{"Headline": "Hunting the Manosphere", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byNotebookIn the final days of May, after police in Portland, Ore., reported that Jeremy Joseph Christian stabbed three men on a train, killing two of them, an unusual theory as to why the attack occurred emerged in certain parts of the internet. Mainstream commentators had already pointed to Christian\u2019s alt-right flavored racism, which seemed obvious enough; the victims, after all, had been defending two Muslim women from his Islamophobic abuse, according to the police. Others raised the possibility that Christian was mentally unstable. But according to this new theory, the primary blame lay not with Christian at all and instead with an ideology internalized by the victims.\u201cTwo good men killed by chivalry,\u201d tweeted Paul Elam, a notorious figure in the field of \u201cmen\u2019s rights activism.\u201d \u201cLet this be a lesson to your sons.\u201d In follow-up tweets, Elam elaborated: If the victims had not been culturally conditioned to risk their lives on women\u2019s behalf, they would still be alive. Therefore, while Christian was heading to trial, the real perpetrator was America\u2019s anti-male status quo.I don\u2019t follow Elam on Twitter. I came across his theory only thanks to the blog We Hunted the Mammoth, run by a 51-year-old Chicagoan named David Futrelle. In a post called \u201cKilled by Chivalry: Everything Wrong With the Men\u2019s Right\u2019s Movement in One Tweet,\u201d Futrelle mockingly summarized Elam\u2019s hypotheses and then went on to argue \u2014 making heavy reference to Elam\u2019s writing over the years \u2014 that this \u201ckiller chivalry\u201d argument epitomized a general disdain in the men\u2019s rights movement not only for women but for the very notions of altruism and empathy.Over the course of seven years spent running We Hunted the Mammoth, Futrelle has made himself an expert on the \u201cmanosphere\u201d: the amorphous, fractious constellation of online men\u2019s groups united in their belief that feminism is ruining the world. Most days, he trawls a constantly-updated list of sites he hates (including Elam\u2019s \u201cA Voice for Men\u201d), seeking out arguments he finds repulsive, baffling and, he admits, fascinating to watch play out in real time. Clicking through his list, he reads post after post, charting the themes and preoccupations of the day, the latest catchphrases and memes, the shifting alliances and disputes.\u201cI plunge myself into this endlessly swirling caldron, and I see what\u2019s new,\u201d Futrelle told me recently. When he began the site in 2010, it was an after-work hobby. Since 2014, it has become a full-time enterprise, bankrolled by advertising revenue and PayPal donations from his readers. Most of those readers, Futrelle says, are women, for whom the site\u2019s lively discussion threads offer a place they can talk (and laugh and cry and yell) about internet misogyny without being harassed on all sides by internet misogynists. The discussion under \u201cKilled by Chivalry\u201d quickly stretched to over 700 comments.Futrelle\u2019s journey toward his idiosyncratic career began in the late 2000s, when he kept finding himself in long, drawn-out Reddit arguments with self-described men\u2019s rights activists (M.R.A.s, in manosphere shorthand). At first he was shocked to discover that M.R.A.s even existed \u2014 that there really was, in his words, \u201ca group of guys who saw men as America\u2019s most oppressed class.\u201d Some of these men, he realized early on, were hardened misogynists or trolls: They argued that only men should be allowed to vote, or they gleefully condoned the use of violence to keep women in their proper place. But some of the less extreme posters reminded Futrelle uncomfortably of his younger self. Looking back on his high-school years, he saw himself as under the sway of some of the same flawed assumptions prevalent among the M.R.A.s.\u201cLike the \u2018nice guy\u2019 fallacy,\u201d he told me, referring to the implicit belief that being persistently \u201cnice\u201d to a woman could lead to her owing you sex. \u201cIt\u2019s rapey and gross. But it\u2019s very widespread. And I had a little bit of it, back then.\u201d Challenging those notions online sometimes felt, for Futrelle, like a form of penance; whether he was changing minds or not, he felt compelled to keep arguing.Futrelle started his own site in 2010, originally under the goofy name Man Boobz, aiming to build a stand-alone repository of careful anti-M.R.A. analysis. Perhaps, he speculated, his site could become a web destination that a confused young man might conceivably stumble upon while Googling for answers. \u201cThat does happen, now and then,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ll get an email saying, you know, \u2018Thanks, I was going down a bad path.\u2019 \u201d At first, almost all of his readers were committed M.R.A.s; they had followed him for Reddit so they could leave argumentative comments under whatever he wrote about them. But within just a few months, Futrelle was attracting a significant female audience: women eager to learn what men were getting up to online but put off by the prospect of trudging through the manosphere themselves.\u201cHe\u2019s basically our filter for looking at an eclipse,\u201d said Jaclyn Friedman, a feminist writer and activist who relied on Futrelle and his site while assembling an early guide to the manosphere for The American Prospect, in 2013. As Friedman\u2019s work became more visible, she was increasingly mentioned in the manosphere or contacted by its participants, occasionally in posts or emails suggesting she deserved to be raped or killed; Futrelle, she says, would help her sift through the threats, using his experience to make judgments about which were worth taking seriously.In We Hunted the Mammoth\u2019s early years, Futrelle assumed the communities he was scrutinizing were essentially fringe movements with a fixed and fairly low limit to their growth. This changed in 2014 with GamerGate, a snowballing manosphere-born campaign of that directed a large volume of misogynistic harassment who called out sexism in the world of video games. \u201cThe old-school M.R.A.s mostly sat GamerGate out,\u201d Futrelle said. \u201cThey thought video games were for wusses.\u201d But the movement rallied a new coalition of online misogynists, not just gamers but pranksters from message boards like 4chan and 8chan and \u201cedgy\u201d conservatives like those reading Breitbart News, which, sensing an opportunity to expand its audience, hitched its wagon to GamerGate early on. (The notorious former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos was a particularly vocal evangelist for the movement.)In the eyes of the post-Gamergate manosphere, Futrelle is the prime example of a S.J.W. (social-justice warrior) trying to \u201cwhite knight\u201d his way to approval by the feminists and liberals who dominate American cultural discourse. On the site Encyclopedia Dramatica, a Wikipedia-style compendium of articles written from a broadly pro-manosphere perspective, the entry for \u201cDavid Futrelle\u201d (\u201coccasionally referred to as FATrelle or \u201cFatrolle\u201d) cherry-picks quotes from Futrelle\u2019s writing in hopes of characterizing him as an apologist for pedophilia, torture porn and child prostitution. Another site, Demagogue, apes the visual style of We Hunted the Mammoth almost to a tee, attempting to target Futrelle with the same zeal he targets them.\u201cIn the long run, David Futrelle\u2019s been a big boost to my career,\u201d says Elam, one of Futrelle\u2019s most frequent individual targets. \u201cEventually he sent all kinds of people to my website that figured out they weren\u2019t exactly getting the straight picture from him. Some of these people have not only stayed and started reading the site, they\u2019ve become financial supporters.\u201d Futrelle, Elam says, \u201cclaims to mock misogyny, but what he really does, in essence, is he mocks the pain of men that are really going through hard times. He might as well be on a cancer unit making fun of people for being sick.\u201dMike Cernovich, a prominent online conspiracy theorist, is another frequent subject of We Hunted the Mammoth posts. By email, Cernovich suggested that Futrelle intentionally exaggerated the size of his readership by creating \u201csock puppets\u201d (fake users) to write comments under his own posts. \u201cWhen I Google myself, his stuff shows up,\u201d Cernovich added. \u201cI don\u2019t read the blogs, as they are predictable and boring.\u201dThe posts themselves often follow a template not dissimilar from the one used by the John Olivers and Seth Meyerses of the world. Some recent manosphere rant or manifesto is held up for inspection and then broken down into snippets and interspersed with Futrelle\u2019s commentary, designed to bring the absurdities of the target into view. It would be fair to criticize the site as an echo chamber: a place where almost everyone agrees that online misogyny is rampant and congratulates themselves for knowing so, taking what pleasure they can in laughing at their enemies\u2019 latest mutterings. Over the years, while poring through Futrelle\u2019s posts for help with magazine articles about the manosphere, I have wondered what the site would look like, and what it might accomplish, if it made more of an effort, alongside its fact-finding and analysis, to speak directly to manosphere denizens. But Futrelle believes that direct engagement simply isn\u2019t part of his mission. \u201cPut bluntly, this blog isn\u2019t for you,\u201d he wrote in a 2010 post directed to the M.R.A. readers still hanging on after following his migration from Reddit. \u201cIt\u2019s for all the people in the world who aren\u2019t you.\u201dAs Donald Trump blustered his way to the presidency, Futrelle watched the manosphere thrill to the rule-breaking candidate as an avatar of their collective worldview: an old-school misogynist unshackled by politically correct strictures; a self-proclaimed anti-elite outsider but also a boastful \u201calpha\u201d male who unapologetically did what he wanted with the political establishment, much like, it was gleefully pointed out, a powerful pickup artist or \u201cseduction artist\u201d did what he wanted with unsuspecting women.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate the extent to which, for a lot of these guys, Trump is a wet dream come true,\u201d Futrelle said. Increasingly, staying on top of his beat has meant adding more destinations to his daily roster, following his manosphere subjects as they branched out to a new generation of racist alt-right stamping grounds and meme-filled neo-Nazi sites like the Daily Stormer, which, as he documented, was now making calculated appeals to a manosphere readership, claiming that all-male neo-Nazi clubs could be hubs for sharing tips and tricks on how to \u201chunt and capture your own women.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not pleasant reading,\u201d Futrelle said glumly. \u201cSomething about it still fascinates me, but it\u2019s definitely not pleasant.\u201dPeter C.

{"Headline": "Apple Needs to Reinvent Itself. It Just Might Be Doing So.", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 One of Apple\u2019s greatest strengths is timing. The company that\u2019s hailed for innovation does not often invent things first \u2014 it didn\u2019t create the first personal computer, the first digital music player or the first smartphone. Instead, Apple reinvents, slipping in and producing something more original than what we used to use.Apple\u2019s version ticks all the Apple-y boxes: It\u2019s very pretty; it\u2019s about twice the price of the Echo; and it has much better sound, including the ability to create a kind of surround sound customized to your room.Yet the reinvention that matters here isn\u2019t about a single device \u2014 it\u2019s larger: The success of HomePod will really depend on whether Apple can reinvent itself.HomePod will be a test of how Apple responds to these difficulties. That\u2019s because for Apple to outdo Amazon in the home assistant game, it will need to prioritize skills that have long been on its back burner \u2014 cloud services and A.I., for instance.But here\u2019s the surprising thing: Apple seems to be up for such reinvention. If you read between the lines at its keynote address on Monday, you would have noticed something. Again and again, like shamans calling on some new and powerful magic, Apple executives invoked the buzzwords of modern computing: \u201cmachine learning,\u201d \u201cdeep learning\u201d and \u201ccomputer vision.\u201dSubtly but unmistakably, they were suggesting a shift. Apple seems to be transforming itself into a new kind of company, one that prioritizes the nerdy technical stuff that will become the foundation of tomorrow\u2019s intelligent machines \u2014 whereas in the past, the company tended to hide this stuff, even if it recognized its importance.In broad strokes, the device seems to do much of what its rivals can. Say, \u201cHey Siri, play me some Carly Rae Jepsen,\u201d and it will belt out perfect Canadian pop. It will also answer questions about the music it\u2019s playing, and, just like the Echo, it can perform a wide variety of other functions \u2014 setting timers, telling you the weather and controlling your smart lights and other home devices.Yet many of these are omissions that you\u2019d expect in a new device, and Apple will most likely add improvements in updates. What will matter most, at first, is how reliably HomePod can perform the basics.If you\u2019re a longtime Siri user, your skepticism is warranted. The best thing about Amazon\u2019s speaker is its reliability: Say something from far away, even in a noisy room, and most of the time it will at least recognize what you asked it. Once you get an idea of the kinds of requests it can handle, Alexa begins to seem like a completely natural interface to computers. It responds so quickly that it starts to seem like a helpful member of the family rather than a computer in a can.Can Siri in HomePod do that? I can\u2019t tell you yet for certain. I got a chance to listen to HomePod \u2014 but not use any of its voice-activated features \u2014 after Apple\u2019s keynote. As the company promised, it does sound much deeper and richer than a Sonos Play 3 or an Amazon Echo, closer to what you might hear in a high-end home stereo system. But the true test for such a device is how it works in real-world conditions, handling the multiplicity of requests that you might think up during a day \u2014 and for now, we have no idea how that might work.Yet I am cautiously optimistic, mainly on the basis of the many other computationally difficult features that Apple showed off on Monday. Many of them are versions of features that rivals like Google have spent years perfecting.For example, Siri will now translate languages for you. Like a true assistant, Siri is also now more predictive \u2014 it aims to spot common computing problems and offer to help. (If it notices that you\u2019ve been chatting about a coming appointment, for instance, it will offer to add it to your calendar.)Best of all, Siri is finally a single unified personality that sits across all of your devices. In the past, Siri on your iPad was different from Siri on your Mac \u2014 one would learn that you\u2019re traveling to Iceland, and the other might never know. Now, similar to other assistants, Siri knows you and can anticipate your interests on whatever device you use.There was more, too. Apple is letting developers create apps that can perform machine learning tasks on its devices. It\u2019s also diving heavily into computer vision. Developers can now create augmented reality features, meaning they can add virtual objects overlaid on images from the real world.If you follow the tech industry you know these are all hot topics that other companies are investing in heavily. Apple is still a laggard, and I wouldn\u2019t expect it to beat Google in an A.I. contest anytime soon.But it doesn\u2019t need to. All Apple has to do is stay competitive \u2014 it\u2019s got to invest just enough in the A.I.-driven future to keep its devices compelling. There\u2019s no mistake, now, that it\u2019s doing so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Third Point, a Hedge Fund, Sets Its Activist Sights on Nestl\u00e9", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Over the past two decades, the hedge fund mogul Daniel S. Loeb has established himself as one of the biggest activist investors around. Now, he has set his sights on one of Europe\u2019s largest corporate citizens: Nestl\u00e9, the global food giant.It is the latest ambitious move by an activist investor to rattle the leaders of the corporate world. Flush with cash, these funds have taken stakes in ever-bigger companies, hoping to goad them into selling themselves or breaking themselves up to improve their stock prices.Third Point disclosed that it owned about 40 million shares in Nestl\u00e9, a stake that amounts to about $3.5 billion in stock. That would make the hedge fund the Swiss company\u2019s sixth-largest shareholder, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.Behind Third Point\u2019s investment in Nestl\u00e9 is a conviction that the company must do more to reshape its product portfolio and adapt to changing consumer tastes and competition from smaller, local brands. The hedge fund argued that the company\u2019s earnings per share figure had not meaningfully improved over the last five years.Shares in Nestl\u00e9 have risen nearly 15 percent over the last 12 months, trailing those of its fellow consumer conglomerate Unilever but outpacing those of other food companies like Mondelez and Kraft Heinz.\u201cThird Point invested in Nestl\u00e9 because we recognized a familiar set of conditions that make it ripe for improvement and change,\u201d the hedge fund wrote in its investor letter. \u201cIt is rare to find a business of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s quality with so many avenues for improvement.\u201dA representative for Nestl\u00e9 was not available for comment.But the hedge fund argued that Nestl\u00e9 should also sell its 23 percent stake in L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the big cosmetics maker whose products include its namesake beauty brand and luxury products like Kiehl\u2019s. The fund argued that the holding was nonstrategic and could be sold off without incurring huge taxes.In a change from previous investments, in which Mr. Loeb was known for his venomous attacks on the chief executives of the targeted companies, Third Point has praised Nestl\u00e9\u2019s leader, Ulf Mark Schneider. The hedge fund pointed positively to his earlier tenure at the German medical supply company Fresenius. But to succeed at Nestl\u00e9, the hedge fund argued, he needs to present a bold strategy that would overhaul the food giant\u2019s performance.The same month, it announced it was retooling its Maggi line to eliminate ingredients consumers do not like and add vegetables, grains and other more nutritional items.In addition, the company has worked over the last several years to strip preservatives and other ingredients from its ice creams and decidedly improve its vast frozen foods portfolio.Third Point said it had hired Jan Bennink, a former executive chairman of Sara Lee, to advise the hedge fund on its investment.Stephanie Strom contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Said to Be Facing Record E.U. Fine by End of August", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byEuropean antitrust officials are preparing to hit Google with a potentially record fine by the end of August over some of the Silicon Valley giant\u2019s search services, according to two people with direct knowledge of the case.As well as the fine, European officials could also force Google to alter how it operates in the region, and potentially elsewhere, to give rivals a greater ability to compete.European officials claim that the company favored many of its own digital services, including search and online maps, over those of rivals. Google has denied any wrongdoing.A spokeswoman for the European Union\u2019s executive arm, the European Commission, declined to comment. Representatives for Google were not immediately available for comment.Here\u2019s what you need to know about Google\u2019s lengthy standoff with European competition authorities:Google\u2019s rivals have long complained that it has used its dominant position in online search to favor its other services, including restaurant recommendations and online maps.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The same year, European officials opened a separate investigation into whether Google\u2019s Android software hampered digital competition. That led to official charges against the company last year.The European Union\u2019s third investigation of Google \u2014 into whether some of the company\u2019s advertising products had restricted consumer choice \u2014 resulted in another charge sheet in July 2016.While the investigations are limited to Google\u2019s activities in Europe, the consequences for the company \u2014 whose digital search and advertising businesses dominate in much of the world \u2014 could be far-reaching.Along with a hefty fine, the company, whose online search services have a roughly 90 percent market share in Europe, may also face \u201cremedies,\u201d or changes dictated by the European Union\u2019s competition authority on how it operates across the bloc.That could include tweaking its search algorithms and other technology to give rivals greater prominence in search queries, as well as greater regulatory oversight of its vast online businesses.European competition authorities are expected to hit Google with a combination of large fines and demands that the company changes how it operates across the 28-member bloc.They can fine Google up to about $7.6 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, but the financial penalty is likely to be significantly less than that. While the company can handle the fine, it is likely to appeal to the bloc\u2019s highest court, the European Court of Justice, to contest any efforts to change how it operates.The judges of the European Court of Justice have never overruled the region\u2019s competition authority, though that is still a possibility. Litigation could drag on for years.Google has vocally rebutted Europe\u2019s charges, saying that competition for its search, advertising and other products is only a click away on the internet.The search giant also says that its services have helped consumers, advertisers and even some competitors find digital information.The company adds that the strength of other American technology companies in Europe, including Amazon and Facebook, shows that Google has not restricted Europe\u2019s digital market.In the short term, it will not affect them very much.Legal action is likely to continue for several years.But if European competition officials get their way, experts say that Google may have to tweak its digital services to comply with regulators\u2019 demands.That could either be limited to changes for European users, or it could extend beyond the region, depending on Google\u2019s ability to limit the region\u2019s antitrust actions to the bloc\u2019s borders.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Slack Is Said to Be in Talks to Raise $500 Million", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Slack, an office messaging company, is in talks to raise around $500 million at a valuation around $5 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the financing.The funding talks are advanced enough that investors are committed to the deal, but Slack could still change its mind, those people said. The company, based in San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia, has already raised about $500 million over the past three years and was valued by investors last year at about $4 billion.In the past few years, Slack has also stirred acquisition interest from potential buyers, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, according to three people with knowledge of the acquisition offers. Most recently, Amazon expressed interest in acquiring Slack, these people said.Slack\u2019s messaging product, introduced in 2014, was initially a cult hit that grew mostly by word of mouth, a rare feat for a company that caters to businesses rather than consumers.Tools made by Slack are now used daily by five million people, up from four million in October. For about 1.5 million of those, Slack is paid $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search, but most customers use a free version. The company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable.Stewart Butterfield, Slack\u2019s chief executive, has said publicly that he wants to build a giant company and that he has therefore been opportunistic about amassing a war chest of capital.Slack is trying to sign on more large companies as customers. It recently expanded its sales and marketing teams. Last fall, it brought in a seasoned sales executive, Kevin Egan, who had most recently worked at Dropbox. This year, it hired Terry Anderson, a former Intel executive, to lead its global public-relations team.Michael de la Merced contributed reporting from London, and Nick Wingfield from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Home Delivery! What Will They Think of Next?", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorI\u2019m rooting for Amazon and companies like Peapod and FreshDirect to hurry up and complete their revolution of the grocery delivery business so that it can be almost as good as it was 60 years ago.Without the benefit of drones \u2014 or for that matter, the internet \u2014 here\u2019s how it worked at our home in Westchester County, north of New York City. Twice a week, my mother would phone the Parkway grocery store in town and rattle off her needs to one of the establishment\u2019s three owners. They would hurry through the staples and dry goods and then spend a bit more time mulling possibilities with meats and produce after Mom asked, \u201cWhat looks good?\u201dA few hours later, a man named Pete would chug up our driveway in the Parkway delivery truck and carry a sturdy box \u2014 always a box, never a bag \u2014 directly to our kitchen. Wearing his long white grocery store apron, Pete would just leave the box on the table. He put anything perishable in the refrigerator.It also reminded me of the twice-a-week deliveries we received from Gene in his Emmadine Farms milk truck. There was no need to phone ahead. Gene just showed up every Monday and Thursday in a step van that had a picture of a cow on each side. Water dripped out of the truck, even in winter, as the ice used to keep things cool melted.The most intriguing part, at least to my pre-teenage eyes, was that the truck had no seat. Gene drove it while standing up. And he always wore galoshes. Even in summer, he\u2019d wear unbuckled snow boots (and Bermuda shorts) as he toted his metal carrier with milk, cream and butter straight to our fridge.Of course this marvelous home-delivery system wasn\u2019t limited to groceries. In fact, back in the pre-Amazon days just about everything you needed magically showed up at the door.When one of us was sick, Dr. Victor Landes drove over in his dark-blue sedan, wearing the requisite suit and tie and carrying his little black bag. I was always amazed at how the contents of an entire doctor\u2019s office seemed to fit into that bag.If we needed medicine, he would phone a prescription to Robbins Pharmacy and a few hours later one of the high school students who worked there part-time would drive over with the order.Every morning James Gray delivered The New York Herald Tribune in his blue VW bus. And each afternoon a woman in a beat-up station wagon delivered the local paper, The Citizen Register. I never caught her name because she managed to toss the paper neatly onto the driveway without ever slowing down.Oil to heat our home in winter was delivered in a smelly truck by the Maui Oil Company. If Mom was having special guests, we\u2019d get a delivery of flowers from Swanson Florist. On Saturday, we often got a delivery of lumber and building supplies from Gerstein\u2019s hardware store.And yes, even back then a highlight was the periodic, and tantalizingly unpredictable, arrival of the United Parcel Service truck. Oddly, while so many things have changed, the U.P.S. truck looked exactly the same back then as it does today \u2014 except instead of bringing packages from an Amazon warehouse, it carried boxes from Sears or Bonwit Teller or some other department store.Really, I had forgotten that our existence was so quaint \u2014 and convenient. It\u2019s beginning to meld in my memory with scenes from \u201cThe Music Man\u201d about the highly anticipated visits of the Wells Fargo wagon by folks in River City, Iowa.I love home delivery, and I\u2019m a big fan of Amazon\u2019s one-click shopping. I usually get at least one book a week, and we just received a replacement steam iron and a three-pack of undershorts. Life is good.But it\u2019s hardly new or novel. As I recall, the postman always rang twice, but Pete from Parkway just let himself in through the kitchen door.Peter Funt is a writer and TV host.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Government Retrenches, Philanthropy Booms", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLast year, as Kalamazoo, Mich., struggled with a budget deficit and other economic woes, two local philanthropists stepped forward, pledging $70 million to improve the city\u2019s fortunes. Earlier in 2016, a group of foundations put up even more money to help another troubled Michigan city, Flint, recover from the contamination of its water supply. And a few years before that, foundations helped to rescue Detroit from bankruptcy.These episodes, coming after years of cuts in state aid to Michigan\u2019s cities, may offer a glimpse of America\u2019s future.In Washington, D.C., where it\u2019s already difficult to get things done, governing is likely to get exponentially harder in coming decades as the baby boomers retire and fiscal pressures mount sharply. More states and localities will also face budgetary crises as pension bills come due and as fiscal conservatives prioritize tax cuts over public investment.So where will the leadership and money come from to take on urgent challenges?In Michigan and beyond, we\u2019re already seeing an answer: Philanthropy will increasingly slide into the driver\u2019s seat of public life, with private funders tackling problems that government can\u2019t or won\u2019t.This is hopeful in many ways, and most of these donors have the best of intentions. But make no mistake: Their influence is growing in tandem with their largess, shifting power away from democratic institutions.Look in any area \u2014 the arts, education, science, health, urban development \u2014 and you\u2019ll find a growing array of wealthy donors giving record sums. Philanthropists have helped fund thousands of charter schools across the country, creating a parallel education system in many cities. The most ambitious urban parks in decades are being built with financing from billionaires. Some of the boldest research to attack diseases like cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s is funded by philanthropy. Private funders, led by the Gates Foundation, play a growing role in promoting global health and development.More big league givers keep emerging as the vast fortunes of a second Gilded Age are harnessed to philanthropy. The most recent: The Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, worth more than $80 billion, last week posted on Twitter a \u201crequest for ideas\u201d for a philanthropy strategy he should pursue. Among a Forbes 400 with a combined net worth of at least $2.4 trillion are numerous billionaires who plan to give away much of their wealth. All told, over $20 trillion is likely to find its way to philanthropy in the next half century.It\u2019s true that philanthropy doesn\u2019t have anything close to the resources of government and can\u2019t replace vital functions of the public sector. But the giving power of private funders has grown more significant as federal spending has flatlined, especially funds that can be used flexibly. Nondefense discretionary spending totaled $518 billion in 2016, compared with charitable giving of $390 billion last year. This gap is likely to keep narrowing as budget cuts hit harder and the wealthy step up their giving. Donors are also using for-profit social investments on a much larger scale \u2014 like when Bill Gates recently organized a slew of billionaires to invest in clean energy research.It\u2019s not just their money that makes the givers so powerful in public life; it\u2019s also their nimbleness. Answering to neither voters nor shareholders, philanthropists and foundations can move boldly. This freedom sounds like a good thing, and often is. But it can produce actions disruptive to communities, as we saw in Newark, where donors led by Mark Zuckerberg backed a school reform effort that lacked local support. When things go wrong with big philanthropy, citizens have little recourse. The givers are accountable to no one.Most Americans have yet to consider what the power shift away from government means for United States democracy. When people think of philanthropy, they tend to imagine giving for museums or hospitals. Yet today\u2019s biggest donors aren\u2019t much interested in such old-style charity, aiming instead to make \u201csystemic\u201d changes in society.Today\u2019s mega-givers keep charging forward. Although the push for charter schools has created both enormous controversy and mixed results, top philanthropists in this field are doubling down. The Walton family is spending $1 billion to promote school choice over the next five years \u2014 almost as much as it spent in the previous two decades. A group of funders in Los Angeles are advancing a plan to move half of all K-12 students in that city into charter schools, stirring fierce debate.In New York City, a proposed island park in the Hudson River financed by the billionaire Barry Diller and his wife, Diane von Furstenberg, has faced strong legal challenges that underscore a growing uneasiness about the role of private money in public spaces. Other big urban park projects have raised similar concerns, and in Baltimore, alarm bells went off when philanthropists funded an aerial surveillance project by the city\u2019s police department.Surveys show that most Americans feel that their voice doesn\u2019t count in public life and want to reduce the influence of the wealthy. But today\u2019s big philanthropy is moving us in the opposite direction, at a time when inequality stands at record levels.It\u2019s time to look harder at how the wealthy wield clout through philanthropy \u2014 and to update oversight rules for a new era of megagiving.For starters, there should be more transparency in the reporting of charitable gifts, which increasingly flow through opaque entities like donor-advised funds that allow givers to remain anonymous, even when their donations seek to influence government policy. Such funds should have to reveal where their money is coming from. More timely reporting of gifts is important, too.There should also be stricter limits on tax-deductible giving, to discourage gifts by wealth holders that amplify their preferences in public debates. In an earlier era, when America had less inequality and stronger mass-member organizations, nonprofits advocating on policy issues typically spoke for lots of ordinary people \u2014 not a handful of private funders, as is now often the case. One way to rebalance civic life would be to restrict the size of allowable tax-deductible gifts to policy groups, while encouraging gifts by smaller donors. Another step might be to narrow which nonprofits qualify for tax-deductible gifts, with an eye toward reducing giving to influence public policy.Ultimately, efforts to level the playing field of civic life won\u2019t get very far as long as economic inequality remains so high, putting outsize resources in the hands of a sliver of supercitizens. Critics of today\u2019s income and wealth gaps tend to focus on who gets what. Yet as a deluge of new wealth pours into civil society, which Alexis de Tocqueville once saw as the realm of the Everyman, we should also be asking who gets heard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "HomePod Speaker and New iMacs: What We Saw at Apple\u2019s WWDC", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported by\u2022 Apple gave a sneak peek of HomePod, a speaker, to rival Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home. It\u2019s the first brand-new hardware product for Apple since the Apple Watch.\u2022 The company also showed new iPads at its annual developer conference, which typically focuses on software instead of hardware.\u2022 Also unveiled: a new iMac Pro, upgraded iMacs and MacBooks, and updates to its operating systems.Amazon, with the Echo, pioneered a device that lets you play music, look up basic information and control your lighting and other home accessories. Now Apple\u2019s answer to the Echo \u2014 the HomePod \u2014 is here, kind of. Apple showed off HomePod on Monday, and it will be available in December.So how will Apple compete? In a very Apple-like manner: The speaker, powered by the Siri voice assistant, looks spiffier than either Amazon\u2019s or Google\u2019s version \u2014 it is a seven-inch-tall canister wrapped in a shiny mesh speaker. The company also said it had prioritized the speaker\u2019s sound, which can be lackluster on rival devices. HomePod has an array of speakers to create virtual surround sound.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know what any of that is; just know that it sounds incredible,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s marketing chief, who added that HomePod would be priced at $349.Although Apple appears to be trying to make up ground on Amazon and Google, the primary casualty may be Sonos. That company offers a wireless multispeaker system that allows users to listen to music throughout the home, similar to HomePod\u2019s ability to chain together speakers.The big question, though, is whether the intelligence inside Apple\u2019s speaker is good for anything beyond music. Apple was early to the voice game with Siri on the iPhone, but rivals have since lapped it \u2014 their voice-command devices are faster, they know more, and they are less annoying to use. Apple promises the new Siri is better, but the improvements it showed were only minor.Apple\u2019s developer conference typically showcases software improvements. In a departure from that routine, Apple showed a lot of new hardware this time.That included updated versions of the iPad, which has been declining in sales. Apple showed that it was continuing to bet on the tablets by unveiling an iPad upgrade that the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said was pushing the device \u201cfurther than it ever has before.\u201dThe new version of the iPad Pro has a 10.5-inch display, 20 percent larger than the previous 9.7-inch model, and it will start at $649. Apple said the size made it perfect for displaying a virtual keyboard comparable to a full-size physical keyboard. The company also highlighted a feature called ProMotion that increases the refresh rate and makes motion smoother in video content.After Steve Jobs introduced the original iPad in 2010, tablets exploded in popularity, but iPad sales have slumped for more than a year now. So Apple, under increasing pressure from investors to strengthen its revenue, has upgraded iPads more frequently than many of its other products. The company introduced a cheaper version of the 9.7-inch iPad, priced at $329, in March and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, compatible with an Apple stylus and keyboard, in 2015.Apple\u2019s predicament seems to be that for existing iPad customers, their tablets are still quite capable and running strong, giving them little reason to upgrade. For new customers, the iPad may be overkill for basic tasks, especially if you can just pay $50 for a media tablet from Amazon.One of Apple\u2019s splashiest hardware debuts was a brand new iMac Pro that will support up to 18 core processors and include a graphic chipset called Radeon Vega. Translation: It is Apple\u2019s all-in-one desktop on steroids.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the most powerful Mac we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d said John Ternus, Apple\u2019s vice president for hardware engineering.The new iMac Pro may help compensate for Apple\u2019s previous professional desktop, the Mac Pro, which was widely panned by critics and customers. The iMac Pro will start at $5,000 and ship in December.With this device, Apple is broadly catering to members of the professional community, like filmmakers and hard-core coders. For years, these users have felt left behind as Apple has focused on consumer-oriented products like the iPhone, shifting away from high-performance equipment for professionals.The company also announced upgrades of its 27-inch and 21.5-inch iMacs, its desktop computers, which will start at $1,099, with additional models at $1,299 and $1,799. And Apple lowered some prices for its MacBooks and said the MacBook Air, its entry-level lightweight laptop, would get a speed increase. The 21.5-inch model with 4K high resolution will start at about $1,300, with a new 13-inch MacBook Pro starting at $1,300.Every year, Apple updates the underlying operating systems that power its devices. The changes are geeky \u2014 remember, they are aimed at software developers \u2014 but they eventually trickle down to how we use iPhones, Macs and Apple Watches.The most important update was to iOS, the operating system that underpins Apple\u2019s biggest seller, iPhones, as well as iPads. Apple introduced iOS 11, with improved camera software; upgrades for Siri; an expansion of its mobile payment system, Apple Pay; and a new version of Apple Maps, with indoor mapping and features to prevent distracted driving.Because the show is about giving new tools to developers, Apple also focused on emerging technologies. Specifically, Apple highlighted augmented reality, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.Apple demonstrated changes to the operating system for the Apple Watch including a new watch face that uses Siri to suggest directions, show calendar items and generally predict what you will want to see. The most substantive changes focused on fitness, including the ability to track new types of high-intensity workouts.Advertisement"}

He is retiring.Perhaps you have some questions.Q. Why are you retiring?Seriously?The Haggler\u2019s work here is done. His relentless intercessions have caused every company in the United States to radically rethink its approach to service. There is nothing left to complain about and thus no more work for the Haggler.No, seriously.The dull and windy boob whose byline you see in this space has taken a new assignment with The Times in London. The Haggler will not work there. Uh-uh. He can\u2019t abide funny accents or crumpets. So he is staying in the United States, specifically in the Humbly Furnished Home for Ex-Consumer Columnists, a gated community with an unpublished address and good broadband. He will be griping on his own behalf into his dotage.What have you learned about the state of customer service in this country?Asking the Haggler this question is like gauging the nation\u2019s mood at a suicide prevention hotline. Nearly everyone who writes to the Haggler is in distress, and this profoundly skews his sample. If all you ever read was the Haggler\u2019s inbox, you would think that the service economy was at war with Americans. That is plainly not the case.Worth noting: Consumer culture in some other countries is much worse. Try renting a car in Brazil. Try opening a bank account in England. Visit Russia.Can you say anything about why things go wrong when they do?Far more common are what the Haggler would classify as Unwitting Incompetents. These are companies that have every intention of doing right by customers but don\u2019t have a system to achieve that end. What\u2019s missing is a mechanism to deal with exceptions. The typical Haggler complainant has a story with a wrinkle in it, a hitch that makes it unusual.But people working for Unwitting Incompetents have no power, and their supervisors are often hamstrung, too. Great companies know exceptions are inevitable. They give employees the latitude to improvise, or they create a place to send anyone in need of an improviser.Which type of company was the most fun to haggle with?The Borderliners. Because they often vigorously defended themselves, usually with a righteous indignity \u2014 easily the most entertaining type of indignity.Are there are any companies that get this whole customer service thing right?The Haggler has never received a single complaint worth investigating about Walmart. He also heard almost nothing about Amazon.Have you ever considered taking the knowledge you have collected as the Haggler and using it to create the single most awful and impervious company in American history?Not until you asked that question.Did writing this column sometimes have the paradoxical effect of making you sympathize with companies?Yes. About a quarter of the complaints sent to the Haggler were from customers who did not have a legitimate case. They wanted a refrigerator fixed free, for instance, even though the warranty ran out a few years ago. They needed a bully. The Haggler is not a bully.What will you miss most?The doughnuts.Any unfinished business that you wished you\u2019d finished?Oh, dear. This makes you sound a bit defeated.The Haggler tends to dwell on losses rather than victories. And he has always been armed with nothing more than the power that comes from the glare of illumination provided by The Times. This is a potent weapon, and it usually suffices. But it does not work on the shameless.Let\u2019s wrap up. Would you like to sign off with something pithy and epigrammatic? Here\u2019s an idea: \u201cOld Hagglers never die.

It was terror.\u201dToday, Peru has risen from what many describe as \u201cchaos\u201d and, thanks to efforts of four generations of the country\u2019s chefs, reimagined itself through a thriving gastronomical culture. Lima is now considered one of the world\u2019s leading culinary destinations.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to use gastronomy as a social instrument,\u201d says Ocampo, who studied medicine before switching to culinary school and training at internationally acclaimed restaurants like Noma in Denmark and El Celler de Can Roca in Spain.\u201cCooking is like a social cause,\u201d agrees Eulert, who considered becoming a visual artist before committing to cooking: \u201cWe have the same mission: zero-waste kitchens, local ingredients.\u201dIn the seaside neighborhood of Miraflores, only minutes away from the 1992 location of the country\u2019s worst terrorist bombing by the Communist group The Shining Path, Eulert serves a fine balance of global flavors and local ingredients, such as \u201cIndo-China\u201d scallops in a yellow-curry butter with quinoa and \u201cBombay\u201d black spaghetti with shrimp, curry sauce and cashews. The seafood is never frozen \u2014 the scallops are delivered live, and the cocoa nibs and passion fruit are also sourced locally, benefits of the country\u2019s being surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Andes and the Amazon.With dark hair tied back into a single thick braid, Eulert finishes her shift and takes a stroll around the area, pointing out one trendy eatery after another: a sushi joint catering to Limeno youth, a bakery specializing in American pastries, a five-floor butterfly-themed concept store topped by a roof-garden restaurant. Her last stop is for a cocktail at El Mercado cevicheria, where she once worked under her longtime mentor, the acclaimed chef Rafael Osterling.Osterling, 47, is part of the second generation, many of whom were classically trained at schools and restaurants in Europe and the U.S. before returning to open their own restaurants in Peru.\u2014\u2014Osterling, 47, is part of the second generation, many of whom were classically trained at schools and restaurants in Europe and the U.S. before returning to open their own restaurants in Peru.Osterling puts Peru\u2019s food movement in the context of the social and cultural revolution that followed the country\u2019s political and economic stabilization in the early 2000s.\u201cThe first generation were the first ones to honor Peruvian food,\u201d says Osterling.\u201cThey built the conditions and the dream and the purpose and the meaning of what we did later,\u201d says Gast\u00f3n Acurio, 49, a second-generation chef and TV personality who opened his flagship Astrid y Gast\u00f3n in 1994 and is considered a national hero in Peru. He goes down a list of revered first-generation chefs: Luis \u201cCucho\u201d La Rosa. Humberto Sato. Isabel Alvarez. Teresa Izquierdo. Bernardo Roca Rey. \u201cThey were pioneers fighting for our dreams in much more difficult times,\u201d he says.The early-generation chefs created \u201cNovoandina\u201d (or \u201cNew Andean\u201d) cuisine, which fused European cooking techniques with indigenous products like quinoa, Andean potatoes and peppers. All have since gained global popularity, but three or four decades ago, shoppers at Lima\u2019s central market in Surquillo, a regular destination for the city\u2019s best chefs, wouldn\u2019t have found them.\u201cThere were no products from the Amazon, almost no products from the Andes besides some potatoes,\u201d says the third-generation chef Mitsuharu Tsumura, 35. His Miraflores restaurant, Maido, serves the Japanese-influenced Peruvian cuisine known as \u201cnikkei\u201d and is among three Lima restaurants on the 2017 World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants list. \u201cEverything was from Lima. Even if you brought it, nobody would buy it.\u201dAt the same time, Acurio says that once the internet began connecting the world and diversity became \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cbeautiful,\u201d he and his peers began to question the contradictions and lack of opportunities for Peruvians.\u2014VIRGILIO MART\u00cdNEZ, CHEF AT CENTRAL\u201cGast\u00f3n was very powerful in media so he could reach people,\u201d says Tsumura, who considers Acurio one of his closest friends. \u201cGast\u00f3n started to bring people, chefs, everybody who was involved in gastronomy together, and said, \u2018Let\u2019s investigate, let\u2019s analyze what Peru really is,\u2019 because we didn\u2019t know. He made Peruvians fall in love again with their country.\u201dToday, the Surquillo market welcomes visitors with an abundance of goods, from colorful piles of hot-pink spotted olluco potatoes and golden berries to multiple varieties of quinoa and chalky bags of coarse Maras salt sourced from Incan ponds in the Andean highlands.\u201cThe new Peruvian message of food is biodiversity and the unknown,\u201d says the third-generation chef Virgilio Mart\u00ednez, who helms renowned Central in Miraflores and serves a tasting menu featuring around 200 meticulously sourced local ingredients from 18 different altitudes. For the last several years, he and Central\u2019s research group, Mater Iniciativa, have foraged for native ingredients and studied indigenous food systems in the Andes and the Amazon. Mart\u00ednez has also invited young chefs from the fourth generation to join the expeditions. \u201cIf you cook with these ideas, this cuisine is way stronger than we think it is now \u2014 it\u2019s not pisco sours, ceviches and great tasty food anymore. It\u2019s at another level.\u201dPurple corn (left) is used to make chicha morada, a popular drink in Peru and an ingredient in the Santo Morada (right) at Astrid y Gast\u00f3n in Lima.From top: Purple corn is used to make chicha morada, a popular drink in Peru and an ingredient in the Santo Morada cocktail (bottom) at Astrid y Gast\u00f3n in Lima.Fourth-generation chef Jos\u00e9 Luj\u00e1n Vargas, 30, is doing just that with his three Cusco-based restaurants. \u201cCusco was the capital of the Incan Empire, which is the culture of our ancestors,\u201d says Vargas, who trained under Acurio and considers him \u201ca source of motivation in every aspect.\u201d\u201cFor me it was very important to be able to fully penetrate and learn everything about our beginnings, touring every archaeological center, museums, fields of culture, libraries and communities, learning the processes, ancestral techniques, inputs, folklore, among others \u2014 the same ones that I present in my restaurants,\u201d Vargas explains.While the previous generations paved the way, the Generation with a Cause hope to push their culinary creativity even farther. And yet, these younger chefs face new challenges.\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of incoherence when you talk about fine-dining cuisine in Peru, which is a country [where] 43 percent of people have hunger,\u201d says Ocampo, who recently launched a sophisticated tasting menu at his second-floor 1087 Restaurante in the upscale San Isidro  district comprised of \u201cscraps\u201d  \u2014 wilted rose petals that have been pickled, caramelized strawberry fronds and cocktails steeped with used coffee grounds. \u201cAs a cook, I feel that literally we have the responsibility in our hands.

For Tsumura, it\u2019s \u201csabrosa,\u201d or tasty: \u201cPeruvian cuisine is a slap in your face.

{"Headline": "Former Amazon Warehouse Manager Sues for Overtime Wages", "Date": "2017-06-11", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon\u2019s warehouses have a reputation as often grueling environments for the workers who pick, pack and load orders there. Managers are pushed hard, too, according to the plaintiff in a new lawsuit against the internet retailer.The lawsuit, filed this month by Michael Ortiz, a former shift manager for Amazon in several warehouses in the San Francisco Bay Area, accuses Amazon of failing to pay him overtime wages.The suit, filed in Contra Costa County Superior Court, says that Amazon improperly classified Mr. Ortiz as exempt from overtime in violation of California labor regulations. Mr. Ortiz\u2019s lawyer, Scott Cole, said he would seek class-action status for the suit with the addition of other plaintiffs.Kristen Kish, an Amazon spokeswoman, said the company would not comment on pending litigation.While most of the entry-level workers at Amazon\u2019s warehouses, known as associates, are eligible for overtime pay, salaried managers are not under Amazon policy. In an interview, Mr. Ortiz, 34, said he and other managers had been promised when they were hired that their jobs would consist mostly of supervisory work.Instead, most of his job ended up being manual labor, some of it dangerous, he said.\u201cWhen we were hired, we were told we would be managers working on high-end things,\u201d Mr. Ortiz said. \u201cIn reality, the bulk of the managers got stuck doing very tedious work which ultimately caused me to be injured.\u201dCases such as Mr. Ortiz\u2019s are more common and could have a better chance of success, especially in California, which is among the states regarded as having the most employee-friendly labor laws in the country.In California, the burden of proof is on employers to show that workers should not receive overtime pay, which they can do by demonstrating that more than half of a manager\u2019s job consisted of managerial responsibilities, labor lawyers said.\u201cAmazon faces a heavy burden to show that the workers truly fit within the narrow exemption to overtime pay that the California Legislature established,\u201d said Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer at Outten & Golden in San Francisco who represents workers in lawsuits against employers, but is not involved in Mr. Ortiz\u2019s case. \u201cJust assigning them managerial-sounding work may not be enough, depending on how much they do and what it entails, exactly.\u201dMr. Ortiz was working as a shift manager at an Amazon delivery station in Richmond, Calif. He said he had worked for Amazon for about 11 months until he was terminated last December after he slipped and cut his eye while climbing on a conveyor belt to free up a jam of packages.Standing on a conveyor belt is a violation of Amazon policy. Mr. Ortiz said his supervisor encouraged him to report that he had fallen on the stairs and that he had later been fired by Amazon when witness accounts conflicted with his version of events.Mr. Ortiz first spoke to a reporter for The New York Times early this year, not long after his injury. At the time, Mr. Ortiz said a friend and colleague in the same facility at Amazon had sustained the injury, not him.In a phone interview after filing the suit, Mr. Ortiz apologized for the deception, saying that at the time of his first contact he was appealing his termination at the company.\u201cThere was a small chance that I would be able to keep my job, so that is why I had to distance myself from the story,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Art of Animated Reality: Walerian Borowczyk and Jacques Demy", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported byOn DVDAmong the oldest dichotomies in movies is between those motion pictures that take the world as given (cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9) and those that create their very own (animation). The boundary between these poles is not absolute. There are movies like Walerian Borowczyk\u2019s \u201cGoto, Isle of Love\u201d that suggest animated cartoons made with physical sets and real actors.The bad-tempered tyrant Goto (a rumbling, hammy Pierre Brasseur, best remembered for playing the heavy in \u201cChildren of Paradise\u201d) is cuckolded by his impassive, wistful consort (Borowczyk\u2019s wife and frequent star, Ligia Branice) and overthrown by a clever prisoner (Guy Saint-Jean). Despite the tawdry erotic intrigue, the movie\u2019s plot is less compelling than its strongly controlled mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, which, with its abundance of creaky machines and fusty bric-a-brac, evokes a 19th-century cabinet of curiosities.As a wandering minstrel with an enigmatic hippie smile, the Scottish folk singer Donovan seems vaguely embarrassed in the title role, while Donald Pleasence and John Hurt run boisterously amok as the villainous baron and his evil son. But, however uneven the performances, the production design by Assheton Gorton (whose previous credits included two Richard Lester films and Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s \u201cBlow-Up\u201d) is outstanding.\u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d also has echoes of \u201cUbu Roi\u201d in its outlandish medieval costumes, while the crowd scenes have a Brueghelian density. Not exactly suitable for young children, the movie might be an ergot-fueled version of Ingmar Bergman\u2019s \u201cThe Seventh Seal\u201d or, as I thought when I caught a rare revival 10 years ago, a Disney version of Albert Camus\u2019s wartime allegory, \u201cThe Plague.\u201dReleased on the bottom half of a double bill with the forgotten sci-fi film \u201cZ.P.G.,\u201d \u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d was largely ignored \u2014 Donovan was no draw \u2014 although the left-wing film journal Jump-Cut praised it as a \u201cneo-Marxist fairy tale.\u201d France was even less hospitable. Not until late 1975 did \u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d find a distributor there, hailed by auteurists as a masterpiece and condemned on the right as counterculture propaganda.Also on the adult fairy-tale front, Arrow Academy has released a dual Blu-ray/DVD edition of the three films from Mr. Rivette\u2019s never-completed quartet, begun in the mid-1970s, that was to be collectively known as \u201cScenes From a Parallel Life.\u201dExquisitely lit and predicated on cryptic rituals, \u201cDuelle\u201d \u2014 which features Bulle Ogier and Juliet Berto as rival goddesses, the sun and the moon, waging war in contemporary Paris \u2014 is of a piece with the preceding Rivette fantasies, \u201cOut 1: Spectre\u201d and \u201cCeline and Julie Go Boating.\u201d It is a live-action comic-book movie with no special effects beyond its total conviction.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alexa, What Happens if the Echo Has a Screen? You Get This Review", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byTech FixWith the $230 Echo Show, Alexa has gained some new capabilities. The touch screen means that you can ask Alexa to place a video call to a friend, pull up a YouTube video on making ice cream and show you lyrics when you play music. And unlike a tablet or smartphone, the stationary Echo Show sits at a fixed angle and stays plugged in for power at all times, similar to a digital picture frame.But the device\u2019s kinship to a smartphone\u2019s or tablet\u2019s capabilities are unmistakable. Asking Alexa to do a video call with Echo Show reminded me of asking Siri to do a FaceTime call on an iPhone. Ditto for when I asked Alexa what my day looked like on the Echo Show, which produced the same summary of events as when I asked Google the same question on an Android phone.After a week of tests, while I concluded that the product is ideal on a kitchen counter or an office desk, I also decided it was superfluous if you already own an Echo speaker and a smartphone or tablet. Whether or not you will be persuaded to buy one will probably hinge on your affinity for Alexa.The setup process for the Echo Show was one of the easiest and fastest I have ever experienced: Just plug it in and enter your Wi-Fi password and Amazon credentials. From there, I could start putting Alexa to work. (If you use third-party services like Spotify, you have to log in to those as well.)The Echo Show\u2019s screen constantly stayed on with a background photo of my choice. It displayed the time while rotating through captions showing future calendar events, the weather and tips on questions I could ask Alexa.Video calling and video playback are the most important features of the Echo Show. After a command like \u201cAlexa, show me how to roast a duck from YouTube,\u201d the screen loaded a list of YouTube videos; each video is numbered, so you could ask Alexa to play a specific clip by naming the number.You could also ask Alexa to place a call to another Echo customer. When I tried it, the Alexa app synchronized with my smartphone\u2019s address book to determine who else was using an Echo. Then just by asking Alexa to call the name of a contact, I could immediately commence a video call.What was also nice about the Echo Show\u2019s being stationary is that it remained fixed on a flattering angle of my face. (If you\u2019re tired of staring up people\u2019s nostrils on FaceTime calls, you\u2019ll know what I mean.)There\u2019s another task that the Echo Show handled better than the Echo speaker: shopping on Amazon. By saying, for example, \u201cAlexa, order me some batteries,\u201d you get the screen to show a list of batteries to choose from. By contrast, with the Echo speaker, the device could only reorder batteries you had bought before \u2014 or, if you hadn\u2019t ordered batteries before, choose a pack of batteries for you.For audio, the Echo Show included two small stereo speakers. They sounded loud and clear but lacking in bass. Compared with fancy speakers, the Echo Show sounded average, but it\u2019s adequate for watching YouTube videos in the kitchen or streaming music if you aren\u2019t a nitpicky audiophile.The Echo Show is buggy. In my tests with a fellow product reviewer as well as an Amazon spokesman, video calls were inconsistent. While video calls from my apartment looked clear and sounded good, other calls placed from the New York Times building failed to show any video \u2014 and, soon after, the calls disconnected. (In both locations, I used a strong Wi-Fi connection.)There were also some quirks with so-called Skills, which are essentially third-party apps that you can install to expand Alexa\u2019s capabilities. For example, for looking up recipes in the kitchen, I tried a skill by AllRecipes.But when I told Alexa, \u201cShow me how to make pasta,\u201d the device loaded a list of recipes from AllRecipes.com, and then I had trouble quitting the app. The command \u201cGo home\u201d was supposed to quit the AllRecipes Skill, but it got stuck until I said, \u201cAlexa, quit.\u201dWhen I was shopping, the Echo Show displayed a pared-down list of items from Amazon. For example, when I asked Alexa to buy a dog bed, the screen showed only 18 results for dog beds. But searching \u201cdog bed\u201d on Amazon.com brought up hundreds. That\u2019s not to say that more is better, but shopping on the Echo Show will make you wonder if you are missing out on better options.What I found most baffling about the Echo Show was that the screen always stayed on. Even when I asked Alexa to turn the screen off, it dimmed the screen and showed the time. While that made it act like a digital clock, the background of the screen was still lit up black, emitting a faint glow in the dark. What\u2019s more, the screen turned back on when the camera detected motion.In other words, light sleepers will not want an Echo Show on their night stands.Amazon said that third-party Skills had not yet been finalized for the Echo Show, and that for shopping, the device displayed only the top search results to simplify the interface for customers. The company did not have a clear explanation for my video-calling issues.But the worst part about the Echo Show is its aesthetic design. Reminiscent of a black doorstop, the Echo Show looks like an uninspired piece of tech that you\u2019d find in a Brookstone store or SkyMall catalog.The Echo Show\u2019s greatest strengths are its stationary applications: getting a quick glance at your calendars while checking the time, for instance, or having a dedicated TV screen in the kitchen for learning recipes. Calendar addicts in the office, people who cook with Alexa and, more broadly, Alexa fans with multiple Echo products deployed throughout the home will love having another Echo, this time with a screen.But the average person would be wise to wait before buying the Echo Show.The device is the priciest in the Echo family \u2014 $50 more than the Echo speaker and $180 more than the Echo Dot, the miniature version of the speaker. And it remains to be seen what third-party companies do with applications designed for an always-on screen that stays put.Until then, you could always grab a tablet you already own, put it on a stand and leave it plugged in. The results will most likely be the same.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Haggler Retires, but Customer Grumbling Continues", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byA few years ago, U.P.S. lost my passport. It was in an envelope that was sent from New York to California, and if I\u2019m honest about it, part of me was kind of excited it had vanished.I was peeved about my passport, but I also knew that the episode would make great column fodder. That was life as the Haggler. When a company botched a transaction, I couldn\u2019t help but smell opportunity; those who wrote to me, naturally, were just plain irate, often with good cause.There was the nursing home that kept billing a woman whose mother had died in the facility months earlier. The carpet cleaner who demanded $42,000 to clean a rug that cost $38,000. The home security company that snookered a woman into signing what she believed was a cancellation request but that was, in fact, a renewal form.I explained to Brother Noah that this might be the nicest thing anyone had ever said to a United phone representative.Writing the column provided a grim view of the country. The sheer volume of aggrieved people with whom I was in contact was, at times, wearying. And I encountered more than a few companies with business models predicated on cheating their customers. Squeezing refunds from outfits like this seemed inadequate: They should have been shut down.Most companies had the good sense to apologize when confronted with their failings, but the balance of power between consumers and corporations tilts heavily in favor of corporations. Part of the problem is scale. In the age of the oversize conglomerate, it takes effort and vigilance to maintain a customer-friendly culture. Amazon is one of the few companies I almost never heard complaints about \u2014 which is why its recent purchase of Whole Foods doesn\u2019t worry me.Amazon aside, the internet ought to come with its own Buyer Beware preview page. But the web also provides consumers with useful tools, which more people should exploit. Before buying anything, try this simple exercise: Search for the name of the company and the word \u201ccomplaint.\u201d That will weed out the worst corporate actors.The failure to do a modicum of due diligence was just one reason consumers could be as maddening as the companies they complained about. At least one out of every three people who contacted me lacked a legitimate complaint. Some wanted repairs on goods for which the warranty period had passed; some had basic facts wrong. There were many people who simply didn\u2019t understand that the Haggler\u2019s only real weapon was public shame, and that this weapon lacked force anywhere The Times lacked prominence. The least promising email I ever received started like this: \u201cIn January, we traveled to Myanmar and purchased two wooden statues in a shop in Yangon.\u201dNext!However, writing the column was incredibly satisfying. It was my pleasure to help people out of various jams or who were at their wit\u2019s end. Often I succeeded in getting a company representative to call a customer who had been trying to make contact for months. Startled customers frequently responded as if I\u2019d performed magic; I received many emails with headers reading some variation of \u201cWhat just happened?!\u201dWhich brings me to what I will miss most. Having retired the cape that everyone seems to imagine I wore, there is no longer anything redeeming about transactions gone horribly wrong. Or even moderately wrong. This hit me the other day when I was venting at British Airways about a ticketing issue, and realized that, without cape or column, I was no longer \u201cThe Haggler.\u201d I was just an irritated guy with an attitude and a telephone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Don\u2019t Want to Buy Groceries From a Robot", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe next time you check out at Whole Foods, you might meet my friend Esther at the register. In a few years, you might meet a robot. Or no one at all.I\u2019m not looking forward to it. While interactions with cashiers may seem insignificant, or at times even a nuisance, they also foster sociability between strangers.I first met Esther 10 years ago when she worked as a cashier at a mom-and-pop bakery in Manhattan, where I\u2019d come to study how adults over 65 used neighborhood spaces to develop social connections that helped them avoid social isolation and live independently.Esther provided care along with pastries to the older people who congregated at the bakery. She knew exactly how her patrons took their coffees and brought orders to the table for people struggling with canes and walkers. She shared her homemade soup with an octogenarian who came each evening, patiently listened to customers\u2019 long-winded stories, and admired pictures of grandchildren.A computer could have done many of Esther\u2019s tasks, perhaps more efficiently. But for anyone who\u2019s ever experienced an alarmed electronic voice at self-checkout blaring that you have an \u201cunauthorized item in the bagging area\u201d when you just don\u2019t see the point of bagging Tic Tacs, technology also has its shortcomings. Besides, while a robot might be able to learn that you take your coffee black with two sugars, how special does that make you feel?Ephemeral contact with cashiers and other service workers can be especially important to people at risk of isolation, such as older people who live alone, those with chronic illnesses and the unemployed.My sister, who suffers from schizophrenia, values her interactions with employees at the CVS where she picks up her medications. \u201cIt makes me happy,\u201d she said about the cashier\u2019s friendly hello. She mentioned a pharmacist who rings up her monthly refills: \u201cShe always asks how I am, says, \u2018Oh, I haven\u2019t seen you in a while, where have you been?\u2019 It really helped when I got out of the hospital.\u201dSix years ago, she spent three months in Bellevue Hospital because of a psychotic break, and at first didn\u2019t want to take medication or attend treatment sessions, worried that the people around her had weapons. Despite that initial resistance, she has faithfully taken the drugs that control her delusions and has not returned to the hospital since. Her exchanges with the pharmacy staff served as informal check-ins that gave her a little extra help adhering to an unfamiliar medication regimen.Services like Walgreens\u2019 express pharmacy kiosks, which allow customers to reduce the interaction required to refill a prescription in person, mean encounters like these may already be dwindling.Fleeting retail interactions can also help people during major life transitions. I learned this when I ended a 13-year relationship and moved to San Francisco, a city where I knew almost no one. I worked from home and could have gone days without speaking to another human being. But I discovered how quickly I could become a regular at the coffee shops, eateries and bars I frequented. Service workers often filled in important connective social tissue before I worked up enough nerve to chat with other customers. A few friendly words with the servers and bartenders made me feel less alone. Eventually some became friends.At the same time, San Francisco was a pioneer in automation. At Eatsa, a quinoa bowl joint, you don\u2019t have to interact with any other humans. You just order on your phone, and a \u201cpersonalized cubby\u201d spits out your food. Robots make coffee at Cafe X, and self-driving food delivery robots roam the streets of the Mission District.We seem to have fewer and fewer opportunities to interact with people, especially those outside of our usual social circles, of different races, classes or nationalities. In our polarized political climate, we cannot afford to squander them. That\u2019s one reason I choose to ride the bus to work as a college professor, side-by-side with Walmart employees and other retail workers at the mall where the bus route terminates. Most people who can afford a car would rather drive to the mall, reducing the chances of serendipitous conversation with strangers. Will they soon be able to avoid them in the mall, too?What\u2019s good for business is not always good for people. We need to consider the trade-offs of increasing automation and use our dollars to push for the kind of shopping experience we want and the kind of communities we want to live in. Next time you\u2019re at the store and have the opportunity to bypass the register, spare a few moments to chat with the cashier instead. You can always shop on Amazon at home.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Bites Off Even More Monopoly Power", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAmazon on Friday announced plans to acquire Whole Foods, the high-end grocer. If approved by antitrust enforcers, the $13.7 billion deal would give Amazon control of more than 400 stores, an extensive supply chain and a new source of consumer data.Amazon will argue to federal authorities, most likely the Federal Trade Commission, that the deal should be blessed because the combined entity\u2019s share of the American grocery market will be less than 5 percent.But antitrust officials would be na\u00efve to view this deal as simply about groceries. Buying Whole Foods will enable Amazon to leverage and amplify the extraordinary power it enjoys in online markets and delivery, making an even greater share of commerce part of its fief.The company has established its level of dominance because of the failings of our current antitrust laws. To understand why, you first need to understand the scope of Amazon\u2019s power. It has captured 43 percent of all internet retail sales in the United States, with half of all online shopping searches starting on Amazon. In 2016, it had over $63 billion in revenue from online sales in the United States \u2014 or more than the next 10 top online retailers combined. It controls 74 percent of e-book sales, is the largest seller of clothes online and is set to soon become the biggest apparel retailer in the country.Amazon today is also one of the world\u2019s largest logistics networks and marketing platforms, as well as the dominant provider of cloud computing, which counts among its clients the Central Intelligence Agency. It manufactures products like the Echo, produces award-winning movies and television series, and delivers food from restaurants in 20 cities.In building this vast empire, Amazon chased growth over paying dividends, pricing key goods and services below cost to chase out competitors. It invested heavily to buy out innovators like Diapers.com after waging price wars. (Amazon followed its acquisition by raising prices.)For consumers, so far, Amazon has delivered many benefits. Its Prime program enables users to receive, through a click, almost any item within two days. But for producers \u2014 those who make and create things \u2014 Amazon\u2019s dominance poses immense risks.Think of Amazon as a 21st-century version of the 19th-century railroads that connected consumers and producers. Because of their gatekeeper role, railroads had power to discriminate, both among users and in favor of their own wares. These middlemen could tax the farmers and oil producers who depended on their rails \u2014 or deny them a ride and sink their livelihoods.In several key ways, Amazon uses its power as the railroads did. By integrating across business lines, Amazon now competes with the companies that rely on its platform. This decision to not only host and transport goods but to also directly make and sell them gives rise to a conflict of interest, positioning Amazon to give preferential treatment to itself.And like the railroads of yore, Amazon dictates terms and prices to those dependent on its rails. During negotiations with the publisher Hachette over e-book pricing, Amazon showed its might by effectively disabling sales of thousands of Hachette\u2019s books overnight.Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods will expand its dominance and heighten conflicts of interest. Prime memberships will enable Amazon to extend its online dominance into physical retail \u2014 using stores for pick-up, for example \u2014 and to use physical stores to entrench its power online. By bundling services and integrating grocery stores into its logistics network, the company will be able to shut out or disfavor rival grocers and food delivery services.Amazon was accelerating investment to position itself as a direct competitor in the fresh foods delivery market; this deal would allow Amazon to potentially thwart future innovations. Start-ups will be less likely to enter the field against such an integrated competitor.Antitrust laws, which were passed by Congress to prevent these kinds of concentrations of private power, have been largely reduced to a technical tool to keep prices low. The change in thinking traces back to the Chicago School revolution of the 1970s, which ushered in decades of mergers and consolidation.Embodying this \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d regime, Amazon has largely avoided government scrutiny by devoting its business strategy and rhetoric to reducing prices. The company has marched toward monopoly by exploiting the defects of contemporary antitrust law.Preventing Amazon from concentrating even more control will require that antitrust enforcers block the company\u2019s bid for Whole Foods. But lawmakers and officials should go even further, embracing the original goals of antitrust law and adopting a competition policy fit for the digital age. Unless we recover our antimonopoly tradition, Amazon will centralize exceptional control.Amazon\u2019s market capitalization grew by more than $11 billion on the day the Whole Foods deal was announced. Wall Street recognizes the reality of Amazon\u2019s market dominance. Antitrust enforcers should as well.Lina M.

{"Headline": "Stories About Disability Don\u2019t Have to Be Sad", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byDisabilityWhile in most other ways I\u2019m just your typical eighth grader, I also happen to have been born with Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a form of muscular dystrophy. Charcot-Marie-Tooth is a degenerative nerve disease that causes muscles in my arms and legs to atrophy over time. I wear leg braces and use a wheelchair to get around, and have an aide at school who helps me spin my locker combination. Every morning, an accessible bus arrives at my house to pick me up. Actually, it\u2019s more of a van, with a \u201cSchool Bus\u201d sign on top.For the most part, despite my wheelchair and knowledge of medical terminology (you build that kind of vocabulary when it\u2019s about your own limbs), my daily reality is mostly the same as that of my classmates. I groan over the same math and science homework, giggle with the same friends, and like every other adolescent, I probably spend too much time on my phone. As a girl with a disability, I know that my story is not a sad one.For the past four years, I\u2019ve been trying to convince everyone else as well that my story doesn\u2019t have to be a sad one. In 2013, I started a Change.org petition asking American Girl, my favorite doll company, to make a doll with a disability. As a longtime fan of the company, whose dolls are accompanied by books and movies with positive stories of girls overcoming challenges, I wanted to see a story with a heroine who was in a wheelchair like me. The petition got 140,000 signatures, and got a lot of news coverage. People clearly wanted to see kids with disabilities featured in an upbeat ways.It would not be fair to say that American Girl completely ignores disability. They do make accessories for dolls like a wheelchair, crutches, a hearing aid and a diabetes care kit. In one of the stories there is a secondary character in a wheelchair; in another, a boy in the hospital with polio, and the 2017 Girl of the Year has a stutter. But these were not the characters I wanted to see.I was inspired to take matters into my own hands and write a book of my own, starring a girl with a disability. I knew exactly what genre of book I wanted to write. I\u2019ve never been a fan of \u201cgreat children\u2019s literature\u201d that was somber or tragic. My friends and I have loved the Cupcake Diaries series, paperbacks with pink covers that described four best friends and their adventures together, making cupcakes. Not exactly heavy stuff, but fun to read. I wanted to write something like the Cupcake Diaries, but starring a middle-school girl with a disability and her filmmaking adventures with her best friends. Instead of making cupcakes, they would make special-effect YouTube videos.My older sister Eva helped me set up a Kickstarter campaign to hire an editor. We wrote the first draft of the book, called \u201cMia Lee Is Wheeling Through Middle School,\u201d and found a literary agent. Using our money from our Kickstarter campaign, we hired someone to help us edit our draft into a polished copy, then sent it out to publishing houses.When the responses started to come in, they were almost all the same: for a girl who was in a wheelchair with a degenerative nerve disease, Mia Lee was just too happy.\u201cI keep expecting more from the plotline than what\u2019s currently here,\u201d one publisher wrote. \u201cWhat if it was about sisters who were twins, and one had Charcot-Marie-Tooth and one didn\u2019t? That would create a more important conflict.\u201d Another said that Mia Lee\u2019s character didn\u2019t seem suited for a lighthearted story. Finally, my agent told me, \u201cI just don\u2019t think people are ready for this type of story for this type of character.\u201dWhat she meant is that Mia Lee, my sassy, YouTube-loving heroine, differed too much from the convention of what a disabled kid is supposed to be like. There are very few stories about kids in wheelchairs, and there are even fewer with a disabled person who is cheerful and happy. Disability is always seen as a misfortune, and disabled characters are simply opportunities to demonstrate the kindness of the able-bodied protagonists.Since its publication, I\u2019ve gone back to being your average middle schooler.

{"Headline": "A Slump in Tech Stocks That Leaves Some Investors Mystified", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byThe laws of gravity apparently apply to technology stocks after all.No one trigger related to the fundamentals of these companies spurred the snap back. As has been the case for years now, these technology giants sit on trillions of dollars in cash, are growing at a breakneck pace and, compared with companies in earlier tech frenzies, do not have absurd valuations.Yet it has been this lack of an identifiable cause \u2014 a disappointing earnings result or a major investor\u2019s unloading stock, for example \u2014 that has been worrying some market specialists.\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201dOn Monday, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 0.5 percent. The broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was also slightly lower, off 0.1 percent.Netflix helped lead the way, declining 4.2 percent. Apple ended the day down 2.4 percent, with its shares recovering slightly from a 4 percent drop in earlier trading.In the last two trading days, Netflix has lost 8.9 percent while Apple has lost 6.3 percent.The declines for Google and Amazon have been less pronounced. On Monday, Google fell 0.9 percent and Amazon 1.4 percent.To the broader point, UBS published a research report late last week noting that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google were responsible for one-third of the S.&P. 500\u2019s return of more than 8 percent this year.The bell does not ring at a stock market peak, the note explained, but there have been periods in recent history when investors, after riding a small group of stocks up to unexpected highs, have abandoned them en masse. The reasons for doing so, however, were less than obvious at the time.UBS was not the only major investment firm weighing in late last week about the heavy influence of these stocks in investor portfolios.Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far these stocks had run, and two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple, citing worries about slowing iPhone sales.While traders have said hedge funds could be bailing out on these stocks, the larger question is the extent to which retail investors \u2014 given how vulnerable they can be to mood shifts in the market \u2014 will stick with them.According to FactSet, a data collection company, 82 percent of today\u2019s combined investor exposure to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google is in the hands of large mutual fund companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity and the Capital Group.Hedge funds as an investor class, according to FactSet, hold just $58 billion in these stocks, which are collectively known by the acronym Faang. (Some analysts prefer \u201cFaamg,\u201d substituting larger Microsoft for Netflix.)Compared with the $688 billion held in traditional mutual funds and their faster-growing cousins \u2014 exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade on stock exchanges \u2014 that is a very small figure.To a large degree, the ascendance of these companies is a result of their ability to grow and achieve startling success in a sluggish economy.In the last week, however, a number of analysts have argued that the disconnect between Faang (or Faamg) stocks and other sectors tied more directly to the economy, such as financial and energy stocks, has become too significant to ignore.Credit Suisse, in a trading alert on Monday, recommended that clients ditch QQQ, a $50 billion exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index, in favor of XLF, a $22 billion E.T.F. that follows large financial companies.In the last week, QQQ has declined by 3.3 percent and XLF has increased by about the same amount as investors large and small have started to make this change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Long Before It Lost Turf, ISIS Was Already Targeting Britain", "Date": "2017-06-10", "News": "Supported byFor the next 13 months, the Islamic State and those inspired by the group killed and maimed in Brussels, Berlin, Nice and Normandy as well as across the Atlantic in California and Florida. Yet the rhetoric against Britain began to feel like the frothy threats made by the group toward other countries that had avoided attacks, including Iran: loud and menacing but ultimately empty.From a publicity standpoint, the attacks in Britain and Iran are a lift to the Islamic State as it loses ground steadily in Syria, Iraq and Libya. Some analysts have interpreted the strikes as a bid by the group to demonstrate its resilience, even as its territory-holding caliphate slowly disappears.Hours after the violence in Iran, the Islamic State released its glossy, online magazine, directly challenging skeptics who have questioned the group\u2019s stamina as its territory shrinks. \u201cWhat many of these analysts failed to admit, however, is that losing territory was nothing new for the Islamic State,\u201d the article said, referring to the group\u2019s near-defeat in 2011 at the hands of United States forces in Iraq.\u201cThe reality faced by the Crusaders today is that despite their claims that the Islamic State has been weakened,\u201d it said, \u201cstrikes in the heart of the Crusaders\u2019 strongholds in the West will continue to occur just as suddenly and unexpectedly.\u201dWhile few details have been shared with the public about thwarted attacks in Iran, plots neutralized in Britain show how the Islamic State\u2019s reach grew with each attempt. The techniques used by the frustrated attackers, the types of targets they chose and the kind of coaching they received broadly follow the arc of the group\u2019s evolution as it struck repeatedly elsewhere in Europe.The earliest instances involved would-be attackers who had ideological affinity for the Islamic State but no direct communication with the group. They took their direction from the many YouTube videos they had watched showing Islamic State atrocities, and from detailed instructions delivered online by Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the group\u2019s spokesman.The messages initially called recruits to travel to the group\u2019s territory, but as those journeys became more perilous, Mr. Adnani exhorted adherents to stay put and wage violence at home.Initially seen as the acts of disaffected youth with no real connection to the Islamic State, these plots did not at first cause alarm, officials say. But in the space of a year, they began to morph into something more complex, as young perpetrators began making online contact with the militant group.\u201cThe rules of engagement changed,\u201d said Max Hill, a British barrister who has prosecuted several high-profile terrorism cases and is now the country\u2019s independent reviewer of antiterrorism legislation.\u201cWe moved from a traditional understanding that there needs to be a trainer \u2014 a radicalizer \u2014 who is physically present into an era where there may be some remote encouragement coupled with fast access to radical material,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cThose factors alone are enough.\u201dJust months after the Islamic State declared its territory-holding caliphate in 2014, the authorities began to see suspects who were in contact with British nationals who had traveled to join the militants.Such was the case for three men who lived near Southall, a suburb of London, and who maintained contact with a friend who had slipped across the Syrian border, according to court records.While their friend joined the ranks of the Islamic State, the three remained stuck in Britain, where they increasingly steeped themselves in the group\u2019s propaganda. In September 2014, when the militants\u2019 spokesman, Mr. Adnani, broadcast an audio recording inciting followers to kill in any way possible \u2014 \u201csmash the disbeliever\u2019s head with a rock or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car\u201d \u2014 the young men felt as if he was talking to them, the records show.The men were arrested in November 2014, after two of them were seen walking into a Kitchen Ideas store, where they bought a Victorinox knife and a sharpener, according to documents from their trial.It is unclear if their contact inside the Islamic State played a role in their progression toward violence, or if he merely acted as a point of inspiration. But by 2015, investigation records reveal, plotters began tapping the inner core of a network of Islamic State online coaches. These coaches spent their days sitting behind computer screens in Raqqa, the Syrian city that is the group\u2019s de facto capital, moving the impressionable men they met on the internet like chess pieces.In the summer of 2015, Mr. Hussain used the encrypted app Surespot to reach a 24-year-old named Junead Khan in Luton who had fallen under the spell of the Islamic State. Mr. Hussain\u2019s stated purpose for reaching out to Mr. Khan was to inform him that a friend of his who had joined the militants had been killed in Syria in an American drone strike, said Mr. Khan\u2019s lawyer, Andrew Hall.Mr. Hall believes that was a ruse. \u201cThe purpose of the call was to use it to call for revenge,\u201d he said. \u201cBy coming to Syria and taking his place. Or, alternatively, by doing an action in England.\u201dMr. Hussain offered Mr. Khan addresses of British soldiers and a nine-page guide to building a backpack bomb. Court transcripts also show that the young man was obsessed with knives.\u201cHe had a longstanding fascination with a particular sort of knife,\u201d Mr. Hall said. \u201cHe kept looking at it on Amazon.\u201d Naming an Islamic State executioner who decapitated Western hostages, the lawyer said, \u201cIt was the sort of knife rumored to be used by Jihadi John.\u201dCounterterrorism experts say the number of foiled Islamic State plots represents the tip of the iceberg. At least 500 people are under active surveillance in Britain, they say, raising the question of whether all can be stopped.\u201cEveryone is saying enough is enough, but what can you actually do?\u201d said David Wells, who until 2013 worked for the Government Communications Headquarters, Britain\u2019s version of the National Security Agency.\u201cMy view is that there is some tinkering around the edges that you could do,\u201d he said, \u201cBut the foreign fighter community being as large it is in Europe, it\u2019s a 20- or 30-year problem \u2014 and no one wants to hear that right now.\u201dSeveral months before they were arrested, Shazib Khan recorded a video of a car driving past the House of Commons in Westminster. He uploaded it to YouTube under the title \u201cISIS drives around Westminster.\u201dThe footage was set to a chant addressed to the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and included the lyrics, \u201cThe virgins are calling, record me for my martyrdom.\u201dKatrin Bennhold contributed reporting from London, and Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Dark Web\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts Went Down", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.When Ross Ulbricht created the Silk Road, a clandestine online drug bazaar hidden on the deep web, he was a 26-year-old libertarian idealist living in Austin, Tex., talking his girlfriend\u2019s ear off about Austrian economics and seasteading experiments \u2014 the idea of creating communities in the middle of the sea, free from government regulations. For all his lofty ambitions, he felt like a failure. He had flunked his Ph.D. exam and was unable to find a buyer for his seasteading gaming simulation. But with the Silk Road he was able to marry his business ambitions and anti-authoritarian philosophy; he envisioned it as a powerful way to defy what he perceived to be the state\u2019s irrational drug policies. Using an anonymizing browser like Tor and the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, people could discreetly buy and sell drugs. Ulbricht taught himself to code and he began by selling mushrooms that he grew himself.By the time Ulbricht was arrested two years later, the Silk Road was an estimated $1.2 billion business that expanded into heroin, guns, hacking tools, counterfeit cash and cyanide. Ulbricht, a former Boy Scout, had tried to commission five murders as the Dread Pirate Roberts, the pseudonym under which he ruled the site. The obsessive, dizzying manhunt to apprehend him involved a slew of government agencies and ended with a neck-breaking plot twist: double agents and hundreds of thousands of dollars in missing Bitcoin.Ulbricht is currently appealing a life sentence for seven convictions, including narcotics, money laundering and the kingpin statute, more typically applied to Mafia bosses or cartel leaders. Evidence unearthed by federal agents included his journal, along with nearly two million words of chat logs between Dread Pirate Roberts and his underlings detailing the operations of the site.The cast of characters has been established over the years since Ulbricht\u2019s arrest, but Bilton\u2019s impressive reporting gives more space to a story that could use some sprawl. For instance, close observers may remember Gary Alford, the criminal investigator with the I.R.S., who was the first agent to come across Ulbricht\u2019s name in conjunction with the Silk Road. Previous accounts gave us the logistics, but Bilton\u2019s book gives us psychological shading and insight into Alford\u2019s method. Alford was born in Brooklyn in 1977, the summer the Son of Sam terrorized New York. It stuck with him that the N.Y.P.D. finally caught the serial killer by poring over parking tickets. He had a hunch he could ensnare Dread Pirate Roberts the same way, and began to look for a sloppy mistake. Sure enough, he discovered that Ulbricht left an anonymous comment on a forum called the Shroomery when he was trying to drum up attention for his new site. However, he had neglected to scrub his email address.In Bilton\u2019s account an unexpected symmetry emerges between the agents investigating Ulbricht and the kingpin himself. They\u2019re all fighting feelings of inferiority and treating the Silk Road as a chance to prove themselves. Bilton\u2019s focus is on the hunt, and the book seems determined to sustain the suspense, even when it\u2019s baked into the plot. Many chapters end with a cliffhanger, which adds a cinematic quality but veers into pulpy true crime when it feels like there\u2019s more pathos at stake. Sometimes the facts are more satisfying than the framing.Ulbricht\u2019s rise and fall is like the start-up hero\u2019s journey reflected in a black mirror. He was fond of the same Ayn Rand quotes as other founders: \u201cThe question isn\u2019t who is going to let me; it\u2019s who is going to stop me.\u201d He had his own version of a consigliere, in the form of Variety Jones. (Ulbricht\u2019s ex-girlfriend gets a lot of space, but the most tender and complex relationship of the book is between him and Variety Jones.)Ulbricht also had the same blinkered view of the consequences of his actions. However, unlike the moral transgressions of the Uber C.E.O. Travis Kalanick or the Theranos C.E.O. Elizabeth Holmes, his came with chat logs. The documentation offers a small window into one of late capitalism\u2019s best kept secrets: How these messianic entrepreneurs talk behind closed doors when they fall so far from their ideals. I wish there had been more focus on that rather than scenes inside a Samsung factory or yet another of Ulbricht\u2019s beach vacations.Since the arrest, Ulbricht\u2019s situation seems decidedly less fringe. Libertarianism has rolled up into the Republican mainstream. The rhetoric that inspired him, from books by Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises, has found its way into the Republican Party. Gawker, the site responsible for first reporting on Silk Road, is dead, bankrupted by Peter Thiel, the libertarian billionaire venture capitalist, Trump adviser and Facebook board member.Like some other start-up founders, Ulbricht is undone by his na\u00efvet\u00e9 and narcissism. \u201cI remember clearly why I created the Silk Road,\u201d he said at sentencing. \u201cI wanted to empower people to be able to make choices in their lives, for themselves and to have privacy and anonymity.\u201d The judge responded: \u201cNo drug dealer from the Bronx selling meth or heroin or crack has ever made these kinds of arguments to the court. It is a privileged argument. You are no better a person than any other drug dealer. ... You were captain of the ship, as the Dread Pirate Roberts, and you made your own laws and you enforced those laws in the manner that you saw fit.\u201d As she handed down the sentence, she said: \u201cIt was, in fact, a carefully planned life\u2019s work. It was your opus. You wanted it to be your legacy \u2014 and it is.\u201dNitasha Tiku is a senior writer for Wired covering Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pandora, Faded Star of Online Music, Gets Cash Infusion From Sirius XM", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byPandora was early to the online music business, introducing a free internet radio service just a few years after Apple started iTunes and enjoying a successful debut as a public company.It was nice while it lasted.Any first-mover advantage Pandora once had has long since dwindled, as rivals including Spotify and Apple Music have become the dominant forces in an industry where consumer habits change faster than the Billboard charts.Now, in a bid to buy time, Pandora has found a partner that can give it some much-needed cash \u2014 and, perhaps down the line, become its new owner.\u201cWith this investment, we have the backing of one of the media industry\u2019s most successful investors and significant capital to accelerate growth,\u201d Tim Leiweke, a Pandora director, said in a statement.Or, as Mark Mulligan, a music technology analyst with Midia Research, put it: \u201cThis gives Pandora a fighting chance of making a proper go at competing.\u201dPandora lost $343 million last year, nearly triple what it lost in 2015. And its active monthly listener base shrank to a two-year low in this year\u2019s first quarter, to 76.7 million.Amazon, Apple and Google also have streaming music offerings, and all face the same fundamental challenge: Paying for music rights and marketing has proved an expensive proposition.Pandora was particularly slow to adapt.Its radio business is supported by advertising that generated a respectable $1 billion in revenue last year.\u201cPandora\u2019s done something sensible,\u201d Mr. Mulligan said, \u201cbut sensible doesn\u2019t always get enough credit.\u201dInternet radio ads, however, are not enough to compete with the likes of Apple and Spotify.Too little, too late, analysts said, suggesting that the expense of the new product would weigh down a company that has never reported an annual profit.Enter Sirius XM.The investment came as little surprise to Wall Street. Sirius XM has flirted with doing a deal for Pandora for some time, with its chairman, Gregory B. Maffei, saying publicly that he could be interested in a transaction, but only at what he considered the right price.The deal announced on Friday includes an agreement for the two companies to work together on internet streaming on mobile devices and in cars. It also gives Sirius XM an edge in any possible takeover of Pandora, with the satellite radio provider taking not only a 19 percent stake but also three board seats, including chairman.All that gives it a formidable advantage over any other potential rival who would seek to buy Pandora, although Sirius XM agreed not to make any such move for 18 months.\u201cLonger term, this makes it more likely that they will end up together,\u201d said Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie.For Sirius XM \u2014 part of the constellation of companies controlled by Liberty Media \u2014 the new stake in Pandora will give it an important toehold in a number of businesses, including ad-supported radio and particularly internet radio. Despite Sirius XM\u2019s traditional strength in cars, its new partner has an attractive presence in the wider world of internet and mobile music outside cars.\u201cThis strategic investment in Pandora represents a unique opportunity for Sirius XM to create value for its stockholders by investing in the leader in the ad-supported digital radio business, a space where Sirius XM does not play today,\u201d James E. Meyer, Sirius XM\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.The agreement on Friday means Sirius XM will replace KKR, the giant investment firm, as Pandora\u2019s major financial backer. Just last month, KKR agreed to invest $150 million in the internet radio service.Pandora, already reeling, will be penalized for swapping partners so quickly: As part of Friday\u2019s complex series of deals, it agreed to pay KKR a $22.5 million termination fee for what amounts to a month of work.Advertisement"}

(Her music is already on Apple Music, which has also financed a concert film for her and put her in commercials.)On Twitter, some listeners also nursed a darker intention to Ms. Swift\u2019s timing: Tonight is also when Katy Perry, her biggest pop rival, is releasing a new album.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foreign Horror TV Shows Are Light on Monsters, Heavy on Mood", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookIt\u2019s unusual to come across this interior, classic style on American TV, in which horror generally means monsters, whether presented with grim finality (\u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d), Saturday matinee derring-do (\u201cGrimm\u201d) or jokey pulp sentimentality (\u201cSupernatural\u201d). The underlying template is the violent action movie, with the supernatural beings as the disposable foe.There is, of course, a tradition of more pure, evocative television horror, beginning with \u201cAlfred Hitchcock Presents\u201d and \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d in the 1950s and \u201960s, and including \u201cNight Gallery,\u201d \u201cThe Outer Limits\u201d and \u201cTales From the Darkside.\u201d The great modern analogue to those shows is \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d where the overall arc was science fiction, while horror was delivered in stand-alone episodes. \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is in the same vein, though horror is more a byproduct of dark techno-futurism.In the current era, though, classic horror has not received its due, outside of David Lynch\u2019s \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d where the frights are sui generis \u2014 more Lynchian than any other genre. Elements of horror figure in many distinctive series, like \u201cLegion,\u201d \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d and \u201cWestworld,\u201d in the service of superhero, science-fiction or fantasy narratives.Where \u201cJordskott\u201d works horror elements into a popular TV format, Mr. Kurosawa, director of supremely creepy films like \u201cPulse\u201d and \u201cThe Cure,\u201d takes a more cinematic approach in his 2012 \u201cPenance.\u201d\u201cBeyond the Walls,\u201d a three-part 2016 production, is a more straightforward genre piece that combines the haunted house and portal-to-another-world tropes. A young Frenchwoman inherits a rundown mansion from a man she\u2019s never met, and, on breaking through a bedroom wall, finds herself trapped, \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d style, in an endless maze of rooms where the usual dark forces lurk.These above-average foreign horror shows share deliberate pacing, quiet styles and a minimal reliance on special effects. (Also, coincidentally or not, a focus on troubled, alienated female characters.) If you feel like weaning yourself from zombies, vampires and werewolves and the cardboard heroes who battle them, they\u2019re a good place to start.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Julia Serano, Transfeminist Thinker, Talks Trans-Misogyny", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byPride 2017The biologist, performer and author Julia Serano is a leading transfeminist thinker and the author of \u201cWhipping Girl,\u201d which Jill Soloway, the creator of the Amazon series \u201cTransparent,\u201d cites as a major influence and the first book she gives to transgender friends, like Caitlyn Jenner.Based on Ms. Serano\u2019s experiences as a trans woman who transitioned in 2002, and deep engagement with feminist theory, her manifesto links transphobia with sexism and is a call to rethink attitudes toward femininity. She worked at the University of California, Berkeley, for 17 years doing postdoctoral research in genetics and evolutionary biology and is now a full-time writer and activist in Oakland. The following interview has been edited and condensed.One of the main ideas \u201cWhipping Girl\u201d became known for is \u201ctrans-misogyny.\u201d Please explain.After I transitioned I experienced a combination of discrimination \u2014 for being a transgender person and also for being a woman. Trans-misogyny describes this complex interplay between transphobia and misogyny that trans women are faced with.What\u2019s an example?Once in San Francisco I saw a trans woman dressed like an average feminine woman walk past a straight couple on the street. The man turned to the woman and sneered, \u201cDid you see all that crap he\u2019s wearing?\u201d He was referring to her dress and jewelry and makeup and all that. If a trans man had walked by, they might also have ridiculed him for being transgender. But I doubt very much they would have made fun of his masculine clothing.When did you become a feminist? And why?I identified as a feminist, or feminist ally, throughout my adult life. But after my transition around 2002, I began writing about my experiences with sexism as a trans woman, and that led me to become more passionate about and involved in feminism.\u201cWhipping Girl\u201d is in many ways a celebration and defense of feminine gender expression. Why did you feel femininity needed a cheerleader?Some people have feminine traits or gravitate toward feminine gender expression. Historically these things have been ridiculed in comparison to masculine interests and gender expression.If people are going to make jokes about transgender people, they usually single out trans women. The underlying theme of the joke is how ridiculous it is that someone who was a man would decide to be a woman, to be feminine. The assumption is that femaleness and femininity are inferior. That\u2019s part of the joke.Just as feminists have long argued that women are men\u2019s equals, we should also be saying that femininity is masculinity\u2019s equal. Most feminist and women\u2019s groups today include trans women. But there are still tensions. Recently the Nigerian novelist and feminist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie sparked controversy with comments suggesting that trans women aren\u2019t really women.I don\u2019t think Adichie is opposed to transgender people per se. But she did go out of her way to make the case that trans women belong in a separate category.Feminism is about putting an end to sexism, and as a feminist I personally want to see the end of sexism in all its forms: homophobia or transphobia or traditional sexism or whatever. I don\u2019t see why trans women need to be forced out into our own group separate from women in order to end sexism.It\u2019s worth pointing out that there was a time when a lot of straight feminists similarly wanted to isolate lesbians. They accused them of being a threat to women and women\u2019s liberation. We see how wrong that was now.Have you felt pressured to conform to certain norms of femininity?It\u2019s complicated. Just like women more generally, trans women vary a lot. Some are high femme. Some butch. I call myself a femme tomboy \u2014 I have a little of both.But there is a sense that to be taken seriously as a trans woman, you should fit into the ideal of femininity as much as possible. Yet trans women who are very feminine are often accused of going over the top and presenting a stereotyped idea of what women should be.A lot of my trans women friends identify as queer or lesbian so they are not canonically feminine. We are very diverse, but the trans women who get media attention tend to fit the more feminine ideal or expectations.Do you swing optimistic or pessimistic in terms of your trans activism?In spite of the many obstacles, I tend to think we progress a little all the time. But since the election, I have been shocked at the rise of the alt-right and about how outspoken strongly sexist, racist, queer-phobic voices have become.You began life as a male; fast-forward almost five decades and you\u2019re a trans woman feminist activist. Could you have imagined that?Not in the way you might be thinking. It\u2019s true that when I was a young boy, I couldn\u2019t have imagined I would be a trans woman. But as soon as I learned about trans people, I thought transitioning might be a possible pathway for me. But being trans has influenced me in surprising ways. Not being able to take my gender for granted from a young age forced me to become a critical thinker. And facing the obstacles of living my life as an out trans woman has made me more self-confident \u2014 not just about my trans identity, but about everything. As a young adult, I mostly saw myself as a biologist and musician, but nowadays I\u2019m working as a writer and activist.Do you have any sisterly advice for Chelsea Manning as she embarks on her public life as a trans woman?I don\u2019t feel comfortable addressing her or anyone specifically. But I would say to younger people in general that when it comes to trans people and transitioning, the only thing you can do is try not to let other people\u2019s expectations dictate what you do or what you become.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Don\u2019t Need Blue Apron to Teach You to Turn On Your Oven", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIf you\u2019re a professional chef for long enough, a journalist will eventually call and say she has a great idea for a story. Her publication is going to come photograph the inside of your refrigerator. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll do what I did: Load up your fridge with groceries you\u2019ll never have time to cook and pretend you\u2019re a normal person.The truth is, chefs aren\u2019t normal people. After a long week working in my restaurant, I find the idea of cooking a meal at home perverse. You want tomato cakes for Table 304? I\u2019m your girl. You want a home-cooked meal? I\u2019ll order on Seamless.Still, while meal kits do eliminate food waste, which is admirable, they also generate enormous amounts of paper and plastic waste. Every ingredient is packaged separately, resulting in absurdities like a single scallion arriving in its own plastic bag.My deepest problem with meal kits, however, is that I worry they\u2019re not teaching people how to cook, but are instead teaching them how to prepare meal kits. The recipe cards that came with some meal kit boxes sounded like word problems, full of measurements, times and temperatures, and if there\u2019s anything I hate it\u2019s this insistence on turning cooking into math.It\u2019s not just Blue Apron and others like it, though. Whenever I write a recipe for a magazine or newspaper my editors demand more measurements and cooking times. This phony precision undermines the heart, and joy, of cooking. Chefs sample their dishes multiple times as they cook because cooking happens by taste and by eye, not by time and temperature. Baking is the fussy one where you need measurements, while cooking is for slobs like me.Does that look like enough pasta? Does this taste as salty as you like? That sauce looks thin \u2014 let\u2019s throw in some more tomatoes. People become dependent on cooking times and temperatures because they don\u2019t understand how cooking works, they know only how to follow a recipe.But when I spoke to people who used these meal kits regularly, I discovered that I was wrong. All of them said that following the recipe cards that the kits provided gave them the confidence they needed to start cooking more. Meal kits had them using spices they\u2019d never tried, experimenting with formerly intimidating techniques, using vegetables they\u2019d previously found baffling. Their question was, \u201cHow many tomatoes go in this pasta?\u201d And the reassuring answer was, \u201cExactly however many came in the box.\u201dThere was a time when recipes were passed from parent to child to grandchild, written by hand on index cards. You had a basic understanding of how the recipe worked because you\u2019d probably helped make it a few times. That doesn\u2019t happen much anymore, and in a way meal kits bridge that gap.For people who didn\u2019t grow up cooking, or seeing food cooked, even buying a cookbook is intimidating. They don\u2019t want \u201cThe Big Giant Book of How to Cook Absolutely Everything.\u201d They want to know how to cook this one thing. Meal kits give them the index cards, with pictures, and even the ingredients for the recipe, all in one place.Everyone I spoke to who used meal kits eventually stopped. The kits gave these new or very occasional cooks the courage to turn on the oven more, so now they\u2019ve moved on. That is the weakness of the meal kit business model, and something that might give the new Blue Apron investors pause: The whole point of training wheels is that eventually you don\u2019t need them anymore.Eventually, you\u2019ll leave meal kits behind and salt and saut\u00e9 on your own, according to your own tastes, not Blue Apron\u2019s. Meal kits take nervous chefs by the hand and lead them toward real recipes.It will always make me sad that many people stop there, clinging to the times and temperatures the way Dumbo holds on to his feather, not realizing he doesn\u2019t need it to fly. But maybe that\u2019s what normal people do. I wouldn\u2019t know. And as long as they\u2019re cooking, what do I care?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: How California Helps the U.S. Economy", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, a reporter based in the Bay Area.On Friday, the United States recorded its 80th consecutive month of job growth, which is the longest streak on record and has pushed the unemployment rate to 4.3 percent from 10 percent in the depths of the recession. After a long and painful recovery, the nation is nearing full employment \u2014 and California has played an outsize role.Over the last five years, California has outperformed the nation in just about every important economic metric. Yes, the state is big, accounting for about 12 percent of the nation\u2019s population. But its share of economic growth has been even bigger.California accounted for 17 percent of job growth in the United States from 2012 to 2016, and a quarter of the growth in gross domestic product.\u201cWhat these numbers say is that California is crucial to U.S. growth, far beyond what we could expect from our population alone,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director and senior economist of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.California was hit hard by the housing bust and recession, so it makes sense that the state would have a stronger rebound. But it also shows how the recovery has been guided by what Mr. Levy calls \u201cthe three Ts,\u201d which are technology, trade and tourism.San Francisco and the Silicon Valley have had a yearslong boom, while the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have been at the center of a rebound in container traffic and international trade. Hollywood has done well, too: As cable channels and companies like Netflix and Amazon have ramped up their original programming, Southern California has seen a surge in production jobs.The downside to all this success is that the state now has quite a lot to lose. With a large immigrant population and a huge port complex, California is at a much greater risk of being hurt by President Trump\u2019s muscular immigration policies and desire to curb imports and tear up trade agreements.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The American distance runner Jeffrey Eggleston won the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Marathon in San Diego on Sunday, beating more than 30,000 entrants with a time of 2 hours, 21 minutes and 18 seconds.But he had to the share the spotlight with a petite, 94-year-old grandmother.Harriette Thompson became the oldest woman to officially complete a half marathon, or 13.1 miles.Ms. Thompson, a former concert pianist from North Carolina, crossed the finish line after a run \u2014 more accurately a brisk walk \u2014 of 3 hours, 42 minutes and 56 seconds.She already held the distinction of oldest woman to complete a full marathon, which she did in 2015 at age 92, also at the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Marathon in San Diego.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me that people are making such a deal out of this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at how many young people say, \u2018I\u2019m running just because of you.\u2019 And I think, \u2018Oh, good.

Whether it\u2019s inspired by devotion, repentance or coercion is a matter of speculation.

Low and sepulchral, Iggy sings, \u201cDeath, make me brave/death, leave me swinging.\u201d He also imagines what it would be like \u201cTo lead a pure life, and look ahead and clear sky,\u201d but Iggy knows better. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna get there, but it\u2019s a nice dream.\u201d J.P. The trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire espouses a contradiction, one that\u2019s not out of place in the jazz tradition: His music is all about dense and winding internal monologue \u2014 even near-impenetrability, sometimes, but the emotional energy of everything he plays is a communal effort, built by the cascading harmony and slyly complex rhythms of his ensemble. Mr. Akinmusire recorded \u201cA Rift in Decorum,\u201d his first live album, earlier this year at the Village Vanguard, and he used just a quartet, nixing his band\u2019s typical saxophone. On \u201cMaurice and Michael (Sorry I Didn\u2019t Say Hello),\u201d written after coming across an old friend who had fallen on hard times, he unfurls a long solo over the sooty clouds of Sam Harris\u2019s piano and Justin Brown\u2019s writhing drums. There\u2019s a jostling energy that doesn\u2019t shake Mr. Akinmusire from his thoughts; his phrases are measured and concise, even as they rise in pitch and urgency.

Every little thing about this song arrives at an odd angle: the youthful na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the lyrics, the squelches and shimmer of the production, the way he turns the feelings of this woman from loathing to love. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d he asks. \u201dDo you like D Rose or do you like Butler?\u201d J.C.Calypso Rose, now 77, broke every gender barrier in the calypso music of Trinidad and Tobago; for one thing, she\u2019s the reason the Calypso King competition was retitled Calypso Monarch. \u201cFar From Home,\u201d the album she released last year abroad and is now available in the United States, is a late-life victory lap that still resonates in her birthplace, Tobago. Its groove and defiance are still strong in \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d which was strong enough to attract participation from Spain\u2019s international groove connector, Manu Chao, and from Trinidad\u2019s soca (soul-calypso) star, Machel Montano.

{"Headline": "Apple Piles On the Features, and Users Say, \u2018Enough!\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As Apple prepares to show off new features for the iPhone and other devices at its developer conference on Monday, the company is grappling with an uncomfortable issue: Many of its existing features are already too complicated for many users to figure out.But the process of finding and installing other apps in Messages is so tricky that most users have no idea they can even do it, developers and analysts say.\u201cWhile we didn\u2019t end up moving forward with it, we\u2019re excited about other ways we\u2019re making delivery faster and more efficient,\u201d Andy Fang, a founder of DoorDash and the company\u2019s chief technology officer, said in a statement.Velapp has just released a video recording app that uses 3-D Touch to help users select the best parts of a video while recording it. But Mr. de Min said that few other developers were using the technology, in part because iPhone users were unaware of it. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can really see,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand it.\u201dApple, which declined to comment for this article, makes many updates that are popular with users, from changes to the Siri voice assistant to automatically transcribed voice mail messages.At this year\u2019s Apple Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, Calif., the company is expected to introduce improved Mac computers and iPads, software updates for all of its hardware and a voice-activated speaker to compete with Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home.With Apple adding fewer major features in recent years, customers have been slower to upgrade their devices.App developers are also pausing in what had been a race to embrace Apple\u2019s latest innovations. Eliran Sapir, chief executive of Apptopia, an analytics firm, said that new apps were being introduced at half the rate they were a year ago.Apple TV apps are hot, he said, but developers are fleeing Apple Watch. \u201cThere is no way to monetize the watch whatsoever,\u201d he said.The slow uptake of apps for Messages and 3-D Touch is evident in the numbers.There are 5,000 regular apps and 30,000 sticker apps for Messages, according to Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Only about 3,600 of the 2.5 million apps in the iOS app store promote their compatibility with 3-D Touch.\u201cYou get your new iPhone and you don\u2019t know that 3-D Touch and apps in Messages even exist,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. Although stickers account for 97 of the top 100 Messages apps, he said, some users are so confused that they post app reviews like, \u201cI downloaded these Disney stickers. How do I use them?\u201dThat is not exactly in line with the simple \u201cit just works\u201d philosophy that Apple built its business on.Apple is not the only major technology company struggling to find the right balance between constant innovation and ease of use. Facebook has changed course several times in its approach to apps and bots within its Messenger app and regularly battles feature overload in its News Feed. Google, whose search box is a paragon of simplicity, famously retreated from an attempt to tie all of its services together with the unwieldy Google Plus social network.Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, which makes apps for companies like JetBlue Airways and Turner, said he would like to see Apple simplify and smooth out some of its current features. He said Messages apps have potential if Apple can figure out how to make it easier for people to find them.Mr. Reubenstein pointed to a feature of Google Photos as an example of the simplicity that people want. He said he backs up his iPhone photos to Google, which uses face recognition to tag people in the images. For Mother\u2019s Day, Google made it so easy to create quick movies from those photos that he made three, for his mother, his mother-in-law and his wife.\u201cAt its core, it\u2019s a discoverability issue,\u201d said Mr. Duncan, who worked part time on Apple\u2019s telephone tech-support team during college and hopes to get a design job there in the future. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know the stickers exist.\u201dHe said he had to teach his friends how to install and use Messages stickers by sending them multiple screenshots.\u201cA lot of people will think it\u2019s their fault, and it\u2019s really the designer\u2019s fault,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want apps to be easy to use.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Fined Record $2.7 Billion in E.U. Antitrust Ruling", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byGoogle suffered a major blow on Tuesday after European antitrust officials fined the search giant a record $2.7 billion for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals.The penalty, of 2.4 billion euros, highlights the aggressive stance that European officials have taken in regulating many of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, going significantly further than their American counterparts.\u201cIn Europe, companies must compete on the merits regardless if they are European or not,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules.\u201dThe apparent focus on Silicon Valley has prompted accusations from some in the United States that the European Union is unfairly targeting American companies. Officials in the bloc vigorously deny those assertions.In targeting the activities of these digital giants, experts say, European authorities are laying down a marker for more hands-on control of how the digital world operates. And while the $2.7 billion fine announced on Tuesday is tiny compared with Google\u2019s $90 billion in annual revenue, it highlights the region\u2019s willingness to dole out sizable penalties.Shares of Google fell for a second straight day on the news. The stock declined 2.5 percent on Tuesday, a steeper decline than the broader Nasdaq.Europe\u2019s latest efforts to rein in technology companies stem from continuing unease that Silicon Valley has come to dominate how the continent\u2019s 500 million citizens interact online.\u201cEurope is setting the agenda,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law and economics at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like that.\u201dIn her statement on Tuesday, Ms. Vestager said that Google held a dominant position in online search, requiring the company to take extra measures to ensure that its digital services did not crowd out those of rivals.The antitrust decision related to Google\u2019s online shopping service, which the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said had received preferential treatment compared with those of rivals in specialized search results.Analysts say such so-called vertical search products \u2014 also including those for restaurant and business reviews \u2014 represent a fast-growing percentage of Google\u2019s annual revenue. The company does not break out earnings figures for this unit in its financial reports.The search company is facing two separate antitrust charges in Europe related to Android, its popular mobile software, and to some of its advertising products. Google denies the accusations.Google rebuffed the European Union\u2019s claims on Tuesday, saying that its services had helped the region\u2019s digital economy grow. It has also said that significant online competition remains in Europe, including from companies like Amazon and eBay.Despite Google\u2019s denials, the record fine \u2014 the previous high, against Intel in 2009, was \u20ac1.06 billion \u2014 represents a bloody nose for a company that holds a market share of more than 90 percent in online search in Europe.Several other antitrust complaints related to other specialized search results have been filed in Europe against Google, and Ms. Vestager said Tuesday\u2019s announcement could \u201cbe used as a framework\u201d in those investigations.That may eventually lead to further fines if European authorities find wrongdoing. The complaints include many from other American technology companies, including Oracle, News Corporation and Yelp, which have been vocal advocates of large fines against Google.Google has 90 days to respond to the European Commission\u2019s demands, or face penalties of up to 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, its parent company. European officials said on Tuesday that they would regularly monitor the company\u2019s activities to ensure that it was complying with the ruling.Under European rules, the company \u2014 and not the regulator \u2014 must come up with proposals to guarantee that it treats competitors fairly when people make online search queries. The authorities can demand that Google make further changes if they are not satisfied with the initial proposals.Analysts and many of Google\u2019s competitors have called for an independent monitor to oversee the company\u2019s digital services in Europe, which could include oversight of its search algorithms, some of Google\u2019s most important intellectual property. The company is likely to fiercely oppose such a move.Google has other options, including the removal of some of its specialized search services from Europe, or returning them to how they operated before the European Union\u2019s investigation began almost a decade ago.Whatever the outcome, analysts say they expect a protracted legal battle that will continue for several years as both Google and its rivals fight to define how search services are provided in Europe and elsewhere.\u201cGoogle\u2019s search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online,\u201d said Shivaun Raff, a co-founder of Foundem, a British comparison-shopping site that was the first company to file a complaint against Google. \u201cLeft unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best Way to Cool Your Space", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byThe FixSummer is nearly here, and your home will soon be heating up. But just the thought of looking for a new air-conditioner is enough to make you break out in a sweat. How do you know which one to buy, and how it will affect your energy bill? What if your apartment building doesn\u2019t allow window units? Not to worry: We\u2019ve done the research for you.The key to comfort and savings is finding the unit that fits your space. An air-conditioner that isn\u2019t powerful enough won\u2019t effectively cool your home and could end up inflating your power bill. One that is too powerful will work too quickly, shutting off before most of the humidity has been removed, leaving your place cool but clammy. And all that cycling on and off can stress the equipment and shorten its life span.With all of that in mind, here are some guidelines to help you find the right air-conditioner for your home.\u201cIt is very tricky to retrofit a building that was built without air-conditioning,\u201d said Andrew Gerringer, the managing director for new business development at the Marketing Directors, a New York development, leasing and marketing company. \u201cBuildings that have installed it\u201d \u2014 including, he noted, some apartments at 190 Riverside Drive and Manhattan House at 200 East 66th Street \u2014 \u201chave done so through great expense and aggravation.\u201dAnother consideration: Most central air systems lack room-by-room control, so if you want to cool the bedroom while you\u2019re sleeping, you\u2019ll have to cool the rest of your home, too. Still, because the ducts and mechanical components are built in, effectively hidden within the walls, floors or attic, central air is the most discreet option.Hire an installer who will work with you on a well-thought-out plan for where to put the ductwork, and be sure to insulate that ductwork. Also, budget for seasonal visits by a professional to change the filter, clean the coils and perform other maintenance to ensure that the system is working properly.Bottom line: If you have space for the ductwork, central air is a quiet, convenient and design-friendly way to cool your home.Be sure to take into account sun exposure and how the room is used. If the room is heavily shaded, for example, the Energy Star chart recommends reducing capacity by 10 percent. If more than two people regularly occupy the room, add 600 BTUs for each additional person. In the kitchen, increase capacity by 4,000 BTUs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Fewer Homes for Sale, Bidding Wars Erupt in Washington", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Daniel Handel left his bachelor pad in the Truxton Circle neighborhood in 2011 to take an overseas post. Returning this May with a wife and two children in tow, he found the capital had changed as much as his family life had.Hipster coffee shops and gentrified homes have popped up around his old neighborhood. A real estate mogul is living in the White House. And house prices have skyrocketed.Forced to give up his search for a new home in the center of the city despite his $700,000 budget, Mr. Handel, 37, describes prices in the capital as \u201castronomical.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m mystified,\u201d he says. \u201cThere can\u2019t be that many people making that much more than us. Who are these people who can afford these houses?\u201dIt is easy to think that it is caused by the influx of very wealthy people, some recruited by Mr. Trump to work in his administration, who have pushed prices up. The housing market in the capital sees a slight churn every four years as political appointees and staff members pass the baton after an election.Instead, Washington is beginning to suffer from a problem facing other American cities, like San Francisco. An influx of professionals is bidding on a limited supply of affordable homes.Real estate prices in the capital did not slump during the Great Recession as much as in the rest of the country. In the five months since Mr. Trump took office, they have grown 7.14 percent year-on-year, the fastest pace since 2010, which is as far back as the local multiple listing service, Bright MLS, has data.The price of the average house sold in Washington has grown 40.3 percent since 2009, to $680,449. Washington ranks fifth of the 20 cities the Case-Shiller index of housing prices tracks, behind only Los Angeles, Miami, San Diego and San Francisco.Certainly, the luxury end of the market has experienced a particular boom this year, as many billionaire investors, lawyers and oil and gas executives relocated to the capital. The average price of a luxury property in the capital, defined as the most expensive 5 percent of homes, rose 32.6 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, according to data from Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm.\u201cThis cabinet in particular has been touted as one of the richest in history, with Trump being a real estate mogul and moving in those circles,\u201d said Steven Centrella, a real estate agent with Redfin. \u201cThey do have more resources available to them and they\u2019re used to certain lifestyles.\u201dIn the same neighborhood, Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, paid $23 million for a 27,000-square-foot former museum that he intends to convert into a single-family home.The small group of political outsiders appointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s team and the very wealthy are hardly the only factors responsible for the more expensive Washington market. Home to government agencies, embassies and universities, as well as consultant firms, technology businesses and government contractors eager to be near the seat of power, the capital has long been buffered from national economic downturns. It remains popular with real estate investors.But that growing demand has not been matched with a supply of new homes. A combination of zoning rules and height restrictions in the city limit the developers.\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere for them to go but up,\u201d said Boomer Foster, president of the Long & Foster real estate agency.Those who have been searching for a new home in recent months, like Keaton Van Beveren, 29, say offers on plum properties come in fast and often end with a bidding war.\u201cIt\u2019s so competitive,\u201d said Ms. Beveren, who spent eight months house hunting and was outbid on three properties before buying her first home in the Capitol Hill area. \u201cThere can be 12 offers on a place in five days and they can go way, way over the asking price.\u201dThis year\u2019s rally is partly explained by pent-up demand from home buyers who resisted making a big purchase during the uncertainty of last year\u2019s divisive presidential election.\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if people were actually going to stick to their promises and move to Canada,\u201d says Holly Loomis, 31, who bought a new home in Bethesda, Md., shortly after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.Demand for properties in downtown locations has, for example, been particularly brisk in recent years. A growing number of Americans, like Mr. Handel and his new family, are opting for bustling central locations close to their workplace over more spacious properties in nearby Virginia and Maryland.Millennials trickling into the housing market could provide a lift to the housing market, particularly in the capital, which is the second-most-popular region in the United States for this young demographic, because of the variety of jobs at high salaries.\u201cThey\u2019re actually much more aligned to their grandparents than to their parents when it comes to housing,\u201d says Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow. \u201cThey believe owning a home is part of the good life.\u201dAs Mr. Trump settles into the White House, the real estate industry is now watching closely to see whether he delivers on his policy pledges.\u201cThere is huge potential for macro policy to drive the housing market upward, even though that wasn\u2019t the intention,\u201d said Ralph McLaughlin, Trulia\u2019s chief economist.Advertisement"}

Analysts have speculated endlessly about what Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, intends to do should he complete the blockbuster deal for Whole Foods.Whole Foods shares, meanwhile, continued to rise Monday and closed at $43.22 \u2014 more than Amazon\u2019s cash offer of $42 a share, suggesting investors are optimistic that a higher bid may yet emerge.Blue Apron also faces meal-kit competition from HelloFresh, Sun Basket and Purple Carrot.Such companies were founded on the premise that customers want fresh ingredients and the convenience of home delivery with the satisfaction of actually preparing their meals at home.Blue Apron is likely to argue to prospective investors that its niche in the food-delivery service is significantly different from the more general service that Amazon offers through PrimeFresh.Founded in 2012, Blue Apron is well known among the cognoscenti of podcasts and other media popular with millennials.That popularity has been a result of aggressive marketing. Blue Apron\u2019s marketing expense is enormous, and it has been growing, jumping tenfold from 2014 to 2016, to $144.1 million.Now the company is hoping to capitalize on its growth by pursuing an initial public offering. It is taking that step with the public markets appearing more welcoming to debutantes: The number of offerings tripled, to 25, in the first quarter of this year from the same time last year. Such offerings raised nearly $10 billion in proceeds in the quarter.Among those offerings was one by Snap, the parent of Snapchat and the most recent prominent consumer-focused company to go public, in March.The company plans to sell at least 30 million shares, although underwriters can sell an additional 4.5 million shares if demand is strong enough.Since its inception, Blue Apron has posted significant gains in sales, with its revenue in 2016 more than doubling from the previous year, to $795.4 million. But it has continued to lose money \u2014 $54.9 million last year \u2014 as it has spent on marketing and growth.Its offering is being led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Barclays.

{"Headline": "A Cyberattack \u2018the World Isn\u2019t Ready For\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byNEWARK \u2014 There have been times over the last two months when Golan Ben-Oni has felt like a voice in the wilderness.On April 29, someone hit his employer, IDT Corporation, with two cyberweapons that had been stolen from the National Security Agency. Mr. Ben-Oni, the global chief information officer at IDT, was able to fend them off, but the attack left him distraught.In 22 years of dealing with hackers of every sort, he had never seen anything like it. Who was behind it? How did they evade all of his defenses? How many others had been attacked but did not know it?Since then, Mr. Ben-Oni has been sounding alarm bells, calling anyone who will listen at the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey attorney general\u2019s office and the top cybersecurity companies in the country to warn them about an attack that may still be invisibly striking victims undetected around the world.And he is determined to track down whoever did it.\u201cI don\u2019t pursue every attacker, just the ones that piss me off,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni told me recently over lentils in his office, which was strewn with empty Red Bull cans. \u201cThis pissed me off and, more importantly, it pissed my wife off, which is the real litmus test.\u201dThe strike on IDT, a conglomerate with headquarters in a nondescript gray building here with views of the Manhattan skyline 15 miles away, was similar to WannaCry in one way: Hackers locked up IDT data and demanded a ransom to unlock it.But the ransom demand was just a smoke screen for a far more invasive attack that stole employee credentials. With those credentials in hand, hackers could have run free through the company\u2019s computer network, taking confidential information or destroying machines.Worse, the assault, which has never been reported before, was not spotted by some of the nation\u2019s leading cybersecurity products, the top security engineers at its biggest tech companies, government intelligence analysts or the F.B.I., which remains consumed with the WannaCry attack.Were it not for a digital black box that recorded everything on IDT\u2019s network, along with Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s tenacity, the attack might have gone unnoticed.Scans for the two hacking tools used against IDT indicate that the company is not alone. In fact, tens of thousands of computer systems all over the world have been \u201cbackdoored\u201d by the same N.S.A. weapons. Mr. Ben-Oni and other security researchers worry that many of those other infected computers are connected to transportation networks, hospitals, water treatment plants and other utilities.An attack on those systems, they warn, could put lives at risk. And Mr. Ben-Oni, fortified with adrenaline, Red Bull and the house beats of Deadmau5, the Canadian record producer, said he would not stop until the attacks had been shut down and those responsible were behind bars.\u201cThe world is burning about WannaCry, but this is a nuclear bomb compared to WannaCry,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cThis is different. It\u2019s a lot worse. It steals credentials. You can\u2019t catch it, and it\u2019s happening right under our noses.\u201dAnd, he added, \u201cThe world isn\u2019t ready for this.\u201dMr. Ben-Oni, 43, a Hasidic Jew, is a slight man with smiling eyes, a thick beard and a hacker\u2019s penchant for mischief. He grew up in the hills of Berkeley, Calif., the son of Israeli immigrants.Even as a toddler, Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s mother said, he was not interested in toys. She had to take him to the local junkyard to scour for typewriters that he would eventually dismantle on the living room floor. As a teenager, he aspired to become a rabbi but spent most of his free time hacking computers at the University of California, Berkeley, where his exploits once accidentally took down Belgium\u2019s entire phone system for 15 minutes.To his parents\u2019 horror, he dropped out of college to pursue his love of hacking full time, starting a security company to help the city of Berkeley and two nearby communities, Alameda and Novato, set up secure computer networks.He had a knack for the technical work, but not the marketing, and found it difficult to get new clients. So at age 19, he crossed the country and took a job at IDT, back when the company was a low-profile long-distance service provider.As IDT started acquiring and spinning off an eclectic list of ventures, Mr. Ben-Oni found himself responsible for securing shale oil projects in Mongolia and the Golan Heights, a \u201cStar Trek\u201d comic books company, a project to cure cancer, a yeshiva university that trains underprivileged students in cybersecurity, and a small mobile company that Verizon recently acquired for $3.1 billion.Which is to say he has encountered hundreds of thousands of hackers of every stripe, motivation and skill level. He eventually started a security business, IOSecurity, under IDT, to share some of the technical tools he had developed to keep IDT\u2019s many businesses secure. By Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s estimate, IDT experiences hundreds of attacks a day on its businesses, but perhaps only four each year give him pause.Nothing compared to the attack that struck in April. Like the WannaCry attack in May, the assault on IDT relied on cyberweapons developed by the N.S.A. that were leaked online in April by a mysterious group of hackers calling themselves the Shadow Brokers \u2014 alternately believed to be Russia-backed cybercriminals, an N.S.A. mole, or both.Both WannaCry and the IDT attack used a hacking tool the agency had code-named EternalBlue. The tool took advantage of unpatched Microsoft servers to automatically spread malware from one server to another, so that within 24 hours North Korea\u2019s hackers had spread their ransomware to more than 200,000 servers around the globe.The attack on IDT went a step further with another stolen N.S.A. cyberweapon, called DoublePulsar. The N.S.A. used DoublePulsar to penetrate computer systems without tripping security alarms. It allowed N.S.A. spies to inject their tools into the nerve center of a target\u2019s computer system, called the kernel, which manages communications between a computer\u2019s hardware and its software.In the pecking order of a computer system, the kernel is at the very top, allowing anyone with secret access to it to take full control of a machine. It is also a dangerous blind spot for most security software, allowing attackers to do what they want and go unnoticed. In IDT\u2019s case, attackers used DoublePulsar to steal an IDT contractor\u2019s credentials. Then they deployed ransomware in what appears to be a cover for their real motive: broader access to IDT\u2019s businesses.Mr. Ben-Oni learned of the attack only when a contractor, working from home, switched on her computer to find that all her data had been encrypted and that attackers were demanding a ransom to unlock it. He might have assumed that this was a simple case of ransomware.But the attack struck Mr. Ben-Oni as unique. For one thing, it was timed perfectly to the Sabbath. Attackers entered IDT\u2019s network at 6 p.m. on Saturday on the dot, two and a half hours before the Sabbath would end and when most of IDT\u2019s employees \u2014 40 percent of whom identify as Orthodox Jews \u2014 would be off the clock. For another, the attackers compromised the contractor\u2019s computer through her home modem \u2014 strange.The black box of sorts, a network recording device made by the Israeli security company Secdo, shows that the ransomware was installed after the attackers had made off with the contractor\u2019s credentials. And they managed to bypass every major security detection mechanism along the way. Finally, before they left, they encrypted her computer with ransomware, demanding $130 to unlock it, to cover up the more invasive attack on her computer.Mr. Ben-Oni estimates that he has spoken to 107 security experts and researchers about the attack, including the chief executives of nearly every major security company and the heads of threat intelligence at Google, Microsoft and Amazon.With the exception of Amazon, which found that some of its customers\u2019 computers had been scanned by the same computer that hit IDT, no one had seen any trace of the attack before Mr. Ben-Oni notified them. The New York Times confirmed Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s account via written summaries provided by Palo Alto Networks, Intel\u2019s McAfee and other security firms he used and asked to investigate the attack.\u201cI started to get the sense that we were the canary,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we recorded it.\u201dSince IDT was hit, Mr. Ben-Oni has contacted everyone in his Rolodex to warn them of an attack that could still be worming its way, undetected, through victims\u2019 systems.\u201cTime is burning,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cUnderstand, this is really a war \u2014 with offense on one side, and institutions, organizations and schools on the other, defending against an unknown adversary.\u201dSince the Shadow Brokers leaked dozens of coveted attack tools in April, hospitals, schools, cities, police departments and companies around the world have largely been left to fend for themselves against weapons developed by the world\u2019s most sophisticated attacker: the N.S.A.For his part, Mr. Ben-Oni said he had rolled out Microsoft\u2019s patches as soon as they became available, but attackers still managed to get in through the IDT contractor\u2019s home modem.Six years ago, Mr. Ben-Oni had a chance meeting with an N.S.A. employee at a conference and asked him how to defend against modern-day cyberthreats. The N.S.A. employee advised him to \u201crun three of everything\u201d: three firewalls, three antivirus solutions, three intrusion detection systems. And so he did.But in this case, modern-day detection systems created by Cylance, McAfee and Microsoft and patching systems by Tanium did not catch the attack on IDT. Nor did any of the 128 publicly available threat intelligence feeds that IDT subscribes to. Even the 10 threat intelligence feeds that his organization spends a half-million dollars on annually for urgent information failed to report it. He has since threatened to return their products.\u201cOur industry likes to work on known problems,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cThis is an unknown problem. We\u2019re not ready for this.\u201dWorse still, Mr. Ben-Oni said, \u201cNo one is running point on this.\u201dLast month, he personally briefed the F.B.I. analyst in charge of investigating the WannaCry attack. He was told that the agency had been specifically tasked with WannaCry, and that even though the attack on his company was more invasive and sophisticated, it was still technically something else, and therefore the F.B.I. could not take on his case.The F.B.I. did not respond to requests for comment.So Mr. Ben-Oni has largely pursued the case himself. His team at IDT was able to trace part of the attack to a personal Android phone in Russia and has been feeding its findings to Europol, the European law enforcement agency based in The Hague.\u201cOnce DoublePulsar is on the machine, there\u2019s nothing stopping anyone else from coming along and using the back door,\u201d Mr. Dillon said.More distressing, Mr. Dillon tested all the major antivirus products against the DoublePulsar infection and a demoralizing 99 percent failed to detect it.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the same computers infected with DoublePulsar for two months and there is no telling how much malware is on those systems,\u201d Mr. Dillon said. \u201cRight now we have no idea what\u2019s gotten into these organizations.\u201dIn the worst case, Mr. Dillon said, attackers could use those back doors to unleash destructive malware into critical infrastructure, tying up rail systems, shutting down hospitals or even paralyzing electrical utilities.Could that attack be coming? The Shadow Brokers resurfaced last month, promising a fresh load of N.S.A. attack tools, even offering to supply them for monthly paying subscribers \u2014 like a wine-of-the-month club for cyberweapon enthusiasts.In a hint that the industry is taking the group\u2019s threats seriously, Microsoft issued a new set of patches to defend against such attacks. The company noted in an ominously worded message that the patches were critical, citing an \u201celevated risk for destructive cyberattacks.\u201dMr. Ben-Oni is convinced that IDT is not the only victim, and that these tools can and will be used to do far worse.\u201cI look at this as a life-or-death situation,\u201d he said. \u201cToday it\u2019s us, but tomorrow it might be someone else.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What You Get (and What You Don\u2019t) From a $50 Amazon Fire", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byTech FixWhat can $50 buy? An inexpensive pair of sneakers, maybe dinner for two in San Francisco or a couple of tickets to the ballgame. But few ever imagined that it could also buy a tablet computer capable of running apps and streaming Netflix.Amazon\u2019s tablet success stands out because sales of the devices as a whole have been shrinking. Slowing tablet sales have compelled Apple to refresh its iPads more frequently than many of its other products. In fact, Apple on Monday introduced yet another new iPad with a 10.5-inch screen and a starting price of $649.After testing Amazon\u2019s Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 for a week, here\u2019s my verdict: These cheap tablets are ideal for families with children who treat gadgets like toys that can be slammed on a table or thrown against the ground. But if you\u2019re an adult who needs to get the slightest amount of work done on a tablet, you should probably spend the extra money on a big-screen smartphone or an iPad.Here\u2019s what you need to know about what you get \u2014 and what you don\u2019t \u2014 from a $50 Amazon tablet.The best thing about the new tablets is how they feel to hold. Weighing about 10 ounces and 13 ounces, the seven-inch and eight-inch devices were designed to be easily carried in one hand. After spending hours holding the Fire with one hand to read e-books and to watch Netflix videos, my wrist did not feel strained. The compact size also makes these tablets great for children with small hands.The Fire 7 also had surprisingly long battery life for a device this inexpensive. Amazon says it gets about eight hours of juice while juggling various tasks, like browsing the web and running apps. I watched about four and a half hours of video before its battery drained. That\u2019s modest, but enough for playing a feature-length movie before tucking a child into bed. Amazon says the eight-incher has a battery life of 12 hours.While the Fires have mediocre displays with dull colors and noticeable pixelation even when reading e-books, the lower quality is acceptable at this price. I wouldn\u2019t use a Fire for reading digital comics, which usually have a wide range of colors and sharp illustrations, but the tablet is sufficient for flipping through e-books, which are just black text on white pages.For internet speeds, the Fires were reasonably fast at downloads. In my tests on a Wi-Fi network, Apple\u2019s $329 iPad had download speeds of 92 megabits a second, compared with the Fire 7, at 48 megabits a second. While the Fires were only about half as fast as the pricier iPad, 48 megabits a second was more than enough to smoothly stream video and quickly download apps and e-books.The worst part of the Fires is the overall computing power. The tablets are so slow at loading apps and processing tasks that even typing memos is painful; whenever you make a mistake, there is a lag as you backspace to type the correct letter.The sluggishness also makes the Fires terrible for scrolling through web articles. Don\u2019t buy an Amazon tablet if you plan to use it for email, web browsing or playing games with heavy graphics.Another major component lacking from Amazon\u2019s tablets is access to Google\u2019s official app store, the largest mobile software shop with more than 2.5 million apps. The tablets run a modified version of Google\u2019s Android that instead showcases Amazon\u2019s App store. While there are hundreds of thousands of apps inside Amazon\u2019s app store, I found that some of my favorite apps were missing \u2014 namely 1Password, an app for managing passwords.Perhaps the biggest design oversight of the Fire 7 is the placement of the speaker on the back of the tablet. Most other tablets feature the speakers on the bottom or sides so that blockage isn\u2019t a problem.But if you place the tablet bottom-side down on a flat surface to listen to music from the speaker, the sound will be muffled. Instead, you have to lay it screen-side down. The same problem occurs if you hold it with a protective cover on: The back flap covers the speaker. (The Fire 8 does not have this problem, because the speakers are on the side.)Lastly, if you pay the bare minimum of $50 for the seven-incher or $80 for the eight-incher, you are getting a tablet that shows ads, or what Amazon calls \u201cspecial offers.\u201d What that means is the lock screen, which is what you see when you wake up the device, will shuffle through different ads, like e-book or app promotions. You can pay an extra $15 to buy versions of the tablets without sponsored screens.With all that said, would you pay $50 for an adequate e-book reader and TV show and movie player that was easy to carry around everywhere? My guess would be yes.But perhaps the most compelling value proposition is a hidden one: keeping your child\u2019s hands off your fancy iPad.An earlier version of this article used an outdated brand reference to the Amazon Fire tablet. The tables are now simply called Fire, no longer Kindle Fire.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Michel Temer of Brazil Is Charged With Corruption", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 President Michel Temer was charged with corruption by Brazil\u2019s prosecutor general late Monday. He was accused of taking a $152,000 bribe via an intermediary, an act that, according to the prosecutor general, Rodrigo Janot, \u201chelped to compromise the image of the Federal Republic of Brazil.\u201dMr. Janot said Mr. Temer had agreed to the $152,000 payment from Mr. Batista in exchange for helping to resolve a problem that a Batista company was having with a power plant it owned. He also said Mr. Temer should pay $3 million in moral damages.According to the charges, a further $11 million in bribes was promised, according to the charges, to Mr. Temer and Rodrigo Rocha Loures, a close aide to the president who was filmed taking delivery of a suitcase that the authorities say contained the payment. He was then arrested.Mr. Temer\u2019s fate is now in the hands of Brazil\u2019s Congress. If two-thirds of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, votes to accept the corruption charges or any others that may be coming, and the Supreme Court agrees, he will be suspended for up to 180 days and put on trial.Analysts said he should have enough support in Congress to survive the vote \u2014 for now.Elections are looming next year, and many lawmakers are facing their own corruption investigations. They may well feel safer siding with the government, even one as shaky as Mr. Temer\u2019s, said Marcus Melo, a professor of political science at the Federal University of Pernambuco.\u201cHe is a lame duck, but incredible as it sounds, he can count on this base because they, too, are implicated in many things,\u201d Mr. Melo said.But if the prosecutor general does bring separate charges against Mr. Temer, each one will have to be voted on separately, said Roberto Dias, a professor of constitutional law at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cThe tendency is that each time there is an indictment offered, that the political support that Temer has will be reduced,\u201d he said.None of this bodes well for Mr. Temer\u2019s legislative agenda, an ambitious package of austerity measures that he says is needed to revive Brazil\u2019s economy.Financial markets regard the measures, which include an unpopular overhaul of Brazil\u2019s generous pension system, as crucial to restoring the country\u2019s battered fiscal credibility.So does Mr. Temer, as he made clear on Monday, before the widely anticipated charges were revealed. \u201cThere is no Plan B. We have to keep going,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing will destroy us. Not me nor our ministers.\u201d He has vehemently denied all of the accusations against him, and has often pointed out that Mr. Batista received a generous plea bargain in exchange for cooperating with prosecutors.Mr. Temer did not immediately comment on the charges. Yet the constant flow of allegations has made it difficult for the government to operate, let alone carry out far-reaching plans.Executives at JBS, a Batista company, testified that Mr. Temer had negotiated millions of dollars in illegal campaign donations for his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. In still another case, he faces scrutiny over claims that he negotiated a $40 million bribe for the party in 2010.But so far, Mr. Temer has been able to escape those and other allegations.Mr. Temer will need 172 federal deputies to either abstain from voting or vote against accepting the charge brought by Mr. Janot.Sylvio Costa, the founder of Congress in Focus, an independent monitoring site, said the president\u2019s support was weakening. He said it could be further compromised if there were more revelations, or any sign that Brazil\u2019s economy, which has been showing some faint signs of recovery, is stumbling again.Mr. Temer can count on around 200 to 250 of the 512 deputies in the lower house, compared with about 400 a year ago, Mr. Costa said.A poll released last weekend found that 7 percent of Brazilians approved of Mr. Temer\u2019s administration, 76 percent thought he should resign, and 47 percent felt ashamed to be Brazilian.Datafolha, the polling company, interviewed 2,771 people in 194 cities from June 21 to 23. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.A visit by Mr. Temer to Russia and Norway last week, intended to distract from his problems at home, seemed to highlight them instead.First, his itinerary announced that he would be visiting the Soviet Union. Then the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, told him that Brazil must address its corruption problem, and Norway halved its contribution to an Amazon rain forest fund because deforestation was increasing.Some lawmakers from the center-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party, a key partner in Mr. Temer\u2019s coalition, have already argued that they should leave the government. On Monday, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former president and elder statesman of the party, said in a newspaper column that Mr. Temer should make a \u201cgrand gesture\u201d and cut short his mandate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nordstrom to Explore Deal to Go Private as Retail Sector Reels", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byIn an industry reeling from bankruptcies, vacant storefronts and plummeting sales, Nordstrom is one of the few department store chains to show promise.The higher-end clothing retailer invested in its e-commerce business early on and was judicious about not opening too many new stores, avoiding many of the pitfalls that are driving other retailers to ruin.But even from a position of relative strength, Nordstrom is struggling to navigate a broad upending of the retail industry, as shopping malls lose their appeal and more customers choose to buy goods online.On Thursday, members of the family that founded Nordstrom in Seattle a century ago \u2014 and who still own a substantial portion of its shares \u2014 said they were exploring ways to shift the company into private ownership.The decision signals the Nordstrom family\u2019s commitment to its core retail business at a time when investors and lenders are deserting the industry in droves.It also reflects optimism that a private equity firm or a sovereign wealth fund would be willing to invest in a large retailer, after many major investors got burned in debt-fueled buyouts that went bust.\u201cNordstrom is the best of the breed,\u201d said David Shiffman, a managing director and a head of the retail group at Peter J. Solomon Company, an investment banking advisory firm. \u201cThis is not a laggard throwing in the towel.\u201dStill, considering going private is an acknowledgment that the public stock market is not a friendly place for companies needing to make costly changes as they compete with online giants like Amazon.By making such a move, Nordstrom would duck the glare of public shareholders and the pressure to constantly produce short-term profits.\u201cThis is a clear signal that the changes that retailers need to make are much more extensive and expensive than public shareholders have the appetite for,\u201d said Joel Bines, a managing director focused on retail at AlixPartners, an advisory firm.Traditional retailers are in a free fall, as physical stores fade as enjoyable, dynamic places to spend an afternoon. On Thursday, the Canadian company that owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor said it would cut 2,000 jobs.Department stores have tried to increase their focus on e-commerce, but many are still weighed down by costly real estate holdings they took on by moving into suburban malls across the United States during better times.How the retail industry evolves has big implications for the economy. The sector employs one in 10 Americans and occupies millions of square feet of commercial real estate.Nordstrom invested in online sales and marketing earlier than many of its peers, while proceeding carefully in opening new stores. The brand is also known for investing in customer service, as other retailers look to cut costs in unprofitable stores, said Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse.\u201cThey are a big exception,\u201d Mr. Buss said.Shares in Nordstrom were up 10 percent on Thursday on the news that a move to private ownership was being considered, giving the company a market value of $7.5 billion.Nordstrom shares had fallen 2.8 percent in the 12 months before that announcement \u2014 far less than other department stores\u2019 shares. But analysts complain that investors have lumped the company in with significantly troubled retailers, leaving its stock undervalued.That could be another motivation for finding a private partner.\u201cThe family is saying they have conviction in the business and see value far beyond where the street is willing to own the stock,\u201d Mr. Shiffman said.Nordstrom was co-founded by the Swedish immigrant John W. Nordstrom, who had moved out West and, eventually, to Alaska in search of gold. He settled in Seattle, where he teamed up with a shoemaker, Carl F. Wallin. They opened their first store in 1901.Members of the Nordstrom family have had the retail business in their blood from the start, and their name has left an indelible mark on Seattle. A medical office tower in the city bears the Nordstrom name, as do lecture and recital halls at Seattle\u2019s downtown art museum and symphony hall.In a city where fleece and T-shirts are more common among workers, employees at Nordstrom\u2019s downtown headquarters stand out for their chic attire, which they are encouraged to buy using employee discounts from the company\u2019s stores.Yet the Nordstroms\u2019 civic profile has been overshadowed to some degree by the area\u2019s newer business icons, including Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, whose company is expected to become the largest apparel retailer in the country this year.It seems unlikely that members of the Nordstrom family, who collectively own about 31 percent of the company\u2019s shares, could buy out the other shareholders without an investment partner like a private equity firm or a large pension fund.The company carries just $2.7 billion in long-term debt, far less proportionally than rivals like Neiman Marcus. That leaves plenty of room for the Nordstroms and any backers they line up to add more debt as part of a going-private deal. The company could also borrow against its real estate to help finance a transaction.The family members exploring the buyout are actively involved in managing the company. They include the co-presidents, Blake W. Nordstrom, Peter E. Nordstrom, and Erik B. Nordstrom; the president of stores, James F. Nordstrom Jr.; the chairman emeritus, Bruce A. Nordstrom; and Anne E. Gittinger.A Nordstrom spokeswoman declined to comment.Others have had a rougher time. TPG and Leonard Green teamed up with Millard S. Drexler, J. Crew\u2019s chief executive, to take the onetime fashion darling private again for about $3 billion.Other high-end department stores have not fared much better.Neiman Marcus, which has had two sets of private-equity owners in the past decade, planned to return to the public markets. But earlier this year, amid declining sales, it withdrew its plans to go public.Additional reporting by Nick Wingfield.Advertisement"}

That quest was delayed once again Thursday as the British authorities asked regulators to further examine whether the $15 billion deal would give the Murdoch family too much control over the country\u2019s media.The announcement was part of a split decision on the bid by Mr. Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox to take over the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own. While Mr. Murdoch and his family are likely to face increased pressure with a lengthy and potentially intrusive review by Britain\u2019s competition authority, they also dodged a regulatory bullet.\u201cIt\u2019s both good and bad news for 21st Century Fox,\u201d said Martin Moore, director of the Center for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King\u2019s College London.Mr. Moore added that the company would be more comfortable arguing its case to British regulators over questions of its control over parts of the media industry than on whether it should pass the \u201cfit and proper\u201d test.In a statement, 21st Century Fox welcomed the \u201cfit and proper\u201d decision, but said it was disappointed the British government still had reservations about its potential influence over the local media industry. It said that its takeover of Sky may now happen by June 2018.The company has until July 14 to respond before the government formally refers the deal to Britain\u2019s competition authority.Two politically independent regulators in Britain \u2014 the Office of Communications, or Ofcom; and the Competition and Markets Authority \u2014 began reviewing the proposed takeover, and attention quickly focused on whether the deal would limit consumer choice and whether 21st Century Fox executives met British broadcasting standards.Karen Bradley, the culture minister, said Thursday that the investigation into the proposed deal had raised questions about whether the takeover would give members of the Murdoch family too much influence.\u201cIt seems clear that there were significant failings of the corporate culture at Fox News,\u201d Ofcom said in the report. \u201cFox\u2019s response to the claims has been mixed. Some allegations were handled swiftly. But Fox was slower to deal with Bill O\u2019Reilly, its star anchor.\u201dOfcom also chastised the company for the language it used to describe employee misconduct, saying that it \u201ctended to downplay the harm caused\u201d and was \u201cunnecessarily pejorative.\u201d In one example, Ofcom pointed to a May meeting with Fox, in which it \u201cdescribed the continuum as going from \u2018appalling sexual harassment\u2019 to \u2018regular dirty old man talk.\u2019\u201d (Fox later told Ofcom that the phrase was not intended to diminish the allegations.)Mr. Ailes, who died last month, and Mr. O\u2019Reilly repeatedly denied the allegations against them.But despite scolding 21st Century Fox, Ofcom determined that the company was a \u201cfit and proper\u201d holder of British broadcasting rights. The regulator said it had found no evidence that the issues at Fox News had extended through 21st Century Fox, nor that any of the company\u2019s executives were aware of the misconduct before they were informed of it in July 2016, when Mr. Ailes was ousted.Ofcom said it would review its position if new information became available.One lawyer for some of the employees making sexual and racial harassment allegations rejected Ofcom\u2019s findings, saying that 21st Century Fox executives had known about the harassment before that date.The extended review into 21st Century Fox\u2019s offer comes at a difficult time for the British government, which must eventually decide whether to approve or reject the takeover.Prime Minister Theresa May was unable to win a majority in parliamentary elections this month, and politicians in Britain are focused on the beginning of negotiations to leave the European Union, leaving little time to consider the proposed takeover. Opposition lawmakers, and some inside Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party, have balked at the deal.21st Century Fox\u2019s attempt to buy Sky is part of the company\u2019s efforts to keep pace with digital rivals like Netflix and Amazon, which have used their streaming services to win over consumers increasingly accustomed to watching movies and television shows on mobile devices.The acquisition of Sky, experts say, would give 21st Century Fox not only a pan-European satellite network and rights to content including English Premier League broadcasts, but also control of Now TV, Sky\u2019s online streaming service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With \u20181984\u2019 on Broadway, Thoughtcrime Hits the Big Time", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "Supported byA British adaptation of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d first staged in 2013, had three successful runs in the West End and national and international tours, including stops in Boston, Los Angeles and Washington. There was talk of bringing it to New York, but no sense of urgency.Duncan Macmillan, who wrote and directed the show with Robert Icke, sent a text to one of his producers reading simply \u201c84 NY?\u201d Within two weeks, a run at the Hudson Theater, where it officially opens on Thursday, June 22, was announced.\u201cI think the feeling was, we have to do it now,\u201d Mr. Macmillan recalled recently. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll miss our chance.\u201dThe production \u2014 which stars Tom Sturridge as Winston Smith, the Everyman who rebels against Big Brother, and Olivia Wilde as Julia, the fellow party member with whom he has a forbidden affair \u2014 may be arriving on Broadway at a ripe, perhaps even overripe, moment.But if their adaptation \u2014 which has not been revised to refer in any way to Mr. Trump \u2014 is designed to resist anything, its creators insist, it\u2019s overly self-certain interpretations.\u201cOur job is to keep the issues open, rather than reducing everything to simple meaning,\u201d Mr. Icke said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we worked really hard on four years ago, and that balance stays exactly the same.\u201dThe production matches Orwell\u2019s suddenly hot 68-year-old book with two rising stars of the British theater, both of whom came of age well after the year of its prophetic title.Their collaboration on \u201c1984\u201d began in 2013, when Mr. Icke was looking for a show based on a nontheatrical text to fill out a season at the Headlong Theater, the company for which he was associate director. Scanning his bookshelf, he settled on Orwell\u2019s novel, for reasons he is hard pressed to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like falling in love,\u201d he said. \u201cYou only rationalize it afterward.\u201dHe enlisted Mr. Macmillan, who hadn\u2019t read the book since he was a teenager. \u201cIt\u2019s much stranger than I remembered,\u201d Mr. Macmillan said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost David Lynchian in its osmotic passing through different realities.\u201dThe show, which features a large projection screen, weaves the story of Winston\u2019s rebellion with scenes from his memory and dreams, and scenes of a group of readers, seemingly in the present, discussing whether they can believe the novel they \u2014 and we \u2014 are reading.The appendix \u201cis a really radical gesture against the rest of the book,\u201d Mr. Macmillan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a book about how you can\u2019t trust the written word.\u201dMr. Macmillan and Mr. Icke hardly discount the more immediate political resonances that audiences bring into the theater. The original staging, at the Nottingham Playhouse in 2013, came just after Edward J. Snowden\u2019s revelations about the National Security Agency surveillance, and after an off-duty British soldier was hacked to death on a southeast London street. (The show, Mr. Icke notes, is also about \u201cthe radicalization of a terrorist.\u201d)The first New York preview, Mr. Macmillan said, was the day a man deliberately drove a car onto a sidewalk in Times Square, killing one person and injuring 22. Since then, he said, summing up the daily news drip, there have been the Manchester bombing in Britain, Mr. Trump\u2019s cryptic \u201ccovfefe tweet\u201d and the announced American withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, all of which, he said, have \u201cinfected\u201d the audience in different ways.People may come in thinking about politics, but the creators hope people will leave also thinking about what it means to trust \u201cthe evidence of your eyes and ears,\u201d in the novel\u2019s famous phrase, when so much of what we know is filtered through screens and texts of our own choosing.\u201cWe\u2019re all contradictory, double-thinking creatures,\u201d Mr. Macmillan said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confirmation bias in reading this novel. We like to think of it as much simpler than it is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Vision of Computing\u2019s Future: An Information Appliance", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn the late 1970s, Jef Raskin, a pioneering technologist who was one of Apple\u2019s earliest employees, sketched out a radical vision for the future of computing.But now, all of a sudden, Mr. Raskin\u2019s information appliance is here, sitting on my kitchen counter.But these are quibbles. The Echo Show is a remarkable machine, not just for what it is now but for the way it clarifies Amazon\u2019s vision of the future of computing. It\u2019s becoming the model for a new kind of communal, household computer \u2014 a resurrection of Mr. Raskin\u2019s idea of an information appliance, as opposed to Mr. Jobs\u2019s vision of an all-purpose PC.One measure of the power of this vision is how quickly Amazon\u2019s rivals are racing to copy it; both Apple and Google have their own takes on the Echo.It\u2019s questionable how far these rivals will get. Amazon\u2019s business model, which depends on millions of households buying millions of goods, is uniquely suited to selling Echos at low prices, because Amazon is certain it can make money on the device from extra Amazon purchases. (The lowest-priced Echo, the Dot, sells for $50; the new Show, available to the public starting Wednesday, sells for $230, but you get $100 off if you buy two.)I suspect you\u2019re scoffing. The primary knock on Mr. Raskin\u2019s information appliance was that it didn\u2019t do a whole lot. This is also the main criticism of the Echo and, now, the Echo Show. These devices can\u2019t do anything you can\u2019t do on your phone, PC or tablet.That\u2019s true, but it also kind of misses the point. You can make toast in the oven, but you have a toaster because it\u2019s designed to perform a specific task reliably and without any fuss.That\u2019s the point of the information appliance, too. There\u2019s a whole lot the Echo Show won\u2019t do. It won\u2019t do email. It won\u2019t do the web. It won\u2019t play first-person shooters. It is emphatically, purposely not a general-purpose computer. But what it does do \u2014 play music and videos, make video calls, tell you the news, tell you the time and weather, and shop at Amazon \u2014 it does with such surpassing ease that it feels like a magic trick.There are a few reasons for that. One is the Show\u2019s unusual and quietly innovative interface.Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, told me that when the company was first designing the Show, it tried to use the same interface that it used for its tablet computers. But the team soon realized this didn\u2019t work. For one thing, the Echo Show is designed to be used just with your voice \u2014 the screen adds extra information, but you have to look at it only when you specifically ask for visual information (such as when you want a video). A standard mobile operating system, which is heavily visual, just wouldn\u2019t work.Another reason a tablet interface wouldn\u2019t have worked is that it felt too much like a computer, and one overriding design goal of the Echo and the Echo Show was to hide any relationship to anything computerlike.The Show\u2019s operating system, memory, storage and other specifications are completely hidden from users. The Echo does have a version of apps, known as \u201cskills,\u201d but they aren\u2019t anything like smartphone apps. You install them just by asking Alexa to enable them, and when you want to use one, you just name it. To watch a video, you just ask for the video \u2014 you don\u2019t load up a web browser or the YouTube app and then search for it.\u201cIt\u2019s a very different mental model than the traditional computer, smartphone or tablet, where you have to think of which app you want to use and then open it and then dive in,\u201d Mr. Limp wrote in an email.The Echo Show has one other advantage over smartphones and tablets: It\u2019s always there in the same spot.Your phone and tablet move around the house. Often they are nearby, but sometimes they aren\u2019t. That uncertainty makes them less useful for the kind of ambient computing tasks the Echo is good at. When you are in the kitchen and need to look up a recipe, you could find your iPad to call it up. But the Echo Show is always there, so you and everyone else at home come to rely on it \u2014 you know that when you call out for it, it will always answer.Such communal, stationary devices are not unusual in our homes. All the appliances are stationary and communal, from the fridge to the washing machine. We also have some appliances whose sole purpose is to provide us with information and entertainment \u2014 bedside clocks and TVs, for instance. Mr. Limp said these informational appliances provided a \u201cmental model\u201d for the Show\u2019s design, which got me thinking about the expansiveness of Amazon\u2019s ambitions here.The Show has a seven-inch screen. There\u2019s no reason the screen could not be slightly bigger \u2014 an iPad-size one that clings to your bathroom mirror, for instance. Or it could be much, much bigger.In fact, let me go out on a limb: Within a couple of years, I bet Amazon will make its own TV that will work just like the Echo Show. Because if you are trying to create the perfect home appliance, there is no better target than the biggest screen in the house.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Easy Money Is Drying Up, and Markets Tremble", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byIt could be time for markets to come down from their sugar highs.After years of injecting trillions of dollars into their economies in an effort to encourage growth, central bankers have become more forthright in signaling an end to easy-money policies.What started as tremors in European government bonds after a speech on Tuesday by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, had spread to global stocks by Thursday.Mr. Draghi called for prudence in policy, and investors seemed to interpret that as a step back from the bank\u2019s commitment to buying European government bonds. Central bank officials were quick to point out that Mr. Draghi did not say that he would tighten policy immediately. But investors apparently ignored that.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, also indicated on Tuesday that an increase in rates might be in order.Those signals have prompted speculation that central bankers may be coordinating efforts to warn investors who benefited from the liquidity boom.Indeed, officials from the Federal Reserve have been saying for several weeks that financial markets were overheated.Investors are also keeping a close eye on the \u201cFaang\u201d stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which dropped briefly in early June. Those stocks account for a disproportionate percentage of market gains, and they are getting more expensive. A sustained fall could also lead to a bear market.Those jumps promised some notable benefits:\u2022 Investors get a bump in their dividends;\u2022 Executives could see their pay packages swell;\u2022 The big institutions might have more flexibility to lend, which could promote more long-term growth.Critics worry, however, that less regulatory pressure could set the stage for a return to the bad old days of enormous leverage and freewheeling.Instead, Rite Aid will sell 2,186 of its 4,600 stores to Walgreens, along with three distribution centers, for $5.18 billion. The announcement sent Rite Aid shares tumbling.The resistance was not unexpected \u2014 the companies\u2019 original $9.3 billion deal would have created a group with more outlets than CVS Health, the biggest drugstore chain by market capitalization in the United States.In spite of hopes that antitrust regulation would ease under President Trump, several deals, including in the health care sector, have been derailed this year.The British authorities have asked regulators to further examine a $15 billion bid by 21st Century Fox to take over the 61 percent of Sky, the European satellite giant, that it does not already own.Rupert Murdoch and his family will now face a review by Britain\u2019s competition authority, but they have dodged a regulatory bullet.

{"Headline": "Amazon to Buy Whole Foods for $13.4 Billion", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byThe acquisition, announced Friday, is a reflection of both the sheer magnitude of the grocery business \u2014 about $800 billion in annual spending in the United States \u2014 and a desire to turn Amazon into a more frequent shopping habit by becoming a bigger player in food and beverages. After almost a decade selling groceries online, Amazon has failed to make a major dent on its own as consumers have shown a stubborn urge to buy items like fruits, vegetables and meat in person.\u201cMake no mistake, Walmart under no circumstances can lose the grocery wars to Amazon,\u201d said Brittain Ladd, a strategy and supply chain consultant who formerly worked with Amazon on its grocery business. \u201cIf Walmart loses the grocery battle to Amazon, they have no chance of ever dethroning Amazon as the largest e-commerce player in the world.\u201dThe company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.The addition of Whole Foods takes Amazon\u2019s physical presence to a new level. The grocery chain includes more than 460 stores in the United States, Canada and Britain with sales of $16 billion in the last fiscal year. Mikey Vu, a partner at the consultancy Bain & Company who is focused on retail, said, \u201cThey\u2019re going to be within an hour or 30 minutes of as many people as possible.\u201dAmazon has been on a multiyear offensive to open warehouses closer to customers so it can deliver orders in as little as two hours, and Whole Foods stores will further narrow Amazon\u2019s physical proximity to its shoppers. The stores could become locations for returning online orders of all kinds. Amazon could also use them to cut delivery times for online orders.The $13.4 billion deal, which does not include net debt, immediately raised questions about whether Amazon\u2019s experiments with automation, like the cashier-less checkout technology it is testing in its Amazon Go store, could eventually lead to job losses at Whole Foods stores.\u201cAmazon\u2019s brutal vision for retail is one where automation replaces good jobs,\u201d Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said in a statement. \u201cThat is the reality today at Amazon, and it will no doubt become the reality at Whole Foods.\u201dDrew Herdener, a spokesman for Amazon, said it has no plans to use the Amazon Go technology to automate the jobs of cashiers at Whole Foods and no job reductions are planned as a result of the deal. Whole Foods workers are not unionized.The move to buy Whole Foods is a further sign of the outsize ambitions of Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive and founder, who came under fire from Donald J. Trump during the presidential campaign last year, when Mr. Trump said Mr. Bezos had a \u201chuge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201dNicole Navas Oxman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined to comment about whether its antitrust division saw any issues with the proposed acquisition. Law professors who specialize in antitrust said it was unlikely regulators would block the deal.If the deal goes through, Amazon and Whole Foods will still only account for about 3.5 percent of grocery spending in the United States, making it the country\u2019s fifth-largest grocery retailer, according to estimates by John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Company.Groceries are purchased five times a month on average by shoppers, compared with the four times a month Amazon Prime customers typically shop on the site and two times for people who do not have Prime memberships, Cowen estimates.\u201cIf you open up groceries, it could increase the frequency,\u201d Mr. Blackledge said.Investors are betting there may be other buyers interested in Whole Foods, and by late Friday the company\u2019s shares rose above Amazon\u2019s $42 a share offer, nearly 30 percent higher for the day. Amazon closed at $987.71 a share, up 2.4 percent.Even with the bigger physical presence Amazon will gain through Whole Foods, it will have far less reach than Walmart and its Sam\u2019s Club warehouse chain, which together account for about 18 percent of the grocery market. Walmart has almost 10 times the number of stores as Whole Foods does.An earlier version of this article misstated the annual sales in the United States in the grocery industry. The sales are $700 billion to $800 billion, not $700 million to $800 million.Amie Tsang and Charlie Savage contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why France Is Taking a Lesson in Culture From Silicon Valley", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byA new start-up incubator in Paris symbolizes France\u2019s tech ambitions, but can the land of the 35-hour workweek overcome its cultural and regulatory barriers to surpass London and other tech hubs? PARIS \u2014 One thousand start-ups in a refurbished train depot as long as the Eiffel Tower lying down. Rooms scattered with Legos and beanbag chairs. Elevated walkways bridging cargo-container offices and open-air desks. Graffitied railway cars transformed into cafes. The vast project in the heart of Paris, Station F, is a symbol of France\u2019s ambitions to be the start-up capital of Europe. Under an arc of glass and curved concrete, it aims to amass the largest group of entrepreneurs, venture capital firms, incubators and accelerators anywhere in the world.The ambitious effort would seem an expensive, even quixotic undertaking for France, a country better known for a 35-hour workweek and rigid labor laws. And plenty of countries are trying to emulate Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem, with varying degrees of success. Mr. Niel sees Station F as a way to help France steal Britain\u2019s crown as Europe\u2019s premier start-up hub. Raised in a gritty suburb of Paris, he is also trying to empower would-be entrepreneurs, especially marginalized youths. And he wants to capitalize on France\u2019s strength as a producer of math and engineering whizzes. \u201cWhen people talk about France, they don\u2019t see it as a small-league player anymore.\u201dTo get into Station F, start-ups had to have a business prototype and a path to growth. A group of 1,000 companies are expected to move into the space by early July. Here are three of them.Artificial intelligenceFood techHigh-tech fabricsTech leaders say France has significant potential. In 2016, French start-ups attracted record levels of investment from business angels, venture capital, growth equity funds and corporate investors \u2014 on par with Israel and in reach of Britain. Back then, the French start-up culture was virtually nonexistent. There was no ecosystem of incubators and funding. He and his co-founders relied on money from family and friends for six years before venture capital funds stepped in.Today, BlaBlaCar is one of four French \u201cunicorns\u201d (start-ups valued over $1 billion), with 45 million users in 22 countries and a global staff of 500. In France, \u201centrepreneurs used to be seen as people with nothing left to lose,\u201d said Mr. Mazzella, sitting in his company\u2019s sleek new headquarters near the Paris Bourse, a couple of floors down from Facebook\u2019s France operations. \u201cNow it\u2019s become acceptable, even desirable, to be a start-up.\u201d Failure is often stigmatized in French society \u2014 so much that the government started a campaign to persuade people that it\u2019s O.K. to take risks. More than three quarters of workers hold so-called jobs for life, and unions protest when businesses demand workplace flexibility. Taxes are high to fund France\u2019s social welfare system, and the 3,400-page labor code introduces new regulatory requirements on companies as they get larger.It is a culture sometimes at odds with entrepreneurial drive. But Mr. Oumnia has struggled to scale up. When he wanted to offer stock options to lure and retain engineers and designers, the French rules were so complex that he dropped the plan. Social\u00a0taxes pushed his employee costs to nearly twice what they would be in the United States.\u00a0The financial infrastructure isn\u2019t fully developed, either. France has around 4,500 angels, investors who take risks on first-stage start-ups, compared with 18,000 in Britain. While more venture capital is flowing into France, the levels still lag Britain, Germany and Israel.\u201cFrance has plenty of talent to create start-ups,\u201d Mr. Oumnia said. \u201cThe problem is to grow them to midsize companies that create jobs in a country where unemployment is high.\u201d \u201cRegulations and taxes have still not evolved enough to allow start-ups to flourish once they get off the ground,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped President Macron would change things. \u201cSo it\u2019s fine to say, let\u2019s create a thousand start-ups. The question is, \u2018Are you creating the environment for them to become champions after?\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u201cThe answer is, \u2018Not yet.\u2019\u201d The biggest vote of confidence in Station F is from Facebook. An earlier version of this article misstated the role of Roxanne Varza in the nonprofit Girls in Tech. She is the former managing director of Girls in Tech Paris, a chapter of the nonprofit.

{"Headline": "Women in Tech Speak Frankly on Culture of Harassment", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byTheir stories came out slowly, even hesitantly, at first. Then in a rush.One female entrepreneur recounted how she had been propositioned by a Silicon Valley venture capitalist while seeking a job with him, which she did not land after rebuffing him. Another showed the increasingly suggestive messages she had received from a start-up investor. And one chief executive described how she had faced numerous sexist comments from an investor while raising money for her online community website.What happened afterward was often just as disturbing, the women told The New York Times. Many times, the investors\u2019 firms and colleagues ignored or played down what had happened when the situations were brought to their attention. Saying anything, the women were warned, might lead to ostracism.Now some of these female entrepreneurs have decided to take that risk. More than two dozen women in the technology start-up industry spoke to The Times in recent days about being sexually harassed. Ten of them named the investors involved, often providing corroborating messages and emails, and pointed to high-profile venture capitalists such as Chris Sacca of Lowercase Capital and Dave McClure of 500 Startups.Most recently, the revelations about Mr. Caldbeck of Binary Capital have triggered an outcry. The investor has been accused of sexually harassing entrepreneurs while he worked at three different venture firms in the past seven years, often in meetings in which the women were presenting their companies to him.The chain of events has emboldened more women to talk publicly about the treatment they said they had endured from tech investors.The women\u2019s experiences help explain why the venture capital and start-up ecosystem \u2014 which underpins the tech industry and has spawned companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 has been so lopsided in terms of gender.Most venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are men, with female entrepreneurs receiving $1.5 billion in funding last year versus $58.2 billion for men, according to the data firm PitchBook. Many of the investors hold outsize power, since entrepreneurs need their money to turn ideas and innovations into a business. And because the venture industry operates with few disclosure requirements, people have kept silent about investors who cross the lines with entrepreneurs.Some of the entrepreneurs who spoke with The Times said they were often touched without permission by investors or advisers.At a mostly male tech gathering in Las Vegas in 2009, Susan Wu, an entrepreneur and investor, said that Mr. Sacca, an investor and former Google executive, touched her face without her consent in a way that made her uncomfortable. Ms. Wu said she was also propositioned by Mr. Caldbeck while fund-raising in 2010 and worked hard to avoid him later when they crossed paths.\u201cThere is such a massive imbalance of power that women in the industry often end up in distressing situations,\u201d Ms. Wu said.After the publication of this article, Mr. Sacca contacted The Times again to amend his original statement, adding: \u201cI dispute Susan\u2019s account from 2009.\u201dMany of the women also said they believed they had limited ability to push back against inappropriate behavior, often because they needed funding, a job or other help.In 2014, Sarah Kunst, 31, an entrepreneur, said she discussed a potential job at 500 Startups, a start-up incubator in San Francisco. During the recruiting process, Mr. McClure, a founder of 500 Startups and an investor, sent her a Facebook message that read in part, \u201cI was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.\u201dMs. Kunst, who now runs a fitness start-up, said she declined Mr. McClure\u2019s advance. When she later discussed the message with one of Mr. McClure\u2019s colleagues, she said 500 Startups ended its conversations with her.500 Startups said Mr. McClure, who did not respond to a request for comment, was no longer in charge of day-to-day operations after an internal investigation.\u201cAfter being made aware of instances of Dave having inappropriate behavior with women in the tech community, we have been making changes internally,\u201d 500 Startups said. \u201cHe recognizes he has made mistakes and has been going through counseling to work on addressing changes in his previous unacceptable behavior.\u201dThey put up with the comments, Ms. Renock said, because they \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine a world in which that $500,000 wasn\u2019t on the table anymore.\u201d Ms. Renock declined to name the investor. Wethos raised the $500,000 from someone else and is still fund-raising.Wendy Dent, 43, whose company Cinemmerse makes an app for smart watches, said she was sent increasingly flirtatious messages by a start-up adviser, Marc Canter, as she was trying to start her company in 2014. Mr. Canter, who had founded a software company in the 1980s that became known as Macromedia, initially agreed to help her find a co-founder. But over time, his messages became sexual in nature.In one message, reviewed by The Times, he wrote that she was a \u201csorceress casting a spell.\u201d In another, he commented on how she looked in a blue dress and added, \u201cKnow what I\u2019m thinking? Why am I sending you this \u2014 in private?\u201dMr. Canter, in an interview, said that Ms. Dent \u201ccame on strong to me, asking for help\u201d and that she had used her sexuality publicly. He said he disliked her ideas so he behaved the way he did to make her go away.Some entrepreneurs were asked to not speak about the behavior they experienced.At a start-up competition in 2014 in San Francisco, Lisa Curtis, an entrepreneur, pitched her food start-up, Kuli Kuli, and was told her idea had won the most plaudits from the audience, opening the door to possible investment. As she stepped off the stage, an investor named Jose De Dios, said, \u201cOf course you won. You\u2019re a total babe.\u201dMs. Curtis later posted on Facebook about the exchange and got a call from a different investor. He said \u201cthat if I didn\u2019t take down the post, no one in Silicon Valley would give me money again,\u201d she said. Ms. Curtis deleted the post.In a statement, Mr. De Dios said he \u201cunequivocally did not make a defamatory remark.\u201dLindsay Meyer, an entrepreneur in San Francisco, said Mr. Caldbeck put $25,000 of his own money into her fitness start-up in 2015. That gave Mr. Caldbeck reason to constantly text her; in those messages, reviewed by The Times, he asked if she was attracted to him and why she would rather be with her boyfriend than him. At times, he groped and kissed her, she said.\u201cI felt like I had to tolerate it because this is the cost of being a nonwhite female founder,\u201d said Ms. Meyer, who is Asian-American.But even after she reached out to a mentor, who alerted one of Binary\u2019s investors, Legacy Venture, to Mr. Caldbeck\u2019s actions, little changed. Legacy went on to invest in Binary\u2019s new fund. Binary and Mr. Caldbeck declined to comment.\u201cWe failed to follow up on information about Mr. Caldbeck\u2019s personal behavior,\u201d Legacy said in a statement. \u201cWe regret this oversight and are determined to do better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But as organic foods grew in popularity, Whole Foods was squeezed by lower-cost grocery rivals.1978: Born in AustinMr. Mackey, 25, co-founded Safer Way Natural Foods, a 2,000-square-foot store in Austin, Tex., with his then girlfriend.1980: First Whole Foods MarketMr. Mackey joined his rival Clarksville Natural Grocery to open the first Whole Foods Market, with 19 employees. A year later, the store was nearly destroyed in a flood. It reopened within a month thanks to the rebuilding efforts of employees and Austin residents.1984: Expansion BeginsThe company\u2019s expansion began with the opening of a store in Houston. Within a year, Whole Foods Market had about 600 workers.1988: Beyond the Lone Star StateWhole Foods Market expanded outside of Texas with the acquisition of the similarly named Whole Food Company of New Orleans. It was the company\u2019s sixth store. Whole Foods\u2019s early growth came largely from mergers and acquisitions.1992: From Austin to Wall StreetNow operating 12 stores in Texas, California, North Carolina and Louisiana, Whole Foods Market went public. The prospectus stated that \u201ca significant segment of the population now attributes added value to high quality natural food.\u201dLater that year, the company expanded into the Northeast with the purchase of the Boston-based supermarket chain Bread and Circus.1996: From Hippie to Hip Capitalist1997: Whole Foods, Whole PaycheckWhole Foods started its store brand, 365 Everyday Value. The private label was later used to combat the perception that Whole Foods, sometimes known as \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d for its notoriously high prices, was too expensive for everyday people.2002: Fighting Unions2004: Manhattan\u2019s Largest SupermarketWhole Foods, which already operated a 40,000-square-foot store in Chelsea, opened its flagship 58,000-square-foot store in the basement of the Time Warner Center.

The F.T.C. discovered that Mr. Mackey had used a pseudonym to write anonymous blog posts attacking Wild Oats. \u201cThe end game is now under way for OATS,\u201d Mr. Mackey wrote in one. \u201cWhole Foods is systematically destroying their viability as a business market by market, city by city.\u201d Two years later, Whole Foods agreed to sell 13 stores to resolve the complaint.2008: Selling a Stake to a Private InvestorSqueezed by the financial crisis and traditional grocery stores, Whole Foods stock plummeted 76 percent in one year. The company sold a 17 percent stake to Green Equity Investors, an affiliate of Los Angeles-based private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners.2009: Obamacare and a BoycottMr. Mackey wrote an Op-Ed in The Wall Street Journal quoting Margaret Thatcher and arguing that \u201cthe last thing our country needs is a massive new health care entitlement.\u201d His company\u2019s liberal-minded customers responded with a boycott.2013: The G.M.O.

{"Headline": "A Street Fight Among Grocers to Deliver Your Milk, Eggs, Bananas", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "Supported byEvery couple of days, Sinclair Browne fights through traffic in Times Square, squeezes his delivery truck into a parking spot, walks up four flights of stairs and delivers groceries to a guy whose order he knows by heart.\u201cI\u2019m fast,\u201d said Mr. Browne, slicing his hands in the air, ninja style. \u201cIn and out, in and out.\u201dDelivering food requires military precision: Bananas can\u2019t get cold. Produce can\u2019t get warm. Eggs, of course, must not get broken. And people expect their food to arrive at specific times.Mr. Browne, 40, is a driver for the online grocery business Peapod. He plays the most important role in solving the biggest problem vexing the online grocery industry: moving food, undamaged and unspoiled, from the warehouse to the customer\u2019s house. It\u2019s known as the last-mile problem.Delivering perishables is much trickier than delivering T-shirts, books or pretty much anything else people can buy online. The biggest challenge is that groceries must stay cold for hours at a time. But there are myriad other complications, too. Bananas and apples give off fumes that can hurt loose leaf lettuce, so they can\u2019t be stored too close. Tomatoes lose flavor when they cool to below 55 degrees. Milk always has to be packaged upright.All the complexity adds costs in an industry where profit margins are already thin. Few businesses have attempted these kinds of gastronomic acrobatics on a large scale, and numerous start-ups have failed trying, making groceries the last frontier of online shopping.Even Amazon, which built a multi-billion-dollar business by perfecting its delivery logistics, hasn\u2019t quite mastered the art of profitably delivering perishable food in big metropolitan areas. But it just made a big bet, purchasing Whole Foods in a $13.4 billion deal that will give it access to more than 400 stores concentrated around major population centers \u2014 places that may have walk-up apartments, aggressive taxi drivers and other urban obstacles that Mr. Browne navigates five days a week.Amazon\u2019s deal sets up a face-off with Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest grocery store. Walmart itself is struggling to become as dominant in the virtual world as it is in the physical one.As the competition heats up, Amazon and others will be relying on drivers like Mr. Browne, who makes $13 an hour, plus tips, to handle the biggest challenges of succeeding in the online grocery business.\u201cWhat\u2019s up, boss?\u201d Mr. Browne greets the doorman at his first building, who tells him he\u2019ll need to take his cart to the service entrance. He takes the elevator down one flight, but it\u2019s the wrong entrance.He tries another floor. No go.When he asks for directions, the man working at the service entrance yells at him: \u201cYou don\u2019t know, you should tell me you don\u2019t know!\u201dBut rudeness, Mr. Browne says, is just one of the things he has to deal with. He\u2019s still got to get in and out, in and out. Nineteen stops to go.Every second counts. Grocery delivery companies like Peapod have to calculate exactly how long each individual order will take, and monitor traffic patterns and car accidents for any disruptions. Mr. Browne gets alerts on his phone; on Sunday, he\u2019ll have to avoid crossing Fifth Avenue, because of the Pride parade.Today, some of his orders are allotted 10 minutes, others 12. Urban areas tend to take longer per stop: 12 to 20 minutes on average, compared with eight to 14 minutes in the suburbs, where Mr. Browne can pull right up to people\u2019s homes.For all 20 of his orders on this day, Peapod has allotted nine hours and 20 minutes. Mr. Browne thinks he can do them all in eight.\u201cThe first guy slowed me up by having to go through the loading dock. I never really went through there before,\u201d Mr. Browne says as he drives to the next stop. \u201cUsually I\u2019d be in and out of that building.\u201dHis truck was loaded at Peapod\u2019s warehouse in Jersey City, a massive 400,000-square-foot facility that services New York and New Jersey. About 425 people bustle in and out of the meat room, the produce room, a rotisserie room filled with dozens of rotating chickens. Workers wearing thick freezer suits retrieve frozen foods from the coldest room, loading items into bright green temperature-controlled bins that workers refer to as \u201ctotes.\u201dAnyone who has shopped for groceries online has probably thought to themselves something like, \u201cWho will be squeezing my tomatoes, and will I get the good ones this time, or not?\u201d That\u2019s why, despite the vastness of the industrial automation here \u2014 there are about 7 miles of conveyor belts in Peapod\u2019s warehouse \u2014 people like Amal Afifi are important. As she loads the totes, Ms. Afifi personally inspects some of the 14 million bananas Peapod sells each year.Her guidelines are relatively simple: Trust your gut. Literally.\u201cI shop for customers like I shop for myself,\u201d Ms. Afifi said, pointing to a box of unappetizing-looking, reject bananas. They may get donated to a local zoo, where the animals are less picky than people are about bruised fruit and smushed bread.Once perishable items make it into the tote, the clock starts ticking. Keeping food cold until it gets to customers is the single most difficult and important thing about delivering groceries. There are many opportunities for things to go wrong.For all the impersonal convenience that online shopping brings \u2014 no crowds, or lines, or chatty cashiers \u2014 no company has figured out how to automate away the care that a live human like Mr. Browne needs to show toward the food.Carrying a box of sodas and two bags of cold food, he walks into the lobby of a building about halfway through his shift. The doorman tells him to leave the order, but he refuses. What if the doorman forgets about it, and the fruit stays out for hours?Peapod has 19 to 21 hours to get totes to customers, and everything has to stay at the right temperature that whole time. If you break the cold chain on the way to a customer\u2019s refrigerator, Mr. Stallone said, even the healthiest-looking berries could rot too quickly.That potentially undermines one of the main selling points of delivery: the convenience. \u201cIf you have a bad apple or a spoiled gallon of milk or broken eggs, we suddenly become inconvenient,\u201d he said.Mr. Browne goes around to the service entrance instead, where two maintenance men tell him that he can\u2019t use the elevator because they\u2019re doing repairs.\u201cI can\u2019t leave it with just anybody,\u201d he says, and doesn\u2019t agree to leave until one of the men offers to bring it up to the customer.\u201cYou\u2019ll do it right now?\u201d he asks. \u201cO.K.\u201dNot every item needs to be cold. In fact, a temperature below 58 degrees will destroy the bananas that Ms. Afifi picked out.FreshDirect, one of Peapod\u2019s competitors, wraps its bananas in little sleeves to keep them warm. (FreshDirect cools its entire trucks, while Peapod relies on dry ice, gel packs and other methods of controlling the temperature in each individual tote.)\u201cWhen it leaves the store, when it leaves the warehouse to get to you, that\u2019s the issue,\u201d said Phil Lempert, a grocery retailing expert. \u201cThey can estimate within seconds of how long it takes to get from the truck to your house for a delivery.\u201dMr. Browne knows which doormen will let him use the bathroom, which customers tip well and which buildings will force him to use the service entrance, even if he\u2019s only carrying a couple of bags.Delivering perishable groceries is still largely an urban business, where logistics can be a nightmare. There are fewer places to park, more steps to climb and more garage doors to accidentally block. Mail carriers have offered some lessons for Peapod\u2019s competition; FreshDirect, for example, copies the UPS model of parking in one spot all day, and using multiple people to make multiple deliveries at a time.On his way into one building, Mr. Browne passes a cart full of FreshDirect groceries on the sidewalk.Unlike FreshDirect deliverymen, Mr. Browne works alone in his truck, and he has to move it for each delivery. Parking tickets are a cost of doing business, and Peapod even has a line item on the budget for fines and tolls. But moving around in a dense urban area has other challenges.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of traffic, real tight spaces, a lot of people, people will just cross right in front of the truck sometimes,\u201d Mr. Browne says. \u201cWorking in the city is very difficult, that\u2019s why they say it\u2019s not for everyone.\u201dAs he drives, Mr. Browne scans the road for buses, cabs, pedestrians and even horses. Peapod drivers get a couple of hours of defensive driving training, and Mr. Browne keeps an eye on a camera that shows what\u2019s happening directly behind him. That helps him spot skateboarders who sometimes try to catch a free ride by grabbing his bumper.\u201cThat\u2019s dangerous, because if I turn,\u201d he said, \u201cthat guy is basically dead.\u201dOnce he makes it through Times Square, things get a little easier. Today he\u2019s mostly going to residential buildings with elevators, where people tend to tip better, inexplicably, than people who live in walk-ups.\u201cYou have some customers where they have an elevator, they have a doorman, and they could have three bags, give you $20,\u201d says Mr. Browne, who has been working overtime to save up for a birthday party for one of his three children. \u201cI say, \u2018Thank you, this goes to my daughter\u2019s sweet 16.\u2019\u201dMr. Browne likes interacting with customers. He has families, college students, older people who he feels he\u2019s helping, because they can\u2019t easily shop for themselves. There\u2019s the woman who lives directly above a grocery store, but still orders online. There\u2019s the man who orders Froot Loops or cold cuts every couple of days, the woman who tips $20 every time.Today, he\u2019ll deliver to a couple of college students who must meet the truck outside. For security reasons, their dorm won\u2019t let delivery drivers upstairs.Younger people are especially important to grocery delivery companies. Millennials and Generation Y make up about a quarter of Peapod\u2019s customers, but in a few years those young people will likely begin spending more money on food; maybe they\u2019ll have families, or get a pet, or start making a little more money.They have grown up in an environment where everything is available online, and digital grocers want to get them hooked early. Peapod, for example, has added more organic, international and bulk items to its offerings, because those products tend to be popular among its younger customers.Generation X makes up about half of Peapod\u2019s customers, and the remaining 25 percent are older. In total, Peapod\u2019s customers are fairly evenly divided between the city and the suburbs, where Mr. Browne prefers to work. There are no horses or walk-ups, and he doesn\u2019t need to walk past the garbage at a service entrance.Though the distances are longer, non-metro areas tend to be cheaper places for Peapod to work, according to Ken Fanaro, the company\u2019s senior director of transportation planning and development. Fuel efficiency is better, and there are fewer parking tickets and tolls. But because customers are farther away and more widely spaced, drivers can do fewer orders per shift. (Tips, however, tend to be better outside the most densely populated areas, Mr. Browne says. One time he went to Staten Island \u2014 part of New York City, but largely suburban in layout \u2014 and made $200 over two days.)\u201cEvery day, you\u2019re coming home with money,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a job like that before.\u201dAbout half of Mr. Browne\u2019s customers today chose to tip him online when they placed their orders. Some will tip him in cash. Some, like the college students, won\u2019t tip at all. Today, the man in the fourth-floor walk-up who orders every couple of days tips Mr. Browne for the first time, giving him $3.\u201cWhat\u2019s up, boss?\u201d Mr. Browne says to the man at the top of the stairs, slightly out of breath.Mr. Browne has lost 15 pounds since he started this job about a year and a half ago. Today he is carrying a gallon of milk, laundry detergent and a couple of bags with his left arm, and holds a carton of eggs in his right hand. He tries to do everything in one trip, if he can.He opens the carton to show the eggs aren\u2019t broken \u2014 eggs must always be presented to the customer \u2014 and heads back downstairs. In and out.\u201cWhat\u2019s up, buddy?\u201d he says to a woman\u2019s cat, for whom he\u2019s carrying two big containers of litter. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d He chats with the cat\u2019s owner for a minute as he carries the bags into her apartment, but the small talk can\u2019t take extra time.Being late isn\u2019t as often a problem for Mr. Browne as is being early. Because the city is so unpredictable, the company frequently allots him more time than he needs. He is one of the fastest drivers who works out of Peapod\u2019s Jersey City warehouse, but he thinks he could do more deliveries.When he shows up early, he can\u2019t contact the customers directly. Instead, he has to call someone back at the office, who then calls the customer, to see if he can drop off the order ahead of time. If not, he has to wait.When the opposite happens \u2014 when people aren\u2019t home \u2014 Mr. Browne can wait only 15 minutes. The other day he had to wait for a woman in a fourth-floor walk-up, carrying three bags in each hand.\u201cSeven minutes, I could have done another delivery,\u201d he says.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rooted in Counterculture, Whole Foods\u2019 Founder Finds an Unlikely Refuge", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported bySince John Mackey co-founded a precursor to Whole Foods in 1978, he has taken a hands-on management approach to the organic grocery chain. He personally oversaw each step of its national expansion. During a takeover battle 10 years ago, Mr. Mackey used a pseudonym to write anonymous blog posts attacking a competitor.So over the last two years, as Whole Foods\u2019 stock price sunk and activist investors called for changes, Mr. Mackey took the challenges to his company personally. After three decades of running a beloved chain of upscale grocers that had helped revolutionize the way Americans ate, Mr. Mackey, a hippie who rails against greed, was mired in a bare-knuckle fight with Wall Street.Last year, Mr. Mackey tried to reassert control, pledging to become more hands-on and address investor concerns.But behind the scenes, the forces that would lead Whole Foods to agree to sell itself to Amazon for $13.4 billion on Friday were already at work.In September, Neuberger Berman, a $267 billion investment firm that had been quietly building its own position in Whole Foods stock, sent a letter to the board of directors that highlighted issues with the company\u2019s business. In November, Walter Robb, Mr. Mackey\u2019s co-chief executive and heir apparent, stepped down. Mr. Mackey was once again leading the company on his own and personally pledged to increase margins and revamp operations.Those changes were not enough for Neuberger Berman, and its executives began a behind-the-scenes campaign to shake up Whole Foods last year, seeking to enlist the help of activist hedge funds. Among the things they had discussed were strategic options for the company to pursue.Then, in April, Jana Partners, an $8.5 billion activist investor, announced its position as the company\u2019s largest outside shareholder. Jana outlined a laundry list of concerns it said the company needed to address, including the way it had conducted its business, and took aim at what it said were deficiencies in customer service and distribution strategy, as well as analytics and brand development. The hedge fund also put forth a list of four nominees to replace members of the Whole Foods board.Mr. Mackey was outraged at the developments, which took place on the eve of a scheduled book tour, and vowed a fight.But Jana had hit on issues that other investors, including Neuberger Berman, had raised. In April, Neuberger Berman wrote another letter urging the company to explore the possibility of a sale.In an effort to broker peace with Jana, Whole Foods said it was willing to consider some of the candidates that Jana put forward for the board. After interviewing four of them, Whole Foods said it would consider two, on the condition that Jana back down from its public aggression, Mr. Mackey said. But Jana declined to compromise.As Whole Foods\u2019 troubles spilled into public view, talk about a sale of the company began to swirl. Amazon \u2014 the leading force in e-commerce \u2014 was among the companies that had initial discussions with the Whole Foods board. Whole Foods was unsure of how serious Amazon was \u2014 Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, had never struck a deal of this size before \u2014 and the talks did not move fast at first.After the Whole Foods board shake-up, talks with Amazon accelerated. Facing unrelenting pressure from Wall Street, the supermarket\u2019s board soon decided that pursuing a sale to the online colossus was the best move, with Amazon providing technological know-how and the promise of bolstering operational efficiency.For a transaction that promises seismic changes, the talks between the two companies were fairly swift, according to people with knowledge of the matter.For Whole Foods, whose ethos was once so crunchy granola that it did not originally sell beer or meat, Amazon and its vast empire of warehouses and robots might seem an odd match. But the deep pockets of Mr. Bezos offer Whole Foods a way to escape the harsh glare of public investors who demanded cost cuts, shake-ups in management and on the board and more.Mr. Mackey did not speak to the press on Friday. A spokesman for Jana also declined to comment.Inside Whole Foods, the news of the sale to Amazon was greeted with a sense of relief, according to employees who agreed to talk on the condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak to the news media.Charles Kantor, who oversees Neuberger Berman\u2019s main investment in Whole Foods, said his team was caught by surprise when the news broke.\u201cIt obviously happened very quickly,\u201d Mr. Kantor said. \u201cRemember, the board just changed, and it was all Mackey\u2019s lieutenants who would have liked nothing more than to come out on top.\u201dMr. Kantor also indicated that he expected the Whole Foods board to consider any other bids that were made.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the final chapter,\u201d he added \u201cAmazon gets one of the best brands in the world for a very thrifty multiple.\u201dAlthough Mr. Mackey was able to sell Whole Foods on his own terms, the activist investors he so loathes came out on top, too.From its brief investment in Whole Foods, Jana Partners, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, stands to make about $301 million.Stephanie Strom contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

You peruse a small area \u2014 no chance of getting lost or wasting time searching for things \u2014 because the store stocks only sample items. You wave your phone in front of anything you want to buy, then walk out. In the back, robots retrieve your items from a warehouse and deliver them to your home via driverless car or drone.Our mental image of job-killing automation is robots in factories or warehouses. But the next jobs to disappear are probably ones that are a much bigger part of most people\u2019s daily lives: retail workers and cashiers in stores and restaurants.For a long time, economists argued that routine jobs like factory and clerical work were vulnerable to automation but that jobs in both the service and knowledge sectors were safer. They require human skills that are hard for machines to imitate, like judgment and adaptability. These skills are useful when an executive makes strategic business decisions or when a chef fries one customer\u2019s egg and scrambles another\u2019s.But it has become increasingly clear that parts of every job will be automated \u2014 and that the service sector is next. Although certain service jobs like health aide or preschool teacher still seem safe, others, like those in retail and food service, are already being displaced. It\u2019s not hard to teach a machine to do routine tasks like scanning bar codes, stocking shelves or dunking fries in oil.Estimates like these are guesses at best, because imagining the future is an act of science fiction. And even when technologies exist, companies adopt them slowly. That\u2019s one reason productivity isn\u2019t increasing at the rate economists might expect, even though more work is able to be automated. But there is evidence that retail jobs are transforming rapidly.Companies won\u2019t invest in technology unless it\u2019s less expensive than employing people, and most retail workers make near minimum wage. But in a case study of grocery stores, McKinsey found that the savings from automation were three times the cost, and 68 percent of the savings were from reduced labor costs.Retailers say automating certain tasks doesn\u2019t necessarily displace employees, but frees them to do other things that are more valuable to customers. Lowe\u2019s, for instance, said its customer service robot answered simple questions so employees could provide more personalized expertise, like home project planning.Whole Foods, before the Amazon acquisition, made a similar argument to Forrester. \u201cWe intentionally don\u2019t over-automate our stores, at least not on the front end,\u201d an executive told Forrester, which didn\u2019t name the person in its report. \u201cWe want to have the personal touch of real people.\u201dBut shoppers often prefer to save time by interacting with fewer people, especially when they just need coffee or paper towels \u2014 thus the convenience of online ordering for in-store pickup at places like Walmart and Starbucks.On the other hand, said David Autor, an M.I.T. economist, it would make the job market even more challenging for a group of workers who already struggle to find stable, well-paid employment and are unlikely to have the education to move into better jobs.Amazon said it had no plans to lay off Whole Foods workers or use Amazon Go technology to automate cashiers\u2019 jobs.Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy, said Amazon\u2019s plans could be much bigger than simply automating stores.\u201cThe bigger and more profound way that technology affects jobs is by completely reinventing the business model,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon didn\u2019t go put a robot into the bookstores and help you check out books faster. It completely reinvented bookstores. The idea of a cashier won\u2019t be so much automated as just made irrelevant \u2014 you\u2019ll just tell your Echo what you need, or perhaps it will anticipate what you need, and stuff will get delivered to you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Cosby Case, First Trial Is a Guide for the 2nd", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "Supported byJudge Steven T. O\u2019Neill has said a second trial would begin within months and, if the case just concluded is any measure, they will be months filled with motions and countermotions as each side jockeys for an edge.Andrea Constand, who said Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in 2004 at his home outside Philadelphia, has agreed to take the stand again in Norristown, Pa., where the first trial occurred.\u201cWe will evaluate and review our case,\u201d said the Montgomery County district attorney, Kevin R. Steele, after the trial. \u201cWe will take a hard look at everything involved, and then we will retry it.\u201dThe prosecution needs to examine, among other things, whether it can introduce testimony from other women who say Mr. Cosby assaulted them. It had tried to introduce 13 accusers as evidence of a pattern of sexual assault, but Judge O\u2019Neill, before the trial, allowed only one to testify: Kelly Johnson.\u201cThe pretrial decision that limited the testimony of other Cosby accusers is probably the reason the case ended in a mistrial,\u201d said Kevin Harden Jr., a criminal defense attorney and a former Philadelphia prosecutor.Complicating matters further for the prosecution, Ms. Johnson seemed hesitant on the witness stand.\u201cKelly Johnson was a somewhat tentative witness, which \u2014 while understandable, given the gravity and attention to the case \u2014 may have lessened the impact of her testimony,\u201d said Dennis McAndrews, a former prosecutor who attended the trial. But he said witnesses were often stronger and less intimidated their second time on the stand.Mr. Steele said Saturday that he had not spoken with Ms. Johnson about a second trial nor had he decided whether to renew the fight to include testimony from additional women.While the criminal case is in limbo, so too will likely be a number of civil lawsuits filed against Mr. Cosby by women who say he assaulted them. In Massachusetts, for example, seven women have sued Mr. Cosby for defamation, saying he branded them liars when they came forward with their accusations.Before the Pennsylvania trial, a judge in Massachusetts ordered a partial stay of discovery pending the resolution of the criminal case, and that is unlikely to change now, experts said.Mr. Cosby\u2019s career as an entertainer is already stalled and will remain so for the time being. The mistrial did little, experts said, to affect the status of \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d which became something of a third rail for cable networks as Cosby accusers surfaced. It would have been further tarnished by a conviction, but it is slowly re-emerging, with all eight seasons available to stream on Amazon Prime and two television outlets, TV One and Bounce TV, now airing reruns.Barbara Ashcroft, a former prosecutor who teaches at the Temple University Beasley School of Law, said that as the second criminal trial approaches, both sides would study the first.\u201cSteele will likely use what he learns from this trial to tighten up the Commonwealth\u2019s case and come back even stronger during the retrial,\u201d she said.Both sides would likely be helped by insights from the jurors, especially the holdouts on the jury, which was unable to reach consensus on any of the three counts of aggravated indecent assault. But so far, both sides say they did not know which way the jury leaned. \u201cWe are in the dark as much as you are,\u201d Brian J. McMonagle, Mr. Cosby\u2019s lead lawyer, said in a telephone interview on Saturday.None of the jurors \u2014 seven men and five women, chosen from Allegheny County, 300 miles west of Norristown, to avoid the taint of pretrial publicity \u2014 has been identified.Judge O\u2019Neill had ruled the jurors would remain anonymous during the trial, so the news media could not pursue them. Even after the mistrial, he did not release their names, and instead cautioned the jurors not to disclose their deliberations in detail, lest it have a chilling affect on future jurors\u2019 deliberations.Several news organizations have gone to court asking for the release of the jurors\u2019 names, citing their First Amendment right. Judge O\u2019Neill indicated that prosecutors have until Monday to respond to the motion.That does not legally preclude jurors from speaking publicly, but as of Sunday afternoon, none of the 12 appeared to have come forward. Among the curious are dozens of women who have made accusations against Mr. Cosby and who say their allegations should carry weight. Some said they remain resolute.\u201cEverybody is saying this, but it ain\u2019t over till it\u2019s over,\u201d said Kristina Ruehli, who says Mr. Cosby assaulted her in 1965. \u201cThis is not the end.\u201dJohn Koblin and Jason Zinoman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Cannes Film Festival, Tech and Tradition Collide", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byStreamingJust as giant streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have quickly established themselves as movie production entities, resentment and panic from studios and filmmakers (and what some might term a critical peanut gallery) have grown more blatant.The wording of that statement was ambiguous \u2014 some films in the competition come to the festival with no distribution deals in place, so how do you determine their French theatrical future in those cases? As for Mr. Almod\u00f3var\u2019s throwdown, it had some unpleasant implications. Would the jury leader effectively blackball the two Netflix movies in competition, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s \u201cOkja\u201d and Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)\u201d?The fun continued into the festival last month, where some members of the news media reportedly booed the Netflix logo at the beginning of \u201cOkja,\u201d then booed some more when the first 10 minutes of the movie were projected in the wrong aspect ratio, a glitch that inspired some Infowars-style conspiracy theories on Twitter. Once the movie was shown correctly, it earned an ovation and attendant critical praise on social media.While Netflix garnered controversy without actively seeking it, Amazon quietly took Todd Haynes\u2019s new movie, \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d to the competition. As of this writing, there was no news of either company\u2019s having made major acquisitions at the festival.Efe Cakarel, the founder and chief executive of the streaming service Mubi, which rides hard for cinephile art house fare, told me I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised by this.\u201cThe first few years I came to Cannes, all I did was explain to film producers what streaming video on demand even was,\u201d he told me in a phone interview just after this year\u2019s festival (his 10th). \u201cAnd if you even broached the idea of acquiring rights to first-run movies for streaming, they looked at you like you were crazy. Remember, Cannes 2007 was right before the introduction of the iPhone. Three years before the iPad. Yes, YouTube was around, but that sort of thing wasn\u2019t even close to what YouTube was about then. Although you could tell, by looking at the way people used their laptops, there was a readiness to engage with long-form material.\u201d\u201cThere were 18 films in competition with 13 already bought,\u201d Mr. Cakarel said. \u201cEvery year it\u2019s getting more and more intense, and that\u2019s in part because companies such as Netflix and Amazon are part of the Cannes machine, so to speak. They\u2019re financing, producing, distributing films, often with an eye to getting them to Cannes. So now we are in the business of negotiating prebuys, too.\u201dSo, Mr. Cakarel concluded, \u201cIf you want to work with Paolo Sorrentino, you have to have the conversation with him today, before he\u2019s even embarked on whatever he is going to do next.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blue Apron Slashes Share Price for Its I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byWhen the parent of Snapchat went public in March, investors flocked to the social media upstart\u2019s offering, eagerly pushing the money-losing company\u2019s valuation to $34 billion.Nearly four months later, investors in initial public offerings are more cautious \u2014 and Blue Apron, the biggest consumer start-up to seek the public markets since, is paying the price.At the new price, Blue Apron would be valued at about $1.9 billion, below the $2 billion valuation it earned in its last private fund-raising round. And it would raise about $300 million \u2014 a third less than it hoped to raise last week \u2014 when it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, under the ticker symbol \u201cAPRN.\u201dThe deflated pricing signals a new sense of caution that has pervaded the market for initial offerings. The big institutions that buy shares in market debutantes have pushed back against ambitious price and valuation targets in recent months, leading to fewer first-day stock-price pops \u2014 but also fewer subsequent drops.\u201cIt\u2019s been very good for investors but very challenging for issuers,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which tracks initial public offerings. \u201cMany I.P.O.s are not coming out at the premium valuations that issuers might have hoped for, since investors are concerned about pricing.\u201dIn pursuing an offering, Blue Apron is moving to the public markets at a time when others have been fleeing them. The number of publicly listed companies in the United States last year was down 50 percent from 20 years ago, according to data from the investment firm Pantheon.The shift is in part because money from private investors \u2014 venture capital firms, giant mutual funds and the like \u2014 has been plentiful enough that start-ups have not needed to go public to raise money.This year has reflected a rebound. The number of companies seeking offerings has risen from last year, which had the fewest number of initial public offerings since 2009, according to Renaissance.The number of offerings in the United States alone tripled, to 25, in the first quarter of this year from the same time last year, according to Renaissance.And money raised from initial public offerings this year has totaled $19.9 billion, already outpacing all of last year, thanks largely to offerings like that of Snap, Snapchat\u2019s parent company.Yet companies have already shown signs of pricing more conservatively. Of the 72 initial offerings worldwide this year, 25 percent ultimately fell below their initial pricing range, according to Renaissance. That compares with 32 percent last year and 33.5 percent in 2015.By Ms. Smith\u2019s reckoning, that shows that companies seeking to go public are becoming more cautious.For prospective investors, there have been numerous causes for concern with Blue Apron.The company unveiled its original price range only days after Amazon announced its $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods, a transaction that promises to upend the retail industry. Shares in other grocery chains dropped the day that deal was announced.Amazon\u2019s dominance in e-commerce has stoked worries among retailers that its planned takeover of Whole Foods could create an enormous and incredibly savvy rival almost overnight.Then there are questions about Blue Apron itself.The five-year-old company is perhaps the most prominent of the meal-kit providers, which send customers ingredients to prepare specific meals. The service caters to customers who want to cook at home without making a trip to the grocery store and with simpler choices on what to make.It is a business model that, in Blue Apron\u2019s case, has had substantial growth. Sales rose tenfold from 2014 to 2016, to $795.4 million. From 2015 to 2016 alone, revenue more than doubled.But Blue Apron has never been profitable, and its losses have swollen over the past three years, to $54.9 million last year.Much of the losses stem from the marketing expenses the company has racked up as it has bought ads on podcasts and a welter of other media. Marketing costs leapt tenfold from 2014 to 2016, to $144.1 million, and now equal about a quarter of the company\u2019s sales.Another notable expense has been the purchase of one of the company\u2019s main beef suppliers, a move meant in part to eliminate middlemen and cut costs.Moreover, Blue Apron faces questions over customer abandonment. Some 60 percent of new subscribers quit after six months, according to estimates from S3 Partners, a research firm.Challenging rivals in the meal delivery business has proved difficult. A number of competitors trying out different models \u2014 including the food delivery services Maple and Sprig and the meal-kit provider Din \u2014 have shut their doors.But Blue Apron is betting that it will survive, in part because of its lofty aims. In its prospectus, the company did not limit expectations, writing: \u201cOur vision for the future is ambitious: to build a better food system. We are transforming the way that food is produced, distributed and consumed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Big Tech Stocks Build Market Euphoria, and Jitters", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byFacebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google.In the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes \u2014 Amazon leads the way, up 206 percent; Apple trails the pack with a 67 percent gain \u2014 as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies.But this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause. Not because they think these companies will crack, as many did in previous market corrections, but because in the parlance of the industry, the trade has become very crowded.\u201cThere is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist who often highlights the influence of these stocks in his research notes. \u201cNo one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive.\u201dDespite some nervousness that a bubble might be building, stock indexes remain near recent record highs, without adjustment for inflation. On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher in cautious trading on the eve of several potentially market-moving events on Thursday, including the British election and testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up 0.16 percent on Wednesday, led by gains in bank stocks.Other markets have been robust recently, including those for gold, a traditional haven, and the virtual currency Bitcoin. But oil prices and the United States dollar have weakened, with the Bloomberg dollar spot index at its lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election.The stock market, however, remains the main attraction.Late in any bull market, investing in highflying momentum stocks requires balancing greed and fear. Everyone wants to keep making money, but everyone also lives in fear that the party will suddenly end.According to the data provider FactSet, since 2012, mutual fund, pension fund and hedge fund holdings of stock in the five technology giants have more than doubled, to $1.4 trillion, from $558 billion \u2014 a consequence of investors\u2019 buying up stocks that are rapidly increasing in value.As is its wont, Wall Street has given voice to this unease with a nickname: Faang, an acronym for the five stocks that evokes a gruesome end more than it does the exuberance of the moment.The push into these stocks has been driven by retail investors via traditional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and direct ownership.Through these channels, retail investors now own 60 to 70 percent of these stocks \u2014 an exposure of very large amounts of money to a small selection of stocks that investment specialists say is unprecedented.It is also dangerous because a prolonged bout of selling in such a small number of stocks could spur a wider sell-off in the market.\u201cIn terms of magnitude, we have not seen this,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, an independent stock market strategist.In Mr. Paulsen\u2019s view, a long period of subpar economic growth since 2009 has given the Faang stocks their special aura. Most companies have struggled to show consistent earnings and sales growth over this period.So when Facebook\u2019s net earnings leap to $10 billion, from $1.4 billion, in four years or Amazon\u2019s sales jump to $135 billion, from $74 billion, investors take notice.\u201cYou have this small cadre of companies that are showing extraordinary growth in a very sluggish economy,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cSo yes, you can see how valuations would get extended.\u201dStock market historians say it would be unfair to compare today\u2019s technology companies to the more speculative names that characterized the dot-com boom and bust. Progress can easily be measured via earnings and the cash-generating abilities these companies have, as opposed to counting eyeballs on the web, which was the norm in that era.Still, the question remains: How much more can the stock market valuations of these companies grow relative to the earnings they produce?For example, the current stock market size of the Faang companies is $2.4 trillion, or about 13 percent of the size of the United States economy. By comparison, their combined earnings were just $77 billion last year \u2014 with more than half that amount from Apple, the world\u2019s richest company.Of course, in many cases, investors are calculating that in the long term, earnings growth will catch up with sales expansion as well as heavy investment spending aimed at putting competitors out of business.Amazon, whose $2.3 billion in earnings last year supports a market capitalization of $483 billion, is the most profound example in this regard.Still, it is not today\u2019s earnings that investors are betting on, but tomorrow\u2019s, the argument goes.Surprisingly, some of the most passionate advocates for these companies are value investors. These investment professionals have earned reputations for snapping up companies trading at deep discounts relative to the market, not chasing stocks that fly high above it.Bill Nygren, a value investor for more than 30 years, oversees the $5.8 billion Oakmark Select Fund, and his No. 1 holding in the fund is now Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Mr. Nygren contends that the company is trading at a bargain to the market, as opposed to a premium, if Google\u2019s cash pile and the potential of YouTube to make a lot of money in the future are considered.\u201cI have not heard anyone advance the argument that the Google search engine is not even an average business,\u201d Mr. Nygren said. \u201cYet that is how the market is pricing it.\u201dAnother well-known value manager who is betting big on Faang stocks is Chris Davis, the lead stock picker for the $11.8 billion New York Venture Fund, where Amazon is his top position.While skeptics see just $2 billion in earnings, he and his analysts see a company that has generated more than $15 billion in cash and is ready for a higher market rating because of the profitability of its web services division.\u201cAmazon is more fully valued than when we bought it,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cBut we have never seen a company with such competitive advantages.\u201dAs these stock prices continue to rise, analysts agree that investors have little choice but to stick to their guns.That is because the Faang stocks have become such large components of the major stock market measures. For a manager not to match the share of an Apple or an Amazon in a benchmark would result in an actively managed fund trailing its index and its peers.And as investors pour billions of dollars into exchange-traded funds \u2014 a record $314 billion in the last year \u2014 no active manager can afford to lag the competition for too long.So be it a mutual fund, hedge fund, sovereign wealth fund or family office, the strategy has been consistent \u2014 put aside any fears, and stay invested.\u201cIt\u2019s like you are riding a missile that you know could explode at any moment beneath you,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo. He has warned in his reports that some of these stocks have entered a stage of mania. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have no choice but to be sucked into the trade.\u201dAdvertisement"}

How do you come up with fresh ideas for giving some of your fortune away?If you\u2019re Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, you fire up Twitter, naturally.On Thursday, Mr. Bezos sent a tweet to his more than 222,000 followers asking for suggestions for philanthropic giving. He specifically asked for ideas that could help the world in the near term, a contrast to long-term personal investments he has made in for-profit companies with social impact, like Blue Origin, a space firm, and The Washington Post.Mr. Bezos wrote, \u201cI\u2019m thinking I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now \u2014 short term \u2014 at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact.\u201dThe prospect of someone with Mr. Bezos\u2019s wealth \u2014 he is the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a fortune of well over $80 billion \u2014 increasing his giving was greeted enthusiastically by people who work in philanthropy. His approach is unusual compared with many big philanthropists from the technology field, like Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft, whose foundation has tackled long-term global health problems like malaria, among other challenges.\u201cI would call it surprising, but welcome,\u201d said Jacob Harold, the president of Guidestar, a national database of nonprofits. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for big-dollar donors to be honest about their desire for short-term results.\u201dMr. Harold said that he \u201cwould be worried if every donor was saying this,\u201d but that Mr. Bezos\u2019s approach could have a meaningful effect.Mr. Bezos asked people to reply to his post with their ideas. A little more than five hours after his request, there were more than 3,600 such replies, including suggestions for contributing to affordable housing, veterans\u2019 organizations and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender causes.Larry Brilliant, the acting chairman of the Skoll Global Threats Fund, a philanthropy created by Jeff Skoll, one of eBay\u2019s founders, said that crowdsourcing philanthropic ideas had had mixed success in large part because of the challenge of identifying ones that have promise.\u201cThe denominator of ideas you will get in, the vast majority of ideas which are not good, not viable, will flood this process,\u201d said Mr. Brilliant, who formerly ran Google\u2019s philanthropic arm.videoAdvertisement"}

I\u2019ll wait.Last week, if you ran into me at the theater or the library or the beach at Coney Island, you heard me sell you on this episode, \u201cA Short History of Weird Girls.\u201d Whip smart, radical, keen and poignant, it is the best 20 minutes of television I\u2019ve seen in years.Directed by Mx. Soloway, who identifies as nonbinary and prefers gender-neutral pronouns, and written by the playwrights Annie Baker and Heidi Schreck, the episode comprises four monologues in which characters explore how sexual identity has shaped, sharpened and dented their lives. Three women, and one gender-nonconforming character played by Roberta Colindrez, each recite a letter to Dick, here a MacArthur-winning artist and cowboy hobbyist played by Kevin Bacon. As their present-day selves stand in the forefront of the frame narrating their sexual histories, younger versions of them kiss and clutch and ache and blunder in the background.Near the end of her section, the character of Chris, played by Kathryn Hahn, says: \u201cSometimes when I walk down the street, I look into the faces of every woman that I pass, and I wonder what she sees. I wonder about the history of her desire.\u201d Watch this episode and you will, too.The fifth episode doesn\u2019t advance the romantic plot; it does something a lot braver, in a manner as formally ambitious as anything on \u201cMr. Robot\u201d or \u201cMaster of None\u201d or \u201cThe Leftovers.\u201d It insists \u2014 here comes the revolutionary part \u2014 that sexual identity is crucial to a broader sense of identity, of a piece with emotional and intellectual development. Other episodes in the series play Chris\u2019s helpless lust for laughs, but this one takes women\u2019s desires seriously in all their convolution and excitement and shame.\u201cI don\u2019t care how you see me,\u201d Chris tells an imagined Dick. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you want me. It\u2019s better that you don\u2019t. It\u2019s enough that I want you.\u201dMaybe that doesn\u2019t sound so world-shattering to you. It does to me.I\u2019ve spent my adult life as a theater critic, which means accepting that in a lot of what I see, female characters will be relegated to tidy niches (girlfriend or mother, temptress or innocent), the better to tell men\u2019s stories. If women\u2019s sexual desire is discussed at all, it\u2019s usually presented as pathetic (Helena in \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream,\u201d say) or screwy (like Blanche in \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d), while what men see and want and do typically drives the action.Often that\u2019s O.K. I like men. I like their stories. I\u2019m a big Sam Shepard fan. But seeing women too expansive and untidy for pigeonholing narrate their own lives, well, that\u2019s a thrill. So is their demand to be seen as flawed heroes instead of helpmates, sexual subjects as well as sexual objects. Though the format of the \u201cDear Dick\u201d letters might suggest that each woman is defining herself in relation to him, in this episode the objectified Dick is on the sidelines, on a sofa, wearing nothing but a Navajo blanket. (No complaints.)If the stories in \u201cA Short History of Weird Girls\u201d feel real, it\u2019s because they are. In the \u201cI Love Dick\u201d writers\u2019 room, staffed exclusively with women and those who don\u2019t identify as male or female, writers were asked to share their own sexual experiences. After a week binge-watching films by artists such as Hito Steyerl, Agn\u00e8s Varda and Chantal Akerman, Ms. Baker and Ms. Schreck assembled those stories into the four monologues.\u201cGrowing up, almost all the sex scenes I saw were made by men, written by men,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find myself in there. I was always craving sex scenes that felt like what sex was to me.\u201d Ms. Schreck, who used at least one of her own stories in the Chris section, said that the \u201cI Love Dick\u201d episode \u201cwas a great experiment in allowing sexuality to feel as unpredictable and varied as it does in your own psyche.\u201dMx. Soloway, speaking by phone from Los Angeles, described feeling \u201ca little bit scared\u201d upon seeing the script and its heavy use of voice-over. Then Mx. Soloway began \u201cto imagine this episode as these women giving their testimonies in the court of the world\u201d and decided to submit it as the show\u2019s directing entry for this year\u2019s Emmy Awards, in part to encourage the thousands of members of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to watch it, too.\u201cYou reel a little bit after watching it,\u201d Mx. Soloway said. \u201cYou just kind of go: \u2018What was that? Was that an episode of television? What did I just see?\u2019\u201dIf we\u2019re being writers\u2019-room honest, I don\u2019t love everything about the episode. There\u2019s some confusion as to when and why the present-day women stand apart from their histories and when they embed themselves in flashbacks. It\u2019s also unclear whether the glowing blur that occasionally overtakes them (a homage to Naomi Uman\u2019s experimental film \u201cRemoved\u201d) represents sexual desire or a more comprehensive sense of identity.But when I watched it, it made me reel. When I streamed it again, more reeling. Dear Dick, Thanks.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Advertising Paradise, Reality Is Just a Conversation Away", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingCANNES, France \u2014 The top hitters in media and advertising descended on the beaches of southern France last week, lounging on yachts and sipping wine and frozen ros\u00e9 slushies as the sun sparkled on the cerulean water of the French Riviera. They networked and cut deals at parties in chic hotels \u2014 the type where rooms cost $500 a night.But even in paradise, it did not take long for conversations at the annual industry conference to inevitably turn to the frustrations of the advertising world.\u201cI\u2019m hypersensitive right now,\u201d said Kathleen Hall, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for global advertising and media. \u201cAs a marketer you always think about risk, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily the first thought. I think now you have to be much more sensitive to the idea of risk and how anything might be construed as a political statement or endorsement or issue-based support.\u201d\u201cThe answer, and I think they agree, is just to raise the bar on monetization,\u201d she said.Ms. Hall said that in today\u2019s polarized media environment, people were \u201cjudging and assuming your values are represented by your media placement.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m kind of obsessed,\u201d she said, \u201cwith what\u2019s the right balance between people\u2019s freedom of choice, the media\u2019s freedom of expression and our freedom to reach.\u201dHoopla aside, several advertisers said they were taking a harder line with such platforms, though they were eager to continue working with them. Google and Facebook, in particular, are trying to assuage advertisers\u2019 concerns around objectionable content.\u201cThey\u2019ve sort of got away with trying to say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re an open-source technology; it\u2019s not us, it\u2019s them,\u2019\u201d Jerry Buhlmann, the chief executive of Dentsu Aegis Network, said about objectionable content online. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting away with it anymore. They\u2019re too big, they\u2019re making too much money, they employ too many people, and it\u2019s too important politically.\u201dOthers are more concerned with creating standards for determining how effectively ads reach people online and being able to compare metrics across platforms \u2014 basically, what a Facebook video view is worth versus an ad viewed on Snapchat.\u201cWhen digital media was a small part of overall advertising, I think we were learning and developing,\u201d said Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever. \u201cBut now it\u2019s starting to become the biggest part of advertising, and I think in that context, we need to make the industry more efficient.\u201dStill, while marketers are more outspoken, the giant online advertising platforms continue to reign supreme \u2014 and attract hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing.\u201cThe duopoly continues,\u201d said Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s biggest ad group, referring to Google and Facebook. \u201cThere\u2019s been all these challenges \u2014 consumer brand safety, what I call political brand safety with terrorist-type stuff, fake news, fraud, transparency. But I don\u2019t think that anything has happened as yet that we\u2019ve seen of great significance in terms of altering the patterns of spend.\u201dWhile Mr. Sorrell likened the timing of the Publicis announcement to a dinner guest\u2019s insulting the host midway through a meal, he noted in an interview that his firm had sent 500 people to Cannes this year, down from 1,000 last year.Advertisers are eyeing ways to work with Amazon, as well as how they can take advantage of the Amazon Echo, particularly as Google and Apple follow the company\u2019s lead in selling voice-activated devices for the home.\u201cWe\u2019re working with Amazon as a retail partner \u2014 which we have a big booming business with them \u2014 and we\u2019re working with them as a media partner,\u201d said Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble. He said Procter & Gamble was moving money there.\u201cI really believe voice is going to be big,\u201d Mr. Weed said. \u201cBrands, of course, are known by their visual representation, but brands don\u2019t have a voice, and I think we\u2019re going to have to think about what is the tone of voice for different brands and how to engage with it.\u201dMs. Lemkau of JPMorgan Chase pointed to Amazon\u2019s data, the millions of verified Chase cardholders who are spending on the site, its media and content arm, its ad serving platform and the potential for marketing through packaging.\u201cI think they will be the biggest presence here potentially one day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you think of alternatives to the big two, they have a really compelling case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Scenes From an Unusual College in the High Desert", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Tucked in the high desert near Death Valley, a tiny all-male college has been preparing the leaders of tomorrow for 100 years.The student body of 25 or so young men is expected to help out on the college\u2019s cattle ranch and farm as part of a two-year liberal arts program. Many then go on to complete their degrees at Ivy League universities.\u201cIt\u2019s a place that feels very open,\u201d she said. \u201cThe young men I photographed have an incredibly expansive perspective of what masculinity can be.\u201dSupporters of the move, including many of the current students, argue that times have changed and so should the college. Others have expressed concerns about disrupting a formula that they saw unique and liberating.Zachary Mider, who graduated in the 1990s, said he supported the move to allow women, but also worried that something could be lost.\u201cWhat I remember being interesting is that in an environment where there aren\u2019t as many women around, you saw people being more willing to take roles that you might associate with women.\u201d he said. \u201cAnd maybe feeling less like they needed to fit into gender roles.\u201dShe shared some of her photos with us.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)One of the most photographed scenes in Point Reyes, the cape north of San Francisco, is a tunnel formed by two neat rows of Monterey cypress trees.The trees were planted by Radio Corporation of America, which once operated a maritime radio station at the end of the long driveway.The station, KPH, was housed in an Art Deco building constructed between 1929 and 1931. In its heyday, KPH used Morse code to send weather reports, instructions for maritime commerce and other transmissions to ships at sea.As American Morse code gave way to newer forms of communication, the station was closed in 1997 and acquired by the National Park Service a couple of years later.Rather than let it fall into decay, local maritime radio buffs persuaded the park service to let them restore it.Every Saturday, the volunteers fire up the radio equipment for a few hours and trade messages with ships that call in. The transmissions evoke nostalgia for an era eclipsed by email, Twitter and Skype.\u201cBut now they hear it rising up through the static and it\u2019s very emotional.\u201dIf you have a shortwave radio you can listen in on the communications \u2014 or if you don\u2019t know Morse code, a mysterious symphony of \u201cdits\u201d and \u201cdahs.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "For Your Consideration: An Increasingly Lavish Emmy Campaign Season", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byOn a recent Sunday in the heart of Beverly Hills, Calif., the hordes were ready.About 300 people began circling waiters armed with tubes of Pringles and mini-croissants. Trays of finger sandwiches (peanut butter, honey and banana) were in ready supply. Attendees stood about 15 deep in lines as seven bartenders frantically handed out free booze.And it wasn\u2019t even noon.\u201cCan you believe this?\u201d said Nicole Leanne Nelson, an actress, holding a glass of red wine.The lavish spread was courtesy of Netflix, which was promoting its rookie drama \u201cStranger Things\u201d to a pool of invite-only guests it hoped \u2014 but did not know for sure \u2014 included Emmy voters.It was just one of about two dozen events that the company had thrown in a rented event space over five weeks, each trying to inspire potential voters to nominate Netflix\u2019s original content for the Emmy Awards.As the streaming services \u2014 Amazon held similar parties \u2014 battle with traditional cable and broadcast networks, Hollywood is witnessing Emmy campaigning on a scale that industry executives say they have never seen before. The once-staid season now finds studios approving generous budgets for billboards, mail promotions, parties and dinners with the express purpose of getting shows, actors and writers in front of would-be voters.\u201cI\u2019ll put a number on it \u2014 it\u2019s 10 times crazier,\u201d FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dAt a time when there is more television than ever \u2014 there will be more than 450 scripted shows broadcast this year \u2014 award jockeying, apparently, is the next logical step. Voting for nominations began last week. Nominees for the September ceremony will be announced next month.The Oscars may have some restrictions on what studios can do to influence would-be voters, but the Emmys hunt has turned into a Wild West of no-holds barred campaigning.\u201cFor Your Consideration\u201d advertisements have blanketed Los Angeles, appearing on billboards, bus shelters and posters. In a seven-block stretch of Melrose Avenue, there were outdoor ads for \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d (Netflix), \u201cSarah Silverman: A Speck of Dust\u201d (Netflix), \u201cTransparent\u201d (Amazon), \u201cThe Night Of\u201d (HBO), \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d (CBS) and \u201cSuperstore\u201d (NBC).\u201cI live in Studio City and drive all the way across town to our office, and I pass at least three \u2018Legion\u2019 billboards,\u201d said John Cameron, an executive producer for FX\u2019s \u201cLegion\u201d and \u201cFargo.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not even on the air anymore and they\u2019re up for that very reason: for Emmy voter memory reasons.\u201dMr. Cameron was an executive producer of the critical hit \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d and reflected on what it was like in the old days \u2014 that is, about six years ago.\u201cThey never used to bother to advertise television like that,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s completely analogous to an Oscars campaign.\u201dEach day for the past couple of months, thousands of Emmy voters have received mailed packages filled with elaborately designed boxes that contain DVDs for award contenders. The packages are a considerable expense \u2014 the more ostentatious, the more likely to stand out \u2014 and are mailed to a large number of potential voters. Executives estimate that the packages cost some networks more than $1 million, and for a select few, over $2 million.\u201cIt is overwhelming the amount of content that comes to me every single day,\u201d said Warren Littlefield, the head of NBC\u2019s entertainment division in the 1990s, and an executive producer for several Emmy contenders, including \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d\u201cI have a kitchen table that no one can sit at and no one can have a meal at it,\u201d Mr. Littlefield said. \u201cIt\u2019s that filled with DVDs.\u201dIndustry executives concede that the majority of those discs will most likely not be watched, and that there is something anachronistic about sending DVDs in the streaming era. But if one network sends out big packages, others feel compelled to join in.Emmy campaigning has escalated this year in part because of the swelling number of TV shows and the large group of voters that executives are trying to reach. The Television Academy voting pool has more than 22,000 people, dwarfing the roughly 7,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that vote for the Oscars.\u201cThere are more voting members of the TV academy than voted for mayor of Los Angeles,\u201d joked Tony Angellotti, a longtime Oscars awards strategist who is working with the cable network Starz this year.There are beneficiaries of all this campaigning, of course.Emmy-related advertising is up about 20 percent at The Hollywood Reporter this year, said Lynne Segall, the trade publication\u2019s executive vice president and publisher. She also noted that television\u2019s awards season was inherently frenetic because it lasts only from April to June, which is shorter than the period for movie awards.\u201cYou have a very short window to really make a mark,\u201d she said.But there was no greater symbol of Emmy campaign excess than Netflix\u2019s event space, a source of some bitterness among the streaming service\u2019s competitors.For years, the Television Academy has facilitated \u201cFor Your Consideration\u201d events between April and June. A typical event includes a panel discussion with actors and writers discussing the past season of a contending TV show. That\u2019s usually followed by a party with an open bar and dinner. (Several executives noted that they were certain many Academy members were showing up for little more than a free meal.)The issue has long been one of scarcity: the academy organizes a calendar that allows one network a day to stage an event in Los Angeles, and occasionally another event in New York on the same night. Over that two-month stretch, a studio is unlikely to get more than three or four slots in which to showcase its candidates.Netflix had a few slots on the sanctioned calendar but elected to rent out a 24,000-square-foot multilevel space in Beverly Hills to stage competing events, cheekily calling them FYSee. Rivals grumbled that the events, which ended once voting started last week, violated a tacit agreement among networks to mostly stick with the official calendar. For instance, when FX convened its sanctioned event for \u201cThe Americans\u201d in Hollywood on June 1, Netflix staged an unofficial event across town for \u201cMaster of None.\u201d\u201cWe consider Netflix a home for the industry\u2019s most compelling storytellers and are responsible for finding equally innovative ways to present their stories,\u201d said Cindy Holland, Netflix\u2019s vice president of original content.In addition to a stage and seating area for panels, the Netflix space featured lavish exhibits dedicated to its shows.The \u201cStranger Things\u201d area was accessible through a wall of mist, where the show\u2019s logo was projected. A room for \u201cThe Crown\u201d had formal dinnerware (crystal goblets, china) hanging from the ceiling. Even the canceled series \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d which was set in the 1970s, had a display involving 50 disco balls and a dozen boomboxes.Netflix was missing just one thing: the definitive list of Emmy voters, controlled solely by the Television Academy. The company sent out invites by stringing together various lists from several guilds, hoping that there would be enough overlap.Ms. Nelson, the actress roaming the space, said that while she was a member of the Screen Actors Guild she was not, in fact, an Emmys voter.The question in the industry is whether the Netflix event space \u2014 and Amazon\u2019s smaller events \u2014 would spur copycats.\u201cI kind of doubt that there\u2019s an Emmy voter who is going to vote for a show because you bought them a cheeseburger,\u201d said Mr. Landgraf, the FX executive. \u201cI have more faith in the electorate than that. I think they\u2019ll vote for the shows that they think are the best.\u201dThis year, at least, the industry is not leaving that to chance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Companies Like Uber Get Away With Bad Behavior", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorUBER has raised more money than any other tech start-up in history. It has achieved the highest valuation by far, almost $70 billion.It has also undoubtedly lost more money, in less time, than any other young tech company. In 2016, it reportedly lost $2.8 billion, excluding separate, colossal losses in China, which it exited that year. Amazon, even in its darkest, loss-accumulating early years, was a piker compared with Uber.If Uber\u2019s investors have the stomach for these losses, that would seem to be their business, not that of the rest of us. Except Silicon Valley is viewed by many people around the world as not just the hotbed of technical innovation, but also as the place to see the most highly evolved business practices, the models most worthy of emulating.Unfortunately, Uber has the unenviable distinction of being the one Valley company that should be emulated only on Opposite Day. No other company can come close to matching it in lawsuit headaches and embarrassing expos\u00e9s chronicling maltreatment of its employees, contractor drivers and competitors, and deceiving local law enforcement, tax collection and other government agencies.Her account brought so much unwanted attention to the company that the board commissioned two outside attorneys, Eric Holder, the former United States attorney general, and Tammy Albarr\u00e1n, both partners at the law firm Covington & Burling, to undertake an investigation of the company\u2019s workplace practices and offer remedies.The report was publicly released on Tuesday and it turns out to be a searing indictment of just about every way the company has managed its own employees. Its more than 40 specific recommendations go well beyond prescribing more training for everyone. It spells out concrete ways that complaints like Ms. Fowler\u2019s should be systematically recorded, tracked and addressed.For all its candor and specificity \u2014 rare qualities in corporate America \u2014 the report doesn\u2019t directly address the sources of Uber\u2019s misbehavior: its longtime chief executive, Travis Kalanick, and his chief enabler, the endlessly forgiving board of directors that is controlled by Mr. Kalanick and his cronies.The Holder-Albarr\u00e1n report recommends that the company consider eliminating its official \u201ccore values\u201d like \u201cAlways Be Hustlin\u2019,\u201d \u201cPrincipled Confrontation\u201d and \u201cLet Builders Build,\u201d principles that \u201chave been used to justify poor behavior.\u201d Students of Uber\u2019s history can easily match particular recommendations to particular scandals, such as the sections related to \u201calcohol consumption during core work hours\u201d or \u201cconsumption of nonprescription-controlled substances.\u201d It also said that workplace rules governing sexual harassment and other prohibited behavior should extend to offsite conferences and meetings. \u201cIt should not be necessary to draft separate policies for these events,\u201d it added dryly.The requested repudiation of the company\u2019s cultural values would be a repudiation of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s cultural values. The entire mess that Uber is in is, ultimately, his doing.But the report treated Mr. Kalanick with kid gloves, recommending only that a chief operating officer be appointed to take on some of his responsibilities. Also on Tuesday, Mr. Kalanick announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence, attending to mourning the recent death of his mother in a boating accident. In an email message that he sent to employees, he spoke of the need to create an \u201cUber 2.0.\u201d He went on: \u201cIf we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0.\u201dConsider all that this presumes: that he is so invaluable that he can step aside \u2014 apparently no single person will be in charge during his absence \u2014 and work on self-improvement and then, his spot at the top held for him, return. He acts like the company belongs to him.It\u2019s behavior that is, unfortunately, all too typical in Silicon Valley, encouraged by weak boards, investors who compete among themselves to be the most \u201cfounder friendly\u201d and dual-class stock structures, similar to those at Google and Facebook, that give founders\u2019 shares 10 times the voting rights as ordinary shares.It\u2019s not as though these problems were news to the board. Mitch and Freada Kapor, longtime and respected Silicon Valley investors, spoke out publicly in February about disturbing revelations like Ms. Fowler\u2019s. The Kapors, who have been investors in Uber since 2010, when it was just a speck of start-up dust, pointed out a pattern they had seen in the Valley: \u201cInvestors in high growth, financially successful companies rarely, if ever, call out inexcusable behavior from founders or C-suite executives.\u201dThe new report received by Uber may banish the phrase \u201cAlways Be Hustlin\u2019.\u201d But the person who created the hustlin\u2019 culture that has trampled the interests of so many people, that needed 40-plus separate structural reprimands from its attorneys, will be permitted to get back on his throne. The supine board has left untouched its bedrock conviction: As long as the company keeps growing, the founder can be forgiven almost anything.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conglomerates Didn\u2019t Die. They Look Like Amazon.", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byDealBookThe conglomerate was supposed to be dead, a relic of a bygone era of corporate America. Investors, we have been repeatedly told, want smaller, nimbler, more focused companies.And yet there is Amazon.Amazon is just one of these new-economy conglomerates. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is another. Facebook is quickly becoming a conglomerate, too.That is very likely true of today\u2019s tech-enabled conglomerates, too, which are spending, and often losing, tens of billions of dollars annually on all sorts of projects and acquisitions that may or may not turn out to be successful. But investors are seemingly willing to give these new behemoths a free pass in the name of growth and innovation \u2014 until they aren\u2019t.If there is any lesson from the last breed of industrial conglomerates, it is that there is a natural life cycle to most of them.The model begins like this: A company that is successful in one area turns itself into a conglomerate by using its free cash flow to finance the development or acquisition of businesses in other areas \u2014 at first, ones that are similar to their current business, and later often ones that are farther afield. And then the company does this again and again.When such an economic machine works, it works extraordinarily well. But when any one of the major levers in the machine breaks or even stalls, the entire enterprise comes under pressure. Shareholders start complaining that the sum of the parts would be worth more separately than together.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.\u201cYou look at companies that got really big in the world, the record is not very good,\u201d Charles T. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway \u2014 the world\u2019s largest conglomerate \u2014 told investors several years ago.His business partner, Warren Buffett, stunned shareholders this year when he suggested that he expected shares of Berkshire to rise immediately after his death because of speculation that the company would be broken up and thus would be worth more. (He and Mr. Munger both believe that Berkshire is better off intact, but Mr. Buffett thinks investors\u2019 knee-jerk reaction will be to believe the opposite.)When it comes to Amazon (or Alphabet, or any of the new conglomerates), the question is whether there is something fundamentally different about these businesses given their grounding in digital information \u2014 especially as they expand into complex brick-and-mortar operations like upscale supermarkets.In an age of big data and artificial intelligence, are businesses that look disparate really similar? And can one company\u2019s leadership really oversee so many different businesses? When does it become too big to manage?Google\u2019s own internal list of top-10 principles seems to include an anti-conglomerate provision: \u201cIt\u2019s best to do one thing really, really well.\u201dLeaving aside the question of whether that maxim may have been more suitable to the Google of a decade ago, it certainly hasn\u2019t stopped the company from jumping into all sorts of businesses outside its flagship search and advertising business. Some of these businesses \u2014 which include Android, YouTube, Waze, Nest Labs, self-driving cars and internet distribution \u2014 have been more successful than others. Most of these were brought under the Google umbrella through acquisition, evidence of how the company has used the enormous proceeds of its advertising business to subsidize its entrance into all sorts of other enterprises.Facebook, too, is expanding its offerings through acquisition, buying Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR. And for now, there are no obvious signs that looking after a wider array of businesses is weakening the management at Alphabet, Facebook or, for that matter, Amazon.\u201cThe economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded,\u201d Ms. Khan wrote. \u201cUnder these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational \u2014 even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.\u201dEven more provocatively, she contends that Amazon\u2019s role as both a distributor and cloud provider for many of its competitors gives it an unfair advantage. \u201cThis dual role also enables a platform to exploit information collected on companies using its services to undermine them as competitors,\u201d Ms. Khan wrote.Amazon has thus far been left alone by regulators because it has helped reduce prices of most products. It is not a natural monopoly. \u201cCan prices ever be \u2018too low\u2019?\u201d the Federal Trade Commission asks on its website. \u201cThe short answer is yes, but not very often.\u201dThat may be true. But in Amazon\u2019s case, it has the potential to become so dominant in so many areas that its impact could be more than simply lowering prices for consumers; it could put large companies out of business.Were that to happen, this new breed of Silicon Valley conglomerates may become more powerful \u2014 and resilient \u2014 than the 20th-century conglomerates of yore.If Amazon were to use its acquisition of Whole Foods, along with the profits from its other businesses, to lower prices so much that it put out of business a company like Walmart, with its 1.5 million United States employees, would that be a good outcome? Or is that just a natural part of capitalism?The view of Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is clear. The man who is assembling the 21st century\u2019s most fearsome new conglomerate once explained his view of competition this way: \u201cYour margin is my opportunity.\u201dAn earlier version of this column incorrectly included a distinction awarded to Michael C. Jensen, a professor emeritus at Harvard Business School. He is not a Nobel laureate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Will Let Customers Try On Clothes Before Buying", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For many people, buying clothing online is not worth the hassle of getting a pair of pants or a shirt that does not fit. Many retailers have sought to eliminate that risk by offering free returns on clothing, but now Amazon is going even further.The service will be an option only for members of Amazon Prime, the company\u2019s membership service, which, for $99 a year, gives customers fast shipping at no extra charge, a streaming video service and other benefits. The company did not say when Prime Wardrobe would be available.It is hard to predict what impact this will have on the company\u2019s clothing sales, but it follows a pattern at Amazon of eliminating so-called friction points to online shopping that have made it surprisingly successful in the apparel category.Amazon isn\u2019t the first online company to offer a try-before-you-buy program. The eyewear retailer Warby Parker has long let customers try on up to five pairs of glasses at home for as long as five days, with no obligation to buy any of them.Another online clothing retailer, Stitch Fix, offers a similar home try-on service. To use it, customers must pay a nonrefundable $20 \u201cstyling fee\u201d through which they receive personalized clothing recommendations. The fee can be applied as a credit toward any items the customer buys.Prime Wardrobe will let customers try on more than a million items of clothing, accessories and shoes from brands including Calvin Klein, Levi\u2019s, Adidas, Hugo Boss and Lacoste without buying them. Customers will then have seven days to return the items they don\u2019t want.Previously, Amazon has tried to make its customers more comfortable with shopping for clothing online by offering free shipping on returns of most apparel. This allowed customers to buy clothing and receive refunds for any items they returned.Free shipping on returns can easily erode the profits of an online retailer if customers use the option often, but Amazon can ease the sting somewhat because it also collects fees from its Prime members.With Prime Wardrobe, Amazon will actually discourage clothing returns in a subtle way. The retailer will cut 10 percent off the purchase price of an order for anyone who keeps three to four items, and 20 percent off for anyone who keeps five or more items.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Lets Viewers Pick the Plot", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byAttention, kids: Netflix just put you in charge.Netflix on Tuesday released a new episode on its streaming service of the animated show \u201cThe Adventures of Puss in Boots\u201d with an interactive twist. About a half-dozen times during the episode, viewers \u2014 most likely children \u2014 will be prompted to choose which plot point the show should follow. Each decision will send the story in a different direction.At one point, for example, viewers must decide whether Puss will confront nice bears or angry bears. On a touch screen, a press of the finger will do the work; on a television, a remote control will be required.The first interactive episode, called \u201cPuss in Book,\u201d will last 18 to 39 minutes (depending on which path viewers go down), with viewers being asked to make a decision every two to four minutes.\u201cThey are used to pressing play on the remote, setting it down and then just leaning back on the couch and letting Netflix roll,\u201d Carla Engelbrecht Fisher, the director of product innovation at Netflix, said of viewers. \u201cIn this case, we actually need them to hold on to the remote. We don\u2019t want it lost in the couch cushions. We need you to lean forward a little bit to engage with the choices.\u201dThe introduction of such a feature \u2014 which Netflix will roll out for another children\u2019s series next month, and a third next year \u2014 is, at this point, an experiment. But if it\u2019s a hit with subscribers, and if Netflix executives are impressed with the results, the implications for the TV industry could be significant.Although the streaming service has not made plans to feature this kind of interactive viewing in, say, a future season of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the potential is there for it to eventually expand beyond children\u2019s programming.The interactive initiative comes as Netflix is locked in a battle with the rival streaming services Amazon and Hulu over creating and acquiring as much children\u2019s programming as possible.Last year, Nielsen released a study that said that children 2 to 11 were watching two fewer hours of live television a day but that the amount of content they watched on digital platforms had spiked.Netflix said its interactive project was more than two years in the making. As the creative team behind \u201cPuss in Boots\u201d developed plot points, Netflix needed time to improve its technology. Netflix will release another interactive episode next month involving its \u201cBuddy Thunderstruck\u201d series. Next year will bring an interactive episode of \u201cStretch Armstrong.\u201dIt is an open question whether other streaming services will follow with similar interactive programming.Hulu has a virtual reality project in development tailored for adults for its VR app. The series, called \u201cDoor No. 1\u201d is a choose-your-own-adventure show that revolves around a 10-year high school class reunion, though it has not been picked up to series yet. There are no interactive children\u2019s programs in the works.Amazon declined to comment on any plans.Ms. Fisher said Netflix did not consult with educational experts before kicking off this experiment.Nevertheless, some experts applauded the effort on Tuesday. \u201cThey guessed right,\u201d said John Black, the director of the cognitive science program at the Teachers College at Columbia University.\u201cHaving kids think about different ways in how stories could play out will lead some to think more deeply about the stories and to comprehend them more deeply,\u201d he said.There are others, however, who have concerns about the sheer volume of children\u2019s programming developed by streaming services.\u201cA lot of this is unexplored territory,\u201d said Melissa Henson, program director for the Parents Television Council. \u201cThe potential pitfall is video streaming services aren\u2019t subject to the educational video requirements put on traditional broadcasters.\u201dWhether or not this kind of interactivity could be used with expensive dramas remains to be seen. TV\u2019s top dramatic shows can cost $7 million to $10 million an episode to produce. Adding shooting time, and various plot lines that only a percentage of viewers may see, would make costs rise further.At this point, Netflix is in wait-and-see mode.\u201cAs you can imagine, with two years of development, I\u2019m really excited to see how our members engage with this,\u201d Ms. Fisher said. \u201cFrom there, we\u2019ve built this tool set for our creators, and it\u2019s ultimately about finding creators who want to tell complex stories in this way. We\u2019ll see where things go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Amazon Be the Next Apple?", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBlood is running in the retail aisle. Sears, the most iconic name in American retailing, told its investors in March that \u201csubstantial doubt exists related to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d The appliance retailer HH Gregg went defunct at the end of May, and once-celebrated companies like Bebe and Limited are desperately trying to survive as online-only storefronts. The carnage has spread beyond empty shopping malls and big-box stores to the grocery trade. Last week, a poor earnings report cost Kroger, the nation\u2019s second-largest food retailer, 19 percent of its stock market value in a matter of hours \u2014 and that was before Amazon announced its acquisition of Whole Foods Market.So why might Amazon, the giant of online shopping, want to spend $13.4 billion on 461 brick-and-mortar stores of the sort other retailers are shedding left and right, along with a coffee roaster, 11 food distribution centers and manufacturing plants that do things like bake bread and gut fish? One obvious possibility is that Amazon could try to cut delivery times and costs by letting shoppers order online and then pick up their goods at the nearest Whole Foods. Another is that Amazon, for some reason, wants to grab a share of the low-profit grocery business, where online sales have not taken off, and see whether its technological wizardry can revolutionize food shopping.But there may be a less obvious explanation of Amazon\u2019s interest in Whole Foods: Perhaps it wants to be a bit more like Apple.There\u2019s no question that Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has built a hugely successful business. But a large part that business comes from selling the products of others. Only a tiny fraction of its retail sales \u2014 its Kindle e-reader, its Echo home control center, the audio books published by its Audible subsidiary, its Amazon Original videos \u2014 are exclusive to Amazon. The company makes money on the rest only if the prices on its website, with delivery costs added in, are below those elsewhere.What that means is that Amazon\u2019s margins are skinny. Last year its business that provides cloud-based web services for businesses and governments, with $12 billion of revenue, brought in three times the pre-tax profit Amazon reaped from $125 billion in retail sales.How to solve this problem? An envious glance at one of their company\u2019s best-known competitors might offer Amazon executives an answer.Apple doesn\u2019t need flashy stores in expensive locations to distribute phones and computers; those can be ordered on the internet. The Apple Stores, meticulously planned from their online appointment books to the transaction processing system that emails a receipt before you\u2019ve walked out the door, sell an experience, not electronics. Their purpose is to persuade customers that Apple has extraordinarily exciting products for which premium prices are entirely justified.Whole Foods started out with a similar idea, but its approach hasn\u2019t been working well. Its customer count dropped 2.6 percent last year as shoppers rebelled against high prices for food that didn\u2019t seem worth the premium. In a phone call with investors on May 10, John Mackey, the company\u2019s chief executive, said Whole Foods was striving for \u201clower costs, lower prices and higher sales.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like the mantra of a high-end retailer.Aside from its troubled grocery business, though, Whole Foods brings Amazon two important assets: affluent customers and locations in high-income neighborhoods. Amazon might use these assets to broaden its business in a way it cannot do online.Online retailing allows retailers access to millions of customers, but that\u2019s not always a benefit. One of the challenges of e-commerce is that it\u2019s difficult to segment the market. Every customer has access to the same web pages. Online merchants may take advantage of information about individuals\u2019 browsing history and past purchases to offer different prices to some than to others, but there\u2019s no way to make online shopping a special experience with Apple-style margins. For that, it\u2019s still critical to bring customers in the door.That\u2019s where Whole Foods comes in. Whole Foods\u2019s stores are sizeable, averaging nearly 40,000 square feet. Imagine Amazon carving out a fifth of that space, with separate entrances, and creating boutiques with well-trained staff and dynamic merchandising. Under the Amazon name or some newly created brand, those boutiques could sell exclusive products and services to shoppers on their way to grab a kale-and-red-currant salad for lunch or a pound of locally raised grass-fed beef for dinner, without detracting from Amazon\u2019s online business.They could sell excitement at profit margins Amazon will never achieve from selling books and backpacks on the internet \u2014 profit margins that look a lot more like Apple\u2019s.Marc Levinson, a historian and economist, is author of \u201cThe Great A&P and the Struggle for Small Business in America\u201d and \u201cAn Extraordinary Time: The End of the Postwar Boom and the Return of the Ordinary Economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Next Stop for Preet Bharara, Fired Prosecutor? His Brother\u2019s Media Firm", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byAs it turns out, Mr. Bharara is becoming something of a media Renaissance man. On Monday, he will officially announce that he is joining his younger brother\u2019s media company, Some Spider Studios. He is writing a book. And he has not stopped tweeting.Mr. Bharara will become an executive vice president at Some Spider, which Vinit Bharara started in 2014. He will also host a podcast called \u201cStay Tuned With Preet.\u201d (The phrase \u201cStay Tuned\u201d will sound familiar to anyone who attended his news conferences.)The podcast, which is scheduled to begin airing in the coming months, will explore justice and fairness issues and provide in-depth analysis on legal cases. Mr. Bharara also expects to write articles for Some Spider\u2019s news and entertainment website, Cafe, and he and Vinit Bharara plan to introduce a conference, Cafe Con, next year.As the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York for more than seven years, Preet Bharara, 48, was perhaps the most powerful federal prosecutor in the country. He prosecuted politicians on both sides of the aisle and earned a reputation for aggressively going after insider trading on Wall Street. He has repeatedly said he has no plans to seek political office, but that has not stopped the murmurings.So joining an upstart media company and hosting a podcast might not seem the next logical step in Mr. Bharara\u2019s career.Vinit Bharara, 45, said he projected that Some Spider would have more than $12 million in revenue this year and double that next year. And the company has made a bunch of hires in the last several months, including a new creative director who previously worked at BuzzFeed. One of its websites, Scary Mommy, is a hit among the parenting set.Mr. Bharara acknowledged in a joint interview with his brother at Some Spider\u2019s headquarters in the Flatiron district of Manhattan that joining the company did not represent the typical career path for a former federal prosecutor. But he said he was drawn to Some Spider because it would allow him an unfettered platform to pursue what he has always done: raise issues of justice and hold people accountable.\u201cIt\u2019s an extension of all the things I have been doing, although I no longer have the authority that I had before,\u201d he said.If Mr. Bharara\u2019s plans seem unconventional, it is worth noting that his interest in the media is not new. In the past, he has publicly expressed support for investigative journalism and has cited reporters\u2019 work that led to prosecutions by his office.Some Spider also gives him an opportunity to work not only with his brother but also with their childhood friend Marc Lore, a primary investor in the company. Mr. Lore and Vinit Bharara started an online diapers store, Diapers.com, in 2005 and later sold its parent company to Amazon for about $540 million. (Preet Bharara held a small investment in the company.) Around the time that Vinit Bharara founded Some Spider, Mr. Lore started Jet.com, an online bulk retailer that he sold last year to Walmart for $3.3 billion.Of course, both brothers said they hoped Preet\u2019s involvement would give Some Spider more heft and recognition.\u201cThis is a business,\u201d Vinit Bharara said. \u201cClearly, I see how this is going to benefit Cafe.\u201dThere may also be another reason Preet Bharara wants to work with his brother: more job security.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech, Fed, Trump: So Many Reasons to Worry About the Market", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseInvestors have seemingly been oblivious to claims of Russian interference in the election, the firing of a director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the appointment of a special prosecutor. As the second quarter ends this week, 2017 has so far been a banner year, with major indexes hitting records.But as the bull market rolls on, some see storm clouds on the horizon. \u201cValuations are high and it\u2019s one of the longest and largest bull markets in history,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. \u201cBull markets don\u2019t last forever. So the question is, when will the music stop?\u201dInvestors \u201care on a knife\u2019s edge,\u201d said Michael J. Kelly, global head of asset allocation for PineBridge Investments. With many still scarred by the financial crisis, \u201cthey see a potential disaster around every corner.\u201dThis month the so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which have led the market\u2019s rally \u2014 faced a sudden downdraft, which many market watchers called a warning of turbulent times to come. Those jitters were on display Thursday, as tech shares led a sell-off that put a dent in the major indexes.And then there\u2019s Mr. Trump himself, whose unpredictability and erratic behavior still have the potential to rattle markets.So I asked some prominent investors and market analysts whether they were pulling back from stocks, and how they viewed these latest developments.There\u2019s no question that these market darlings, which together have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of the market\u2019s gains, are expensive, and getting more so. Price-to-earnings ratios range from 38 (Facebook) to 184 (Amazon). Their market caps are so huge they dominate the indexes. They show up not only in so-called growth funds, but also in value and low-volatility funds. Should they embark on a sustained plunge, a bear market could quickly follow.The tremor in June was \u201ca warning shot across the bow,\u201d said Bill Smead, the founder of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. The Faang stocks \u201care showing all the classic signs of being overcooked,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat magazine hasn\u2019t had Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg on the cover? There\u2019s no question this can end very badly. But the market can stay irrational for a very long time. My sense is that there\u2019s one big blowout rally left in these stocks.\u201dMr. Stack noted that the Faang stocks had brief sell-offs last June and October, only to rebound. Still, he said, \u201cthe Faang stocks will be among the hardest hit in the next bear market due to the amount of money that flowed into them and the high expectations that have driven them higher.\u201dBut like Mr. Smead, he doesn\u2019t expect that to be imminent. \u201cWe\u2019re not buying them, but we\u2019re not necessarily saying sell,\u201d Mr. Stack said. He urged investors to rebalance portfolios that have become too heavily weighted in these stocks.Everyone I interviewed agreed that the Fed is the most likely catalyst for the next bear market, but that may still be years away.\u201cHistorically it\u2019s difficult to find a bear market that wasn\u2019t triggered to some extent by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think unwinding the long bond position as gradually as they\u2019re going to will have a significant impact. What would have an impact is if the Fed is forced to raise rates faster than everyone anticipates. The Fed has prepared investors for one more rate hike this year. That\u2019s where the potential surprise could come. If we see two or three by year\u2019s end, we\u2019re going to see definite headwinds and maybe a market top of some significance.\u201dMr. Kelly said the Fed had plenty of room to maneuver before stocks start to be affected. \u201cWe just had a once-in-70-year crisis that left very long scars. Businesses basically didn\u2019t invest for eight years. In tightening, the Fed is acknowledging that a monetary policy built on a very fragile economic backdrop is no longer appropriate. But we\u2019re just getting to the point now where people are crawling out of their shells and we\u2019re seeing more normal economic activity.\u201dMr. Kelly said bull markets typically last another three to four years after such a point in the economic cycle, and can even go another eight or nine. \u201cBull markets die from excess, not old age,\u201d he said.Mr. Smead agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re getting closer to normal rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be difficult for the stock market when it happens. People will be less willing to be adventurous. But that\u2019s still years away.\u201dOver at InvesTech Research, \u201cwe\u2019re still quite bullish,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cWe\u2019re not increasing cash reserves. We are rebalancing towards more defensive and out-of-favor sectors, like consumer staples and health care.\u201d\u201cThe risks don\u2019t lie with potential charges of obstruction of justice or even impeachment,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cFor political mayhem to upset the economic apple cart, it has to irreparably damage confidence at the consumer and business level. So far we don\u2019t see that happening. Consumer confidence and consumer sentiment measures are at 16-year highs, and C.E.O. confidence in April was the highest since 2004.\u201dNor have investors given up hope that a Republican Congress will still deliver business-friendly corporate tax reform and a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code, despite the president\u2019s troubles.At the same time, \u201cTrump shouldn\u2019t be looking to the market for vindication,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a Trump rally. He\u2019s basically riding on the Obama years. \u201cHis bottom line: \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to politics, and that\u2019s been a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Uber and Airbnb Became Poster Children for the Disruption Economy", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byNonfictionDuring the week of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in January 2009, three young would-be entrepreneurs \u2014 Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk \u2014 crashed on air mattresses in unfurnished rooms they had rented in a rundown house in Washington. They spent some of their days at a Metro station handing out fliers that urged strangers to offer rooms for rent, and in the evenings they fielded angry email complaints from a woman who had rented space in the basement. Despite the difficulties they faced that week, the huge demand for accommodations from people who had flocked to the inauguration convinced the group that the business they were hoping to create, which they called AirBed & Breakfast, would succeed if they persisted.Also in town for the festivities were two other hustling San Francisco startup jockeys, Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp. They had used a website to find more comfortable accommodations, but on Inauguration Day they couldn\u2019t get a cab and had to sprint miles in the wicked cold to get to the mall on time. Camp had been trying to convince Kalanick to join him in a startup that would allow people to summon a car with the push of a button on an iPhone. The cab problems they had in Washington, which were similar to what they experienced in Paris a few months earlier, helped persuade him that the company, then called UberCab, had potential.At certain moments in history, a confluence of technological and social advances creates the opportunity for a new field of innovation. That was happening at the beginning of 2009. A few months earlier, a reluctant Steve Jobs had been persuaded by his colleagues to allow other companies to develop apps for the iPhone. That happened just as Google Maps and GPS and other tools were enabling more wondrous mobile-based services. In addition, cloud services such as Amazon\u2019s allowed startups to store and process large amounts of data without building their own infrastructure. The explosive growth of Facebook had encouraged people to create trusted identities and share things online. And as the 2008 financial crisis receded, the overcaffeinated venture capitalists of Silicon Valley became frenzied in the pursuit of new potential unicorns.The result was the blossoming of a type of economic activity with many kludgy labels \u2014 the \u201csharing\u201d or \u201cgig\u201d or \u201con-demand\u201d economy \u2014 that do not quite capture its disruptive and transformative nature. What companies such as Airbnb and Uber have done in the past decade is take the peer-to-peer sharing of digital content that flourished online, through sites like Napster and YouTube and Facebook, and apply it to our physical world, including cars and rooms and scores of other goods, tasks and services.Three new fast-paced narrative books written by seasoned business journalists (all of whom I have known since my days in the magazine world) detail the personal, financial and social aspects of the rise of these companies. \u201cWild Ride,\u201d by Adam Lashinsky, executive editor of Fortune, is a crisp and lively look at both the good and bad aspects of the rise of Uber and its C.E.O., Kalanick. His Fortune colleague Leigh Gallagher has similarly produced a colorful account of Airbnb and its C.E.O., Brian Chesky, \u201cThe Airbnb Story.\u201d And Brad Stone of Bloomberg News has intertwined the two tales in \u201cThe Upstarts,\u201d a richly researched and highly readable narrative that provides additional layers of insight by weaving in contrasting stories of competing companies that failed.As happens on all of history\u2019s uncharted frontiers, the pioneers of the sharing economy have displayed an energizing mix of idealism and recklessness. Airbnb\u2019s founders came from a background of arts and design, rather than coding and engineering, which offered, contrary to the preaching of STEM education apostles, an advantage in a new economy built on connecting humans to other humans. As a child, Chesky used to visit the Norman Rockwell Museum near his home and spent hours sketching . \u201cOn a family trip to Florence one year,\u201d Gallagher reports, \u201che stood in front of the statue of David for eight hours, meticulously drawing it.\u201d Gebbia studied the violin, played jazz piano and originally planned to be a painter. They met at the Rhode Island School of Design, and they started their company when a big design conference came to San Francisco and there was a shortage of hotel rooms.Both managed sports teams while at R.I.S.D., and their tale illustrates the importance of team formation in innovation. Each brought different skills to their collaboration: Chesky evolved into a manager and chief executive, and Gebbia focused on product design. To complete the team, they brought in Gebbia\u2019s friend Blecharczyk, a computer science geek from Harvard who had started a software company when he was an undergraduate. \u201cNo one of us alone could have done this,\u201d Gebbia said. \u201cTwo of us alone couldn\u2019t have done this. But the combination of what Nate brings, what Brian brings, what I bring, put that together, and I think that\u2019s how we\u2019ve persevered through all the challenges.\u201dThat perseverance \u2014 indeed an insane persistence \u2014 was another component of their success. Having come up with a wacky marketing idea of repackaging breakfast cereal during the 2008 conventions in boxes featuring Obama or John McCain, they lived on the leftover cereal during the subsequent lean year of struggling to keep the company going. They used their scarce resources to fly to New York on weekends to watch how the early adopters were using Airbnb and offering to photograph for free the apartments that were listed on their site.In the case of Uber, both co-founders were already somewhat successful serial entrepreneurs. The idea for an on-demand car service originated with Camp, but Kalanick shaped it. He was a maestro of collaborative brainstorming. Like Steve Jobs, he firmly believed that collaboration happened best when people got together in the flesh, and he turned his San Francisco apartment into a gathering place he called the Jam Pad. \u201cIt was a kind of entrepreneurial safe house, a place where like-minded obsessives could gather in front of a whiteboard and debate the intricacies of building internet companies,\u201d Stone writes.At first neither he nor Camp wanted to run Uber, so they set out to add a manager to their team. Kalanick sent out a tweet, \u201clooking 4 entrepreneurial product mgr.\u201d A 27-year-old midlevel product manager for General Electric in Chicago sent back the most lucrative Twitter reply in history: \u201cemail me :) graves.ryan@gmail.com.\u201d Graves was hired, and the stock he got is now worth more than $1.5 billion.Collaboration, however, can only go so far. It is also necessary to have an intense, driven leader with the visionary brilliance and obstinacy of a Steve Jobs. After finally signing up full-time as C.E.O. in 2010 and edging Ryan Graves down a notch, Kalanick became that.Kalanick focused on beating back regulators, from San Francisco to Paris, who insisted that if Uber cars were going to function like taxis they had to adhere to the rules and licensing requirements that cabbies faced. He fought with a righteousness mixed with self-interest that caused most city officials to think of him as arrogant (or another word that begins with \u201ca\u201d). It was a classic case of technological disruption where there is merit to both sides: It was unfair to medallion taxi owners to allow a competitor that did not have to play by the same rules, and yet for years city officials had become so beholden to and intimidated by the taxi industry that the medallion and licensing system had become a way to protect the interests of the owners rather than of passengers.With his scorched-earth approach to rules, Kalanick not only won battles for Uber but also for a techno-libertarianism that was contemptuous of most government attempts to regulate disruptive innovation. \u201cUber\u2019s lawyers and lobbyists, who had begged him, unsuccessfully, to seek compromise and testify with humility, began to whisper in reverent tones about a new political dictate that contravened all their old assumptions. Travis\u2019s Law,\u201d Stone writes. \u201cIt went something like this: Our product is so superior to the status quo that if we give people the opportunity to see it or try it, in any place in the world where government has to be at least somewhat responsive to the people, they will demand it and defend its right to exist.\u201d He was right.Only once did Kalanick show caution. In 2012, Uber was still using only professional drivers, mainly in town cars. A competitor started a service named Lyft that allowed drivers to use their personal cars, sometimes festooned with a playful pink mustache. Kalanick, uncharacteristically, argued to regulators that this should be illegal. But when he saw Lyft gaining traction, he reversed himself and responded with a ride-sharing service called UberX that quickly became dominant.A good litmus test to determine a person\u2019s basic ideological outlook is to ask about Uber\u2019s use of surge pricing. To some, it is a sensible way to match supply and demand by encouraging more drivers to come out and some consumers to find other transportation during periods of peak demand. Hotels and airlines use variable pricing all the time. To others it smacked of gouging, especially when there were huge spikes in prices during Superstorm Sandy and a hostage crisis in Sydney. Some of the problems could have been avoided with a bit more sensitivity \u2014 Uber would have been wise to kick in its own financial incentives for drivers during a major crisis \u2014 but that was not an instinct that came naturally to Kalanick. \u201cAnyone who whined about surge pricing, in his eyes, was too thick to understand the laws of supply and demand,\u201d Lashinsky writes. The hard-driving testosterone-fueled culture of Uber eventually caused problems. Earlier this month, the board approved top management changes, which included having Kalanick take an indefinite leave of absence, after an independent investigation found a culture of sexism and disrespect pervaded the company.Chesky has been more sensitive to public concerns, but the complex issues raised by Airbnb are as challenging, especially in places where the service is dominated not by easygoing millennials renting out a spare bedroom but instead by developers who buy up multiple houses and apartments to convert into short-term rentals. That can destroy residential neighborhoods and decimate the supply of affordable housing. To his credit, Chesky has tried to deal with these issues as well as the problem of racial discrimination that had infected the service. I watched in admiration earlier this year as Airbnb and my hometown, New Orleans, painstakingly negotiated a complex agreement, with enforcement and taxing mechanisms, specifying the number of days per year each type of place could be rented on Airbnb, with distinctions made by neighborhood and by whether a place was owner-occupied.The benefits that Airbnb and Uber pioneered go beyond convenience. They allow people to make human connections in an era that has become much more institutionalized in the decades since family-run bed-and-breakfasts began being replaced by standardized hotel chains. Stepping into someone\u2019s personal car or apartment forges a bond of trust and, in Gallagher\u2019s words, \u201cyields a little vote of confidence in our fellow humanity.\u201d A disconnected society becomes slightly more connected, not just digitally but also physically.Stone saw this firsthand while covering Chesky on a visit to Paris in November 2015 when the terrorist attack that killed 130 people occurred. \u201cI Ubered home that night to my Airbnb, near the Cath\u00e9drale Notre Dame de Paris,\u201d he writes. \u201cOnce back, I received a frantic phone call from my worried host, Ivan, whom I had never met in person (he was out of town and had left me the keys) but who wanted to make sure I was O.K. The next morning, he emailed: \u2018I was relieved to hear you yesterday on the phone. I hope you are well today despite the critical times in Paris.\u2019 He invited me to stay for as long as necessary until the travel situation in the city returned to normal.\u201dUber and Airbnb, as embodied by their young billionaire leaders, represent, to their supporters, a radical expansion of freedom and a liberating empowerment of individuals to supply services as they please, without government interference. They have provided workers with added flexibility and sources of income, and they have created a new economy based on trust and earned reputations. Consumers rate their drivers and hosts, and they in turn rate us. When it works well it encourages all involved to be a bit nicer and restores the bonds of trust that have been fraying in our society.But as Stone points out, \u201cUber and Airbnb have also come to represent, at least to some, the overweening hubris of the techno-elite. Critics blame them for everything from destroying the basic rules of employment, exacerbating traffic and ruining peaceful neighborhoods to bringing unrestrained capitalism into liberal cities.\u201d On a deeper level, this new economy is disrupting not only old industries but also the entire concept of work. Instead of having \u201ca job,\u201d a growing number of people will, by desire or necessity, support themselves by juggling on-demand gigs. That presents an issue that goes well beyond the need for new regulations; it will require whole new ways to think about pensions, health care, benefits, sick leave, disability and retirement savings.A review on the cover this weekend about four books on the rise of Uber and other transformative start-ups includes outdated information about Travis Kalanick, one of Uber\u2019s founders. After the section had gone to press, Mr. Kalanick resigned as the company\u2019s chief executive; he is no longer merely on an indefinite leave of absence from that position. In addition, an accompanying picture caption also includes the outdated reference.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Deal for Whole Foods Starts a Supermarket War", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byShares of Walmart, Target, Kroger and Costco, the largest grocery retailers, all tumbled on Friday. And no wonder.Grocery stores have spent the last several years fighting against online and overseas entrants. But now, with its $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods, Amazon has effectively started a supermarket war.Armed with giant warehouses, shopper data, the latest technology and nearly endless funds \u2014 and now with Whole Foods\u2019 hundreds of physical stores \u2014 Amazon is poised to reshape an $800 billion grocery market that is already undergoing many changes.And much of the battle is expected to take place online, Amazon\u2019s home turf.\u201cThis shows that online is going to be very dominant in the grocery business \u2014 and very quickly,\u201d said Errol Schweizer, a former Whole Foods executive.The grocery business is facing a slew of upstart companies trying to figure out how to make a business of getting food on the kitchen table. Instacart delivers food from grocery stores to doorsteps, while FreshDirect delivers from its own warehouse. Blue Apron delivers boxes of food packaged to make meals.In addition, Lidl and Aldi, two European discount grocers, have recently announced enormous expansions in the United States. Aldi plans to invest $3.4 billion to grow from 1,600 stores to 2,500 stores by 2022, while Lidl, which recently opened a handful of locations, plans to operate 100 by the middle of next year.They are taking on a handful of major companies that have dominated the grocery market. Walmart supercenters, Kroger, Safeway and Publix accounted for about 36 percent of the market in 2013, according to the most recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture.While the grocery giants have been under attack, they have advantages of their own. Walmart has 4,500 stores, for example, compared with the 460 Whole Foods, putting it in far more markets. Walmart has also tried to move swiftly into e-commerce, setting up grocery pickup at many stores.A spokesman for Walmart, Randy Hargrove, said the company felt \u201cgreat\u201d about its \u201cfast-growing\u201d e-commerce and online grocery businesses.But even before the deal, many of the stores have been showing signs of stress. On Thursday, shares in Kroger fell nearly 19 percent after the company lowered its guidance.On Friday, the company put on a strong face.\u201cAs we\u2019ve done in the past, we will evolve our business to deliver what our customers want and need today and into the future,\u201d Kristal Howard, a spokeswoman for Kroger, said in an email.In recent years, competitors moved into its niche. Kroger and Albertsons have bulked up their organic offerings, and organic food has been one of the strongest areas of growth in the grocery business: Last month, the Organic Trade Association announced that sales of organics had increased by 8.4 percent to $43.3 billion, or more than 5 percent of grocery sales.But with Amazon, the equation changes entirely.It is unclear how Amazon will use Whole Foods, as the company would not go into detail about its plans. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, is known for making unconventional decisions. But he is also known for having big ambitions, and that could mean a more frontal assault on Walmart \u2014 a face-off between the old and the new dominant forces in the retail world.Any heated competition among retailers could be a win for consumers who will be able to pick up their organic sugar beets from Canada, fresh turbot from the North Atlantic and papayas from Guatemala at ever-cheaper prices.And Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods may allow the e-commerce giant to court a much different customer. Walmart\u2019s vast rural footprint often allows it to be the cheapest option in town, while Whole Foods\u2019 stores are in more affluent areas.Amazon recently began to creep into an important part of Walmart\u2019s turf \u2014 low-income customers \u2014 when it slashed the price of its Amazon Prime membership for people with electronic benefits transfer cards, which people on food stamps and other government assistance programs use. Those customers pay $5.99 a month rather than the $10.99 a month or $99 a year other customers pay for Prime, which provides free two-day shipping, streaming video and other benefits.The deal could also help solidify Amazon\u2019s existing grocery business.The company\u2019s strategy could be \u201cas much defensive as it is offensive,\u201d said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a global consulting firm. Mr. Flickinger recently returned from a research trip to Britain, where he said Lidl had significantly \u201cslowed down\u201d Amazon\u2019s growth.\u201cShoppers, vendors, people with whom we talked across the country said that Lidl literally transformed everybody\u2019s standard of living, whether they shopped at Lidl or not,\u201d he said. \u201cThey either stopped shopping at Amazon, or they shopped a lot less.\u201dAs the supermarket war heats up, some grocery store chains, analysts said, may recognize they cannot compete in a grocery store price war.\u201cThe bottom-tier operators are either going to have to close stores or they\u2019re going to get sold to the next bigger guy in order to stay alive,\u201d said Mickey Chadha, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Corporation.Morton Williams, a chain of upscale grocery stores in New York, has already adjusted to newer digital delivery services like Fresh Direct and Instacart. But now, executives fear how Amazon could use its digital expertise to expand Whole Foods in Manhattan.\u201cFresh Direct and Instacart are already factored into our numbers,\u201d said Avi Kaner, the co-owner of Morton Williams. \u201cThe thing that could result in greater risk to us is if Amazon invested in the Whole Foods locations in Manhattan to make them more delivery-centric.\u201dTim Hayduk, 46, likes to shop at the Morton Williams near his office and also enjoys the sense of community that independent grocery stores engender.

{"Headline": "Google Said to Face $1.2 Billion Antitrust Fine, but Battle With Europe Looms", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byEuropean Union officials are expected to issue a record fine of at least 1.1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion, against Google as soon as Tuesday for breaking the region\u2019s tough competition rules.Yet the hefty penalty and its timing, which were confirmed by two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity, are likely to be quickly overshadowed by a more complex problem: How should Google comply with the decision to rein in its power?That dilemma will now take center stage as the tech giant fights doggedly to protect its crown jewel \u2014 its closely guarded search algorithm \u2014 from the prying eyes of regulators and, possibly, its competitors.Potentially heavy-handed intervention may raise the hackles of Google and other companies in the American tech world, which could claim that, once again, Europe is unfairly targeting companies from the United States. The region\u2019s officials deny such accusations.No matter the final outcome, analysts warn that jockeying for greater regulatory control over Google\u2019s services in Europe will drag on for months, if not years, as the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, tries to turn its expected antitrust decision against Google into a reality.\u201cThe issue they\u2019re facing is, how does the European Commission solve the underlying problem\u201d of Google\u2019s suspected antitrust abuse, said Christian Bergqvist, an associate professor of competition law at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. \u201cIt will be very difficult to structure any remedy.\u201dHow Google responds to these demands will be left to the company, which must provide the region\u2019s authorities with potential technical solutions to counter its perceived antitrust abuse. Officials can ask for more changes if they are not satisfied with Google\u2019s initial proposals.Experts and some of the company\u2019s competitors claim that any changes would most likely require greater oversight of Google\u2019s products, including a potential independent monitor over its search services (and, potentially, its algorithms) in Europe to guarantee that it continues to comply with the antitrust ruling.A spokeswoman for the European Commission declined to comment on the potential announcement.\u201cWe believe strongly that our innovations in online shopping have been good for shoppers, retailers and competition,\u201d Al Verney, a company spokesman, said in a statement.The coming announcement against Google represents a watershed moment for the search giant, which holds more than 90 percent of the market in online search across Europe. Still, the potential fine represents a mere fraction of the company\u2019s $90.3 billion in revenue in 2016.Other American tech companies, including Apple, Facebook and Amazon, also remain under investigation by European officials for a variety of antitrust, tax and privacy reasons. And while the companies deny any wrongdoing, the continued focus, and potential hefty fines, have given European authorities an increasingly large say over how much of the internet is regulated. That position comes despite European tech companies mostly failing to keep pace with their American counterparts.\u201cEurope has been more aggressive in enforcement against monopolies than the U.S.,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law and economics at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. \u201cIn Europe, we\u2019re more threatened by the dominance of big companies.\u201dAs Google and its foes prepare for battle over how the search giant should comply with Europe\u2019s upcoming antitrust decision, much attention will focus on lessons from a previous failed attempt to settle the online shopping case in 2014.Analysts and Google\u2019s rivals stressed that any new proposal must go further than these previous efforts, which included placing competitors\u2019 ads online alongside Google\u2019s own digital advertising.To ensure the company complies, one remedy may include the regular monitoring of Google\u2019s action by an outside group. The company, however, also has the option of removing some of its specialized search results altogether, or returning them to what they looked like before Europe\u2019s investigation began almost a decade ago.\u201cAll that the complainants are asking for is that Google restores the level playing field,\u201d said Shivaun Raff, a founder of Foundem, a British comparison shopping site that was the first company to file a complaint against Google.For Michael Weber, director of Hot Maps, a German digital mapping company, the conclusion to Europe\u2019s antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s online shopping service cannot come soon enough.\u201cI can\u2019t image life without being a complainant against Google, it\u2019s been going on for such a long time,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who first filed his claim in 2011. \u201cIt has become something like a marriage.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Upside of Bad Genes", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported byThere\u2019s a well-to-do couple thinking about having children. They order a battery of genetic tests to ensure that there\u2019s nothing untoward lurking in their genomes. And they discover that they each carry one copy of the sickle cell gene.If their children inherit two copies of the gene, they could develop anemia, which can cause joint pain, weakness and even death. So what should the couple do?For the last two decades, they\u2019ve had the option of artificially fertilizing embryos and selecting only those that lack the sickle cell trait. Now a new possibility is on the horizon: They may soon be able to edit the offending gene right out of their own sperm, eggs or embryos, erasing it from their bloodline forever.The technology that will allow this is called Crispr-Cas9. It\u2019s relatively cheap and it permits scientists to change DNA with an ease and precision that until now has been impossible. The promise is that it will transform medicine by vanquishing previously incurable diseases. The method is probably at least a few years away from being applied in clinical settings. Still, some are already worried that, when it comes to improving our own genome, we don\u2019t yet know enough about how genes work to wield this power without unintended consequences.In 2015, the journal Science declared Crispr the \u201cbreakthrough of the year,\u201d and researchers in China edited human embryos for the first time. Scientists also convened a meeting in Napa, Calif., to talk through the ethical implications of this new technology, and to draft guidelines. A fundamental issue that came up, says Jennifer Doudna, a biochemist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a pioneer in Crispr research, was that scientists really don\u2019t understand enough about the upside of genes we consider \u201cbad\u201d to begin editing them willy-nilly.Sickle cell was a case in point. The gene is usually found in people who live in, or whose ancestors came from, sub-Saharan Africa, the Arab world and India; in those places, having one copy of the gene can prevent the worst symptoms of malaria. Of every four children our imaginary couple might have, one will probably be afflicted with sickle cell disease, but two would most likely be protected from malarial disease.Ditto with the gene variants that cause the lung disease cystic fibrosis. In parts of northwest Europe, about 1 in 25 people carries a single copy of the gene. And while two copies cause disease, it has long been hypothesized that having just one protects against tuberculosis \u2014 the White Plague that ravaged Europe for a few hundred years.Both these genes probably helped us survive in the past, so is it wise to remove them now?Earlier this year, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine issued recommendations on editing embryos and other germ line cells, calling for a high degree of caution but not prohibition. An obvious counterargument to the precautionary approach is that the world has changed. We in the developed world don\u2019t inhabit an environment rife with malaria and TB anymore. We have drugs to protect us when infection strikes. So doomsday preppers notwithstanding, removing injurious and outdated genes is a logical step in our (now self-directed) evolution.The problem, Dr. Doudna points out, is that new pathogens for which we don\u2019t have cures continue to emerge \u2014 like H.I.V. and SARS and drug-resistant variants of TB. In fact, as the world has become more crowded and interconnected, the emergence of new pathogens has accelerated. Those \u201cbad\u201d gene variants might still come in handy, she says.More broadly, genetically diverse populations tend to be more resilient, precisely because they have more genetic resources to draw on when unforeseen challenges arise.What protects the Russians from their own genetic inheritance? Or better phrased, what makes the Finns vulnerable?Finnish scientists think that exposure to a particular community of microbes \u2014 one that more resembles the microbiota of our less hygienic past \u2014 prevents the diseases from emerging in Russia. That\u2019s important because at least some of the gene variants associated with autoimmune disease are probably useful; they most likely helped us battle infections in the past.So instead of rewriting our genetic code, a better approach might be to change the interplay between our genes and environment \u2014 in this case by altering the microbes we encounter.This dynamic may also apply to a gene linked with dementia. Carriers of the ApoE4 variant have an up-to-fourfold increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In 2010, scientists at Northwestern University found that the gene was more prevalent in tropical and polar populations than in those from mid-latitudes, presumably because it served some function in those regions. Then, strangely, the gene was linked to enhanced cognitive performance in children living in Brazilian slums. And last year, Ben Trumble, an anthropologist at Arizona State University, and colleagues published an intriguing study suggesting that the gene might improve brain function in elderly people living in the Bolivian Amazon.The tribe he studied, called the Tsimane, subsist mostly on what they grow and hunt in the jungle, and about two-thirds have intestinal parasites. Dr. Trumble discovered that if elderly ApoE4 carriers harbored parasites, their cognitive abilities improved relative to noncarriers with parasites. Only carriers without parasites suffered cognitively.How this might work is unclear. The gene seems to increase the absorption of cholesterol, which is necessary for brain health. Parasites, of course, steal cholesterol and other fats, either by extracting them from your food or by drinking your blood. Maybe people who have the gene are better at countering this thievery. Or perhaps their superior fat absorption affords them more energy to fight parasites, too many of which can also erode brain function. And maybe because the Tsimane exercise plenty and eat low-fat fare, the gene never becomes problematic for them as it does in the developed world \u2014 unless they lack parasites.Whatever the mechanism, here\u2019s the point: A gene that we now think increases the risk of cognitive decline may actually protect against it in other environments.Most biomedical research is done on modernized populations in industrialized cities. But if we edit out genes based on how they work in those populations exclusively, \u201cwe might disrupt processes that we didn\u2019t realize were important,\u201d Dr. Trumble says.Finally, there\u2019s diet. Back in the late 1980s, the anthropologist Fatimah Jackson discovered that the prevalence of the sickle cell trait varied considerably across Liberia, a small country. It was more common in the northwest than the southeast, even though the infection that makes the trait advantageous \u2014 malaria \u2014 was everywhere.Scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City had recently discovered that ingesting cyanate salts could prevent the \u201csickling\u201d of red blood cells that leads to the anemia and pain of sickle cell disease. Dr. Jackson knew that a related compound, cyanide, was common in foods across Africa, particularly in the staple crop cassava (which you may know as tapioca). She was also aware that, at the right dose, cyanide could directly protect against the malaria parasite. She realized that regular consumption of cassava \u2014 more common in the Southeast than the Northwest \u2014 could, by working as an antimalarial drug, affect the prevalence of the sickle cell trait, by making it less advantageous.Something different was happening in the Northwest, though. Dr. Jackson, who is now at Howard University, thinks that while cassava consumption in the region was insufficient to protect against malaria directly, people who had two copies of the sickle cell gene still ate enough to partly avoid sickling. In that population, diet may have prevented a genetic disease from fully manifesting.Certainly, some genes will turn out to be only detrimental, and provide no advantage. But there are bound to be other cases like these, in which genes deemed harmful can aid survival or at least cause less damage in other surroundings. As the epidemiologist David Barker said, \u201cgenes are not Stalinist dictators.\u201d They respond to what\u2019s going on around them \u2014 to environment.We evolved in environments that are radically different from today\u2019s, and some of our genes may work better in those environments. This complicates the idea of trying to perfect the human genome with technology. Given how much the world has changed in just the past 150 years, and how much it\u2019s likely to change again in the next 150, the question is, \u201cWhat environment will we optimize our genes for?\u201dMoises Velasquez-Manoff, the author of \u201cAn Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Disease,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Amazon became serious only in late April, when the company\u2019s team signed confidentiality agreements. That means some shareholders, notably Jana Partners, an activist owner of an 8 percent stake, could be receptive to a higher price. A grocery industry buyer like Walmart could also cut costs, helping to justify paying more than the 27 percent premium Amazon is offering.Then there\u2019s the defensive value. If investors were right to sell off grocery chain stocks across the board in the United States and Europe on news of Amazon\u2019s plunge into the sector, it could be worth keeping Jeff Bezos\u2019 online giant away from Whole Foods.Walmart is one of few candidates. Its $230 billion market value dwarfs other listed United States grocers, including Target, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market, as well as Albertsons, which is private. Its balance sheet cash could in theory finance nearly half the acquisition, and with total debt at about 1.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, it could borrow more.Adding an upscale brand might help Walmart attract new customers and lift its grocery business. Yet that would be a change of direction. Its recent strategy has been to improve its e-commerce offering, including with Friday\u2019s deal to buy the men\u2019s clothing online retailer Bonobos.Financially, too, topping Mr. Bezos\u2019 offer would be tough. Assume Walmart is able to cut Whole Foods\u2019 operating costs by a generous 3 percent, or about $450 million a year. Taxed at 35 percent and capitalized on a multiple of 10, those savings are worth just under $3 billion today, roughly the same as Amazon\u2019s premium. Walmart would be irrational to pay more, especially since it would also have to cover a $400 million break fee.This math applies to any interloper. And even hefty cost cuts wouldn\u2019t make Whole Foods\u2019 Ebitda expand enough for the after-tax return on an acquisition to exceed the 8.6 percent weighted average cost of capital Morningstar attaches to the company. Whatever magic Mr. Bezos has in mind, his advisers have done the trick of making his deal hard to beat.Advertisement"}

So physically I\u2019ve been able to free solo this for eight or nine years. But it\u2019s taken me a long time to feel safe enough on it that I want to do it.What did your mother say?She said \u201ccongratulations\u201d of course. Then she said, \u201cThanks for not telling me ahead of time.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know?No. You don\u2019t want to tell a lot of people because then obviously they are worried and then they project that on to you and then you start to worry.

Yet Jeff Bezos\u2019 company won\u2019t walk away with all the spoils. Customers are worried about being locked in, and that will keep competitors in business.Companies have come to realize it is simpler, cheaper and more convenient to store data and run applications on servers owned and operated by the likes of Amazon, Alphabet and Microsofts. Uncertainty over the cost implications is receding rapidly, according to surveys conducted by Bain and Morgan Stanley and highlighted by Kleiner Perkins\u2019s Mary Meeker in her annual \u201cInternet Trends\u201d presentation last week.The providers of cloud services have grown rapidly as a result. First-quarter revenue at Amazon Web Services was about 3.5 times as big as in the same period three years ago. At $3.7 billion for the period, it accounted for more than 10 percent of Amazon\u2019s total sales, and it was by far the most profitable slice. The operating margin for Amazon Web Services has nearly doubled over the last two years to around 25 percent.Not coincidentally, information technology managers have started to worry about the difficulty of switching cloud suppliers \u2014 a particular problem if one outfit, like Amazon Web Services, comes to dominate. This concern rocketed between 2012 and 2015, according to Ms. Meeker, with the proportion of respondents bothered by it surging from 7 percent to 22 percent.As in other sectors including, for instance, finance, companies will often ensure that at least two suppliers of each service stay in business, to retain the option of shifting between the two and maintain price competition. This doesn\u2019t always happen in technology.

{"Headline": "Katy Perry Woke Up. She Wants to Tell You All About It.", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "Ms. Perry, who has a new album, \u201cWitness,\u201d says she no longer wants to be the frothy pop star she once was. And she intends to reveal her true self.Supported byA dizzying array of police lights flashed up and down the West Side Highway on a damp Thursday in May. President Trump was visiting the U.S.S. Intrepid, snarling traffic outside the Javits Convention Center, where Katy Perry was performing at a corporate showcase for her new partner, YouTube. The last time she was in the building was election night, when she had been preparing to toast the victory of Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent.\u201cIt was a revelation, it was a reckoning,\u201d she said of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss. She started downing drinks and reached out to the nearest person for physical support: Lady Gaga, also there to celebrate the election of the first female president. There they were, \u201cGaga and I just looking at each other, and being like, [expletive] it, we need to touch each other,\u201d Ms. Perry said. And for a minute, two of the biggest pop stars in the world held hands.But she said she had an awakening on election night tied to misogyny in her past. And she is undertaking a strenuous effort to prove she isn\u2019t the same frothy Katy Perry as before, making over her look, her music and her vocabulary. For 96 hours, timed to the album\u2019s release, she spread that message of \u201cunity and communication\u201d via filibuster \u2014 a nonstop YouTube live stream called \u201cWitness World Wide,\u201d organized into segments (a therapy session, meditations, a cathartic chat with RuPaul) where the words \u201csafe place\u201d came up a lot and Ms. Perry worked out to her own album.Thanks to Madonna\u2019s restlessness, female pop stars are expected to reinvent themselves every few years, but there\u2019s no guarantee that listeners will accept the changes. For Ms. Perry, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher: She believes she is now revealing her true self. The old Katy Perry is gone.\u201cEvery day when I think I know something, the universe shows me that I need to learn another lesson,\u201d she told me in a Manhattan shared work space. \u201cSo I stand here today, more so than any other day, saying I know nothing. I literally know nothing.\u201d (Ms. Perry often veers into platitudes, but she is consistent: During the live stream, she wore an \u201cI Know Nothing\u201d T-shirt for yoga, and the phrase is currently her Twitter bio.)\u201cI feel very empowered,\u201d she continued, \u201cextremely liberated, liberated from the conditioning of the way I used to think, spiritually liberated, politically liberated, sexually liberated, liberated from things that don\u2019t serve me.\u201dShe said she stopped drinking (for now) on Jan. 15, and she has been attending group therapy with her family. Her parents are Pentecostal pastors, and Ms. Perry, who was born Katheryn Hudson, was raised in a strict religious tradition. \u201cI went to that dark place that I had been avoiding, and I dug out the mold,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was not fun, but I did that \u2014 I\u2019m still doing that.\u201dChange is also the theme of the throbbing \u201cWitness,\u201d an introspective, less pop-driven album that\u2019s a departure from her last two records, \u201cPrism\u201d (2013) and \u201cTeenage Dream\u201d (2010). It\u2019s her first LP not to feature work from her longtime collaborator Dr. Luke \u2014 \u201cI had to leave the nest,\u201d she said; he declined to comment for this article \u2014 though she continued her partnership with the Swedish hitmaker Max Martin.Ms. Perry told me she didn\u2019t play her new music for Capitol Records, her label, until a few weeks before our interview, which is late in the process. If the label minded, it isn\u2019t saying so. \u201cI like to allow her the freedom to keep pursuing her artistic vision, and obviously we support her fully in all her endeavors,\u201d said Steve Barnett, the chairman and chief executive of the Capitol Music Group, adding that choices about her sound and team were Ms. Perry\u2019s call: \u201cI think she\u2019s earned and deserved that.\u201dThe person charged with helping create Ms. Perry\u2019s vision was Lauren Glucksman, 28, who is credited with A&R on the album, stepping into this role for the first time on a full LP. (She formerly worked as an assistant to the singer Ellie Goulding and managed the songwriter Banks.) \u201cWe have a very honest rapport with each other, we have very similar taste, and ultimately I saw my job as trying to translate what\u2019s in her mind and in her heart,\u201d Ms. Glucksman said. Both women were listening to a lot of electronic pop, and the way Ms. Perry explained it, she decided, \u201cI\u2019m going to stop making a playlist and just be the playlist.\u201d\u201cPeople don\u2019t let people grow,\u201d Ms. Perry said. \u201cThey just want a time capsule. And they want them to be one thing. And we have to start reimagining that.\u201dKaty Perry says she doesn\u2019t want to make playlists, but wants to be the playlist.It didn\u2019t take long for the outrage machine to ramp up in real time. Three days before our interview, Ms. Perry greeted me in her dressing room at \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d where she was performing on the season finale, and interrogated me with questions while maintaining some of the most penetrating eye contact I\u2019ve experienced outside of an ophthalmologist\u2019s chair, her already wide eyes blazing under heavy swooshes of silver glitter.\u201cIntention is everything,\u201d Ms. Perry told me, repeating one of her mantras. \u201cAll I was trying to do is build a bridge.\u201d\u201cWhen people are just talking about \u2018Teenage Dream,\u2019 I\u2019m like, please talk to me when you\u2019ve done that. And lived through it. Because it was [expletive] intense. And amazing and beautiful and horrible all at the same time.\u201dPart of the pressure stemmed from maintaining her hypersexual image, which Ms. Perry takes responsibility for helping create. \u201cI used to be scared of intimacy, I used to use my sexualization as attention, I used to oversexualize myself because that was the only way I knew how,\u201d she said. (Ms. Perry, who hit No. 1 with \u201cI Kissed a Girl,\u201d later explained why she holds queer women in high esteem: \u201cI admire that they\u2019re doing it for themselves. They are not doing it for the male gaze.\u201d) It\u2019s easy to read her drastic haircut and new stylistic choices \u2014 her live stream finale outfit covered her in neck-to-toe sequins \u2014 as a reaction to having worn whipped-cream bras in the past.Ms. Perry credits her shift in perspective on her sexuality \u2014 she calls it \u201ca full sexual liberation\u201d \u2014 to resolving issues with her father. \u201cThe reality is that I was retriggered on the election,\u201d she said. \u201cI was retriggered by a big male that didn\u2019t see women as equal. And that had been, unfortunately, a common theme in my upbringing.\u201dWhen she needs to speak with somebody who can relate, Ms. Perry said she turns to Sia, a songwriter and artist who has gone to great lengths to control how much (or in her case, how little) the public sees of her inner life. \u201cI think she\u2019s presently challenging old held beliefs about herself and that even in this day and age, cutting all your hair off and having an opinion is NOT WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT,\u201d Sia wrote in an email message. \u201cThey would prefer you to make cute pop and to stay in your lane.\u201d She added: \u201cI hide behind my wig, while she is out there taking bullets for the rest of us ... The less brave ... you know?\u201dIn our interview, she proclaimed herself devoted to dialogue but spoke in a near uninterrupted monologue. She griped frequently about the internet (the \u201cWild Wild West,\u201d a quip she repeated on the live stream nearly every time I tuned in), but she boasts the highest number of Twitter followers of any user and just allowed her digital audience to watch her eat, sleep and spread her new gospel on a 96-hour infomercial. She returned to words and phrases: good things are \u201cbeautiful\u201d; a desirable mate is \u201ca man of quality and equality\u201d (and for the record, she said Orlando Bloom was one, and Mr. Mayer and even Mr. Brand \u201care beautiful in their own right\u201d). And she revisited a pet subject: things that are \u201cnot real.\u201d\u201cAll the awards shows are fake,\u201d she said, \u201cand all the awards that I\u2019ve won are fake,\u201d she added, explaining that they don\u2019t represent the audience. \u201cThey\u2019re constructs.\u201dThe old Katy Perry wasn\u2019t a construct, she explained, and she isn\u2019t dead. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill her, because I love her, and she is exactly what I had to do then,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a con artist, I didn\u2019t con people, like, that was just me. And this is me now.\u201dMs. Perry\u2019s awakening has been tapped as a marketing strategy for \u201cWitness,\u201d and the live stream was selling her authenticity: If you dig hearing about her new perspective, maybe you\u2019ll enjoy her song \u201cPower.\u201d While there are still plenty of relationship songs on \u201cWitness\u201d that will have fans wondering which of her beaus she misses more than she loved, seven tracks deal plainly with her new mind-set. The most direct is \u201cBigger Than Me,\u201d a statement of purpose akin to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cMan in the Mirror\u201d (\u201cBut my intuition says there\u2019s a bigger mission I must embrace/So I\u2019m, I\u2019m pushing my thoughts to a new place\u201d).Though some of the subject matter is thorny and emotional, Ms. Glucksman described the making of \u201cWitness\u201d as \u201cthe most joyful professional process I have ever experienced.\u201d And Ms. Perry said she\u2019s the happiest she\u2019s ever been.\u201cIt\u2019s a departure, and it\u2019s a necessary evolution that I have to take,\u201d Ms. Perry said. \u201cAnd I know that sometimes it feels publicly like I\u2019m dragging cement blocks, but like, the pyramids were made out of cement blocks \u2014 or not cement. But do you know what I\u2019m trying to say? I\u2019m gonna get there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos Goes Grocery Shopping", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAmazon\u2019s comfort with low margins and knowledge of logistics make it so fearsome a rival that investors in the sector ran for cover.A relentless focus on the long-run opportunity of selling practically everything to everyone has been the hallmark of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and chief executive. For most of its history, Amazon, a nearly half-trillion-dollar company, has been run at break-even with its prodigious cash flow plowed back into price reductions, expansion into new areas and investment to ensure faster delivery.So groceries are a natural target. Americans spend about $800 billion a year on Cheerios, kale and ground beef, according to Cowen research. It is also a business whose profitability is notoriously low. Whole Foods, for example, generated a net margin of 3.2 percent last year. That is astronomical by Amazon\u2019s standards. Its own margin was 1.7 percent.The deal nevertheless creates some seismic shifts. For one thing, it is Amazon\u2019s biggest acquisition ever by a considerable sum. While Mr. Bezos has been tinkering with rolling out bookstores, Whole Foods vastly increases Amazon\u2019s bricks-and-mortar presence with 460 stores. And the deal expands Amazon\u2019s work force by about a quarter.In exchange for this strategic deviation, Amazon gets access to a great many wealthy customers and information about their food-buying habits. Mr. Bezos could easily extend the benefits of his company\u2019s popular Prime membership into goods and services at grocery stores, thus giving them additional reason to buy even more from Amazon.It also has been trying to shrink shipping costs. Amazon lost $7 billion in subsidizing deliveries last year. Having customers pick up their purchases in Whole Foods stores might help.There is a strong sense from investors that Amazon is upending the entire business. Its own market value increased by $15 billion on the news. More significantly, it caused about $30 billion to disappear from Costco, Walmart Stores, Kroger, SuperValu and other grocery vendors.Fears of Amazon\u2019s domination went global, as British supermarket chains were hit, too. And it is possible that delivery start-ups like Instacart may be affected. Grocery stores aren\u2019t a winner-take-all proposition, but Amazon may be about to eat a lot of lunches.Advertisement"}

In recent years, it has expanded to offer shirts, suits and other men\u2019s clothing, and has opened dozens of brick-and-mortar locations, as well as boutiques in Nordstrom department stores, a previous investor in the start-up.Yet even as Bonobos has become a more conventional retailer, it has maintained its online ethos, offering generous shipping and return policies and calling its customer-service agents ninjas. Even its stores have a twist \u2014 customers are fitted on site, but the clothes are later mailed.This sensibility, and Bonobos\u2019s sustained growth, are what attracted the interest of Walmart.Less than a year later, Mr. Lore and his team have already begun transforming the way Walmart sells things online \u2014 and now have bought their most prominent retail brand to date.But for now, there are no plans to offer Bonobos\u2019s $98 chinos or $128 dress shirts in Walmart\u2019s 5,000-plus stores. Instead, Walmart is hoping to learn from Bonobos. Its co-founder and chief executive, Andy Dunn, will oversee Walmart\u2019s digital brands, which also include the independent women\u2019s brand ModCloth.\u201cI saw Walmart acquire Jet and then ModCloth, and, I thought, they get the future of e-commerce is brands,\u201d Mr. Dunn said in a telephone interview.The deal is taking place as the retail industry faces broad upheaval, as scores of traditional bricks-and-mortar sellers struggle to keep customers who are increasingly used to buying online. Onetime retail stalwarts like Macy\u2019s and Sears have seen sales drop as they struggle to figure out e-commerce strategies, while a host of smaller retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection.It has also gotten serious about acquiring more brands born on the internet. Walmart and Mr. Lore had already spent $166 million buying start-ups like ModCloth and Shoebuy.com. But buying Bonobos is the biggest step yet.\u201cIt\u2019s another rung in our strategy of moving fast,\u201d Mr. Lore said in a phone interview.To Mr. Lore, buying a brand like Bonobos is not just about adding third-party apparel. It is also about acquiring the audiences that these start-ups have already attracted, and using Walmart\u2019s resources to expand.\u201cWe\u2019re offering customers something new by buying these proprietary brands,\u201d he said.Partnering with Walmart \u2014 the biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer around \u2014 might have seemed extremely off brand for Bonobos.But Mr. Dunn argued that since the Recode report, his company has not suffered a blow to its growth rate. And he contended that working for the Walmart of 2017 was exciting, particularly with Mr. Lore \u2014 a longtime mentor \u2014 reimagining the company\u2019s e-commerce strategy.\u201cI\u2019m here because of Marc,\u201d Mr. Dunn said, adding, \u201cI think Walmart is misunderstood in some ways.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Takata has promised the United States government that it will pay $125 million in compensation to victims. The costs from the recalls are continuing to rise. Takata said it could not yet estimate the scale of the liabilities that it would ultimately face, but the figure is expected to be more than $10 billion.The bankruptcy is thought to be the largest by a Japanese manufacturing company.The sale to Key Safety, a company based in Michigan but owned by a Chinese company called Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corporation, is noteworthy because Japanese politicians and officials have often cajoled domestic businesses to save competitors rather than let them fail or be scooped up by foreigners.The European Central Bank said on Friday that the banks had failed or were likely to fail \u2014 a precondition for winding them down.The two banks account for 2 percent of Italian deposits, but there was a risk that their troubles could undermine confidence in Italy\u2019s fragile financial system.The money for the rescue plan will come from a fund established by the Italian government for the banking system, which has been criticized for being at odds with officials\u2019 vows not to spend taxpayer money to save sick banks.But there was fear that imposing losses on middle-class depositors and investors, like those who bought the troubled banks\u2019 senior bonds, might drive people who suffered losses into the arms of extremist parties and add to political turmoil in the country.And there were concerns that the failure of these banks could imperil the economies of the northern Italian regions they serve.The rescue plan protects depositors from losses and will spare investors who own senior bonds in the two banks.Owners of junior bonds, which earn a higher interest rate but are riskier, will lose their money. As will shareholders in the banks, which will be liquidated. Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy\u2019s second-largest bank, after UniCredit, is expected to buy the healthy operations of the two banks for a symbolic purchase price.After President Trump fired Preet Bharara as United States attorney in March, speculation swirled about Mr. Bharara\u2019s next move.

Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far the stocks had run. Two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple.Hedge funds could be bailing out, too.The question now is whether retail investors will stick with them.The group of Uber executives that formed the inner circle around Travis Kalanick, the chief executive, is fraying.The A-Team, as it was informally known, shared Mr. Kalanick\u2019s aggressive approach and helped him barrel into new markets around the world.\u2022 Emil Michael, Uber\u2019s senior vice president for business and its second in command, left the company.\u2022 Eric Alexander, a top executive in Asia, was fired for mishandling the rape case of an Uber passenger in India.\u2022 Thuan Pham, Uber\u2019s chief technology officer, is under scrutiny for what many see as his shortcomings in listening to employee complaints.Uber staff members who sell even part of their stock back to the company under a repurchase program must give the voting rights associated with all their shares to Mr. Kalanick, according to a copy of the buyback agreement obtained by The New York Times.That voting power is crucial as the ride-hailing service wrestles with its issues and as the board considers whether Mr. Kalanick should take a three-month leave of absence.Even if he took time off, his ability to influence the direction of the company would appear to be secure, thanks to his \u201csuper-voting shares.\u201dAnd employees must follow the \u201cinstructions of Travis Kalanick,\u201d according to the buyback agreement, \u201cwith respect to any and all matters\u201d that are submitted to a shareholder vote.Advertisement"}

We remain committed to putting our scale and inventive culture to work in ways that are good for the environment and our customers.Murray EnergyThe Ohio-based company, one of the largest coal-producing companies in the country and a prominent supporter of Mr. Trump, praised the decision. The chief executive, Robert E. Murray, said in a statement:We applaud President Trump\u2019s steadfast leadership and his delivery on this important campaign commitment. Indeed, complete withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord is an integral part of President Trump\u2019s energy agenda.In following through on his promise, President Trump is supporting America\u2019s uncompromising values, saving coal jobs, and promoting low-cost, reliable electricity for Americans and the rest of the world.UberToday\u2019s announcement from President Trump that the United States will not honor the agreement is a huge disappointment.

Therefore IBM supported \u2014 and still supports \u2014 U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement. This agreement requires all participating countries to put forward their best efforts on climate change as determined by each country. IBM believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it.ShellPeabody Energy The company, a multinational coal-mining giant based in St. Louis, said in a statement:We believe that abiding by the accord, without significant changes, would have substantially impacted the U.S. economy, increased electricity costs and required the power sector to rely on less diverse and more intermittent energy. Peabody continues to advocate for greater use of technology to meet the world\u2019s need for energy security, economic growth and energy solutions through high efficiency low emissions coal-fueled power plants and research and development funding for carbon capture.CargillIt is extremely disappointing. Exiting international accords like the Paris Agreement will negatively impact trade, economic vitality, the state of our environment, and relationships amongst the world community.

{"Headline": "Developers Lure Buyers to Cities, Even as Prices Stall", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Peter Fader, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has long yearned for the city life. For 20 years, though, he and his wife, Mina, have deferred that dream, living in a Philadelphia suburb to raise their two children in a 3,500-square-foot home.That will change this month, when the couple \u2014 with the children grown and gone \u2014 moves into a new luxury high-rise in the heart of Philadelphia. They will have expansive 11th-floor views, an easy walk to the shops, restaurants and cultural attractions of downtown and a car-free commute to work.The Faders are like many other empty-nesters in their 50s and 60s, as well as young professionals, helping fuel a boom in multifamily housing in the country\u2019s big cities. The growth has been so strong, for so long, that some leading economists have started warning about overdevelopment, worried that flattening prices could leave builders struggling to pay their debts.The Federal Reserve in February expressed \u201cgrowing concern\u201d about commercial property, including large apartment buildings, in cities like New York, Boston and San Francisco. An index of national commercial property prices from Green Street Advisors, a real estate research company, has gained sharply since the recession although has largely stalled since late 2016.But developers do not appear to be pulling back, no matter the warnings, believing that there are many more people like the Faders. In a sign that the supply of housing will continue to swell in coming months, the number of building permits, a forward-looking indicator, rose 5.7 percent in April compared with a year earlier, the Census Bureau said.\u201cIt\u2019s exploding,\u201d said Ron Caplan, the president of PMC Property Group, a Philadelphia-based developer of rental properties in markets including Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Columbia, S.C., referring to the growth in demand for urban residential rentals.Mr. Caplan said that his company\u2019s experience was at odds with the fears about overbuilding.\u201cSo far the development that we\u2019ve done has been embraced by a continuing larger population,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have found that the buildings continue to fill up.\u201dIn Baltimore, PMC just finished work on a downtown apartment building that has been leased at the quickest rate Mr. Caplan has seen since starting the company in 1981. He expects the property to be fully leased in six months, about twice as fast as is typical.In Columbia, the company is now leasing the Palmetto Compress, a former cotton warehouse, after creating 200 apartments for the local student population. With two months\u2019 leasing to go before the start of the new school year, 90 percent of the building is leased, Mr. Caplan said.He attributed the surging demand to the increasing livability of downtown areas that were once rife with crime and poverty but that have become more appealing with the influx of new residents who are educated, professional and often wealthy.\u201cWhat they have discovered is that it\u2019s a lot more fun being social than it is going home at the end of the day, closing the door and watching television,\u201d Mr. Caplan said.In Seattle, Lake Union Partners, a local developer, has built seven rental-apartment houses since 2012 for a total investment of about $200 million, with a vacancy rate of 4 percent, said Joe Ferguson, the company\u2019s principal.Mr. Ferguson said that the market was being driven by vigorous hiring by major employers, including Amazon and Microsoft, and by employees\u2019 increasing willingness to move to previously marginal areas like Pioneer Square, Seattle\u2019s oldest neighborhood. The employers include Weyerhaeuser, a lumber company, which has responded to the influx of young adults by moving from a suburban location about 40 minutes south of downtown Seattle to a new building in Pioneer Square.\u201cThey are doing this because they are having to compete for a lot of the same talent as the tech companies and other major employers who are recruiting at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to offer something that\u2019s attractive to their future employees.\u201dIn the Milwaukee area, some baby boomers are moving into the downtown area from the suburbs, encouraged by suburban housing prices that have finally recovered from the 2008-9 crash, said Barry Mandel, the president of Mandel Group, a developer of multifamily buildings. Some of the boomers are buying condos while others are opting to rent city properties and preserve the capital from the sale of their houses.Other older clients are driving the construction of urban enclaves, or \u201cnodes,\u201d within suburban developments, where suburban amenities like shops, restaurants and religious institutions are available within walking distance of people\u2019s homes, Mr. Mandel said.The \u201cnodes\u201d are in strong demand from buyers in their 40s and older, Mr. Mandel said, noting that one such development was 100 percent leased before construction ended about 18 months ago, while demand in another community was unexpectedly strong.While suburbanites may welcome the opportunity to sell their lawn mowers or donate clothing to charity when moving to city apartments, there are limits to their zeal for downsizing, said Carl Dranoff, the developer of Philadelphia\u2019s One Riverside building, where the Faders are moving.The 82 apartments originally planned for One Riverside, a 22-story building, have been reduced to 68, the result of combining some units for buyers who wanted more space after years in the suburbs, Mr. Dranoff said. By the official opening on May 2, 80 percent of the building \u2014 the first newly constructed condo tower in central Philadelphia for seven years \u2014 had been sold.The building, offering marble counters, private balconies, and river views, sells 1,000- to 1,100-square-foot apartments for $1.5 million to $2 million, Mr. Dranoff said. A 2,500-square-foot unit costs from $2.5 million to $2.8 million.While such prices are beyond the reach of most buyers, they are contributing to a citywide erosion in affordability, and mirror the trend in other big cities, said Rick Sauer, the executive director of the Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporations, which advocates affordable housing, among other causes.\u201cThere is a larger impact on the overall cost of housing in the city,\u201d Mr. Sauer said. \u201cWhile there\u2019s new housing stock being created on the high end in particular to respond to the demand, over all what you are seeing is that housing costs in the city are going up very significantly.\u201dAt One Riverside, the Faders recognized that the building met many of their long-term goals for city living and jumped at the chance to buy.\u201cIt\u2019s the last place we\u2019re ever going to buy \u2014 we\u2019re here for keeps,\u201d Professor Fader said. \u201cWe are all in on the condo because the city has so much to offer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Diana Krall on Handling Grief, and \u2018Finding Romance in Everything\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byMs. Krall met Mr. Short more than two decades ago, while still an aspiring musician. At the time, she was too shy to tell him she played the piano. \u201cI would just sit in the background, in that chair,\u201d she said, pointing toward the back of the room, as far from the stage as the intimate space allows.The Diana Krall of today isn\u2019t hiding in any corners. Now 52, she is easily the most high-profile female jazz artist of her generation, with a string of gold and platinum albums as well as film and TV projects, including an upcoming Amazon series adapting the children\u2019s book series \u201cPete the Cat.\u201d (Ms. Krall and her husband, Elvis Costello, voice Pete\u2019s parents.) Ms. Krall is now eager to engage that veteran stature by mentoring younger musicians the way Rosemary Clooney, Marian McPartland and others encouraged her. And on Wednesday she will perform at the Beacon Theater, supporting her latest album, \u201cTurn Up the Quiet,\u201d a collection of standards released in May that was firmly guided by her artistic authority.\u201cIf she had an idea for something, and it felt definite, she would let us know,\u201d said the drummer Jeff Hamilton, a frequent collaborator who played on the record, \u201cwhereas in the past she might have said, \u2018Is this O.K. with you guys?\u2019\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t finish sentences; I go all over the place,\u201d Ms. Krall said, which is true, to the extent that in her enthusiasm about any given subject \u2014 movies, photography and family are consuming interests \u2014 she seems eager to leave nothing and no one out, deflecting any praise directed toward her in the process. Discussing the artists she has admired, or has been lucky to work with or would like to work with more often \u2014 all three lists are endless \u2014 she\u2019s less a name-dropper than a breathless music nerd, quietly geeking out over Joe Lovano and Wynton Marsalis, or Julie London and Ms. McPartland, whom Ms. Krall first phoned when she was 17. (Ms. McPartland returned the call when Ms. Krall wasn\u2019t home; her father took the message.)Over more than two decades in the public eye, during which she has become half of an atypically durable celebrity couple, and a mother \u2014 she and Mr. Costello have twin boys, now 10 \u2014 she has lost a stream of close relatives and mentors, and the album is a reflection of her progress in dealing with grief.\u201cIt gets to the point where you need to laugh,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we had so much fun making this record; that\u2019s what I hope comes through.\u201dMs. Krall recruited and led three ensembles for the album, one of them featuring the bassist John Clayton and Mr. Hamilton, who both began working with Ms. Krall when she was 19. In Ms. Krall\u2019s early days, Mr. Hamilton recalled, \u201cRay Brown would call her \u2018Foot,\u2019 because she would stomp her feet when she played the piano \u2014 not tap them, but stomp them. She knew when it was time to get hot, to turn it on.\u201dFor Ms. Krall, the jazz and pop standards on \u201cQuiet,\u201d like the many others she has performed through the years, represent not the past but the enduring. \u201cIt\u2019s not about a period of time or a demographic. It\u2019s about finding romance in everything, in beauty or in things that are sad.\u201dShe sees great American songs as living documents, endlessly open to reinterpretation: \u201cListen to how Bill Evans and Oscar Peterson and Teddy Wilson played the same music, or how Sheila Jordan and Rosemary Clooney and Al Jarreau sang the same song. Charlie Parker invented bebop over these songs. That\u2019s what makes me feel completely satisfied, the freedom in it.\u201dIf motherhood and loss have made Ms. Krall more aware of her mortality, she\u2019s not preoccupied with it. \u201cSomeone the other day said to me, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re 52!\u2019 And I thought, \u2018It\u2019s O.K., dude.\u2019 Then you think, \u2018I wonder if Joni Mitchell went through this.\u2019 But it\u2019s liberating, in a way,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019m more comfortable in myself than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "All the Ways Apple\u2019s iOS 11 Will Change Your iPhone", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byApple\u2019s latest operating system for iPhones and iPads is set to roll out on September 19th, bringing with it a number of new features and tweaks that are designed to make your phone safer to use and more customizable.We all know how dangerous texting, or using your phone in general, while driving can be, but it doesn\u2019t stop people from thinking they can get away with it. Plus, buzzing alerts on your phone are distracting even if you don\u2019t look at them (and sometimes it seems like they never stop). Apple\u2019s next update will include a possible solution to that problem: It will automatically block notifications when your phone thinks you are behind the wheel.Texts sent via iMessage will also be intercepted. When one arrives, the phone will send an automatic reply saying you are driving and that you\u2019ll respond when you get to your destination. (You can program your phone to let some numbers through the blockade, so loved ones can reach you in a pinch.) When the phone has determined that you\u2019ve stopped driving, your screen will come back to life, and you can catch up on everything you\u2019ve missed.The Control Center, that panel full of easily-accessed buttons and tools you see when you swipe up from the bottom of your iPhone screen, will also get an overhaul in the new update. Soon all the controls will be located on one colorful, widget-filled page.Some have complained that the new layout is confusing and cluttered, but it doesn\u2019t have to be: The Control Center will be customizable, so you can add as many (or as few) widgets as you like, including quick access to your camera, calculator or Apple TV.Additionally, there\u2019s a new toggle for the iPhone\u2019s \u201cLow Power\u201d mode, designed to save battery life while you\u2019re out without a spot to charge your phone. The new Control Center also features quick accessibility settings, including options to magnify your screen, change the brightness, make text display larger (or smaller), enable Do Not Disturb mode, and more. And each setting now makes use of Apple\u2019s \u201c3D Touch\u201d feature, where pressing and holding on an icon brings up additional useful options.Siri, Apple\u2019s personal assistant program, will get an overhaul too. The company said the program will soon have \u201ca new, more natural voice\u201d that will be more \u201cexpressive\u201d than the robotic lilt it currently has. At the conference last week, some audio of both the male and female voices were played to showcase its more nuanced pronunciations. But the biggest changes for Siri will be under the hood, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence.Here is what that means: Apple says Siri will learn so much from you that it will be able to anticipate your needs and make suggestions before you even ask for them.For example, it will offer news stories based on things it has learned you like. If you\u2019re texting a friend about a film you saw or a place you visited, Siri will auto-type the name of the movie or the place. It will suggest new searches for you in Safari based on articles you\u2019ve read. It will automatically queue up songs you like, suggest songs it thinks you will like or answer trivia questions about songs you play.Siri is going to know a lot about you.iOS 11 will also help save storage on your phone. When your storage runs low, a new optional feature will automatically remove apps you don\u2019t use very often. It is called \u201cOffload Unused Apps\u201d and you can turn it on by going to Settings, then tapping General. The selected apps are removed, and you get back all of the space they were using, which can be especially useful for people who\u2019ll need to make room for more photos, for phone updates, or just to download music or movies for a long flight.Don\u2019t worry, though. Your phone will keep any data you have associated with the deleted app, which will display as a gray icon after it has been removed. If you ever want to reinstall it, all you have to do is tap the gray icon and everything is back to the way it was.Apple\u2019s mobile payment system, Apple Pay, will also get a boost with the new update. Using your credit or debit card, you will be able to send money to anyone who also uses iOS11 with just a text message, which can be especially useful for splitting the check at a restaurant, paying someone gas money, or even paying the rent if you\u2019re close with your landlord. You even get an electronic receipt that shows the payment went through.This article was initially published on June 12, 2017, and was updated on September 18th, 2017. It was updated again on September 20th to note that Apple Pay is not available at launch. Advertisement"}

But even as e-commerce grows, it isn\u2019t absorbing these workers.Supported byJOHNSTOWN, Pa. \u2014 Dawn Nasewicz comes from a family of steelworkers, with jobs that once dominated the local economy. She found her niche in retail.She manages a store, Ooh La La, that sells prom dresses and embroidered jeans at a local mall. But just as the jobs making automobile springs and rail anchors disappeared, local retail jobs are now vanishing.\u201cI need my income,\u201d said Ms. Nasewicz, who was told that her store will close as early as August. \u201cI\u2019m 53. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dMs. Nasewicz is another retail casualty, one of tens of thousands of workers facing unemployment nationwide as the industry struggles to adapt to online shopping.Small cities in the Midwest and Northeast are particularly vulnerable. When major industries left town, retail accounted for a growing share of the job market in places like Johnstown, Decatur, Ill., and Saginaw, Mich. Now, the work force is getting hit a second time, and there is little to fall back on.Moreover, while stores in these places are shedding jobs because of e-commerce, e-commerce isn\u2019t absorbing these workers. Growth in e-commerce jobs like marketing and engineering, while strong, is clustered around larger cities far away. Rural counties and small metropolitan areas account for about 23 percent of traditional American retail employment, but they are home to just 13 percent of e-commerce positions.E-commerce has also fostered a boom in other industries, including warehouses. But most of those jobs are being created in larger metropolitan areas, an analysis of Census Bureau business data shows.Almost all customer fulfillment centers run by the online shopping behemoth Amazon are in metropolitan areas with more than 250,000 people \u2014 close to the bulk of its customers \u2014 according to a list of locations compiled by MWPVL International, a logistics consulting firm. An Amazon spokeswoman noted, however, that the company had recently opened warehouses in two distressed cities in larger metropolitan areas, Fall River, Mass., and Joliet, Ill.The Johnstown metropolitan area, in western Pennsylvania, has lost 19 percent of its retail jobs since 2001, and the future is uncertain. At least a dozen of Ooh La La\u2019s neighbors at the mall have closed, and a \u201cGoing out of business\u201d banner hangs across the front of the sporting goods store Gander Mountain.\u201cEvery time you lose a corner store, every time you lose a restaurant, every time you lose a small clothing store, it detracts from the quality of life, as well as the job loss,\u201d said John McGrath, a professor of management at the University of Pittsburgh Johnstown.This city is perhaps still best known for a flood that ravaged it nearly 130 years ago. After rebuilding, Johnstown eventually became prosperous from its steel and offered a clear path to the middle class. For generations, people could walk out of high school and into a steady factory job.But today, the area bears the marks of a struggling town. Its population has dwindled, and addiction treatment centers and Dollar Generals stand in place of corner grocers and department stores like Glosser Brothers, once owned by the family of Stephen Miller, President Trump\u2019s speechwriter and a policy adviser.When Mr. Trump spoke about \u201crusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation\u201d in his Inaugural Address, people like Donald Bonk, a local economic development consultant, assumed that Mr. Miller \u2014 who grew up in California but spent summers in Johnstown \u2014 was writing about the old Bethlehem Steel buildings that still hug long stretches of the Little Conemaugh River.The county voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump, eight years after it helped to elect Barack Obama. (It also voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, but not by as wide a margin.)Here and in similar towns, when the factory jobs left, a greater share of the work force ended up in retail.Sometimes that meant big-box retailers like Walmart, which were often blamed for destroying mom-and-pop stores but at least created other jobs for residents. The damage from e-commerce plays out differently. Digital firms may attract customers from small towns, but they are unlikely to employ them.Some remaining retailers are straining for solutions.Randy Clark remembers when his Miller\u2019s Clothing Store, a family-run men\u2019s wear shop, employed twice as many people and sold 20 pairs of pants a day. He knows he needs a website, but attracting digital customers is the least of his concerns. Brands that he sells, like Tommy Bahama and Southern Tide, will not even let him sell their products online, where he would compete with their own e-commerce operations, he said.So instead, Mr. Clark has focused on the store itself. He renovated the first floor to attract customers from farther away, customers who might have more money to spend and more places to go than Johnstown. He bought new furniture and new floors, installed a coffee machine, and donated old sports coats and corduroy jackets to make room for fresh inventory. He wears a suit and tie to work six days a week, and says he does not own a pair of jeans.\u201cNot a lot of people dress up anymore,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t dress the part, who will?\u201dTom Apryle IV takes the opposite approach at his jewelry store.Metalworkers, office clerks and executives \u2014 thousands of workers used to stream in and out of the factories here every day. When they got engaged or celebrated anniversaries or just wanted a nice diamond bracelet, they often went to Apryle\u2019s, a jewelry store that Mr. Apryle\u2019s great-grandfather opened in 1902.But fewer people can afford his products now that the good jobs are long gone, and Mr. Apryle has had to make adjustments.A cash-for-gold sign hangs in the window. He started selling knickknacks on eBay. Eventually, he stopped wearing a tie.\u201cI might as well be comfortable,\u201d Mr. Apryle, 46, said, gesturing to his wrinkled T-shirt and tennis shoes. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here to impress.\u201dThe story of America\u2019s Johnstowns is not just the story of retail, or e-commerce, or how men don\u2019t buy suits and ties at Miller\u2019s the way they used to. It\u2019s also about men like Mr. Apryle, who wouldn\u2019t even have a place to wear them.\u201cI was the last generation to see it booming and prosperous, and people were employed,\u201d said Mr. Bonk, 53, the economic development consultant, who grew up in Johnstown. \u201cIt disappeared in my lifetime.\u201dJust as Johnstown scrambled to adapt to the decline in manufacturing that began a generation ago, local leaders are now looking at how to navigate a future with a much diminished retail economy.To help revitalize the area, the county hired Mr. Bonk, whose parents ran a corner grocery store here for more than 40 years and made enough money to send him and his brother to college.Mr. Bonk has returned, determined to make downtown thrive again. But he does not have dreams of bringing back the department stores of his youth. He knows that consumers these days want to spend their money more on experiences than things, and that neighborhood stores are competing against digital upstarts that do not need as many workers and often have far more resources.As he walks briskly down Main Street, Mr. Bonk points out the new businesses that stand shoulder-to-shoulder with empty storefronts. There is The Vault, a day spa in an old bank building, and the Press Bistro, which, he excitedly points out, has an area for live music.These places are evidence, he says, that other people are committed to restoring Johnstown.\u201cThey want to see it be a healthy, thriving community, like where they grew up,\u201d he said.Mr. Bonk is inspired by Pittsburgh, another former steel town that revived its economy by attracting new businesses, including an Amazon distribution center and the fleet of trucks that came with it. But he knows that the Pittsburgh metro area, with a population of 2.4 million, is 17 times as large as Johnstown.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about what\u2019s next,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re essentially thinking of Johnstown as an economic development laboratory.\u201dMr. Bonk isn\u2019t counting on Amazon coming here.A picture caption on Monday with an article about the loss of retail jobs misspelled, in some copies, the surname of a jewelry store owner and the name of the business in Johnstown, Pa., that carries his name. He is Tom Apryle IV of Apryle\u2019s jewelry store (not Arpyle).Rachel Abrams reported from Johnstown, Pa., and Robert Gebeloff from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Texas Governor Revives Stalled Transgender Bathroom Bill", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 Gov. Greg Abbott reignited one of the most divisive issues in Texas politics on Tuesday, calling lawmakers back to the Capitol for a special session of the Legislature in part to consider a bill that would reinforce the state\u2019s effort to regulate bathroom use by transgender people in public buildings.An attempt during the regular session by conservative lawmakers and pastors to pass legislation to regulate bathroom use had been unsuccessful by the time the session ended on Memorial Day. But on Tuesday, Mr. Abbott, a Republican, ordered a 30-day special session starting in July and put on the agenda a bathroom bill that would prevent municipalities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances designed to protect transgender people. The special-session agenda also includes bills that would limit property taxes and keep several state agencies operating.\u201cAt a minimum, we need a law that protects the privacy of our children in our public schools,\u201d Mr. Abbott told reporters at the Capitol in Austin.In doing so, Mr. Abbott ignored the concerns of local and national business leaders but earned swift praise from social conservatives, some of whom had complained that he had remained largely on the sidelines in the debate. Critics said Mr. Abbott, a former judge who is viewed by many as more cautious than his predecessor, Rick Perry, had capitulated to the extreme right, and to one of his Republican colleagues, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who led the push for the restrictions.In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Patrick praised what he called the \u201cbig and bold special-session agenda,\u201d which he said \u201csolidly reflects the priorities of the people of Texas.\u201d\u201cMy take is that he is clearly panicked about the far right, and he feels the need to shovel as much red meat to the far right of his party as he can,\u201d said State Representative Chris Turner, a Democrat who was the campaign manager for Wendy Davis, Mr. Abbott\u2019s Democratic rival in 2014.In a recent interview at his Capitol office, Mr. Abbott pushed back against that idea. \u201cThe positions that I\u2019ve fought for in my first session and in this session are unalterable conservative principles, so it\u2019s just who I am,\u201d he said.Mr. Straus\u2019s attempt to loosen the bathroom restrictions in the House was rejected by Mr. Patrick and Senate leaders. The resulting stalemate threatened the operation of several state agencies, including the one that licenses doctors. The failure by the Legislature to pass legislation to keep those agencies operating put added pressure on Mr. Abbott to call a special session.\u201cA special session was entirely avoidable,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cThere was plenty of time for the House and Senate to forge compromises.\u201dIt would effectively ban local regulation of discrimination. The bill would prohibit cities, counties and school districts from passing anti-discrimination measures to protect any class of people already protected under state law. And it would nullify existing policies in San Antonio, Dallas and other cities that allow transgender people to use the public bathroom that matches their gender identity.Manny Fernandez reported from Houston, and David Montgomery from Austin, Tex.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What No One Ever Tells You About Tiny Homes", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byDomestic LivesMy husband and I share a 492-square-foot apartment in Cambridge, Mass. We inhabit a \u201cmicro apartment,\u201d or what is sometimes called a tiny house. This label is usually proudly applied to dwellings under 500 square feet, according to Wikipedia. We are unwittingly on a very small bandwagon, part of a growing international movement.But deep inside the expensive custom closets and under the New Age Murphy beds, the pro-petite propaganda has hidden some unseemly truths about how the other half lives. No one writes about the little white lies that help sell this new, very small American dream.Here, on the inside, we have found small not so beautiful after all. Like the silent majority of other middling or poor urban dwellers in expensive cities, we are residents of tiny homes not by design, but because it is all our money can rent.Tiny houses are booming. The movement, whose origins fans often link in spirit all the way to Thoreau\u2019s cabin at Walden Pond, became increasingly popular after the 2008 housing crash. Living small has come to signal environmental mindfulness and restrained consumerism.Our apartment in Cambridge was built in 1961, part of an earlier wave of utopian interest in tiny affordable housing. Our space occupies most of the lower third of a two-unit, three-story building. There is a contiguous row of nine such pairings \u2014 pint-size below, family-size above \u2014 on our street. The original developer\u2019s vision was that income from renting the lower units could help cover the mortgage for the owners\u2019 homes above.The most striking feature of our small lives is the unavoidable, domineering presence of the plastic laundry hamper originally bought from Target in 2007. Embarrassing, ordinary objects like the hamper are empowered in small spaces; they become tyrants. In a larger home, this perfectly functional item might recede quietly into a closet or laundry room.Our unattractive $10 centerpiece occupies approximately 0.4 percent of our home\u2019s surface area, but visually, it seems much larger. In an otherwise horizontal bedroom landscape (a queen-size mattress on the floor), the hamper looms high and white above the rest of the room. It often reminds me of the Capitol in Lincoln, Neb. \u2014 a piece of monumental architecture designed to dominate the prairie, to force man\u2019s will over nature.Tickets for the Tiny House Conference (\u201ctiny houses, big conference\u201d) in Portland, Ore., in April cost $349. The event featured inspirational talks like \u201cDownsize Your Space and Life\u201d and \u201cFuture of the Movement.\u201d In Charlotte, N.C., you can hire a tiny house life coach to help with your transition.Life in our tiny home is characterized above all by shabbiness. Like the apartment\u2019s pervasive, undomesticateable dust bunnies, the threadbare feeling grows and grows simply because it already exists.No one warns you that everything is more concentrated in a tiny house, that the natural life cycle of objects accelerates.Our things are aging faster than they did in their previous homes. We sit on our lone couch more hours a day than in any previous dwelling. The cushions are fading, the springs sagging, the corners fraying. Our rug is balding along our daily paths, starkly revealing repetitive routines: back and forth to the coffee machine, to the couch, to the sink, to the couch. The denudations look like cow paths cut through sage brush \u2014 invasive affronts on the landscape. Everything in our tiny house is worked over more, used harder.Here, even smells take up space. We once made a meal that called for caramelizing three pounds of onions. For hours the onions melted in their pan. Technically they were taking up less and less space, but somehow they intruded more. In a tiny house, the smell of slowly sweated onions is an inescapable, cloyingly rich aroma; a scent to drive men \u2014 and women \u2014 mad.The eau de onion spread to everything. It clung especially to the moist bathroom towels, and to the laundry drying in the bedroom. We were never clean again. Fresh from the shower, we immediately smelled of onions \u2014 of tiny house. For weeks, smelling like old onions became one of our micro lives\u2019 certainties. The scent\u2019s preferred repository, I eventually learned, was my New Age, polyester sports bra.\u201cIt smells like onion,\u201d my husband had certified weeks later. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem like a good thing to wear.\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t not wear it.\u201d And that was true. I did wear it, but the bra\u2019s coolly advertised moisture-wicking technology seemed designed to activate the old onions. I carried the smell with me deep into the city. You can never really leave a tiny house; it goes with you everywhere.For generations, writers have warned about romanticizing the lives of the poor. Beware the nostalgie de la boue. Small can be a bad fit.So we daydream big. Dreams of unfashionable, politically incorrect, old American aspirations that our generation isn\u2019t supposed to believe in anymore. Dreams of design features so vast that they sound like foreign countries. I dream of kitchen islands. I dream outside this box.Gene Tempest is a writer and historian who lives in Cambridge, Mass.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s, Mike\u2019s and Cade\u2019s Week in Tech: More Uber, With a Dash of Amazon", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported byBitsYou know what I do care about? Artificial intelligence. No, I\u2019m not referring to your intellect, Farhad. I\u2019m making a quick segue into introducing our newest addition to the tech team, Cade Metz. He just joined us.O.K., that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m not a bot. I\u2019m just some hack who covers A.I. The truth is: A.I. is a long way from mimicking the behavior of a Times reporter. I hope.I have to say, I was really impressed with this whole exercise. I think tech companies have long been too reluctant to talk about the potential dangers of their technology. It\u2019s great that Facebook \u2014 after, of course, a lot of questions and prodding arising out of its role in the election \u2014 is taking these issues seriously. But Cade, you\u2019re our resident A.I. expert, so could you explain what exactly Facebook is doing, and whether it\u2019ll work?Some of the stuff they talk about, like identifying an image known to be related to terrorism, will work well. But other stuff, like the experimental system that seeks to identify online conversation and other natural language that points to terrorism, won\u2019t work really well for years. (Hint: experimental is a key word). That kind of thing requires A.I. that is still very much under development.The other key bit is where they say: \u201cA.I. can\u2019t catch everything.\u201d That\u2019s an understatement. When it comes to catching unwanted behavior on Facebook\u2014 whether it\u2019s someone planning an act of terrorism or spreading fake news \u2014 Zuckerberg and company still need help from real live humans who see this stuff as it happens. That means Facebook users who can flag questionable content with a click, and it means the many contractors hired to review what has been flagged and remove what needs to be removed. This is stuff is very hard, and it will continue to be very hard until A.I. gets a lot better.All that said, I agree with you, Farhad. Hard stuff should be taken seriously.In Thacker\u2019s case, he was among the researchers at Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Lab in the 1970s who built the Alto, the machine with the graphical user interface that spawned the Macs and the PCs and, eventually, the smartphones that are such a big part of our everyday lives. Plus, he helped design Ethernet, the networking technology that linked the Altos together \u2014 and now links all the machines in your office, not to mention the thousands of machines inside the giant data centers that feed all the internet apps you use.Think of it like this: When Steve Jobs died, he deserved avalanche of tributes that arrived from across the globe, and Thacker deserves much the same.These are huge changes. I\u2019m not sure if people who don\u2019t follow the tech industry get this \u2014 a few months ago, it was unimaginable that Kalanick, who has overwhelming control of the company, could ever be pressured to step away. And if Uber actually follows through on its plan to remake its culture, it will operate like a completely different company.But that\u2019s what makes me so skeptical of this plan. Can a $70 billion company really change so radically?To be honest, a lot of this seems to hinge on the personality of Travis, who is famously aggressive and obsessive. And while he\u2019s said he\u2019s taking time off right now, I do wonder whether that will hold true \u2014 especially since Uber is undergoing its most prolonged set of crises, um, ever.I think companywide DNA, instilled and fostered by the founders, is seriously difficult to change. Just ask Twitter.That said, we should give Uber a chance \u2014 just like it is giving peace a chance! \u2014 and see what the company looks like six months to a year from now.What Amazon is good at is building enormous supply chains and physical infrastructure (warehouses, trucks, planes, even drones) that provide ways of delivering goods to your door much quicker than competitors can. By the same token, Whole Foods puts more Amazon groceries closer to you. Those stores aren\u2019t just stores. They\u2019re part of the supply chain.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Last, Jeff Bezos Offers a Hint of His Philanthropic Plans", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "Supported byInside WealthJeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, is well on his way to becoming the richest person in the world, with a net worth of more than $80 billion. What\u2019s less certain is what he plans to do with his fortune, and how he could reinvent philanthropy.Citing a homeless program in Seattle, Amazon\u2019s hometown, that the company is working with, he said he was seeking to help people \u201cat the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact,\u201d adding, \u201cIf you have any ideas, just reply to this tweet...\u201dThe message was classic Bezos \u2014 challenging conventional wisdom, seeking the wisdom of the market and highlighting his various businesses. Yet it failed to answer a question that is likely to follow him more often if and when he becomes the richest man: What are his plans to give away some or all of his wealth?Mr. Bezos, who owns about 17 percent of Amazon, has enjoyed what could be the most rapid personal-wealth surge in history. As Amazon\u2019s share price has more than tripled since 2015, its leader has added more than $50 billion to his net worth, bringing his current total to nearly $83 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is now less than $7 billion shy of taking the title of the world\u2019s richest person from Bill Gates, who has held the crown for 18 of the past 23 years.Mr. Bezos\u2019 wealth is proof of Amazon\u2019s seemingly unstoppable growth and dominance in a wide range of fields, including online retailing and cloud computing. It adds another Horatio Alger story to the mythmaking machine of American wealth \u2014 showcasing someone from the middle class who was adopted by his Cuban-immigrant stepfather, quit his Wall Street job to start selling books online from his garage and created a company now worth nearly a half trillion dollars.Yet until Thursday, his philanthropy remained largely a mystery.Still, Mr. Bezos has never said publicly what he plans to do with his fortune, what causes he might support or even whether he will give away some or most of it.Mr. Bezos declined to comment for this article. His Twitter invitation on Thursday came after repeated questions on Wednesday from The Times about his giving levels and the lack of public information on his philanthropy. A spokesman declined to comment on whether the queries prompted the post.The Twitter post \u2014 while offering the most insight so far about his philanthropy thinking \u2014 did not commit to any funding levels or to creating a foundation or an L.L.C., as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and other billionaires have done.Experts on nonprofits and friends of Mr. Bezos say he has been more focused on building Amazon and would probably turn to philanthropy later. The more wealth he creates today, they said, the more he can give away later.\u201cI took the less safe path to follow my passion,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m proud of that choice.\u201dYet Mr. Bezos has so far refused the kind of charitable pledges common among billionaires today. The Bezoses\u2019 giving has largely been a family affair, with Mr. Bezos\u2019 role hard to determine. Nonprofit experts said the Bezos Family Foundation, while funded with Amazon stock, is mainly led by Mr. Bezos\u2019 mother. The foundation has given away tens of millions of dollars, mainly to causes related to child brain development and early education.And judging from his Twitter post and conversations with people who know Mr. Bezos, he wants to forge a new path for addressing social problems rather than just writing checks to nonprofits. His desire to get ideas from the public and fund \u201chere and now\u201d philanthropy suggests what could be a bold new direction for philanthropy.Mr. Bezos also sees for-profit ventures as a more effective way to solve certain social problems.\u201cIn many cases, for-profit models improve the world more than philanthropy models, if they can be made to work,\u201d he told Charlie Rose in 2010.\u201cWe know that he hasn\u2019t been very receptive to traditional philanthropy,\u201d said Steve Delfin, a Washington-area philanthropy adviser to companies and wealthy families. \u201cMy guess is that at some point, he will create an innovative new model or a hybrid approach. And maybe, like Amazon, he\u2019ll do it better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Lies. China Thrives.", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byOne of the many dangers posed to our society by having a president who\u2019s a serial liar \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t behave like an adult, let alone a president \u2014 is that we more easily ignore him even if he happens to say something true.Yes, some things are true even if Donald Trump believes them. I explored one of them in China last week \u2014 Trump\u2019s charge that China is playing unfair on trade.Chinese men and women friends tell me they don\u2019t carry purses or wallets anymore, only a mobile phone, which they use for everything \u2014 including for buying vegetables from street vendors.\u201cAmerica has been dreaming of becoming a cashless society,\u201d Ya-Qin Zhang, president of Baidu, China\u2019s main search engine, remarked to me, \u201cbut China is already there.\u201d It has \u201cleapfrogged the rest of world\u201d and is now going mobile-first in everything.Wang Xing, the founder of Meituan.com \u2014 a Chinese mobile website that is a combination of Fandango, Yelp, OpenTable, Grubhub, TripAdvisor, Booking.com and Angie\u2019s List \u2014 told me that he has around 300,000 people on electric bicycles who deliver takeout food and groceries to 10 million Chinese mobile internet users daily. \u201cWe are the largest food delivery company in the world,\u201d said Xing.And in an age when raw data from the internet of people and the internet of things is the new oil, the fact that China has 700 million people doing so many transactions daily on the mobile internet means it\u2019s piling up massive amounts of information that can be harvested to identify trends and spur new artificial intelligence applications.Moreover, while Trump is pulling out of the Paris climate deal, China is steadily pulling out of coal. Xin Guo, C.E.O. of Career International, told me two of his hottest job openings in China are in \u201csoftware and new energy\u201d \u2014 everyone is looking for engineers for electric cars, solar and wind. Walter Fang, a top executive at iSoftStone, which helps design China\u2019s smart, sustainable cities, told me that \u201cjust two weeks ago I brought in about a dozen green energy start-up companies from Massachusetts\u201d to show them opportunities in China.And yet, as smart as China has been in adopting new technologies, Trump\u2019s broad complaint that China is not playing fair on trade and has grown in some areas at the expense of U.S. and European workers has merit and needs to be addressed \u2014 now. Before going to Beijing I emailed the smartest person I know inside China on trade (who will have to go nameless) and asked if Trump had a point.He answered: \u201cYour note has arrived as I slide across the Chinese countryside at 300 kilometers per hour from Beijing to Shanghai. There are nearly 60 trains going from Beijing to Shanghai every day, typically with 16 cars able to carry nearly 1,300 people. \u2026 We glide past endless brand-new factories and immaculate apartment buildings in practically every city along the way, with many more still under construction. As you suspect, I have been sympathetic to many of Trump\u2019s trade and industrial policy ideas. But if anything, Trump may be too late.\u201dOuch.The core problem, U.S. and European business leaders based in China explained, is that when the U.S. allowed China to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 and gain much less restricted access to our markets, we gave China the right to keep protecting parts of its market \u2014 because it was a \u201cdeveloping economy.\u201d The assumption was that as China reformed and become more of our equal, its trade barriers and government aid to Chinese companies would melt away.They did not. China grew in strength, became America\u2019s equal in many fields and continued to protect its own companies from foreign competition, either by limiting access or demanding that foreign companies take on a Chinese partner and transfer their intellectual property to China as the price of access, or by funneling Chinese firms low-interest loans to grow and buy foreign competitors.Once those companies got big enough, they were unleashed on the world. China plans to use this strategy to implement its new plan \u2014 \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d \u2014 to make itself the world leader in electric vehicles, new materials, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, bio-pharmacy, 5G mobile communications and other industries.The latest annual survey of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, released in January, found that 81 percent of its members felt \u201cless welcome\u201d in China than in the past and had little confidence any longer that China would carry through on promises to open its markets. APCO Worldwide\u2019s James McGregor, one of the keenest observers of China trade, recently noted that China tells the world that its policy is \u201creform and opening,\u201d but on the ground its policy \u201cmore resembles reform and closing.\u201dToday, Alibaba can set up its own cloud server in America, but Amazon or Microsoft can\u2019t do the same in China. China just agreed to allow U.S. credit card giants, like Visa and MasterCard, access to its huge market \u2014 something it was required to do under W.T.O. rules but just dragged its feet on for years \u2014 but now domestic Chinese financial services companies, like UnionPay, so dominate the Chinese market that U.S. companies will be left to fight over the scraps. The world leader in industrial robots, the German company Kuka Robotics, was just bought by the Chinese company Midea; Beijing would never allow the U.S. to buy one of China\u2019s industrial gems like that.This is not fair. China needs to know that some people who disagree with everything else Trump stands for \u2014 and who value a strong U.S.-China relationship \u2014 might just support Trump\u2019s idea for a border-adjustment tax on imports to level the playing field. Because our economic relationship with China is out of whack \u2014 and not just because China makes great products, but because we do, too, and it\u2019s high time they are all allowed through China\u2019s front door.Advertisement"}

The men, considered among the brightest of a rising generation of studio executives, are currently the leaders of Sony Pictures Television, the company behind high-quality cable dramas like \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d major Netflix series like \u201cThe Crown\u201d and broadcast network comedies like \u201cThe Goldbergs.\u201dIn a blow to Sony, Mr. Erlicht, 48, and Mr. Van Amburg, 46, will start at Apple by the end of summer.

By hiring Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg, however, Apple has sent a clear message to Hollywood: We are finally serious about building an original video business.

{"Headline": "In Whole Foods, Bezos Gets a Sustainably Sourced Guinea Pig", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "State of the ArtBy purchasing the upscale chain, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief, has a chance to tinker with how people buy groceries \u2014 and map the future of the physical store.Supported byWhen big tech companies make big moves, it\u2019s natural to see the news in earthshaking terms.Sure, all of this seems plausible at some point in the future. In particular, an Amazon presence in groceries might transform it from a company you shop at every once in a while to one you think about several times a week. This is not a novel idea: It was the key reason Walmart got into the grocery business in the 1980s, a move that accelerated its shift from a regional chain into the world\u2019s largest physical retailer.Yet if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, after years of watching Amazon, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time predicting future possibilities. He is instead consumed with improving the present reality on the ground, especially as seen through a customer\u2019s eyes. The other thing to know about Mr. Bezos is that he is a committed experimentalist. His main way of deciding what Amazon should do next is to try stuff out, see what works, and do more of that.So the best way to think of this deal is to look at Whole Foods as a kind of guinea pig for Amazon \u2014 a pricey, organically sourced one, perhaps, but a guinea pig all the same.Amazon almost certainly doesn\u2019t know yet how exactly Whole Foods will fit into its long-term plans. You can expect it to make few dramatic changes to Whole Foods in the near future. Instead, Mr. Bezos and his team will most likely spend years meticulously analyzing and tinkering with how Whole Foods works. They will begin lots of experiments. When something works, they will do more of that, then more, and then even more. They may take over the world all the same \u2014 and, in the process, probably usher in big changes to large swaths of the economy, affecting everything from labor to urban planning \u2014 but they\u2019ll do it in ways we won\u2019t be able to predict now.\u201cI think they look at this as an opportunity to learn,\u201d said Venky Harinarayan, an early Amazon executive who later worked at Walmart, and who also ran a venture capital firm in which Mr. Bezos was a big investor. \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment for everyone \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone has figured out yet how to use a store to service online customers at massive scale. That\u2019s the experimental piece.\u201dIn this light, I suspect that the Whole Foods deal starts less with a strategic end-goal and more with this insight: Shopping for food is broken. Both the in-store experience and the many attempts at online delivery \u2014 from Webvan to Instacart to Amazon\u2019s own service, Amazon Fresh \u2014 have failed to create the sort of seamless buying experience we enjoy with nonfood e-commerce.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.But online grocery delivery also isn\u2019t so great. Delivery services tend to be far more expensive than in-store shopping, and it\u2019s still not quite painless: You have to order ahead of time, you often have to deal with last-minute substitutions, and the whole process is still quite labor-intensive and wasteful. (Ask me about the many pounds of ice-filled plastic bags I have to dispose of every time I shop at Amazon Fresh.)But wait a second, isn\u2019t $13.4 billion a lot for an experiment? Amazon didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\u201cNo doubt it\u2019s a big deal; it\u2019s a large amount of money,\u201d Mr. Harinarayan said. But he also noted that Amazon is flying high.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Amazon-Walmart Showdown That Explains the Modern Economy", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsEach one is trying to become more like the other \u2014 Walmart by investing heavily in its technology, Amazon by opening physical bookstores and now buying physical supermarkets. But this is more than a battle between two business titans. Their rivalry sheds light on the shifting economics of nearly every major industry, replete with winner-take-all effects and huge advantages that accrue to the biggest and best-run organizations, to the detriment of upstarts and second-fiddle players.Men\u2019s dress clothing, mine included, can be a little boring. Like many male office workers, I lean toward clothes that are sharp but not at all showy. Nearly every weekday, I wear a dress shirt that is either light blue, white or has some subtle check pattern, usually paired with slacks and a blazer. The description alone could make a person doze.I used to buy my dress shirts from a Hong Kong tailor. They fit perfectly, but ordering required an awkward meeting with a visiting salesman in a hotel suite. They took six weeks to arrive, and they cost around $120 each, which adds up fast when you need to buy eight or 10 a year to keep up with wear and tear.I\u2019m on the fence as to which company will provide my next shirt order, and a new deal this week makes it a doubly interesting quandary: Walmart is buying Bonobos.Walmart and Amazon have had their sights on each other for years, each aiming to be the dominant seller of goods \u2014 however consumers of the future want to buy them. It increasingly looks like that \u201chowever\u201d is a hybrid of physical stores and online-ordering channels, and each company is coming at the goal from a different starting point.Walmart has thousands of stores that sell hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods. It is particularly strong in suburban and rural areas and among low- and middle-income consumers, but it\u2019s playing catch-up with online sales and affluent urbanites.Why are these two mega-retailers both trying to sell me shirts? The short answer is because they both want to sell everything.More specifically, Bonobos is known as an innovator in exactly this type of hybrid of online and physical store sales. Its website and online customer service are excellent, and it operates stores in major cities where you can try on garments and order items to be shipped directly. Because all the actual inventory is centralized, the stores themselves can occupy minimal square footage.So the acquisition may help Walmart build expertise in the very areas where it is trying to gain on Amazon. You can look at the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods through the same lens. The grocery business has a whole different set of challenges from the types of goods that Amazon has specialized in; you can\u2019t store a steak or a banana the way you do books or toys. And people want to be able to make purchases and take them home on the spur of the moment.Just as Walmart is using Bonobos to get access to higher-end consumers and a more technologically savvy way of selling clothes, Amazon is using Whole Foods to get the expertise and physical presence it takes to sell fresh foods.But bigger dimensions of the modern economy also come into play.The apparel business has long been a highly competitive industry in which countless players could find a niche. Any insight that one shirt-maker developed could be rapidly copied by others, and consumer prices reflected the retailer\u2019s real estate costs and branding approach as much as anything.That helps explain why there are thousands of options worldwide for someone who wants a decent-quality men\u2019s shirt. In that world, any shirt-maker that tried to get too big rapidly faced diminishing returns. It would have to pay more and more to lease the real estate for far-flung stores, and would have to outbid competitors to hire all the experienced shirt-makers. The expansion wouldn\u2019t offer any meaningful cost savings and would entail a lot more headaches trying to manage it all.But more and more businesses in the modern economy, rather than reflecting those diminishing returns to scale, show positive returns to scale: The biggest companies have a huge advantage over smaller players. That tends to tilt markets toward a handful of players or even a monopoly, rather than an even playing field with countless competitors.The most extreme example of this would be the software business, where a company can invest bottomless sums in a piece of software, but then sell it to each additional customer for practically nothing. The apparel industry isn\u2019t that extreme \u2014 the price of making a shirt is still linked to the cost of fabric and the workers to do the stitching \u2014 but it is moving in that direction.And that helps explain why Walmart and Amazon are so eager to put a shirt on my back.Already, retailers need to figure out how to manage sophisticated supply chains connecting Southeast Asia with stores in big American cities so that they rarely run out of product. They need mobile apps and websites that offer a seamless user experience so that nothing stands between a would-be purchaser and an order.Larger companies that are good at supply chain management and technology can spread those more-or-less fixed costs around more total sales, enabling them to keep prices lower than a niche player and entrench their advantage.These positive returns to scale could become even more pronounced. Perhaps in the future, rather than manufacture a bunch of shirts in Indonesia and Malaysia and ship them to the United States to be sold one at a time to urban office workers, a company will have a robot manufacture shirts to my specifications somewhere nearby.That in turn may help explain why the income gap has widened in recent years. Essentially, the corporate world is bifurcating between winners and losers, with big implications for their workers.How much of that is because of shifting technology \u2014 as opposed to changing corporate behavior, or loose antitrust policy \u2014 is an open debate.What isn\u2019t is this: The decision by Amazon and Walmart to compete for my grocery business \u2014 as well as for space in my closet \u2014 is a tiny battle in a war to dominate a changing global economy.And for companies that can\u2019t compete on price and technology, it could cost them the shirt off their backs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.K. to Decide on 21st Century Fox Deal for Sky by June 29", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cI will consider these reports in detail before coming to an initial view on whether or not I am minded to refer the merger\u201d for further investigation, she said.It is also likely to renew criticism that Rupert Murdoch holds too much sway over the British media, which he has denied.James Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox and the chairman of Sky, said last month that he was confident the proposed transaction would be completed by the end of the year.Here\u2019s what you need to know about the British review, and how it may affect the Murdochs and plans for 21st Century Fox.In a separate but connected review, the regulator also determined if 21st Century Fox\u2019s management, particularly James Murdoch, were \u201cfit and proper\u201d to retain Sky\u2019s broadcasting licenses. Ofcom will publish details of its ruling by June 29.Now, 21st Century Fox is grappling with the aftermath of a sexual harassment scandal at Fox News. Regulators at Ofcom have met with lawyers who represented several of the accusers as well as one woman who made sexual harassment allegations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly. These meetings have raised questions about whether Ofcom would take into account the allegations, and the company\u2019s handling of them, in its judgment on whether the company passes the \u201cfit and proper\u201d test.21st Century Fox has said in a statement about the scandal that it had taken \u201cprompt and decisive action\u201d and had overhauled the leadership and management at Fox News.Analysts say there are four possible outcomes.Ofcom may give its unconditional backing to the takeover, or recommend that the government block the deal, both of which are considered unlikely. It could recommend that 21st Century Fox make concessions, such as guaranteeing the independence of Sky News, the British news organization owned by Sky. Or the authorities may call for a more in-depth review by Britain\u2019s competition authority, extending the outcome until the autumn.Rupert Murdoch has long coveted total ownership of Sky, whose assets include broadband services, a Pan-European satellite television network and popular original broadcasting with rights to sporting events like the English Premier League.He founded Sky in the early 1990s, helping to jump-start a satellite television revolution in Britain that quickly spread across Europe. The company is now one of the region\u2019s largest private broadcasters.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s previous plans to buy the stake in Sky that he did not already own were scuttled because of the hacking scandal, leading to a widespread reorganization that included splitting his media empire into a publishing business and an entertainment business.The possible takeover of Sky would cement Mr. Murdoch\u2019s position in the fast-changing media sphere, where Netflix and Amazon are offering consumers new forms of programming. Sky owns NowTV, a European rival to these streaming services, which could help 21st Century Fox to compete.When 21st Century Fox proposed in December to take over Sky, many opposition lawmakers \u2014 and even some from the governing Conservative Party \u2014 were vocally opposed to the deal.Opposition politicians have argued that the deal would limit the country\u2019s media offerings and that the Fox News scandal is evidence that the company does not pass Britain\u2019s \u201cfit and proper\u201d test. 21st Century Fox denies both allegations.A decision \u2014 however unlikely \u2014 that 21st Century Fox executives are unfit to hold Sky\u2019s broadcasting license would be a major reputational blow for Mr. Murdoch and his sons.The proposed takeover is also central to 21st Century Fox\u2019s global ambition to become a crucial player in determining how people watch programming online. Consumers now watch videos and shows on their mobile devices, an area where Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company is lagging some of its rivals.Analysts say that Sky \u2014 which is highly profitable and has 22 million customers across Europe \u2014 can offer 21st Century Fox direct experience with consumers, both as a provider of television and broadband services and through NowTV, its streaming unit.And while 21st Century Fox is primarily interested in Sky\u2019s programming and internet assets, potential concessions required by the British officials to guarantee the independence of Sky News may also weaken Mr. Murdoch\u2019s hold over much of the British media.Advertisement"}

Crazes by their nature are unpredictable. But the new puzzle I\u2019m currently infatuated with \u2014 which might not reach the level of mania but is still very engaging \u2014 is something called \u201cBar Code.\u201d It started in yesterday\u2019s Sunday Magazine section, on the variety puzzle page, and will run for 14 consecutive weeks.Bar Code is a logic puzzle along the lines of sudoku or KenKen but completely different in solving method. It was invented by Thinh Van Duc Lai, a 28-year-old puzzle enthusiast in Nha Trang, Vietnam, on the coast about 250 miles northeast of Ho Chi Minh City.Like sudoku and KenKen, Bar Code has simple instructions, is solved on a grid and can be worked step by step with no guessing. When you\u2019re done you have an elegant little design.I\u2019ve never understood what causes a person to become a puzzle enthusiast. The puzzle bug crosses all nationalities and ethnicities. When he was young, Thinh discovered sudoku in a bookstore, was entranced and bought four books to solve at home.Once, as a college student, he saw a newspaper offer of 100,000 Vietnamese dong (about $4.50) for solving a very hard sudoku. He got up at 4 a.m. to do it, and he won.Thinh has been creating logic puzzles for several years. On Amazon, he has dozens of self-published books of them, which he now says are not up to his current quality. He is smitten with Japanese-style logic puzzles like sudoku, kakuro and futoshiki, and he has invented dozens of varieties of his own.Publication of Bar Code in The Times could be a life-changing experience for Thinh. He lives at home with his parents, who are sugar cane farmers. Life is not easy. His earnings from 14 weeks of Bar Code will be more than his family\u2019s usual income for an entire year.Now Thinh is making plans to attend the World Puzzle Championship in Bangalore, India, this fall to meet other puzzle enthusiasts, which he has never had a chance to do. Beyond that, he dreams of having a career in puzzlemaking for both print and electronic media.With Bar Code, his first publication in a newspaper or magazine, I\u2019d say he\u2019s off to an auspicious start.Will Shortz is the crossword editor for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Asking Girls and Boys, What Would Wonder Woman Do?", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byAdolescenceThe movie begins with an inviting origin story. Wonder Woman, whose real name is Diana, is a demigod raised by warriors on an all-female paradise island. But the story moves from the sunny beach to the Western Front of World War I, where it both darkens and reveals its heart. Wonder Woman marshals her supernatural force behind the single aim of stopping human suffering, which means ending the war.Diana is undeniably tough, but it\u2019s her yawning tenderness, not her mythical strength, that sets her apart from the men alongside her and the standard-issue male superhero. In a haunting scene that resonates with the news of our time, she withers when she comes upon the devastation of a gas attack.Wonder Woman\u2019s compassion is the fuel of her force. She\u2019s not bowed down by anguish; she\u2019s pulled back like a catapult.That Wonder Woman unleashes her wrath only when she\u2019s exposed to inhumanity raises a question that belongs at our dinner tables: What is the purpose of having power? You can\u2019t spend time on a playground or in a classroom (or in a boardroom or a war room) without having to grapple with this one.Making \u201cWonder Woman\u201d a full-family experience can open conversations with our children about how they might use their own influence. Would our daughters and sons stand passively by if they saw someone being bullied? Or would they use their own power to stick up for those who have less of it?Not surprisingly, the film has plenty of examples of sexism. For instance, when Diana dares to crash an all-male meeting, an appalled commander demands to know \u201cWho is this woman?\u201d Parents can use this to talk about gender politics unfolding in our children\u2019s schools.To be clear, guys aren\u2019t alone in riding roughshod over their peers. But the common cultural responses to female and male aggression reveal a double standard. Young women who abuse their social power are often given the hard-to-shake label of \u201cmean girls,\u201d while similar behavior among young men is often ignored, because \u201cboys will be boys.\u201dWhen we stop instinctively dismissing male aggression and at the same time slow our judgmental reactions to what we view as female aggression, we can have fair conversations with our children about how power should be exercised. We can ask whether it\u2019s O.K. for boys to tease one another, or for a child to watch a boy be teased and say nothing. And we can wonder if a young woman might be penalized for assertive behavior that is routinely overlooked in young men, and what actions should be considered out of bounds for anyone.Our children won\u2019t face the epic evildoers of the DC Comics world, but they will certainly encounter, or flirt with being, pint-size tyrants. Those who seek to abuse power offer one model of how force can be employed. \u201cWonder Woman\u201d offers another. Diana serves up a welcome example of a leader who draws her strength from her humanity, and uses it only to protect herself or to defend others.In this respect, we should all want for our daughters to be like Wonder Woman, and our sons, too.An earlier version of this article misstated the war during which the film is set. It is World War I, not World War II.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whole Foods Deal Shows Amazon\u2019s Prodigious Tolerance for Risk", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported byUnlike almost any other chief executive, Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, has built his company by embracing risk, ignoring obvious moves and imagining what customers want next \u2014 even before they know it.Key to that strategy is his approach to failure. While other companies dread making colossal mistakes, Mr. Bezos seems just not to care. Losing millions of dollars for some reason doesn\u2019t sting. Only success counts. That breeds a fiercely experimental culture that is disrupting entertainment, technology and, especially, retail.Mr. Bezos is one of the few chief executives who joke about how much money they\u2019ve lost.\u201cI\u2019ve made billions of dollars of failures,\u201d Mr. Bezos said at a 2014 conference, adding that it would be like \u201ca root canal with no anesthesia\u201d if he listed them.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take bold bets, they\u2019re going to be experiments,\u201d Mr. Bezos explained. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re experiments, you don\u2019t know ahead of time if they\u2019re going to work. Experiments are by their very nature prone to failure. But a few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn\u2019t work.\u201dIt is an approach baked into the company since the beginning \u2014 and one that is difficult, if not impossible, for competitors to emulate. Consider how Amazon Web Services began as a small internal cloud computing project to help Amazon\u2019s core business. Then the company started selling excess cloud capacity to other companies.If the cloud computing business just grew, Amazon Prime was a bold bet from the beginning, the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet for shoppers: Pay an annual fee and all shipping costs for the year are covered. Amazon\u2019s shipping expenses ballooned, but revenue soared so much that no one minded.\u201cWhen you have such a long-term perspective that you think in decades instead of quarters, it allows you to do things and take risks that other companies believe would not be in their best interests,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, an analyst with the investment firm Robert W. Baird & Company.Amazon began, for those too young to remember, as a discount internet bookseller in 1995. In the headiness of the late-1990s dot-com boom, it became the symbol of how this new invention called the World Wide Web was going to change everything. Then, like many of the leading dot-com companies, it blew up. The world wasn\u2019t quite ready for Amazon. It came very close to going under.One thing the retailer did not do was make much money. In its two decades as a public company, Amazon has had a cumulative profit of $5.7 billion. For a company with a market value of nearly $500 billion, this is negligible. Walmart, which has a market value half that of Amazon, made a profit of $14 billion in 2016 alone.But the tens of millions of customers do not care whether Amazon is hugely profitable. They care if it is making their lives easier or better.\u201cJeff Bezos is making shopping great,\u201d said Chris Kubica, an e-book consultant and software developer who watches Amazon closely. \u201cHe\u2019s made me come to expect better from every checkout counter. Oh, I can scan my entire shopping cart full of groceries in one go, without stopping, as I roll into the parking lot? Yes, please. Where do I park?\u201dAs Amazon pushes on with its ceaseless experimenting, however, it risks being seen as less of a cute disrupter of the old and as more of a menace. It has hired many workers for its warehouses, but it is also betting heavily on automation. Amazon Go, after all, is an attempt to drain the labor out of shopping.\u201cAmazon runs the risk of becoming too big,\u201d Mr. Kekre said.Some Amazon critics would like the Whole Foods deal to be the trigger for reining in the company. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a frequent foe of Amazon, noted that the company is \u201crapidly monopolizing online retail\u201d and that both Prime and Echo \u201care strategies for locking in consumers and ensuring they don\u2019t shop anywhere else.\u201d Amazon declined to comment for this article.Where will it all end? Mr. Kubica has thought about this. Amazon can be understood as a decades-long effort to shorten the time between \u201cI want it\u201d and \u201cI have it\u201d into as brief a period as possible. The logical end of this would be the something Mr. Kubica jestingly called Amazon Imp, short for \u201cimplant\u201d and also \u201cimpulse,\u201d Mr. Kubica said. It would be a chip inserted under the skin.\u201cThe imp would sense your impulses and desires,\u201d Mr. Kubica wrote in an email, \u201cand then either virtually fulfill them by stimulating your brain (for a modest payment to Amazon, of course) or it would make a box full of goodies for you appear on your doorstep (for a larger fee, of course).\u201dEvery desire fulfilled. \u201cI am sure that Amazon even now is building it,\u201d Mr. Kubica said.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: \u2018The End of Advertising\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "Supported byQ. and A.Andrew Essex believes that \u201cthe end of advertising as we know it\u201d is \u201csomewhere between five minutes and five years\u201d away. That\u2019s what this former chief executive of the influential creative agency Droga5 writes in \u201cThe End of Advertising: Why It Had to Die, and the Creative Resurrection to Come\u201d (Spiegel & Grau).\u201cLife is better without bad ads,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt\u2019s simply irrefutable.\u201d Consumers have increasingly effective ways to avoid ads, and an entire generation has been raised with a different expectation of how \u2014 and how often \u2014 it will have its viewing, reading or listening interrupted. Yet brands still spend vast amounts of money in diverse ways to promote their products, and entire industries (like journalism) are struggling with how to replace traditional ad revenue. (In fact, in the past Essex has done consulting work for The New York Times Company.) These sea changes are the subject of Essex\u2019s highly opinionated treatise. Below, he talks about how this era of television has inspired him, the origin stories of aspirin and heroin, and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?I got the idea after spending a summer making compost. I had left my previous job after 10 years to recharge my batteries: driving kids to camp, making compost and trying to write a book. It just seemed that it was time to reflect on the state of advertising. It was around the time \u201cMad Men\u201d went off the air and ad blocking started to enter into the public discourse.What\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?That history repeats itself. We had invented the \u201ccorrect way\u201d to advertise, then took a 50-year detour pursuing a model that, in retrospect, seems kind of insane. For the past 50 years, we\u2019ve essentially pursued a model called \u201ccommand and control,\u201d which is to interrupt people in the rudest possible way with something they didn\u2019t ask to see, which is most exemplified by interrupting a TV program at a moment of great interest to show you a 30-second toilet-paper spot.But that model of adjacency is irrelevant and increasingly superfluous in a world in which there is so much content. Years ago, brands were making the thing. Not the thing that interrupts the thing. The old model was General Electric Theater; the new model is \u201cThe Lego Movie,\u201d and that\u2019s the same thing \u2014 making things people want to see, and adding value to their lives, as opposed to making something they actively don\u2019t want to see.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I wanted to write a book about the untold story of the dual origin story of aspirin and heroin. The company Bayer is famous for inventing aspirin in 1898, which is arguably one of the world\u2019s most beloved brands, and for good reason. But I was surprised to learn that just two weeks earlier, the same three guys who gave the world aspirin also created Bayer\u2019s other big brand, heroin, which was marketed for about eight years as the world\u2019s best cough medicine. This is a true story, and that seemed to me a perfect metaphor for advertising\u2019s ongoing tension between authenticity and artifice. But all the protagonists are dead, and Bayer won\u2019t talk about it.It was originally a book about unintended consequences and origin stories. So that theme never really changed. But the news kept staying ahead of the book, which had the unintended consequence of making it even more relevant than I intended. Fake news came along, and that seemed relevant to this rapidly shifting role of advertising in the culture. Google and Safari added ad-blocking software.

{"Headline": "The Decline of the Baronial C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Corporate giants once had all-powerful chiefs with domains to match. But activist investors and technological change are remaking the executive suite.Supported byFAIRFIELD, Conn. \u2014 They bestrode the business world, or at least the suburban corporate campus, like a colossus.Sitting behind burnished wooden desks, in glass-walled corner offices like the one Jeffrey R. Immelt occupied at General Electric\u2019s former headquarters here, a select group of American chief executives were once more akin to statesmen than businessmen.G.E. moved out of this sprawling Skidmore, Owings & Merrill-designed emblem of 1970s corporate modernism in favor of smaller, humbler digs in downtown Boston last year. And last week, Mr. Immelt unexpectedly announced plans to retire after 16 years in the top job, amid a sagging stock price and pressure from activist investors.General Electric is just the latest storied name in corporate America to show its leader the door. Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, had been in the job for less than three years when he was fired in late May. Two weeks earlier, Mario Longhi of U.S. Steel abruptly stepped down.With these departures, the American era of the baronial chief executive, sitting atop an industrial dominion with all the attendant privileges, is drawing to a close.It is one consequence of a transformed economic landscape in which many of the mega-corporations that defined 20th-century commercial life are confronting a host of new business and technological challenges. These changes \u2014 in corporate leadership, on boards and across Wall Street \u2014 are recasting the very idea of industry in America.\u201cThe C.E.O. with a big office, a tenure of 10 or 20 years, in a suit and tie, is becoming a thing of the past,\u201d said Vijay Govindarajan, who served as G.E.\u2019s chief innovation consultant in 2008 and 2009 and now teaches at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business.Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit from G.E. is particularly telling, given the company\u2019s reputation as a training ground for the future chief executives of other companies. He tried to change G.E., yet couldn\u2019t react quickly enough to the forces affecting companies like his.These include the rising power of activist investors, who buy up stakes in companies and then demand changes. Activists are now hunting much bigger game, demanding double-digit annual earnings growth in a stagnant economy. Or else.That deal also shows how the digital age has upended the competitive landscape, pitting companies in vastly different industries against one another.\u201cWho ever thought Ford would be competing with Google?\u201d said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who has studied corporate leadership for decades. \u201cBut they are, and Mark Fields wasn\u2019t moving fast enough.\u201dBoards, too, have changed, evolving from country-club-like collections of the same familiar faces into a much more diverse and demanding constituency.To be sure, the money is better than ever. And pockets of unbridled ambition and occasional excess remain, especially in Silicon Valley, where Apple\u2019s new $5 billion spaceshiplike headquarters opened in April.But for most of the Fortune 500, the unquestioned power and perks, the imperviousness to criticism from the likes of shareholders, and the outsize public profile that once automatically came with the corner office have gone the way of the typewriter and the Dictaphone.\u201cThese people were bigger than life, and I saw it up close,\u201d said Kevin Sharer, a former chief executive of Amgen who worked as a top aide to Mr. Immelt\u2019s legendary predecessor at G.E., Jack Welch. \u201cThey were a combination of chief executive, statesman and rock star. They were unassailable.\u201dA Naval Academy graduate, then an officer, before joining G.E. in 1984, Mr. Sharer said the only place that evoked a feeling of power comparable to the long hallways and corner offices of Fairfield in its prime was aboard the fast attack nuclear submarines where he once served as chief engineer.\u201cWe had the confidence, the swagger, and we felt like we had unlimited industrial potential,\u201d he said. \u201cCould we buy RCA or NBC? Of course we could. I\u2019m not complaining, but this is absolutely not the case today.\u201dAs Amgen\u2019s chief executive in the spring of 2009, Mr. Sharer visited the White House repeatedly to meet with Obama administration officials as they designed what would become the Affordable Care Act. He also played a key role in getting fellow pharmaceutical industry chiefs to support the legislation.Now retired and teaching at Harvard Business School, Mr. Sharer said he would never do that today, as wading into bitterly partisan public debates offers little upside for corporate leaders, and risks damage to their company\u2019s reputation.As a result, while companies in many ways have more economic and political power than ever, \u201cchief executives now shy away from weighing in on the policy level or broader societal issues,\u201d Mr. Sharer said. \u201cThey\u2019re more focused on running their companies.\u201dThere are exceptions. Besides Mr. Immelt\u2019s outspokenness on the climate issue, last year Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck called out \u201cbad actors\u201d in the pharmaceutical industry for exorbitant price increases. Timothy D. Cook of Apple challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed immigration restrictions in January.Still, Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit leaves a void at the intersection of business and public policy, along with the retirement this year of Douglas R. Oberhelman, the Caterpillar chief who led both the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers.\u201cIf you start fooling around in Washington with the Business Roundtable or writing op-eds, activist investors will ask what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Useem said.\u201cI don\u2019t see him stepping into that role,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep his head down and focus on the numbers.\u201dAt Exxon Mobil, it\u2019s referred to as the God Pod. On the 11th floor of Procter & Gamble\u2019s headquarters in Cincinnati, there was Mahogany Row. And while the official name of the executive wing at G.E.\u2019s Fairfield headquarters was E3, inside the company it was known as Carpet Land.And no wonder. From the Persian rugs that lined the hallways to the plush wool floor covering in Mr. Immelt\u2019s office and private conference room, the carpets created the hushed atmosphere of a monastery or library.\u201cIt was so quiet, you could feel the energy drain out of you,\u201d said Ann Klee, the G.E. executive who oversaw the move to Boston and the development of its new headquarters there.What these executive aeries all shared was an Olympus-like sense of remoteness, authority and defined hierarchy.At G.E., even in Carpet Land, office size grew in lock step with rank, and the biggest corner space was reserved for the chief executive. Not only did Mr. Immelt have his own bathroom, but his two administrative assistants had a private bathroom and a pantry.The abundant perks \u2014 in G.E.\u2019s case, two helicopter pads, a shoeshine station and an executive dining room linked to the kitchen below by dumbwaiters \u2014 fed the sense of exalted status. At the same time, faster economic growth and rising earnings camouflaged the cost of these indulgences.With G.E.\u2019s profits and shares soaring in the 1980s, Mr. Welch oversaw the construction of a private 28-room hotel known as the Guest House to serve visiting executives and others, with no expense spared on the parquet floors, wood-burning fireplaces and a Steinway piano, which was left behind when the company moved out.\u201cNothing was off-the-shelf,\u201d said Bill O\u2019Brien, a 19-year G.E. veteran who helped supervise the Fairfield facility. \u201cWith Jack Welch, everything was custom and the operation was five star, spot on.\u201dAlmost 16 years after Mr. Welch retired in 2001 and Mr. Immelt took over, G.E. shares have never regained their 2000 peak. So while Mr. Immelt successfully steered the company through a near-death experience during the 2008 financial crisis, refocused it on its industrial roots and shed its ancillary businesses, it became a natural target for activist investors.One of those was Nelson Peltz, a onetime corporate raider who relied on Michael R. Milken\u2019s junk bonds for financing back when Mr. Welch was building his Guest House. Mr. Peltz has come a long way since then, having scored big wins forcing laggards like Heinz and Wendy\u2019s to improve their performance, and he acquired a $2 billion stake in G.E. in 2015.G.E.\u2019s chief communications officer, Deirdre Latour, denied that activist pressure was a factor in Mr. Immelt\u2019s decision to retire. \u201cSixteen years is a long time,\u201d she said.But at 61, Mr. Immelt is four years younger than Mr. Welch when he stepped down, and joins a long list of otherwise respected executives whose stately succession plans were seemingly interrupted by impatient investors.\u201cC.E.O. tenure is down from the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, and the G.E. situation is a reflection of that,\u201d said Jason D. Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business. \u201cWithout this outside pressure, it\u2019s likely Jeff Immelt would have served out his term and retired at 64 or 65.\u201dNow other chief executives are feeling the same pressure, including Mary T. Barra of General Motors. \u201cShe\u2019s being pulled in different directions,\u201d Mr. Schloetzer said, noting that G.M.\u2019s shares have barely budged in the last two years, even as the broader stock market has soared.If Ms. Barra can\u2019t turn things around in 12 to 18 months, Mr. Schloetzer said, she could share a fate similar to that of Mr. Fields at Ford.Indeed, Mr. Fields\u2019s defenestration was more shocking in many ways than Mr. Immelt\u2019s slow-motion fade, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management.\u201cHe\u2019s the poster child for what\u2019s happened to the C.E.O. job,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cUntil last month, people thought dynastic family capital like the Ford family was the solution to rampant short-termism. I\u2019m sorry Ford forgot that recipe.\u201dHow did activist investors acquire such outsize power over publicly traded companies?\u201cWith fewer public companies out there, any one of them is more likely to become a target of interest for one hedge fund or another,\u201d Mr. Slaughter said.At the same time, activists are getting more, well, active. More than 300 American companies were targeted by these investors in 2015, up from just over 100 in 2010, according to Mr. Useem of Wharton. They\u2019re also becoming more successful at winning board seats, as fewer companies stagger their board elections over three-year cycles.What\u2019s more, chief executives have less internal latitude. In 2001, more than half of new C.E.O.s also assumed the position of chairman when they took over. By 2016, only 10 percent occupied both roles, according to an analysis by Strategy&, the strategy and consulting arm of PwC.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the C.E.O. running the board too,\u201d said Gary L. Neilson, a principal with Strategy&. \u201cNow the C.E.O. has a boss.\u201dBoards themselves have changed, Mr. Sonnenfeld added. A few decades ago, a Pittsburgh-based giant like U.S. Steel would draw board members from a local pool of business and community leaders.\u201cThere was a downside in terms of cronyism, mutual back-scratching and a hesitance to criticize,\u201d he said. \u201cThe positive was that they were anchored in their communities and they invested in them. Now, for C.E.O.s, all the constituencies have changed.\u201dSo while boards are still willing to dole out huge golden parachutes to C.E.O.\u2019s, even if they fail, they\u2019ve become much more generous with money than they are with additional time.The glaring exception to the trends outlined by Mr. Sonnenfeld is in the technology sector. But in many ways, these firms are the exception that proves the rule, because they play by different rules.Facebook also has a multi-class stock structure that effectively guarantees that the founder Mark Zuckerberg will retain control even as he sells shares. And on this point, the company offers no apologies.The staggering profitability of the tech giants provides their leaders with more than a little of the swagger the industrial executives once possessed.In 1990, the revenues of Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers totaled $250 billion while they employed 1.2 million people, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute.Silicon Valley\u2019s top three companies in 2014 had almost the same revenues before adjusting for inflation \u2014 $247 billion \u2014 but with 137,000 employees, they required a work force just one-tenth the size.That kind of efficiency adds up to huge profits, soaring stock prices and few complaints from investors. Or as Brooks C. Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown, put it, \u201cIf your stock is doing well, your job is safe.\u201dIf the old quarters for G.E.\u2019s top brass were akin to a pedestal, the new ones are more like a fishbowl. At G.E.\u2019s interim headquarters in Boston, and in the permanent one set to open next year, the offices for top leaders have glass walls that enable them to see out and, in turn, let employees see in.They are also much smaller. In Fairfield, a handful of senior G.E. leaders and their assistants occupied 44,000 square feet in the executive wing. Now the same group shares a total of just 7,800 square feet, less space than in the big mansions many C.E.O.s inhabit in places like Greenwich, Conn., or the Bay Area.\u201cIt has a much more collaborative feel, and the glass replicates the transparency of working together,\u201d said Ms. Klee, the G.E. executive. \u201cThe Fairfield campus was beautiful, but it lacked the spark you feel here. It\u2019s a different time, and we like the power and energy and creativity that comes from mixing people together.\u201dG.E.\u2019s 66-acre Fairfield campus was purchased for $31.5 million last fall by Sacred Heart University, according to Michael J. Kinney, the school\u2019s senior vice president for finance and administration.\u201cThere\u2019s not as big a need for corporate headquarters like this any more,\u201d said Mr. Kinney, who as a Kraft executive once worked in a similarly spectacular setting in the Taj Mahal-like General Foods building in Rye Brook, N.Y. \u201cThose were the days.\u201dMr. Kinney has big plans to convert the old offices into classrooms, a business incubator space and a computer engineering center, among other things. Students will be trained in hospitality at the former Guest House.As a result, the university has kept the campus in pristine condition since the last G.E. executives left. \u201cThe only things missing are the Persian rugs and the artwork,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who now serves as Sacred Heart\u2019s director of facilities.\u201cIt\u2019s such a different vibe with the kids all here,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who added that he\u2019s still getting used to people strolling around the manicured grounds rather than quietly shuttling between hushed offices.Walking around the pub in the Guest House Mr. Welch built, Mr. O\u2019Brien confessed to a little nostalgia for G.E.\u2019s glory days in Fairfield. \u201cCan\u2019t you see just see Jack running the world from here in \u201987 or \u201988?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Although, I was not fully aware of what this meant at age 7, there are no words to describe the feelings that flooded over me when my family landed at Miami International Airport, when I realized that we were here to stay. The process of being accepted as a refugee into the United States is a nightmare. It took us 10 months of exhausting interviews, paperwork and medical tests. After fleeing Baghdad, and spending a year as illegal refugees in Jordan, that moment meant everything. It breaks my heart that in 2017, there are some trying to steal this moment from countless individuals whose promise of a new life will be broken \u2014 families no different from mine, who deserve a second chance but who won\u2019t get one. President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration is not merely illegal and unconstitutional, but also heartless and discriminatory.Under the newest draft of President Trump\u2019s executive order that is meant to \u201cprotect the nation from foreign terrorist entry,\u201d citizens from the affected countries \u2014 Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya \u2014 will be subjected to a 90-day ban on travel to the United States. It should be noted that while Mr. Trump\u2019s ban covers these countries, which have produced exactly zero people linked to terrorist attacks that have killed Americans since 1975 to 2015, the ban does not cover countries like Turkey, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, with which the Trump family has business interests and whose citizens have been linked to terrorist attacks that have killed Americans. In addition to that, terrorism by Muslims as opposed to American Christian lone gunmen accounts for just one third of 1 percent of all murders in the United States.But let\u2019s take a step back from the politics of it all. Children may die, families will be separated. These are the world\u2019s most vulnerable that we are turning our backs on. What about the tired, poor and huddled masses yearning to breathe free? A few weeks ago when returning to the United States from Dubai, my family was selected for a \u201crandom security check.\u201d This one was more thorough than ever. I had to hold back tears as everyone in line passed while they were dissecting my bag like I was some sort of criminal. My crime? The American passport that I carry says that I was born in Iraq. My father asked the man why the security check was taking so much longer than usual. The man replied simply with \u201cAmerica first,\u201d but how do you put America first when you are destroying the very values it was founded upon?Works CitedBoard, The Editorial. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Muslim Ban Is Cowardly and Dangerous.\u201d The New York Times.

Independent Digital News and Media, 01 Mar. 2017. Web. 03 Apr. 2017._________There are over four million people living in the five permanently inhabited island territories of the United States. The residents of these territories \u2014 Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and Puerto Rico \u2014 are Americans who follow the Constitution, serve in the U.S. military and vote in presidential primaries. However, unless citizens establish an official residency in a U.S. state (and vote by absentee ballot or travel to their state to vote), they cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections or receive any substantial representation at a national level. It is time for the U.S. to stop infantilizing its territories and to grant them voting and other rights equal to the mainland states.The Supreme Court decision that denied equal rights to the territories was made over 100 years ago. Not only was the verdict intended to be temporary, but it was also made by the same justice who approved the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson. The ruling denies territories rights outlined in constitutional amendments because the territories are \u201cinhabited by alien races\u201d unable to understand \u201cAnglo-Saxon principles.\u201d This blatantly discriminatory decision is still used today against U.S. territory citizens fighting for equal rights.Inequality for the territories is also prevalent in Congress and bureaucracy. All U.S. territories elect representation into the House of Representatives; however, their Congressmen have no voting power on legislation. Guam and American Samoa specifically receive unfair treatment from the government despite their overwhelming large military enrollment. One-eighth of Guam\u2019s population is enrolled in the U.S. military and American Samoa has \u201cthe highest rate of military enlistment in the U.S.,\u201d yet citizens in both territories do not vote for their commander-in-chief, have adequate representation in Congress, or receive equal veteran benefits to mainland citizens.It is even more difficult to acquire the right to vote in American Samoa because American Samoans, unlike other territory residents, are not born U.S. citizens. They are instead called \u201cnationals\u201d to accommodate their \u201ccultural distinctiveness.\u201d In order to vote, American Samoans must move to a U.S. state and become naturalized as if they were immigrating from another country. This process costs \u201calmost $700\u201d and includes tests in English, U.S. history and civics. The naturalization process is comparable to poll taxes and literacy tests \u2014 forms of voting discrimination outlawed by the 24th Amendment \u2014 and further highlights unjustifiable bias of the U.S. government against its territories, simply because of cultural differences.It is time for the U.S. to acknowledge its disrespectful and isolating treatment of its territories and give their neglected citizens the rights they deserve.Works CitedMurriel, Maria. \u201cMillions of Americans Can\u2019t Vote for President Because of Where They Live.\u201d PRI\u2019s The World, 1 November 2016.Ponsa, Christina Duffy. \u201cAre American Samoans American?\u201d The New York Times, 8 June 2016.Savage, David G. \u201cSupreme Court Rejects Citizenship for American Samoans.\u201d Los Angeles Times, 13 June 2016.\u201cU.S. Territories: Last Week Tonight With John Oliver (HBO).\u201d YouTube, uploaded by LastWeekTonight, 8 March 2015._________Climate change is a threat to every young person on our planet. It is vital that schools teach about the climate-caused tragedies that are occurring globally and how to combat climate injustice. Fortunately, some school districts are taking steps to ensure that this is done. In 2016 the Portland, Ore., school board unanimously passed a resolution supporting the teaching of climate justice.In the New York Times article, \u201cSetbacks Aside, Climate Change is Finding its Way into the World\u2019s Classroom,\u201d Alexander Leicht of Unesco states \u201c[to slow climate change] we need an overall change of mind and a change of action that relates to everything that we think and do.\u201d Education can provide this essential change in perspective that will ultimately help the generations to come.However, actions like Portland\u2019s are still relatively rare. There are too many cases of state legislatures, school districts and teachers actively denying the fact that climate change is real, or bowing to pressure from community members and corporations who value short-term profits over long-term climate stability.Even when teachers and school districts want to teach the facts about climate change, many classroom resources discount the science behind climate change. Holt McDougal\u2019s textbook, \u201cModern World History,\u201d published in 2010, includes misleading statements questioning the legitimacy of the climate crisis such as, \u201cnot all scientists agree with the theory of the greenhouse effect.\u201d This statement falsely leads students to believe that there is not a wide scientific consensus about climate change.Fossil fuel industry funding of curriculums also poses a huge obstacle to eliminating misinformation about climate change. Energy corporations are paying for materials to be developed that promote fossil fuel usage and production. In the Washington Post article, \u201cEnergy Industry Shapes Lessons in Public Schools,\u201d Kevin Sieff writes, \u201cThe industry aims to teach students about its contributions to local economies and counter criticism from environmental groups.\u201d These resources are often biased and factually incorrect.Actions like Portland\u2019s demonstrate that schools can address climate change in the classroom. It is essential that cities around the nation follow their lead because we, as the future generation, deserve to know what we are facing and what we can do to fix this crisis that we did not create.As Portland student Gaby Lemieux says, \u201cClimate education is not a niche or a specialization, it is the minimum requirement for my generation to be successful in our changing world.\u201dWorks CitedGardiner, Beth. \u201cSetbacks Aside, Climate Change Is Finding Its Way Into the World\u2019s Classrooms.\u201d The New York Times.

Within days, dozens of demonstrators showed up to block the painting from view, and over 25 black artists signed an open letter to the Whitney\u2019s curators demanding that the painting be destroyed due to its cultural appropriation of black suffering for \u201cprofit and fun.\u201dCultural appropriation is the adoption of elements of one culture by members of another culture. What makes the protests at the Whitney Museum so frustratingly sad isn\u2019t just the call for a museum to destroy a piece of artwork. Instead it is the objection that a white artist has no right to paint a subject like a lynching victim that entirely misses the point. What these critics \u2014 the same people who would protest against the routine stop and frisking of innocent black people, the vulgar accusations made by President Trump caricaturing Mexican immigrants, and the harassment of Muslim-American families \u2014 fail to realize is that \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d can actually be used to heighten empathy and stop these injustices.The truth is that people, even the most sympathetic ones, tend to view victims from disparate racial groups as separate from themselves. Again and again, politicians, reporters and television broadcasters reflect this trend. \u201cNo one wants any child to be kidnapped,\u201d writes journalist Conor Friedersdorf, \u201cbut the little blond girl leads the local news; her black analog might not make the newscast... [Dana Schutz] was trying to bridge the gulf between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them.\u2019\u201dSlavery and white supremacy are very real parts of American history, and white people ought to confront them no less than black people. To label such efforts as \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d lends credibility to the sort of racial rigidity that fuels racism in the first place. So while Dana Schutz is white and Emmett Till is black, the emphasis on racial essentialism here feels ludicrously, infuriatingly off topic. Sometimes a woman rendering painful moments in black history has nothing to do with whether she herself is white or black, but rather with the exposure of human pain. Combating racism must not only rely on racial equity in legislation, but also must allow for the full participation of every ethnic group, nationality and race.Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting itself is abstract and haunting \u2014 the ambiguous brush strokes across Till\u2019s face form a profoundly disquieting image. But this is to be expected of any painting that reopens the wounds of American racism. Call it whatever you will, but what Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting does is powerful and evokes emotion in the viewer. Sorrow. Anger. Loss. Some might even say empathy.Works CitedFriedersdorf, Conor. \u201cWhat Does \u2018Cultural Appropriation\u2019 Actually Mean?\u201d The Atlantic. 3 Apr. 2017.Fury, Alexander. \u201cMarc Jacobs and the Appropriateness of Appropriation.\u201d The New York Times. 21 Sept. 2016.Sehgal, Parul. \u201cIs Cultural Appropriation Always Wrong?\u201d The New York Times. 29 Sept. 2015.Shamsie, Kamila. \u201cThe Storytellers of Empire.\u201d Guernica Magazine. 1 Feb. 2012.Tomkins, Calvin. \u201cWhy Dana Schutz Painted Emmett Till.\u201d The New Yorker. 10 Apr. 2017._________Christine Lagarde. Charles Murray. Condoleezza Rice. What do the director of the IMF, the conservative political scientist, and the 66th secretary of state have in common? All three have been prevented from speaking on college campuses due to student protests.Campaigns by college students to block speakers from campus events have markedly increased in recent years. According to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, there have been 338 attempts by college students to prevent public figures from speaking at campus events since 2000. The annual number of \u201cdisinvitation events\u201d has increased since 2011, with 2016 reaching a record high of 42 campaigns.The protests themselves are not the problem. Throughout history, protests have been the catalyst for political progress, from Gandhi\u2019s salt march to the American Civil Rights movement. Instead, it is the motivation behind these college protests that provides a disservice to the students of today. Often, the reason for campaigns against speakers is the disparity between the politics or actions of the proposed speaker and the views of the student protesters. Many students hold that the beliefs of proposed speakers are so damaging that they should not be given a platform.The solution to a difference of opinion is not a violent refusal to listen. Discourse is necessary.By listening to and engaging with political opponents, students can strengthen their understanding of political issues and both sides can evolve their views.In an increasingly polarized political climate, an understanding of opposing viewpoints is crucial to developing and strengthening one\u2019s own ideology. By listening to speakers with different political views, students are afforded the unique opportunity to learn about contrary beliefs and their underlying reasoning. In turn, this understanding allows students to refine their positions and, therefore, to more effectively advocate for them.Vigorous and open debate also allows both sides the opportunity to engage in ideological development. One purpose of college is the ability to grow and change before venturing into the real world. Listening to a speaker with whom you already wholeheartedly agree is a merely a visit to the echo chamber. Exposure to new viewpoints may actually change the beliefs of students. Conversely, students who confront the speaker with informed questions and arguments may challenge the position of the speaker or sway other undecided listeners.Thus, for the benefit of students and the future of political discourse, the practice of blocking speakers on college campuses must stop. College students should continue to protest, but should also listen and demand respectful dialogue with speakers, no matter their politics. If we fail to listen, if we turn our backs on the opposition instead of arguing and engaging, then we have already lost.Works Cited\u201cDisinvitation Attempts.\u201d Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.Fitzsimmons, Emma G. \u201cCondoleezza Rice Backs Out of Rutgers Speech After Student Protests.\u201d The New York Times, 3 May 2014.P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a, Richard. \u201cAfter Protests, I.M.F.

The hero quickly realized what made the nine-headed beast so deadly. After decapitating one head, two more took its place. However, if he cauterized the wounds, the heads would not spawn, allowing Hercules to defeat this relentless foe. The moral is brute force may not be the sole solution. Three thousand years later, we do not fight sea monsters and impervious lions, but we need Hercules\u2019s lesson more than ever. For the past 16 years our nation has been at a never-ending war with a similarly regenerating enemy: international terrorism.Former President Obama criticized his predecessor\u2019s strategy for creating more terrorists than it killed, but his own pivot from conventional warfare to drone strikes was not the ideal solution either.President Trump appears to be embracing Obama\u2019s myopic tactics. On January 21 and 22, the United States conducted drone strikes in the Yemeni province of Bayda that claimed the lives of 75 people. Though such drone strikes successfully kill insurgents, new radicals always seem to spring up in their place. Could this new technology be moving us toward perpetual war rather than peace?Retired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, once responsible for the Joint Special Operations Command, says yes. During a Reuters interview, he argues that drones strengthen the \u201cperception of American arrogance that says, \u2018Well we can fly where we want, we can shoot where we want, because we can.\u2019\u201d Although these strikes eliminate enemies, General McChrystal stresses that radical groups use perceived American imperiousness to bolster their numbers faster than we kill them.Proponents claim this technological advantage enables us to remotely kill key targets like the Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour. However, these weapons\u2019 short term gains cause more havoc than sustained peace. Just days after terminating Mullah Mansour, an \u201ceven more ruthless and radical leader\u201d filled his position.The attack that killed Mullah Mansour also incinerated an innocent taxi driver name Mohammad Azam. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism states this humble cabdriver joined \u201cbetween 256 and 633 civilians\u201d who perished in United States\u2019 drone strikes between January 2009 and December 2015. Our feigned progress leads us to ignore the innocent people who have been trampled and shallowly regarded as collateral damage. Our acceptance of these unintended deaths generate resentment, hatred and destabilization, creating a prime environment for spawning new radicals.The modern Hydra is more complex than its ancient Greek counterpart. However, its heads will continue to sprout even though our weapon is a Hellfire missile rather than Hercules\u2019s club. We must discover how to seal the wounds rather than just inflict them, or our problems will grow exponentially.Works CitedAlexander, David. \u201cRetired General Cautions against Overuse of \u201chated\u201d Drones.\u201d Reuters.

This time it was a group of first graders from a sandy hook. Standing in the kitchen with my backpack by my feet, I could not escape the visions of carnage.In school, we practice Code Red. We pile furniture against classroom doors and sit silently, holding our breath until reminded that it is just a drill. Wariness follows me home from school, its tentacles twisting my head.When I pick up my phone, there are notifications reading, \u201cAt least 50 dead after nightclub shooting in Orlando, officials report\u201d next to Snapchat notifications. I can list Adam Lanza, Dylann Roof, Omar Mateen, Robert Dear and Chris Harper Mercer, just as quickly as I can list the names of my best friendsI notice that when the bullets hit the kids, our civilized side flares. But we build the excuses back up, brick by brick, into cities and laws and Second Amendments. I am mad because 16-year-olds are supposed to be angry with their parents and society and not having a date to the prom, but instead I have to be angry with lawmakers and the N.R.A. and an entire country that lets holsters and bazookas pull its puppet strings. I can fire off facts faster than an AR-15 rifle: last year, there were 358 shootings in the U.S. in which four or more people were injured or killed. 306 Americans are shot every day. 48 of those are children or teenagers.It does not have to be this way. Take Australia. After a shooting in 1996 left 35 civilians dead, extensive gun control legislature was passed. These new laws included required licenses, safety training courses and an assault weapons ban. In the twenty years since the legislature was passed, there have been no mass shootings in Australia. This is sensible action. This is making sure guns do not end up in the wrong hands.Dear lawmakers: I challenge you to think about the American people. Think about the 306 Americans who will feel bullets tearing into their skin tomorrow. Think about the American students holding their breath in the corners of dark classrooms.Works CitedKauffman, Gretel. \u201cWhy Australia Isn\u2019t a Model for US Gun Control.\u201d The Christian Science Monitor.

In the Kingdom of the Little People theme park just outside Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, that\u2019s the norm. The park creates a safe space for little people in China, but still sources such as the L.P.A., Little People of America, believe the park is mocking dwarfism and isolating the handicapped community. The Kingdom of the Little People theme park should be kept running, because it gives little people a stable job and a safe space to be themselves.Little people in China have an extremely hard time finding work, but at the Kingdom of the Little People they have many job opportunities. According to the South China Morning Press, \u201cdwarves earn average pay packets of 1,500 yuan, equivalent to that of local college graduates.\u201d Though most dwarfs in China live in poverty, often times forced to beg on the streets, the dwarves at the park are paid well and many say that it changed their lives forever.Another big pull for dwarfs is to be finally in an environment where they aren\u2019t the odd one out and they have a safe space to be with others like them. One of the performers at the park, Wu Zhihong, 20 said, \u201cBefore, when we were at home, we didn\u2019t know anyone our size. When we hang out together with normal-size people, we cannot really do the same things. So I really felt lonely sometimes.\u201d Many of the workers felt isolated in their hometowns where most often they were the only person of short stature they knew. At the park they have a place to meet others they can relate to and reportedly many dwarfs find their first loves at the park.Some say the park is a human zoo and a place to gawk, but this is not the case. Most of the performers have nowhere else where they can have a stable life with friends similar to them. The performers all say that they wouldn\u2019t be the same if they hadn\u2019t worked at the Kingdom of the Little People.The park creates a safe space for little people in China to meet friends and get paid a comfortable salary. Without the park little people in China would live as lesser members of society subject to extreme ridicule. Ethics groups that oppose the park need to be shown the effect it has had on performers and how drastically different their lives would be without it. The park must remain open for the sake of the little people all over China.Works CitedNews, Red Door. \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World: The Kingdom of the Little People.\u201d South China Morning Post.

I should be glad that it keeps \u201cAlexa\u201d clean and protected, but I cannot overlook the amount of waste created. I recycled the cardboard, but the plastic? My neighborhood recycling plant only accepts plastic bottles. It does not have the facilities to break down the multilayered packaging economically. Instead, it went to the landfill, adding to the 14.4 million tons of plastic produced each year in America.Granted, we have made progress over the years. Since 2005, United States companies have already avoided creating 1.5 billion pounds of packaging waste. Even so, reducing the amount of packaging is not enough. We must eliminate it entirely in order to see any large progress.Zero waste stores have opened all across Europe in order to combat this issue. At Original Unverpackt, in Berlin, Germany, all of their products are out in the open, unobstructed by layers of plastic, paper or metal. Precycling removes trash before it is even created. Shoppers come in with sacks and totes buying local products while making conscious purchases.Few places generate as much waste as grocery stores. We consistently see produce individually wrapped in plastic. But why is this necessary? For thousands of years, people bought goods fresh and in bulk \u2014 free of any sort of packaging. Bulk items are still around now, but their sections are dwarfed by aisles and aisles of unnecessary packaging. These small areas do not dominate stores and therefore have very little influence on our buying habits.In America, a land full of supermarkets and large companies, it is more difficult to have zero waste and bulk markets because we want security and convenience. We pay for instant gratification rather than quality when we buy packaged food. If we want to reinvent grocery shopping, both the manufacturers and the consumers must take part.Many large corporations such as Nestl\u00e9 and WalMart have taken steps toward becoming more environmentally friendly, but lesser-known brands have made the most progress. They have responded to the demands of consumers, eliminating excessive packaging and sourcing from local and organic farms. We need to continue this movement toward zero waste by encouraging consumers to change their way of life and look toward the future of healthy, sustainable living, rather than being content with harming our planet. Bring your own bags. Buy food in bulk. Shop zero-waste. Small changes are all it takes to make a difference that extends far beyond our own homes.Works CitedBall, Aimee Lee. \u201cThe Anti-Packaging Movement.\u201d New York Times, 29 Nov. 2016.

In fact, The New York Times reports that it has nearly the same capacity as Madison Square Garden. Now, McKinney Independent School District, adjacent to Allen I.S.D., is building a rival stadium for nearly $70 million. That\u2019s the equivalent of providing school lunch to all of the 24,500 students in McKinney every day for six years.This is a remarkable misappropriation of money in a state that chronically underfunds education. As of last year, not only did Texas rank 43rd in the nation for education, it ranked 49th in per pupil spending. Nationally, the U.S. spent an average of $11,667 per student whereas Texas fell behind at $7,957 per student. But it\u2019s not only Texas whose obsession with sports is ripping at the seams of our educational system and, consequently, our democracy.A democracy forming without the proper education is doomed to crumble. Education is the key in arming the electorate with the information necessary to consider candidates, yet superfluous spending toward athletics is hindering the way our society is learning and voting. Paving the path toward a strong democracy, not a sharply divided one, begins and ends with education. Shifting the focus from athletics to academics, from the playing field to the classroom, is the way to uphold our trembling nation. As Richard D. Kahlenberg and Clifford Janey explain, \u201cThe Founders saw education as the safeguard of America\u2019s system of self-governance. Educating common people was the answer to the oligarchs who said the average citizen could not be trusted to choose leaders wisely.\u201d But with more than two-thirds of Americans unable to name all three branches of government, I can\u2019t help but ponder: Is this the America that our founders had hoped for?Defunding sports is absurd. It is just as vital to have an active society as it is to have an educated one. But athletics cannot be the top priority when the U.S. is ranked so low in education. The Pew Research Center reports that the U.S. is currently 38th out of 71 developed and developing countries in math, and 24th in science. We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, but our school funds are going down the wrong drain. Author Marguerite Roza \u201cfound that one high school was spending $328 a student for math instruction and more than four times that much for cheerleading \u2014 $1,348 a cheerleader.\u201dSpend tax money wisely; invest more in education; prioritize academics over athletics. And, who knows? Maybe if we spent $60 million on libraries instead of sports stadiums, students would understand that their society values education. And they would vote accordingly.Works CitedAnderson, Lindsey. \u201cTexas Falls to 43 in National Education Ranking.\u201d El Paso Times. 11 Jan. 2016.DeSilver, Drew. \u201cU.S. Students\u2019 Academic Achievement Still Lags That of Their Peers in Many Other Countries.\u201d Pew Research Center. 15 Feb. 2017.Gerber, Marisa. \u201cAfter Texas High School Builds $60-million Stadium, Rival District Plans One for Nearly $70 Million.\u201d Los Angeles Times. 17 Sept. 2016.\u201cMcKinney ISD Meal Prices for the 2016-17 School Year.\u201d McKinney ISD.

However, it also reaffirmed the power and relevancy that the written word still has in this day and age. A study conducted at Stanford University just after the November 2016 elections found that over 7,800 students in middle school, high school and college in 12 states \u201cwere unable to assess the credibility\u201d of information that they encountered on the internet. Now, more than ever, it is critical that we teach students in all schools \u2014 public and private, K-12 and college \u2014 how to think critically and analyze the news that they come across.Though terms such as \u201cfake news\u201d have risen to prominence in the past year, the art of deception reaches back to the advent of modern media. Photography especially has long been used to make political statements, \u201cprove\u201d questionable supernatural sightings, and justify cultural appropriation. Today, complex 19th-century equipment and studios have been replaced with Photoshop and a computer. The outcome, however, is still the same: an altered form of truth, or proof of a nonexistent event. Photoshopped images cover the internet, often side-by-side with real ones. How are students with an untrained eye supposed to spot the difference between reality and fiction?Then there are the articles themselves. Fake news articles are mainly spread through various social media platforms, frequented by teenagers and adults alike. When people see fake news articles \u2014 which often have eye-catching or alarming headlines \u2014 how are they to judge the validity of these articles without knowing what to look for? Fact-checking sites like Snopes certainly help, but they do not cover every article or statement on the internet. Some claims can only be proven false through critical thinking and by consulting reputable references.There are many different ways to tackle the rise of fake news, but the most important is teaching people how to think critically about what they encounter on the news and how to recognize whether it is fact or fiction. This can only be accomplished by incorporating news literacy into existing school curriculums \u2014 such as government, civics or history classes \u2014 rather than having a separate elective or seminar. By the time students reach college, they\u2019re already \u201ctoo immersed in their own worldviews\u201d to be able to look at news objectively. News literacy classes must be introduced to schools, and it needs to be done as soon as possible. Everyone is affected by fake news, and it is now our civic duty to educate ourselves and others about it.Works CitedBarron, James. \u201cIn an Era of Fake News, Teaching Students to Parse Fact From Fiction.\u201d The New York Times. 20 Mar. 2017.Chen, Angus. \u201cLong Before There Was \u2018Fake News\u2019, There Were \u2018Fake Photos\u2019.\u201d Goats and Soda.

We all run back to class, forming a line and departing from our adventures in the land of recess. I\u2019m last in line. Every. Day.The system of alphabetical order in schools must be changed, as a silent bias toward the names starting with letters near the end of the alphabet is causing detrimental effects to our children\u2019s psychology due to the subconscious implications of inferiority.As someone with the last name \u201cZhang,\u201d I still remember the rush of excitement I felt when my teacher read the roll sheet from the bottom to the top \u2014 only on special occasions, of course. I remember the condolences the teacher would give, telling me \u201clast but not least!\u201d But I still felt least. This display of alphabetical inequality not only continually provides an unfair disadvantage and feeling of inferiority to the same group of people; it also affects our decisions made later in life.In the New York Times article \u201cHow Inequality Hollows Out the Soul\u201d by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, it discusses how social inequality allows us to \u201cnot only [see] what we knew intuitively \u2014 that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive \u2014 but that it also damages the individual psyche.\u201d If inequality in wealth damages people, why wouldn\u2019t inequality in school cause damage as well?In a recent four-series scientific study in the Journal of Consumer Research conducted by Kurt A. Carlson, assistant professor at Georgetown, and Jacqueline M. Conard, assistant professor at Belmont University, the professors found that those who had last names later in the alphabet reacted quicker to special sale opportunities when offered deals simultaneously.\u201cWe find that the later in the alphabet the first letter of one\u2019s childhood surname is, the faster the person acquires items as an adult. We dub this the last name effect ... it stems from childhood ordering structures that put children with different names in different positions in lines ... since those late in the alphabet are typically at the end of lines, they compensate by responding quickly to acquisition opportunities,\u201d Professor Carlson says.Alphabetical order is fine for files in cabinets or books in a library or for naming hurricanes. It is not appropriate for organizing people. \u201cThere may be no great alternatives to alphabetical order,\u201d says Professor Carlson. \u201cBut flip it around every now and then. That\u2019s a reasonable way to balance things out.\u201dWorks CitedGregory, Sean. \u201cHow Your Name May Cost You at the Mall.\u201d Time, 28 Jan. 2011.Wilkinson, Richard and Kate Pickett. \u201cHow Inequality Hollows Out the Soul.\u201d The New York Times, 2 Feb. 2014._________Since President Richard Nixon first waged a \u201cwar on drugs\u201d in 1971, the United States has resorted to prohibition, believing that aggressive drug bans will reduce and prevent drug-related crime, addiction, incarceration, death and disease. Yet, the opposite has occurred.According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 46.3 percent of inmates are currently imprisoned on drug offenses. The National Institute on Drug Abuse approximates that more than 50,000 individuals died from drug overdoses in 2015 alone, and states that diseases like hepatitis and H.I.V. continue to rage, spreading through unhygienic methods like unsterilized needles.Considering these failed results, the federal government should look to an alternative approach to combating drug use.That alternative is the decriminalization and legalization of all illicit drugs. This may seem like a disastrous choice; however, in Portugal, it\u2019s worked.In 2001, Portugal\u2019s government decriminalized and legalized all drugs, no matter their severity, in response to a growing heroin problem. Instead of a criminal offense, those caught with less than a 10-day supply of hard drugs are taken before a special court of legal experts, psychologists and social workers. In place of jail time, a small fine or community service, as well as treatment, is provided.Today, Portugal has one of the lowest drug-usage rates in all of Europe. The British Journal of Criminology found a significant reduction in the imprisonment of alleged drug dealers, from 14,000 in 2000 to 5,000 in 2010, and in the imprisonment of addicts, which fell from 41 percent in 1999 to 21 percent in 2008. The Washington Post reported that \u201cthere are three drug overdose deaths for every 1,000,000 citizens\u201d in Portugal; as a comparison, \u201c44.6 per million\u201d die in the United Kingdom. Drug-related diseases, like H.I.V., have decreased, \u201cwhile the dramatic rise in use feared by some has failed to materialize,\u201d as stated by the Transform Drug Policy Institute.By focusing on treatment rather than punishment, Portugal has given its citizens the opportunity to rehabilitate and contribute as functioning members of society. Consequently, the demand for drugs falls as the number of users declines.In the U.S., certain states are moving toward reformation instead of incarceration.

Members of minority groups struggle to find accurate representation in films, clinging tightly to even the smallest examples of representation. This lack of diversity is particularly damaging to young children, whose perception of the world is warped to fit a narrative where only a certain type of person gets to have a happily ever after.In 2015, only 22 out of 126 released films featured a character that was part of the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community. Some people argue that because there are more cis-heterosexuals in real life, there should be more cis-heterosexuals in films. By this logic, the number of cis-heterosexual characters in individual films should exceed L.G.B.T.Q. characters. The lack of L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters in over 100 films creates entire universes where L.G.B.T.Q.+ people are seemingly nonexistent, a statistic that does not mirror reality in the slightest.Children especially need to see L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters, and yet their demographic is the one that is most denied access to films with accurate representation. Unfortunately, many people consider same-sex relationships to be too mature for children. Because of this, impressionable young people are prevented from watching films that could help them to better understand themselves and to accept the people around them.This also prevents L.G.B.T.Q.+ people and relationships from becoming normalized. If children are not exposed to the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community until later on in life, they will learn to treat it as something new and different as adults. By showing them films with diverse casts of characters, children will recognize that L.G.B.T.Q.+ people are a part of everyday life and that they \u201chave a right to ... their happily ever after, too.\u201d Normalizing L.G.B.T.Q.+ identities will also normalize their inclusion in films and other media outlets, because the people making those films will be so used to a world of L.G.B.T.Q.+ people that to not include them would be unthinkable.Film companies argue that parents would not allow their children to see films with L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters in them, making diversity and inclusivity bad for business. Though there are certainly people who would boycott films on this basis, there are also many parents who would be thrilled to see their children introduced to that kind of diversity at such a young age. Many L.G.B.T.Q.+ adults would watch the films as well, because they want to experience the representation they were denied as a child.Representation in any type of media is important, but L.G.B.T.Q.+ visibility in children\u2019s films is of particular significance. It represents another step on the long road to equality and a shift in the mind-set of an entire generation.Works Cited\u201cOverview of Findings.\u201d GLAAD. 02 May 2016.________The angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Igneous rock melts into magma. And I\u2019m sure by now many high schoolers know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of a cell. Having knowledge in a variety of subjects gives students information that could be useful in their futures depending on what they do with their lives. But what about classes that teach skills that will be useful to everyone, regardless of their life paths? Being a high school student myself, I do not believe I currently know enough about how to manage money. If more personal finance classes were available in schools, students would be more prepared for their futures.Financial education is not a requirement in every U.S. state, and students are missing out on useful information because of this. Only 17 states \u201crequire high school students to take a course in personal finance \u2026 the same number as in 2014.\u201d The United States is also behind other countries in regard to financial education. A 2012 international survey reported, \u201cmore than 1 in 6 students in the United States failed to reach the baseline level of proficiency in financial literacy.\u201d This same large study showed that American students are just behind Latvia and just ahead of Russia in financial knowledge, at the center of the countries assessed. Using money is something people do in their everyday lives, so being in the dark about financial skills leaves room for instability.When high school students take finance classes, they are more responsible with their finances. It has been shown that \u201chigh school students who are required to take personal finance courses have better average credit scores and lower debt delinquency rates as young adults.\u201d In the New York Times article, \u201cMaking Your Family Better at Personal Finance,\u201d Paul Brown says after his daughter took a personal finance course, she was \u201cfar better with money than her equally smart brothers.\u201d A parent\u2019s advice alone is often not enough to foster sensible financial habits in young people \u2014 being in a classroom allows students to process information and make meaningful connections to their own lives.While my school district requires I take a personal finance class in high school, many schools throughout the world do not. Young students everywhere should have ways to learn about how to survive and succeed in their lives, and learning about the economy is one way to do that. Yes, learning about the cycle of how rocks melt into magma can be interesting, but learning how to create and manage a budget, use and manage a credit card, and pay off a mortgage can make a lasting positive influence on one\u2019s life.Works CitedAdvertisement"}

For Latin American countries, which overwhelmingly support global efforts to tackle climate change, the move will make it more difficult to meet climate objectives, and it will put a strain on relations with the United States.International cooperation and support will be critical for Latin American and Caribbean countries\u2019 ability to fulfill their Paris commitments and to ratchet up their pledges in the future, as climate negotiators intended. Emissions reduction plans developed by many countries, including Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, involved both unconditional commitments and more ambitious pledges that countries agreed to meet on the condition of technology transfer and international finance.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the climate pact seems to be part of a broader policy of disengagement from international affairs that will ultimately hurt the United States\u2019 relationships with Latin American countries. Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy ostensibly aims to strengthen American interests and national security, and Mr. Trump has indicated he will prioritize defense over international cooperation. The president\u2019s budget, presented to Congress on May 16, proposes to cut funding to the State Department by 30 percent compared with the previous year while increasing military spending.After Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, many Latin American leaders condemned the United States\u2019 decision to leave the Paris accord and vowed to meet their climate change targets nevertheless. With the dramatic fall in renewable energy costs and gains in energy efficiency, clean energy is often more cost-effective anyway. However, meeting the global challenges of fighting and adapting to climate change requires global cooperation, and the United States\u2019 decision to withdraw from this international partnership will damage its standing with Latin America and the rest of the world.Lisa Viscidi is the director of the energy, climate change and extractive industries program at the Inter-American Dialogue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "Supported byOpinionBEIJING \u2014 What worries you about the coming world of artificial intelligence?Too often the answer to this question resembles the plot of a sci-fi thriller. People worry that developments in A.I. will bring about the \u201csingularity\u201d \u2014 that point in history when A.I. surpasses human intelligence, leading to an unimaginable revolution in human affairs. Or they wonder whether instead of our controlling artificial intelligence, it will control us, turning us, in effect, into cyborgs.These are interesting issues to contemplate, but they are not pressing. They concern situations that may not arise for hundreds of years, if ever. At the moment, there is no known path from our best A.I. tools (like the Google computer program that recently beat the world\u2019s best player of the game of Go) to \u201cgeneral\u201d A.I. \u2014 self-aware computer programs that can engage in common-sense reasoning, attain knowledge in multiple domains, feel, express and understand emotions and so on.This doesn\u2019t mean we have nothing to worry about. On the contrary, the A.I. products that now exist are improving faster than most people realize and promise to radically transform our world, not always for the better. They are only tools, not a competing form of intelligence. But they will reshape what work means and how wealth is created, leading to unprecedented economic inequalities and even altering the global balance of power.It is imperative that we turn our attention to these imminent challenges.What is artificial intelligence today? Roughly speaking, it\u2019s technology that takes in huge amounts of information from a specific domain (say, loan repayment histories) and uses it to make a decision in a specific case (whether to give an individual a loan) in the service of a specified goal (maximizing profits for the lender). Think of a spreadsheet on steroids, trained on big data. These tools can outperform human beings at a given task.This kind of A.I. is spreading to thousands of domains (not just loans), and as it does, it will eliminate many jobs. Bank tellers, customer service representatives, telemarketers, stock and bond traders, even paralegals and radiologists will gradually be replaced by such software. Over time this technology will come to control semiautonomous and autonomous hardware like self-driving cars and robots, displacing factory workers, construction workers, drivers, delivery workers and many others.Unlike the Industrial Revolution and the computer revolution, the A.I. revolution is not taking certain jobs (artisans, personal assistants who use paper and typewriters) and replacing them with other jobs (assembly-line workers, personal assistants conversant with computers). Instead, it is poised to bring about a wide-scale decimation of jobs \u2014 mostly lower-paying jobs, but some higher-paying ones, too.This transformation will result in enormous profits for the companies that develop A.I., as well as for the companies that adopt it. Imagine how much money a company like Uber would make if it used only robot drivers. Imagine the profits if Apple could manufacture its products without human labor. Imagine the gains to a loan company that could issue 30 million loans a year with virtually no human involvement. (As it happens, my venture capital firm has invested in just such a loan company.)We are thus facing two developments that do not sit easily together: enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands and enormous numbers of people out of work. What is to be done?Part of the answer will involve educating or retraining people in tasks A.I. tools aren\u2019t good at. Artificial intelligence is poorly suited for jobs involving creativity, planning and \u201ccross-domain\u201d thinking \u2014 for example, the work of a trial lawyer. But these skills are typically required by high-paying jobs that may be hard to retrain displaced workers to do. More promising are lower-paying jobs involving the \u201cpeople skills\u201d that A.I. lacks: social workers, bartenders, concierges \u2014 professions requiring nuanced human interaction. But here, too, there is a problem: How many bartenders does a society really need?The solution to the problem of mass unemployment, I suspect, will involve \u201cservice jobs of love.\u201d These are jobs that A.I. cannot do, that society needs and that give people a sense of purpose. Examples include accompanying an older person to visit a doctor, mentoring at an orphanage and serving as a sponsor at Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 or, potentially soon, Virtual Reality Anonymous (for those addicted to their parallel lives in computer-generated simulations). The volunteer service jobs of today, in other words, may turn into the real jobs of the future.Other volunteer jobs may be higher-paying and professional, such as compassionate medical service providers who serve as the \u201chuman interface\u201d for A.I. programs that diagnose cancer. In all cases, people will be able to choose to work fewer hours than they do now.Who will pay for these jobs? Here is where the enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands comes in. It strikes me as unavoidable that large chunks of the money created by A.I. will have to be transferred to those whose jobs have been displaced. This seems feasible only through Keynesian policies of increased government spending, presumably raised through taxation on wealthy companies.As for what form that social welfare would take, I would argue for a conditional universal basic income: welfare offered to those who have a financial need, on the condition they either show an effort to receive training that would make them employable or commit to a certain number of hours of \u201cservice of love\u201d voluntarism.To fund this, tax rates will have to be high. The government will not only have to subsidize most people\u2019s lives and work; it will also have to compensate for the loss of individual tax revenue previously collected from employed individuals.This leads to the final and perhaps most consequential challenge of A.I. The Keynesian approach I have sketched out may be feasible in the United States and China, which will have enough successful A.I. businesses to fund welfare initiatives via taxes. But what about other countries?They face two insurmountable problems. First, most of the money being made from artificial intelligence will go to the United States and China. A.I. is an industry in which strength begets strength: The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the more data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you can attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product. It\u2019s a virtuous circle, and the United States and China have already amassed the talent, market share and data to set it in motion.For example, the Chinese speech-recognition company iFlytek and several Chinese face-recognition companies such as Megvii and SenseTime have become industry leaders, as measured by market capitalization. The United States is spearheading the development of autonomous vehicles, led by companies like Google, Tesla and Uber. As for the consumer internet market, seven American or Chinese companies \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 are making extensive use of A.I. and expanding operations to other countries, essentially owning those A.I. markets. It seems American businesses will dominate in developed markets and some developing markets, while Chinese companies will win in most developing markets.The other challenge for many countries that are not China or the United States is that their populations are increasing, especially in the developing world. While a large, growing population can be an economic asset (as in China and India in recent decades), in the age of A.I. it will be an economic liability because it will comprise mostly displaced workers, not productive ones.So if most countries will not be able to tax ultra-profitable A.I. companies to subsidize their workers, what options will they have? I foresee only one: Unless they wish to plunge their people into poverty, they will be forced to negotiate with whichever country supplies most of their A.I. software \u2014 China or the United States \u2014 to essentially become that country\u2019s economic dependent, taking in welfare subsidies in exchange for letting the \u201cparent\u201d nation\u2019s A.I. companies continue to profit from the dependent country\u2019s users. Such economic arrangements would reshape today\u2019s geopolitical alliances.One way or another, we are going to have to start thinking about how to minimize the looming A.I.-fueled gap between the haves and the have-nots, both within and between nations. Or to put the matter more optimistically: A.I. is presenting us with an opportunity to rethink economic inequality on a global scale. These challenges are too far-ranging in their effects for any nation to isolate itself from the rest of the world.Kai-Fu Lee is the chairman and chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm, and the president of its Artificial Intelligence Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Titans Make Pilgrimage to White House to Discuss Government Systems", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cGovernment needs to catch up with the technology revolution,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who strolled in at the end of the meeting to greet the tech titans. \u201cWe\u2019re going to change that with the help of great American businesses like the people assembled.\u201dHe later said, drawing laughter, \u201cWe have approximately $3.5 trillion of market value in this room \u2014 but that\u2019s almost the exact number that we\u2019ve created since my election.\u201dThe event was organized by Jared Kushner, special adviser to the president and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and Chris Liddell, the White House director of strategic initiatives and former chief financial officer of Microsoft. Mr. Kushner\u2019s Office of American Innovation brought together the executives for 10 workshops on topics such as cybersecurity, analytics and using technology to better connect people to government services.Mr. Kushner opened the event in the White House Indian Peace Treaty room by emphasizing the potential of the companies to improve the government\u2019s outdated and inefficient technology systems.\u201cTogether we will unleash the creativity of the private sector to provide citizen services in a way that has never happened before,\u201d he said.The opportunity for Silicon Valley is enormous. The federal government spends $80 billion a year on information technology, much of it used to maintain outdated technology such as data systems that are decades old and storage that includes floppy disks used at the Defense Department. Federal agencies maintain 6,100 data centers that could be consolidated and moved to the cloud.The meeting occurred as tech company stocks roared back after declining in the last two weeks, pushing the stock market to records on Monday. Apple and Alphabet, the parent of Google, were among the top gainers after three consecutive sessions of declines.Mr. Musk did not attend the meeting Monday. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, was invited but declined because of a scheduling conflict, the company said.\u201cThis is a double-edged sword for the tech C.E.O.s because they don\u2019t want to be window dressing and used for photo ops,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor and associate dean at the Yale School of Management. \u201cBut on the other side, this is the most business-friendly administration since Eisenhower and is much more open than any administration to influence on the spot.\u201dAdministration officials said that the chief executives had done their homework and were engaged in the workshops and discussions.\u201cI don\u2019t think there was any one big suggestion,\u201d Mr. Liddell said in an interview. \u201cBut there was a large number of small suggestions, all of which are interesting for us to follow up.\u201dSeveral tech executives had a chance to address Mr. Trump in a round-table discussion at the end of the day.Mr. Bezos encouraged the president to use commercial technology whenever possible. Amazon\u2019s booming cloud services business has become a contractor to the government. The Amazon founder also emphasized the need to retrain workers and said it was \u201cimpossible to overstate\u201d the importance of artificial intelligence.Peter Thiel, an early Trump supporter and tech investor, praised the president.\u201cYour administration is doing very well,\u201d he said.Two people who were briefed on the tech meeting later said Mr. Trump also voiced support for \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration reform, a term that was used during the Obama administration to generally describe a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States.The president made the promise, the two people said, after being told by Mr. Cook that tech employees may worry they are being targeted amid confusion over the administration\u2019s immigration policy. It was unclear exactly what the president meant, or if he was using the term to mean something else. White House press aides did not respond to a request for comment on Monday night, and a spokesman for Apple declined to comment.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from Washington, Vindu Goel from San Francisco, and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Feel the Noise: Homemade Slime Becomes Big Business", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported byPrototypeBy slime, Goldie, 10, was referring to the sticky substance with a well-known heritage that includes the buckets of green stuff dumped on Nickelodeon guests, the goo spewed on Bill Murray and his \u201cGhostbusters\u201d crew and the slippery concoction in small plastic trash cans that Mattel started selling in the late 1970s.The current iteration is homemade, and it comes in a multitude of colors and textures \u2014 fluffy, glittery, grainy \u2014 that emit crackling noises when poked and squeezed.\u201cIt\u2019s fun to play with,\u201d said Goldie, adding that it can help relieve stress, too. \u201cBut it\u2019s also like you\u2019re making your own science experiment in your house.\u201dLike Goldie, some children have turned slime into a business.There\u2019s a thriving nationwide market for slime, and the demand is met by children aged 8 to 12, teenagers and young adults, who sell it at school or online, often through Etsy. Many post marketing videos on Instagram, where they can be seen poking, swirling and squishing globs of it. The hashtag #slime appears on 3.5 million Instagram posts, and slime searches on Etsy have increased 9,000 percent since October, according to the company.YouTube is brimming with video tutorials, or \u201cslime D.I.Y.s.\u201d The most popular garner millions of views and attract lucrative advertising and sponsorship deals for their creators.Although Nickelodeon\u2019s parent company, Viacom, owns trademarks on a plethora of slime-related products, including \u201cfree-flowing gel,\u201d clothing and books, the term slime is widely used among home producers, and Viacom typically doesn\u2019t enforce its rights against them.The standard slime ingredients are white school glue and the household cleaning detergent known as Borax, or sodium borate. To jazz up the color, scent and texture, slime-makers add glitter, food coloring, essential oils, baby oil, cornstarch and shaving cream.In the past few months, Goldie and a friend have been mixing slime at home and selling it to their schoolmates. Most of their customers are in fourth, fifth and sixth grades.\u201cWe ask them if they want it fluffy or stretchy,\u201d Goldie said, adding that they have a strict policy of fulfilling the orders within one or two days. \u201cIt\u2019s like Amazon Prime.\u201dShe estimates that they have sold 30 slimes, at $5 each. For larger slimes, they charge $10; for a gallon, it\u2019s $25. They have yet to close a gallon-size deal.Credit for the trend goes, at least in part, to Karina Garcia, 23, a former waitress known as the Slime Queen. Ms. Garcia began posting tutorials on YouTube several years ago showing things like decorations for school supplies and how to make lipstick. In fall 2015, she hit on slime.\u201cI decided to do sensory play, like squishy things,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I feel that\u2019s what kids like. They\u2019re into Play-Doh and anything else squishy.\u201dSlime wasn\u2019t yet a thing when she started making it, and there were no online tutorials, Ms. Garcia said. So she filmed herself mixing recipes, and the videos were a sensation. Seven months into her slime venture, she started making money. Soon after, she was fully supporting herself, her parents and her siblings on slime.What sets her apart is that Ms. Garcia doesn\u2019t sell her slime. She doesn\u2019t need to. Her earnings come from corporate advertisers and sponsorship deals, from companies like Audible, Coca-Cola and Disney. The sponsorships range from $30,000 to $60,000. She works three or four days a week on videos and earns six figures per month, she said.\u201cThere are times when it\u2019s $200,000 in a really good month,\u201d Ms. Garcia said.In March, she bought a six-bedroom house in Riverside, Calif. Her slime studio overlooks a swimming pool, a hot tub and a construction site where she\u2019s building a guesthouse. There\u2019s a screening room and a game room downstairs. Her parents and siblings live with her.\u201cI\u2019ve retired my parents,\u201d Ms. Garcia said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely really crazy. Even I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m like, \u2018How is this happening?\u2019\u201dShe\u2019s also capitalizing on the trend by developing a line of D.I.Y. slime kits and writing a recipe book: \u201cKarina Garcia\u2019s D.I.Y. Slime.\u201d Entries include crystal jelly, aromatic coffee and hot Cheetos slime, featuring real (though inedible) Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos.Last summer, Ms. Jagan started making slime so prolifically that her mother complained. \u201cShe was like, \u2018You need to stop making slime,\u2019\u201d Ms Jagan said. \u201c\u2018You have too much all over your room.\u2019\u201dInstead of tossing it out, she created a business proposal. Her mother, Ahilya Singh, agreed to the plan, and the two researched logistics and shipping.They chose Etsy, because Ms. Jagan didn\u2019t want to design her own website, and Ms. Singh liked that customers could pay through the platform.So far, Ms. Jagan has sold 982 pots. Her prices range from $6 to $12, and most of her customers are in California and the Northeast.\u201cI really look at what\u2019s the best deal I can get for my customers while I still make a profit,\u201d Ms. Jagan said. She reinvests most of her earnings and saves some for college, and hopes to one day major in business.Ms. Jagan relies on Etsy\u2019s analytics tools to determine what days her site is most popular and how many views each slime batch attracts. To balance her business with school work and a robotics hobby, she films multiple slime videos on weekends and vacations.Her mother, Ms. Singh, said the slime trade isn\u2019t about profits, but rather provides an opportunity for her daughter to learn to run a business.The fickleness of the adolescent and teenage demographic is well established, and, as with other fads, slime is likely to fade. However, these purveyors aren\u2019t yet concerned.\u201cI think slime will eventually peter out, Ms. Jagan said. \u201cBut for now it\u2019s going strong enough. Whatever happens, happens.\u201dMs. Garcia was similarly sanguine. \u201cI don\u2019t really think about it dying off,\u201d she said.\u201cIf it were to stop, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Ms. Garcia said of the interest in slime. \u201cI\u2019ll just go on to other D.I.Y.s and stuff like that. But it would kind of suck, because I love slime.\u201dAn article on June 25 about homemade slime referred incorrectly to the characters who did the sliming in the movie \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d Bill Murray\u2019s character, Dr. Peter Venkman, was hit by green goo by the ghostly blob Slimer; Dr. Venkman and his crew did not do the sliming.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cellphone Roaming Charges End in Europe. Many Respond With a Yawn.", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "Supported byAfter a decade of debate, Europe will finally abolish cellphone roaming charges this week, allowing people from Britain to Bulgaria to call, send text messages and surf the web without incurring eye-watering charges when traveling across the 28-nation bloc.Albena Krastanova, though, will not be among them.Ms. Krastanova, 37, prefers to vacation in her native Bulgaria when she is not selling newspapers in Sofia, the country\u2019s capital. Ms. Krastanova says she is too busy \u2014 and many of her compatriots too poor \u2014 to travel elsewhere in Europe.\u201cPaying the bills and providing for my 4-year-old daughter is our main priority. There is little left to splurge on trips abroad,\u201d Ms. Krastanova said as she cross-stitched an elaborate pattern and sat in her newspaper kiosk, a cup of coffee and a pack of cigarettes resting next to her embroidery. \u201cI don\u2019t use roaming.\u201dEurope\u2019s decade-long struggle to end cellphone roaming charges began before the original iPhone was released. But it involved often bitter lobbying between the region\u2019s cellular operators and consumer groups over how much people should pay to use their phones internationally. The changes will affect only people with European cellphone contracts, meaning Americans and others traveling in the region will still face costly charges.Critics point to data showing that a minority of Europeans regularly travel beyond their national borders to charge that the changes may offer limited benefit to most Europeans\u2019 daily online activities.\u201cThere\u2019s just a small percentage of consumers who will benefit from the scrapping of roaming charges,\u201d said Luca Schiavoni, a telecom regulation analyst at Ovum, a technology research group, in London. \u201cIt\u2019s for the few, not the many.\u201dDefenders of Europe\u2019s digital policies reject such criticism, saying that removing cellphone roaming charges took time because it represented the bedrock for the rest of the region\u2019s digital plans. It is hard to watch Netflix or shop on Amazon while traveling, they say, if you cannot first connect to the internet.For Viviane Reding, a former European commissioner who shepherded the roaming overhaul through Brussels\u2019s complex legislative process, the reduction in people\u2019s cellphone bills is a marked improvement. Even if Europeans travel abroad only a couple of times a year, they now can avoid extortionately high prices for even the briefest of calls or internet browsing.And while the roaming rules took longer than many had first expected, Europe\u2019s other digital proposals, she said, were still on track.\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest change Europe has ever made digitally,\u201d said Ms. Reding, now a member of the European Parliament. \u201cThe new rules will apply to every company operating in the whole European market.\u201dMatt Chapam is one European who is eager for roaming to end.A British software engineer who moved to Amsterdam last year, Mr. Chapman, 28, had routinely paid hefty charges when traveling back to Britain to see his family.When the new rules come into force, his Dutch cellphone contract of 25 euros, or $28, a month will give him almost unlimited internet browsing and phone calls wherever he is in Europe. That compares to almost weekly top-ups of \u20ac20 that Mr. Chapman previously made when using his cellphone abroad.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to never have to worry about that again,\u201d he said.Yet, like most changes to European digital policy, the scrapping of roaming charges is by no means the end of the debate. Consumer groups and European officials are already voicing concerns that people may still see costly fees on their cellphone bills.While there will be strict caps on how much telecom operators can charge when individuals are outside their home countries, cellphone carriers can increase other fees, including phone calls and text messages to other European countries when people are not traveling, to recoup potential lost income.Lise Fuhr, director general of ETNO, a telecom industry group, said companies were offering competitive prices across Europe. But, she added, operators needed investment-friendly policies \u2014 not further regulation \u2014 if Europe wanted to build much-needed high-speed broadband networks and other digital infrastructure.European officials, though, have warned companies against price increases on services not linked to the end of cellphone roaming, saying that regulators may step in if they see potential unfair practices.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a Europe without digital borders,\u201d said Roberto Viola, director general of the European Commission\u2019s digital policy unit.That message will be music to the ears of Ondine Ripka, a French national living in Belgium who recently signed up for a new cellphone contract with Orange, a European carrier.While her overall monthly bill has fallen more than 50 percent, to \u20ac40, compared with what she paid to her previous operator, Ms. Ripka said certain charges, including sending text messages from Belgium to other European countries, were now significantly more expensive.In response, Orange said it was fully compliant with European rules, but that it had made changes to some of its products to better represent how consumers used its services.Boryana Dzhambazova contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Staples to Sell for $6.9 Billion, and Its New Owner Has an Uphill Battle", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byAs online shopping claims ever more casualties, Staples, a mainstay of office supplies, has agreed to sell itself to a private equity firm.The deal is the latest instance of a once-prominent name in retailing being laid low by the powerful forces reshaping how people shop (in other words: Amazon).Yet Sycamore is acquiring a company that is squarely in decline. Sales and gross profits at Staples have fallen for each of the last four full years. At the same time, the company has been shrinking the number of stores it operates.\u201cWe also compete with online retailers such as Amazon.com, mass merchants such as Walmart and Target, warehouse clubs such as Costco, computer and electronics retail stores such as Best Buy,\u201d the company said.Nor did it offer up an especially rosy outlook.\u201cWe are focused on maximizing profitability and reducing risk in our underperforming North American retail and international businesses,\u201d the company said in its annual report, noting that it planned to close about 70 stores in North America this year.Staples\u2019s board and management decided to sell the company after shareholders had essentially lost faith in the business. Shares of the company were trading near $7 earlier this year, having fallen sharply from about $18 a share just two and a half years ago.Investors can take some measure of solace from this deal. Sycamore\u2019s offer of $10.25 a share represents a 20 percent premium over the company\u2019s stock price in early April, before initial reports of a deal to sell the company lifted shares.\u201cStaples\u2019 board believes that this process has led to a transaction which is in the best interests of our stockholders, as well as Staples and its employees,\u201d Robert Sulentic, the company\u2019s chairman, said in a statement.Staples and Sycamore declined to make executives available for interviews on Wednesday.For a business on the wane, Staples still sells huge volumes of paper, printer cartridges and electronics. It reported $18.2 billion in revenue last year, down from $21.1 billion five years ago.And for a company that is closely associated with big-box stores, Staples sells a minority of its goods at bricks-and-mortar locations. Some $10.6 billion of its sales are delivered, compared with about $6.6 billion sold in stores. That suggests that even as stores close and consumers shop online, Staples has a large and potentially profitable opportunity.For those reasons, the company was an ideal target for a leveraged buyout.What\u2019s more, Staples has very little debt, just about $1 billion in total. That healthy balance sheet will mean Sycamore \u2014 which will borrow much of the money it needs to fund its buyout \u2014 will not have to overload the company with a crushing debt burden.A consortium of banks including UBS, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Canada, Jefferies, Wells Fargo Bank and Fifth Third Bank are providing financing. The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, is expected to close by the end of the year.Ultimately, however, Sycamore will have to figure out what to do with Staples.\u201cDeclining traffic, escalating leases and sluggish consumer spending have made it very difficult to support the debt load that often comes with private equity acquisitions,\u201d Liz Dunn, chief executive of Pro4ma, a retail analytics software company, said in an email. \u201cStaples\u2019 position as an industry leader provides some cover from retail\u2019s meltdown, but there remains too many stores in almost every sector of retail, and office products are hardly immune from disruptive trends.\u201dIf Sycamore follows a traditional private equity playbook, it is expected to have an easy time squeezing out costs, streamlining operations and issuing special dividends that enrich the firm and its limited partners.And there are other potential deals that could help strengthen Staples.One option could be to try to revive a merger with Office Depot. That deal was among a number of prominent mergers that were met with opposition in the last years of the Obama administration.Executives and bankers are betting that the Trump administration will take a more business-friendly approach to antitrust review. But with a dearth of big mergers and acquisitions so far in President Trump\u2019s tenure, that belief has not been tested. This deal is the largest buyout of the year in the United States.Whatever it does with Staples, Sycamore may have a hard time returning the company to the public markets. Investors who have lost faith in Staples today would need a drastic change in perspective to buy shares in the same company a few years from now. Instead, Sycamore may try to sell Staples to a different private equity firm, or a strategic buyer like Walmart.For Staples\u2019s chief executive, Shira Goodman, the sale to Sycamore caps a short tenure in charge. She was installed as interim chief executive last year after her longtime boss, Ron Sargent, stepped down after failing to complete the Office Depot deal, and her position was later made permanent.Barclays and Morgan Stanley advised Staples, and WilmerHale provided legal advice. Sycamore was advised by Bank of America and Deutsche Bank, and received legal advice from Kirkland & Ellis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wonder Woman, Weaponized", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byEditorial ObserverThis weaponized posture brings a welcome edginess to a 75-year-old comic book idol who maintained a squeaky clean rectitude while trapped in a succession of conceptual cages that writers and editors fashioned for her. The mistreatment she experienced at the hands of the men who dominated the comic book business in the 1940s echoed the trials that real women endured as they struggled to find places in the world of work.Mr. Marston appealed to young men by dressing Wonder Women as a 1940s pinup girl, with a red bustier, blue underwear and kinky, knee-high boots. He shaped her temperament to answer critics who were beginning to view comics as a source of violence, delinquency and general moral rot. His Wonder Woman hated guns, and her battle gear consisted of golden bracelets that deflected bullets and a magical lariat that could force bad guys to tell the truth.Mr. Marston was fixated on bondage. As the Lepore book points out, every comic book in which Wonder Woman appeared included scenes with her \u201cchained, bound, gagged, lassoed, tied, fettered and manacled.\u201d As a Wonder Woman editor noted, Mr. Marston\u2019s conception of strong femininity encompassed the dissonant notion that powerful women should revel in male domination.Introduced in 1941, Wonder Woman became hugely popular very quickly. A year later, she became the first female superhero to get her own comic book title and crashed the Justice Society of America, a boys\u2019 club that included Superman, Batman and Green Lantern. (Instead of becoming a full partner, she settled for the role of secretary.)Even before the hearings, publishers had adopted policies that killed some superheros outright and bled the vitality out of others. The pressure to churn out plain vanilla characters and cornball moral rectitude was especially debilitating to franchise players like Superman and Batman. They were soon deemed square by younger, hipper readers, and they are still struggling to shake off that legacy. They were sitting ducks in the \u201960s when the upstart Marvel Comics company started pumping out morally ambiguous heroes who embraced an inner nastiness and didn\u2019t really give a damn what other characters thought.Wonder Woman, too, had been softened and diminished in a number of ways. She had become by turns a fashion model, a baby sitter, an actress and a lonely hearts advice columnist. At one point, the publisher even ditched her trademark boots for shoes that resembled ballet slippers.The new film capitalizes on this legacy, and strikes a cathartic note with female moviegoers in particular. What\u2019s remarkable is that it took so long to create a big-budget movie for one of the most popular comic book characters in the history of the medium.Advertisement"}

Luckily, the crossings are kind, so my second guess was ODDS.\u25a0 28D: I don\u2019t really think of a JAM JAR as a \u201cPreserves preserver;\u201d it\u2019s more of a container. Preserves are preserved by a heat or pressure canning process and sometimes by including an acid like lemon juice in the process.\u25a0 42D: I had CARA instead of CARO until I realized that BAY MEETS GIRL would take Mr. Margolis\u2019s theme off into a totally different direction.I am very pleased to have my second puzzle run in The New York Times. I have to give credit to some college friends for helping me bring this together; they were spending a beautiful summer weekend with my wife and me, and we started bouncing around \u201cboy meets girl\u201d names. There are actually a ton of them! Some that weren\u2019t used: Chris Christie, Edmund Hillary, Hugh Laurie, Buddy Holly. So it helped to have a bunch to choose from to make the puzzle and the fill work.Not too many fill issues, since there were four theme entries including the revealer. Thanks to Will and Joel for coming up with some improved clues and answers. I liked the way they took \u201cneo\u201d and \u201ccon\u201d and made them into one answer (now why didn\u2019t I think of that?)Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon-Whole Foods: A Good Deal?", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:As I read the article, I had memories of my parents going to the local grocer down the street to buy the food we would be eating that night. My mother or father would talk to the grocer about his family, and the grocer would ask about our family. He would wrap our meat in brown paper, and other items were placed in a sack. The vegetables were seasonal and from a local farm.Now I am not saying that I want to go back to the local grocer days, because I really enjoy the exotic fruits and vegetables that I get from the big grocery stores. But there is something that doesn\u2019t seem right about ordering groceries online. Have Americans become so unsocial and disconnected?I like it when the person at the checkout counter remembers that I like potato chips and tells me about the special on my favorite ones. Sometimes the other customers would give me a good recipe. Connecting with people and connecting with your computer are not the same.ANTONIA I. DELUCA, BOLIVIA, N.C.To the Editor:The chief executive of Whole Foods, John Mackey, has built an empire on giving shelf space to products that have transformed American food culture for the better, increasing the variety and quality of organic and plant-based options in particular. At the same time, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has changed the retail landscape in ways that make shopping easier for consumers and thereby improve our lives.These two innovators will merge the ideals of conscious capitalism and wicked efficiency, which should be a boon for healthy, humane and sustainable food companies.BRUCE FRIEDRICH, WASHINGTONTo the Editor:Like it or not, history tells us that change in all aspects of life, occasioned by technology, is inevitable. Exactly what changes will be wrought by Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods is hard to say, but one thing is inevitable about this and almost all technology-inspired change: Jobs will be lost. As automation of service, and even professional, jobs occurs with increasing rapidity, none of us are exempt.Rather than bemoaning this result or attempting to thwart it, we need to figure out how to provide jobs and income for the ever-increasing number of people whose jobs succumb to automation. The failure to do so will have catastrophic consequences \u2014 either in further increases in income and wealth disparities, or in the creation of a permanently oppressed underclass, or in revolution, or all three.ALAN MEISEL, PITTSBURGHTo the Editor:As an independent sales rep, I\u2019m all too aware of the havoc caused by Amazon\u2019s low prices. The destruction of competition, however, is by no means solely Amazon\u2019s doing; it\u2019s the manufacturers and distributors who always award larger dealers better pricing at the expense of smaller brick-and-mortar stores.Better sales management and implementation of minimum advertised pricing (known as MAP) is a simple, effective and perfectly legal way to protect and diversify competition instead of enabling the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d of product pricing and low profitability.When retailers can compete by offering better service and not simply better pricing, everyone wins, Amazon customers included.ERIC KLEIN, MONTCLAIR, N.J.Advertisement"}
