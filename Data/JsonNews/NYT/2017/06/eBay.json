{"Headline": "How the Dark Web\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts Went Down", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.When Ross Ulbricht created the Silk Road, a clandestine online drug bazaar hidden on the deep web, he was a 26-year-old libertarian idealist living in Austin, Tex., talking his girlfriend\u2019s ear off about Austrian economics and seasteading experiments \u2014 the idea of creating communities in the middle of the sea, free from government regulations. For all his lofty ambitions, he felt like a failure. He had flunked his Ph.D. exam and was unable to find a buyer for his seasteading gaming simulation. But with the Silk Road he was able to marry his business ambitions and anti-authoritarian philosophy; he envisioned it as a powerful way to defy what he perceived to be the state\u2019s irrational drug policies. Using an anonymizing browser like Tor and the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, people could discreetly buy and sell drugs. Ulbricht taught himself to code and he began by selling mushrooms that he grew himself.By the time Ulbricht was arrested two years later, the Silk Road was an estimated $1.2 billion business that expanded into heroin, guns, hacking tools, counterfeit cash and cyanide. Ulbricht, a former Boy Scout, had tried to commission five murders as the Dread Pirate Roberts, the pseudonym under which he ruled the site. The obsessive, dizzying manhunt to apprehend him involved a slew of government agencies and ended with a neck-breaking plot twist: double agents and hundreds of thousands of dollars in missing Bitcoin.Ulbricht is currently appealing a life sentence for seven convictions, including narcotics, money laundering and the kingpin statute, more typically applied to Mafia bosses or cartel leaders. Evidence unearthed by federal agents included his journal, along with nearly two million words of chat logs between Dread Pirate Roberts and his underlings detailing the operations of the site.The cast of characters has been established over the years since Ulbricht\u2019s arrest, but Bilton\u2019s impressive reporting gives more space to a story that could use some sprawl. For instance, close observers may remember Gary Alford, the criminal investigator with the I.R.S., who was the first agent to come across Ulbricht\u2019s name in conjunction with the Silk Road. Previous accounts gave us the logistics, but Bilton\u2019s book gives us psychological shading and insight into Alford\u2019s method. Alford was born in Brooklyn in 1977, the summer the Son of Sam terrorized New York. It stuck with him that the N.Y.P.D. finally caught the serial killer by poring over parking tickets. He had a hunch he could ensnare Dread Pirate Roberts the same way, and began to look for a sloppy mistake. Sure enough, he discovered that Ulbricht left an anonymous comment on a forum called the Shroomery when he was trying to drum up attention for his new site. However, he had neglected to scrub his email address.In Bilton\u2019s account an unexpected symmetry emerges between the agents investigating Ulbricht and the kingpin himself. They\u2019re all fighting feelings of inferiority and treating the Silk Road as a chance to prove themselves. Bilton\u2019s focus is on the hunt, and the book seems determined to sustain the suspense, even when it\u2019s baked into the plot. Many chapters end with a cliffhanger, which adds a cinematic quality but veers into pulpy true crime when it feels like there\u2019s more pathos at stake. Sometimes the facts are more satisfying than the framing.Ulbricht\u2019s rise and fall is like the start-up hero\u2019s journey reflected in a black mirror. He was fond of the same Ayn Rand quotes as other founders: \u201cThe question isn\u2019t who is going to let me; it\u2019s who is going to stop me.\u201d He had his own version of a consigliere, in the form of Variety Jones. (Ulbricht\u2019s ex-girlfriend gets a lot of space, but the most tender and complex relationship of the book is between him and Variety Jones.)Ulbricht also had the same blinkered view of the consequences of his actions. However, unlike the moral transgressions of the Uber C.E.O. Travis Kalanick or the Theranos C.E.O. Elizabeth Holmes, his came with chat logs. The documentation offers a small window into one of late capitalism\u2019s best kept secrets: How these messianic entrepreneurs talk behind closed doors when they fall so far from their ideals. I wish there had been more focus on that rather than scenes inside a Samsung factory or yet another of Ulbricht\u2019s beach vacations.Since the arrest, Ulbricht\u2019s situation seems decidedly less fringe. Libertarianism has rolled up into the Republican mainstream. The rhetoric that inspired him, from books by Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises, has found its way into the Republican Party. Gawker, the site responsible for first reporting on Silk Road, is dead, bankrupted by Peter Thiel, the libertarian billionaire venture capitalist, Trump adviser and Facebook board member.Like some other start-up founders, Ulbricht is undone by his na\u00efvet\u00e9 and narcissism. \u201cI remember clearly why I created the Silk Road,\u201d he said at sentencing. \u201cI wanted to empower people to be able to make choices in their lives, for themselves and to have privacy and anonymity.\u201d The judge responded: \u201cNo drug dealer from the Bronx selling meth or heroin or crack has ever made these kinds of arguments to the court. It is a privileged argument. You are no better a person than any other drug dealer. ... You were captain of the ship, as the Dread Pirate Roberts, and you made your own laws and you enforced those laws in the manner that you saw fit.\u201d As she handed down the sentence, she said: \u201cIt was, in fact, a carefully planned life\u2019s work. It was your opus. You wanted it to be your legacy \u2014 and it is.\u201dNitasha Tiku is a senior writer for Wired covering Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Fined Record $2.7 Billion in E.U. Antitrust Ruling", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle suffered a major blow on Tuesday after European antitrust officials fined the search giant a record $2.7 billion for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals.The penalty, of 2.4 billion euros, highlights the aggressive stance that European officials have taken in regulating many of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, going significantly further than their American counterparts.\u201cIn Europe, companies must compete on the merits regardless if they are European or not,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules.\u201dThe apparent focus on Silicon Valley has prompted accusations from some in the United States that the European Union is unfairly targeting American companies. Officials in the bloc vigorously deny those assertions.In targeting the activities of these digital giants, experts say, European authorities are laying down a marker for more hands-on control of how the digital world operates. And while the $2.7 billion fine announced on Tuesday is tiny compared with Google\u2019s $90 billion in annual revenue, it highlights the region\u2019s willingness to dole out sizable penalties.Shares of Google fell for a second straight day on the news. The stock declined 2.5 percent on Tuesday, a steeper decline than the broader Nasdaq.Europe\u2019s latest efforts to rein in technology companies stem from continuing unease that Silicon Valley has come to dominate how the continent\u2019s 500 million citizens interact online.\u201cEurope is setting the agenda,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law and economics at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like that.\u201dIn her statement on Tuesday, Ms. Vestager said that Google held a dominant position in online search, requiring the company to take extra measures to ensure that its digital services did not crowd out those of rivals.The antitrust decision related to Google\u2019s online shopping service, which the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said had received preferential treatment compared with those of rivals in specialized search results.Analysts say such so-called vertical search products \u2014 also including those for restaurant and business reviews \u2014 represent a fast-growing percentage of Google\u2019s annual revenue. The company does not break out earnings figures for this unit in its financial reports.The search company is facing two separate antitrust charges in Europe related to Android, its popular mobile software, and to some of its advertising products. Google denies the accusations.Google rebuffed the European Union\u2019s claims on Tuesday, saying that its services had helped the region\u2019s digital economy grow. It has also said that significant online competition remains in Europe, including from companies like Amazon and eBay.Despite Google\u2019s denials, the record fine \u2014 the previous high, against Intel in 2009, was \u20ac1.06 billion \u2014 represents a bloody nose for a company that holds a market share of more than 90 percent in online search in Europe.Several other antitrust complaints related to other specialized search results have been filed in Europe against Google, and Ms. Vestager said Tuesday\u2019s announcement could \u201cbe used as a framework\u201d in those investigations.That may eventually lead to further fines if European authorities find wrongdoing. The complaints include many from other American technology companies, including Oracle, News Corporation and Yelp, which have been vocal advocates of large fines against Google.Google has 90 days to respond to the European Commission\u2019s demands, or face penalties of up to 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, its parent company. European officials said on Tuesday that they would regularly monitor the company\u2019s activities to ensure that it was complying with the ruling.Under European rules, the company \u2014 and not the regulator \u2014 must come up with proposals to guarantee that it treats competitors fairly when people make online search queries. The authorities can demand that Google make further changes if they are not satisfied with the initial proposals.Analysts and many of Google\u2019s competitors have called for an independent monitor to oversee the company\u2019s digital services in Europe, which could include oversight of its search algorithms, some of Google\u2019s most important intellectual property. The company is likely to fiercely oppose such a move.Google has other options, including the removal of some of its specialized search services from Europe, or returning them to how they operated before the European Union\u2019s investigation began almost a decade ago.Whatever the outcome, analysts say they expect a protracted legal battle that will continue for several years as both Google and its rivals fight to define how search services are provided in Europe and elsewhere.\u201cGoogle\u2019s search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online,\u201d said Shivaun Raff, a co-founder of Foundem, a British comparison-shopping site that was the first company to file a complaint against Google. \u201cLeft unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He or she, along with up to seven friends, will share a lunch with Mr. Buffett at Smith & Wollensky in Manhattan.Mr. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, has been participating in this event since 2000. The money raised goes to support Glide, a nonprofit organization in San Francisco that provides a variety of services for poor and marginalized people including food \u2014 almost 800,000 meals per year \u2014 shelter and child care.Glide has an annual budget of $18 million, Janice Mirikitani and Reverend Cecil Williams, the organization\u2019s founders, said in a telephone interview.\u201cMr. Buffett\u2019s contribution through this auction is very, very important to us,\u201d Ms. Mirikitani said, adding that the organization\u2019s leaders were \u201cthrilled\u201d this past week as they watched the bidding offers rise.The auction was not always hosted on eBay. The first winner in 2000, Pete Budlong, a technology entrepreneur, placed a winning bid of $25,000 at a lively, in-person auction in San Francisco that was hosted by the actress Sharon Stone and the comedian Robin Williams.That gave Mr. Budlong, now 52, the opportunity to spend hours chatting with Mr. Buffett, his then-wife, Susan Buffett, and seven friends at a San Francisco restaurant. (Also in attendance, briefly, was Mr. Williams, who had asked Mr. Budlong at the auction if he could stop by.)\u201cIt was a conversational, pretty chill lunch,\u201d Mr. Budlong said, calling Mr. Buffett \u201cfolksy, down to earth and legitimately funny.\u201dOne of the next year\u2019s winners, Jim Halperin, 64, a collector and auction house executive who heard of the auction because he held shares in Berkshire Hathaway, said Mr. Buffett held the meal at his country club in Omaha.\u201cWe chatted for a couple hours,\u201d Mr. Halperin said, adding that Mr. Buffett had kept in touch with him since. \u201cHe was really nice, seemed as interested in us as we were in him.\u201dAs the years have gone by \u2014 and as the auction moved from an event based in San Francisco to a site on eBay \u2014 winners have come from as far as Singapore and China. They have also bid more and more money.This year\u2019s bid was not the highest ever. In 2012 and 2016, Reuters reported, anonymous bidders offered $3,456,789 to dine with Mr. Buffett. A total of 41 people bid for the lunch.It does not matter whether bidders see the lunch as a business opportunity or a job interview, said Mr. Budlong, as long as the result is more money for Glide\u2019s work.Ms. Mirikitani added that she was grateful to Mr. Buffett for 18 years of supporting the organization. \u201cHe is a brilliant businessman and he is so deeply respected and he has so much integrity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of this relationship.\u201dAn article on June 11 about an annual fund-raising auction to have lunch with the billionaire investor Warren Buffett misidentified the person who said that it did not matter whether bidders see the lunch as a business opportunity or a job interview. It was Pete Budlong, the first winner of the lunch in 2000, not Janice Mirikitani, a founder of the nonprofit group Glide, which benefits from the auction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos Wants Ideas for Philanthropy, So He Asked Twitter", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "Supported byYou\u2019re an astronomically wealthy tech mogul who has mastered the art of getting people to spend money with your company over the internet. How do you come up with fresh ideas for giving some of your fortune away?If you\u2019re Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, you fire up Twitter, naturally.On Thursday, Mr. Bezos sent a tweet to his more than 222,000 followers asking for suggestions for philanthropic giving. He specifically asked for ideas that could help the world in the near term, a contrast to long-term personal investments he has made in for-profit companies with social impact, like Blue Origin, a space firm, and The Washington Post.Mr. Bezos wrote, \u201cI\u2019m thinking I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now \u2014 short term \u2014 at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact.\u201dThe prospect of someone with Mr. Bezos\u2019s wealth \u2014 he is the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a fortune of well over $80 billion \u2014 increasing his giving was greeted enthusiastically by people who work in philanthropy. His approach is unusual compared with many big philanthropists from the technology field, like Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft, whose foundation has tackled long-term global health problems like malaria, among other challenges.\u201cI would call it surprising, but welcome,\u201d said Jacob Harold, the president of Guidestar, a national database of nonprofits. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for big-dollar donors to be honest about their desire for short-term results.\u201dMr. Harold said that he \u201cwould be worried if every donor was saying this,\u201d but that Mr. Bezos\u2019s approach could have a meaningful effect.Mr. Bezos asked people to reply to his post with their ideas. A little more than five hours after his request, there were more than 3,600 such replies, including suggestions for contributing to affordable housing, veterans\u2019 organizations and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender causes.Larry Brilliant, the acting chairman of the Skoll Global Threats Fund, a philanthropy created by Jeff Skoll, one of eBay\u2019s founders, said that crowdsourcing philanthropic ideas had had mixed success in large part because of the challenge of identifying ones that have promise.\u201cThe denominator of ideas you will get in, the vast majority of ideas which are not good, not viable, will flood this process,\u201d said Mr. Brilliant, who formerly ran Google\u2019s philanthropic arm.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Mom and Pop Can\u2019t Sell the Farm (or in This Case, the Theme Park)", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringThe octogenarian couple have run the place for 43 years and are finally ready to retire. But their sons, Randy and Mike, who are in their early 60s and have helped manage it, are keen for other challenges. And the three Donley grandchildren, who grew up playing cowboy games at the 23-acre amusement park, are off living their own lives. It seems quite likely that this quintessential family-owned business will be passed into the hands of an outsider.There is a hitch, however: The elder Donleys don\u2019t want someone to change the property into, say, a concert space, as a potential buyer once suggested. Ideally, they want things to continue in their current Howdy Doody-esque form, right down to the gold-panning pavilion, the live action Wild West show, and kiddie rides on the 19th-century miniature locomotive.Donley\u2019s Wild West Town has been for sale, off and on, for a few years. The current asking price is $7 million, but Larry Donley has turned away people who didn\u2019t seem willing or likely to preserve it as is.\u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone really interested in this place will tear it down,\u201d he said in an interview on a recent Sunday.Developers have salivated over the property, which comes with a restaurant that has a liquor license and would be perfect, in their minds, for other commercial uses, like a concert stadium or an antique car dealership. They look at Donley\u2019s Wild West Town and envision how quickly it could be razed.And while the senior Donleys know they could easily cash in by ceding to such tempting offers, they are resolute.Randy and Mike Donley say the theme park taps into their father\u2019s inner child, and he seems to agree. \u201cIt reminds me of when I was a kid in the 1930s,\u201d Larry Donley said.Such is the difficulty of selling a family heirloom business that no one else in the family really wants to run.Does this frustrate the younger generations? They say no, and insist they are committed to operating the park until they find that elusive buyer. \u201cThe park was never our dream,\u201d Randy, the younger son, said of himself and his brother, who auction antique phonographs, jukeboxes and other 20th-century Americana as their principal occupation. As for their father, however, \u201cHe really believes that that person is out there.\u201dAs with many amusement parks, the bulk of the revenue \u2014 some of it from the $17-a-person admission \u2014 has to come in between May and the end of October. Mike Donley wouldn\u2019t discuss financial details, but he said the park had earned the family enough to sustain three generations over the decades. Mike and Randy Donley both say it is profitable.Jim Futrell, an amusement park historian, said a park the size of Wild West Town may bring in around $10 million annually, but that wouldn\u2019t include the proceeds from a restaurant on the site run by twin brothers who only recently took it over and from other events held there, including auctions by Randy Donley.Places like Wild West Town are relics of a bygone era, trying to attract children who are more attracted to virtual reality and mobile apps than games of cops and robbers or cowboys and Indians.As for the smaller theme parks that no longer exist, in many cases the families that owned them cashed in on their land holdings \u2014 at great profit \u2014 and closed up shop.The concept of the family road trip has also evolved. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing are changing vacation habits,\u201d Mr. Futrell said.Robert Kramer, the marketing director at Santa\u2019s Village in East Dundee, Ill., said that operating a small amusement park comes with some modern challenges. Both Wild West Town and Santa\u2019s Village focus on the 2-year-old-to-tween crowd. These days, those children are reluctant to put down their electronic devices for a day of unplugged, old-fashioned fun, he said.The increasingly far-flung nature of organized sports ties up family free time. And a glut of entertainment options, from bowling and paintball to bigger and more extravagant theme parks, also draws away potential customers.Santa\u2019s Village opened in 1959 but closed in 2006, and its original owner is dead. Under new ownership and management, the park reopened in 2011 and has continued to add attractions, including a $1.5 million roller coaster that opened this year. Constant investment is needed, Mr. Kramer said, because \u201cthere are a ton of other options when it comes to family activities.\u201dParks tied to the Wild West or cowboys have struggled in particular, said Mr. Futrell, the historian, because that theme has lost its appeal with younger audiences. After all, \u201cBonanza\u201d and \u201cGunsmoke\u201d are no longer popular prime-time television fare.Ponderosa Ranch, a theme park that operated on Lake Tahoe, Nev., set of \u201cBonanza,\u201d shut down over a decade ago.Donley\u2019s Wild West Town is still the site of many happy childhood memories \u2014 particularly for the Donley grandchildren.\u201cAs a child growing up, it was like a fairy tale,\u201d said Shawnah Donley, 29, the daughter of Randy Donley. \u201cIt was our backyard, and we were part of what our family did for a living.\u201dShe grew up nearby and recalls school field trips to Wild West Town. After college, Ms. Donley got a job in the live action Wild West show, where her work caught the attention of a talent scout. That led to her professional career as a stunt actor, with credits that include the movie \u201cContagion\u201d and the NBC television series \u201cChicago Fire.\u201d She now lives in Chicago and also works as a real estate broker. But while she says her generation, which includes a younger brother and a cousin, hopes to see the park continue to operate, the fact that her family is looking to sell it isn\u2019t a surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s always something that we thought would happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have our own interests and futures.\u201dThe Donleys have always been collectors of trinkets and oddities. Larry Donley acquired the first seven acres of the property in 1972 so he could build a storehouse for the antique phonographs and other things he had begun collecting decades earlier. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what stuff I had, and I still had too much,\u201d he said. Back then, he owned a gas and service station in Berwyn, Ill., around 50 miles closer to Chicago, where he raised his family. But he would eventually sell that business.Randy and Mike Donley grew up watching their father collect these pieces of Americana and got into the game themselves, snapping up antique guns and military memorabilia and assorted pieces of American history like toys, lamps, telephones, phonographs, music boxes, telegraph equipment and war souvenirs.The first building on the park\u2019s site became a museum and showcase for these items. Despite being right off Route 20 and barely three miles from the Illinois Railway Museum, visitor traffic was slow for the first couple of years.It wasn\u2019t meant to be a theme park at all until Larry Donley built the town\u2019s gold mine and gold-panning attraction to occupy the children of adults who visited the museum, which opened in 1974. \u201cIt all kind of evolved,\u201d Mike Donley recalled.In addition to the museum and gold mine, the site has an operating antique train, a gentle roller coaster (the \u201cRunaway Mine Cart\u201d), a carousel and a water ride. There are also firing and archery ranges, a tomahawk throw and slingshot gallery. Employees dressed as cowboys give roping lessons and gun-spinning exhibitions. The town jail includes authentic 19th-century cells acquired from the jail in the town of Union. Visitors can coax the town marshal to arrest people.During the height of the season, the site employs about 100 people, many of them students at the local high schools. It draws visitors from a 60-mile radius in northern Illinois, attracting school and day care groups, church groups and camp attendees.Sid Schroepfer, who will be a high school senior in the fall, demonstrated his lasso-twirling skills in the park one recent Sunday. This is a new job for him, and he said he liked it because he \u201cgets to play cowboy all day.\u201d\u201cWe are selling an experience for parents and grandparents and children,\u201d Mike Donley said. \u201cEverything is hands-on.\u201dThe park has given birth to some careers in show business. In addition to Shawnah Donley, there is Joey Dillon, a gun spinner who now coaches actors on gun handling for films and television. He credits his two seasons in the cast at Donley\u2019s for starting his career.He grew up in rural California and developed an interest in gun spinning from watching old Westerns, and when he moved to Chicago to pursue a career in comedy, he fell into a job at Donley\u2019s. \u201cI look back on Donley\u2019s as kind of my fun dorm days with a bunch of college-aged kids, hanging out with them at night and playing pranks backstage,\u201d Mr. Dillon said. He is still in touch with some of his former colleagues, some 20 years later. Mr. Dillon wasn\u2019t aware the property was up for sale.Taylor Fryza, who directs and acts in the park\u2019s live shows, remembered visiting the town as a girl. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a little kid, it\u2019s like stepping into a different world,\u201d she said. Eventually she went to acting school in New York and returned home. She said she was not worried about the place being for sale. \u201cYou just put your best foot forward and do as many shows as you can,\u201d she said.And so the operation chugs along, in nostalgia mode for some of its owners. \u201cAs much as we enjoyed it, as much as we loved it, it was hard work seven days a week,\u201d Mike Donley said, adding that the grandchildren \u201cdidn\u2019t see that as a future for them.\u201dLarry and Helene Donley live in a house right next to the amusement park and work on the site every day. The family jokes they are likely to ask the next owners for a job. The brothers say they aren\u2019t forcing a sale.\u201cIf they want to find another proprietor during their lifetimes, I\u2019d rather let them do that,\u201d Mike Donley said of his parents. \u201cIt\u2019s another challenge for them.\u201dAn article last Sunday about an effort to sell a family business, Wild West Town theme park, misidentified the state where a shuttered theme park, Ponderosa Ranch, is located. It is on Lake Tahoe in Nevada, not California.Advertisement"}

Certainly, there are things worth waiting for \u2014 a slice at Di Fara? a Lisa Vanderpump book signing? \u2014 but they are few and far between and, in truth, rarely as rewarding as you hope.Worse, the mind roams. Every second you allow your body to be geo-limited by a random desire, your mind is dominated by thoughts of all the productive things you are failing to do. A line is a collective sign of failure. I won\u2019t wait more than a few minutes for a seat at a restaurant. I\u2019ve given up going to clubs or concerts where I\u2019m not on some sort of list. Naturally, I have never waited in a Supreme line.Sometimes, on the days when Supreme releases new product \u2014 a drop, in scene parlance \u2014 I\u2019ll pass by the gaggle of gawky teenagers held behind barriers on Lafayette Street and wonder about all of the potential energy vaporizing into thin air.

Seems unlikely, but if true, that\u2019s a lot of lines.Shopping Palace in its opening weeks caused existential questioning: How long would the lines be? Was waiting in line for a professional reason as meaningless as waiting in line for boring old consumer desire? Right after the store opened, an online reviewer huffily noted, \u201cBeing told you cannot talk, or smile or indeed move when standing on line is an infringement of civil liberties.\u201dGeorge Plimpton would have stood in the line, and so I stood in the line. There were maybe 30 of us, less the one kicked off by security for smoking. This informal police force was thick \u2014 four heavyset bruisers, all dressed in black \u2014 and mostly polite in carrying out orders, which apparently included telling one waifish young man that he couldn\u2019t wear a baseball cap.I read some political news on my phone. I texted my mom. I silently hoped no one I knew would happen to walk by and assume I had nothing more worthwhile to do. The weather was cool, mercifully. A half-hour later, I dodged some kids walking out with their purchases in Mylar bags as I was finally allowed in.The store itself had ample breathing room: high ceilings, sleek materials, clothing racks that oozed dignified European glitz. Near the rear of the long room was a largish pool in the shape of the Palace logo; a constant stream of water poured from the genitals of a golden cherub statue planted atop it.T-shirts, hoodies, tracksuits, caps \u2014 you know the routine. Palace manages a cheer and a sense of wonder that Supreme, in its desire to be conspiratorial, often lacks. It feels loyal to the athletic gear it takes inspiration from, yet it rarely feels sporty. The store carried some limited-edition items, but they went early to the most dedicated line-standers and, I imagine, to those too well connected to stand in any line. (Some of those jackets are on eBay for more than $2,500. There\u2019s your future millionaire reseller right there.)In fairness, of the three times I visited Palace in the past month, this was the only time there was a line, perhaps a function of the fact that the most recent Palace drop is, by the brand\u2019s standards, less than stellar. Typically, there is more wit.For what it\u2019s worth, newspapers were practically invented for standing in line.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Towns Already Hit by Steel Mill Closings, a New Casualty: Retail Jobs", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Thousands of workers face unemployment as retailers struggle to adapt to online shopping. But even as e-commerce grows, it isn\u2019t absorbing these workers.Supported byJOHNSTOWN, Pa. \u2014 Dawn Nasewicz comes from a family of steelworkers, with jobs that once dominated the local economy. She found her niche in retail.She manages a store, Ooh La La, that sells prom dresses and embroidered jeans at a local mall. But just as the jobs making automobile springs and rail anchors disappeared, local retail jobs are now vanishing.\u201cI need my income,\u201d said Ms. Nasewicz, who was told that her store will close as early as August. \u201cI\u2019m 53. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dMs. Nasewicz is another retail casualty, one of tens of thousands of workers facing unemployment nationwide as the industry struggles to adapt to online shopping.Small cities in the Midwest and Northeast are particularly vulnerable. When major industries left town, retail accounted for a growing share of the job market in places like Johnstown, Decatur, Ill., and Saginaw, Mich. Now, the work force is getting hit a second time, and there is little to fall back on.Moreover, while stores in these places are shedding jobs because of e-commerce, e-commerce isn\u2019t absorbing these workers. Growth in e-commerce jobs like marketing and engineering, while strong, is clustered around larger cities far away. Rural counties and small metropolitan areas account for about 23 percent of traditional American retail employment, but they are home to just 13 percent of e-commerce positions.E-commerce has also fostered a boom in other industries, including warehouses. But most of those jobs are being created in larger metropolitan areas, an analysis of Census Bureau business data shows.Almost all customer fulfillment centers run by the online shopping behemoth Amazon are in metropolitan areas with more than 250,000 people \u2014 close to the bulk of its customers \u2014 according to a list of locations compiled by MWPVL International, a logistics consulting firm. An Amazon spokeswoman noted, however, that the company had recently opened warehouses in two distressed cities in larger metropolitan areas, Fall River, Mass., and Joliet, Ill.The Johnstown metropolitan area, in western Pennsylvania, has lost 19 percent of its retail jobs since 2001, and the future is uncertain. At least a dozen of Ooh La La\u2019s neighbors at the mall have closed, and a \u201cGoing out of business\u201d banner hangs across the front of the sporting goods store Gander Mountain.\u201cEvery time you lose a corner store, every time you lose a restaurant, every time you lose a small clothing store, it detracts from the quality of life, as well as the job loss,\u201d said John McGrath, a professor of management at the University of Pittsburgh Johnstown.This city is perhaps still best known for a flood that ravaged it nearly 130 years ago. After rebuilding, Johnstown eventually became prosperous from its steel and offered a clear path to the middle class. For generations, people could walk out of high school and into a steady factory job.But today, the area bears the marks of a struggling town. Its population has dwindled, and addiction treatment centers and Dollar Generals stand in place of corner grocers and department stores like Glosser Brothers, once owned by the family of Stephen Miller, President Trump\u2019s speechwriter and a policy adviser.When Mr. Trump spoke about \u201crusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation\u201d in his Inaugural Address, people like Donald Bonk, a local economic development consultant, assumed that Mr. Miller \u2014 who grew up in California but spent summers in Johnstown \u2014 was writing about the old Bethlehem Steel buildings that still hug long stretches of the Little Conemaugh River.The county voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump, eight years after it helped to elect Barack Obama. (It also voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, but not by as wide a margin.)Here and in similar towns, when the factory jobs left, a greater share of the work force ended up in retail.Sometimes that meant big-box retailers like Walmart, which were often blamed for destroying mom-and-pop stores but at least created other jobs for residents. The damage from e-commerce plays out differently. Digital firms may attract customers from small towns, but they are unlikely to employ them.Some remaining retailers are straining for solutions.Randy Clark remembers when his Miller\u2019s Clothing Store, a family-run men\u2019s wear shop, employed twice as many people and sold 20 pairs of pants a day. He knows he needs a website, but attracting digital customers is the least of his concerns. Brands that he sells, like Tommy Bahama and Southern Tide, will not even let him sell their products online, where he would compete with their own e-commerce operations, he said.So instead, Mr. Clark has focused on the store itself. He renovated the first floor to attract customers from farther away, customers who might have more money to spend and more places to go than Johnstown. He bought new furniture and new floors, installed a coffee machine, and donated old sports coats and corduroy jackets to make room for fresh inventory. He wears a suit and tie to work six days a week, and says he does not own a pair of jeans.\u201cNot a lot of people dress up anymore,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t dress the part, who will?\u201dTom Apryle IV takes the opposite approach at his jewelry store.Metalworkers, office clerks and executives \u2014 thousands of workers used to stream in and out of the factories here every day. When they got engaged or celebrated anniversaries or just wanted a nice diamond bracelet, they often went to Apryle\u2019s, a jewelry store that Mr. Apryle\u2019s great-grandfather opened in 1902.But fewer people can afford his products now that the good jobs are long gone, and Mr. Apryle has had to make adjustments.A cash-for-gold sign hangs in the window. He started selling knickknacks on eBay. Eventually, he stopped wearing a tie.\u201cI might as well be comfortable,\u201d Mr. Apryle, 46, said, gesturing to his wrinkled T-shirt and tennis shoes. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here to impress.\u201dThe story of America\u2019s Johnstowns is not just the story of retail, or e-commerce, or how men don\u2019t buy suits and ties at Miller\u2019s the way they used to. It\u2019s also about men like Mr. Apryle, who wouldn\u2019t even have a place to wear them.\u201cI was the last generation to see it booming and prosperous, and people were employed,\u201d said Mr. Bonk, 53, the economic development consultant, who grew up in Johnstown. \u201cIt disappeared in my lifetime.\u201dJust as Johnstown scrambled to adapt to the decline in manufacturing that began a generation ago, local leaders are now looking at how to navigate a future with a much diminished retail economy.To help revitalize the area, the county hired Mr. Bonk, whose parents ran a corner grocery store here for more than 40 years and made enough money to send him and his brother to college.Mr. Bonk has returned, determined to make downtown thrive again. But he does not have dreams of bringing back the department stores of his youth. He knows that consumers these days want to spend their money more on experiences than things, and that neighborhood stores are competing against digital upstarts that do not need as many workers and often have far more resources.As he walks briskly down Main Street, Mr. Bonk points out the new businesses that stand shoulder-to-shoulder with empty storefronts. There is The Vault, a day spa in an old bank building, and the Press Bistro, which, he excitedly points out, has an area for live music.These places are evidence, he says, that other people are committed to restoring Johnstown.\u201cThey want to see it be a healthy, thriving community, like where they grew up,\u201d he said.Mr. Bonk is inspired by Pittsburgh, another former steel town that revived its economy by attracting new businesses, including an Amazon distribution center and the fleet of trucks that came with it. But he knows that the Pittsburgh metro area, with a population of 2.4 million, is 17 times as large as Johnstown.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about what\u2019s next,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re essentially thinking of Johnstown as an economic development laboratory.\u201dMr. Bonk isn\u2019t counting on Amazon coming here.A picture caption on Monday with an article about the loss of retail jobs misspelled, in some copies, the surname of a jewelry store owner and the name of the business in Johnstown, Pa., that carries his name. He is Tom Apryle IV of Apryle\u2019s jewelry store (not Arpyle).Rachel Abrams reported from Johnstown, Pa., and Robert Gebeloff from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Silicon Valley Pushed Coding Into American Classrooms", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byEducation DisruptedThe Apple chief\u2019s education mandate was just the latest tech company push for coding courses in schools. But even without Mr. Trump\u2019s support, Silicon Valley is already advancing that agenda \u2014 thanks largely to the marketing prowess of Code.org, an industry-backed nonprofit group.In our tech-driven world, Hadi Partovi argues, computer science has become as essential for students as reading, writing and math. \u201cEncryption is at least as foundational as photosynthesis,\u201d he said.Computer science is also essential to American tech companies, which have become heavily reliant on foreign engineers. Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to limit immigration make Code.org\u2019s teach-Americans-to-code agenda even more attractive to the industry.Along the way, Code.org has emerged as a new prototype for Silicon Valley education reform: a social-media-savvy entity that pushes for education policy changes, develops curriculums, offers online coding lessons and trains teachers \u2014 touching nearly every facet of the education supply chain.Mr. Partovi, 44, said he simply wanted to give students the opportunity to develop the same skills that helped him and his backers succeed. He immigrated as a child to the United States from Iran with his family, went on to study computer science at Harvard, and later sold a voice-recognition start-up he had co-founded to Microsoft for a reported $800 million.\u201cThat dream is much less accessible if you are in one of America\u2019s schools where they don\u2019t even tell you you could go into that field,\u201d Mr. Partovi said.Even so, he acknowledged some industry self-interest. \u201cIf you are running a tech company,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s extremely hard to hire and retain engineers.\u201dCode.org is now one of the largest providers of free online coding lessons and more comprehensive computer science curriculums. It has also provided training workshops to more than 57,000 teachers, Mr. Partovi said.The rise of Code.org coincides with a larger tech-industry push to remake American primary and secondary schools with computers and learning apps, a market estimated to reach $21 billion by 2020.Then Mr. Partovi came along with the idea of using a viral video to spark mass demand for the courses.He began by persuading Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, and Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, to appear in a short film promoting coding to students. In its first week on YouTube, the video, called \u201cWhat Most Schools Don\u2019t Teach,\u201d racked up roughly nine million views. Within two weeks, Mr. Partovi said, about 20,000 teachers contacted him.Mr. Partovi compared Code.org\u2019s approach to those of start-ups like Airbnb and Uber. \u201cAirbnb is disrupting the travel space, but they don\u2019t own the hotels,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe are in a similar model, disrupting education. But we are not running the school and we don\u2019t hire the teachers.\u201dMr. Partovi\u2019s elite connections didn\u2019t hurt.Mr. Partovi, for his part, was hoping to go viral with a message that coding could improve students\u2019 job prospects. Teaching skills that may lead to higher-paying jobs \u201cseems like the kind of idea that everyone in the country can get behind,\u201d he said.Mr. Partovi promptly invited Mr. Smith over to preview his celebrity coders video.\u201cWe think computer science is to the 21st century what physics was to the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Smith said.But the movement has also supported legislation that could give companies enormous sway in public schools, starting with kindergarten, with little public awareness.\u201cIt gets very problematic when industry is deciding the content and direction of public education,\u201d said Jane Margolis, a senior researcher at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.The Idaho bill read, in part, \u201cIt is essential that efforts to increase computer science instruction, kindergarten through career, be driven by the needs of industry and be developed in partnership with industry.\u201dWhen a reporter apprised him of the bill\u2019s language, Mr. Smith of Microsoft seemed taken aback, saying he had not endorsed it. \u201cBroad public education should not be grounded first and foremost in the needs of any particular industry \u2014 or in the needs of industry as a whole,\u201d he said.Mr. Partovi noted that Code.org had opposed a \u201cmore extreme\u201d coding bill in Florida that would have required students to obtain industry certification. It has also opposed bills that would allow coding courses to count toward foreign-language credits in high schools, he said. Still, Mr. Partovi added, \u201cWe do think that tech companies have a role to play.\u201dThe clout behind computer science has all but obviated a wider debate about whether, to better prepare students, schools might introduce an array of new subjects. It has also overshadowed discussion about whether students would be better off if schools modified traditional math classes to increase the emphasis on fields like statistics.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said that tech companies and philanthropists were simply trying to give voice to an overlooked subject. \u201cWhat we really need is a national conversation about the broad array of intellectual disciplines that will be fundamental to the future of American students,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s a broad array, not a single subject.\u201dMr. Partovi concurred. \u201cWe have a lot of debate in this country about how to teach,\u201d he said, \u201cand not enough debate about what to teach.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tailoring in a Basement? It Suits Him", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNeighborhood JointThirty-six years ago, when Bilal Egilmez opened his shop, Genius Tailor, in the Lenox Hill area of Manhattan, colleagues wished him well but warned that no one would come to a basement business accessible only through a seven-step metallic stairwell under the stoop.\u201cHenry Ford worked in a basement,\u201d he said recently, recalling his response to naysayers. \u201cAnd so did da Vinci in the 1400s. Why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201dTo ensure that customers could find his store, stashed on a residential and commercial tree-lined block at 65th Street and First Avenue, Mr. Egilmez designed two large green and white canvas banners. One hangs vertically on poles along the building\u2019s facade, while another is displayed over the entrance.Mr. Egilmez, 75, was one of eight children born near Yozgat, Turkey, to a farming family. He chose tailoring as a teenager because he loved fashion and design. His father, who nicknamed him Falcon Baby for his sense of purpose, predicted that Mr. Egilmez would travel the world and sent him to Istanbul, where, at 15, he found his first apprenticeship. \u201cI slept in the shop for two years,\u201d Mr. Egilmez said.At 25, he opened his own store in Beyoglu, a district in Istanbul. Several years later, he made his way to the United States, where he settled.One recent afternoon, surrounded by photos pinned to peeling walls, of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, John F. Kennedy, James Dean and Marilyn Monroe, Mr. Egilmez worked at his 1923 Singer sewing machine. Suits, gowns and coats hung in the back of the single room, where a Mies van der Rohe Barcelona chair, bought secondhand decades ago, held neatly folded clothes. A large mirror reflected a light circle worn into the dark stone floor, from years of clients\u2019 shuffling as they stared at their images.\u201cCome in!\u201d Mr. Egilmez shouted as soon as a bell rang. A father and his young children entered, along with a few women.\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d Max Neylon, 4, asked as he pointed to a contraption: an iron hooked to a water bottle hanging from an upside down hanger attached to a pipe. \u201cIt\u2019s a flat iron, Max,\u201d said his father, Kevin Neylon, a 34-year-old doctor from Ireland. The steam iron, just like Mr. Egilmez\u2019s extensive collection of scissors, had been bought in the garment district 36 years earlier.Keylah Mellon, a photographer from Haiti, brought in a jacket from the Vietnam War that she bought on eBay. \u201cIt was too long,\u201d Ms. Mellon, 26, said, \u201cso he cut a piece at the waist to keep the low pockets.\u201dOf the leftover piece, she said: \u201cI\u2019ll use it in my hair.\u201dIt was Ms. Mellon\u2019s first visit, and she said the basement location \u201cadds character.\u201dRebecca Margolies, 26, was picking up a complicated job and seemed relieved with the results.\u201cI got the bridesmaid dress for my best friend\u2019s wedding,\u201d she said, \u201cand it was seven times too big.\u201d Mr. Egilmez told Ms. Margolies not to worry. \u201cHe was very emotionally supportive,\u201d she said.Mr. Egilmez prefers the simplicity of cash exchanges or a handwritten check. \u201cI don\u2019t use credit cards,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd mortgages grab your neck.\u201d (He rents his space.)Every day except Sunday (when he often goes to the beach), Mr. Egilmez rides his 1945 bicycle from his home in Sunnyside, Queens, to his shop. He locks the bicycle outside to a nearby pole while he works. \u201cCome to the Genius Tailor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, clever and stylish here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Date My Dad\u2019 Is Warm, Fuzzy and Has Raquel Welch, Too", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYes, it appears that the 1990s and the 1960s were both awhile ago. In any case, Rick (who as the series opens is trying to get people to stop calling him \u201cRicky\u201d) is a widower, and the show revolves around the efforts of his daughters, ages 15, 12 and 8, to get him to start dating again. That of course is one of the oldest story lines there is; children have been playing matchmaker for their single parents forever, on TV and in the movies. These same children seem blissfully unaware of another ancient story line, that of the monstrous stepmother, but never mind.Ms. Welch was never a great actor and isn\u2019t here, either, but the actresses playing the three daughters \u2014 Zenia Marshall, Lilah Fitzgerald and Audrey Smallman \u2014 are all quite enjoyable, which helps the show along considerably. And if you\u2019re wondering what makes an UP TV show different from most other channels\u2019 domestic comedies, look no further than a small scene in the premiere involving the three girls.The oldest, Mirabel (Ms. Marshall), makes fun of the middle one, Elisa (Ms. Fitzgerald), for not having a boyfriend. Elisa looks hurt. In other such shows, that might be the end of the scene; they\u2019d quickly move on to the next joke. But here, Mirabel sees the effect her words have had and does something rare in this era of wisecracking, me-centered kiddie characters: She apologizes.Unlike in the real world, on UP TV, empathy, decorum and self-correction are alive and well.Advertisement"}
