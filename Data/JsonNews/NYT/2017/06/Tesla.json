{"Headline": "Solar Trade Case, With Trump as Arbiter, Could Upend Market", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byMillions of Americans now get their electricity, at least in part, from the solar panels that have rapidly spread throughout the country since 2010, thanks to their sharply declining cost. For customers \u2014 including homeowners, businesses and utilities \u2014 as well as for the companies that promote and install them, cheap solar panels have been a good thing.But for American manufacturers, those cheap panels \u2014 specifically, a glut of low-cost supplies from overseas \u2014 have not been a good thing, driving more than a dozen of them to the brink of bankruptcy and beyond.Now, manufacturers are fighting back, in an unusual trade case that could put the final decision about government intervention, and any remedy, directly in President Trump\u2019s hands.The case, filed with the United States International Trade Commission, is shaping up to be one of the first major trade decisions of the Trump administration. The outcome could have a powerful impact on whether the American solar industry will be able to compete on cost with conventional fuels like natural gas and coal in producing electricity.And China, Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent foil on trade issues, has interests on both sides of the fight.The cheaper equipment coming into the American market is often from Chinese manufacturers that the trade commission previously determined were dumping goods below cost, according to the petition. But the company that initiated the new case, Suniva, is an equipment maker based in Georgia whose majority owner is a Chinese company.The petition seeks steep tariffs and minimum price guarantees on certain solar energy equipment made outside the United States. The commission is set to vote on the merits of the case by Sept. 22, and send any recommendations to the president by Nov. 13. But it is already reshaping the market.Prices for solar panels have increased as buyers rush to get ahead of potential tariffs. Solar-farm developers have become skittish about long-term commitments to supply power at prices that could become uneconomical if tariffs, which can be applied retroactively, raise their costs.\u201cIt clearly throws a wrench into what is already a challenged global market,\u201d said Shawn Kravetz, president of Esplanade Capital, a hedge fund based in Boston that is focused on solar energy companies. \u201cThere are going to be winners and losers. The list of losers is long.\u201dBack then, SolarWorld Americas, a subsidiary of a now-bankrupt German panel maker, filed a trade complaint along with six other domestic solar manufacturers that accused their Chinese counterparts of using unfair government subsidies to finance their operations and then selling their merchandise for less than the cost of manufacturing and shipping it.SolarWorld, which has joined Suniva\u2019s petition, won that battle, as well as a second case that included Taiwan, where Chinese manufacturers had turned for cells to avoid anticipated tariffs.After the imposition of tariffs beginning in 2012 that ranged from about 20 percent to about 55 percent for the largest cell and panel makers, manufacturers outside China and Taiwan \u2014 including those in the United States like SolarWorld and Suniva \u2014 saw their fortunes rise. In 2014, SolarWorld Americas, based in Oregon, announced a $10 million expansion of its plant and plans to hire hundreds more workers to meet surging demand for solar panels.Suniva had grown out of government-supported research at Georgia Tech to become one of the largest American makers of solar cells and finished modules. But the much larger Chinese manufacturers that came to dominate the global market kept up the pressure on price. Seeking a much-needed infusion of cash to finance an anticipated expansion, Suniva sold a majority stake in 2015 to a Chinese company, Shunfeng International Clean Energy, which wanted to get a foothold in what it believed was a growing American market.Then came a glut of cheap, new panels as Chinese manufacturers began operating or contracting with factories in countries like Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, the petition charges. Last year, the Chinese government suggested it might slash its domestic incentives for buyers of solar panels, sharply reducing demand for equipment and adding to the oversupply. Manufacturers cut their prices to compensate, which sent global prices plummeting. Even though China ended up shaving subsidies just slightly and only for large power-plant arrays, prices remained low.As panel prices dropped to about 40 cents per watt in late 2016 from 57 cents per watt in 2015, American solar installations reached a record high, making solar energy the biggest source of new electricity generation last year. But the domestic industry\u2019s share of the panel market, which had been declining since 2013, tumbled to 11 percent in 2016 from 17.1 percent the previous year, according to the market research firm IBISWorld.In those conditions, Suniva could not compete as a supplier. Starting in March it shuttered its two factories in Michigan and Georgia, laying off about 250 workers, and in April it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. About a week later, it secured a loan from one of its creditors to pursue the trade case.With control of Suniva in the hands of the bankruptcy court, Shunfeng declared in May that it no longer supported the company\u2019s trade case, saying it was \u201cnot in the best interests of the global solar industry.\u201d It said in March that it would take a charge of roughly $38 million on its Suniva investment, though it could still benefit if the company prevails in the case.Suniva argues that because of the global nature of the solar trade, the American manufacturing industry needs blanket safeguards from the trade commission that would apply to the crystalline silicon cells and modules manufactured anywhere outside the United States. It is the only way, the complaint argues, to keep manufacturers from circumventing tariffs aimed at specific countries by setting up shop elsewhere.\u201cWithout global relief, the domestic industry will be playing Whac-a-Mole,\u201d the petition says. \u201cThe way that the world\u2019s largest producers have reacted to antidumping and countervailing duty claims demonstrates that global relief is required.\u201dBut opponents say the case threatens many of the hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs could be eliminated in an industry slowdown. Those include people who install, finance and oversee the development of large-scale solar projects, as well as manufacturers of support structures for the panels and devices that regulate the flow of electricity from them.According to a report from GTM Research, a consultant firm that tracks the solar industry and provides data and analysis for the industry\u2019s main trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, which is aggressively fighting the petition, a finding in Suniva\u2019s favor could reduce expected installations over the next five years by 50 percent.Adding to anxiety in the industry is the potential role of Mr. Trump, who would have broad leeway to determine how to proceed should the commission find that the domestic industry had been harmed by the surge in imports.Though the president has pledged to increase manufacturing jobs, he has not offered the same full-throated support as his predecessor for solar energy. Proponents see solar energy as an important weapon in the fight against climate change, making its ability to compete economically with conventional sources \u2014 a concept known as grid parity \u2014 even more critical.\u201cGrid parity is of the utmost importance, so that we are competing on price and price alone,\u201d Abigail Ross Hopper, chief executive of the solar trade group, said. \u201cIf you change the underpinnings of that, it undermines what we\u2019re doing.\u201dIf things go Suniva\u2019s way, analysts say, other domestic manufacturers could also benefit, although the industry would most likely contract over the next few years.Two makers of crystalline silicon cells and panels, SunPower and Solaria, are expanding their production capacity at factories in California. Then there is First Solar, based in Tempe, Ariz., which is also expanding production at its factory in Perrysburg, Ohio. The company mainly manufactures in Malaysia, but it uses a different technology and would not be subject to the trade restrictions. And if Tesla is able to get its troubled and much-delayed panel factory in Buffalo up and running, it could benefit as well.Then, too, the major Chinese manufacturers are already exploring options for opening their own factories in the United States, said Ocean Yuan, chief executive of Grape Solar, a distributor of panels based in Eugene, Ore.\u201cThere\u2019s no other way for them to enter the U.S. except that they make panels in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I guess that\u2019s the positive side.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Businesses Cheer \u2018New Sheriff in Town\u2019 After Climate Pact Exit", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byAs news that President Trump was pulling out of the Paris climate accord hit at a luncheon for small-business owners in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday, an already happy crowd suddenly turned euphoric.\u201cIt was like a major win at a football game,\u201d said Rick Longenecker, a management consultant who had been among the 50 or so attendees who gathered to trade thoughts amid a rapidly improving local economy.While multinational corporations such as Disney, Goldman Sachs and IBM have opposed the president\u2019s decision to walk away from the international climate agreement, many small companies around the country were cheering him on, embracing the choice as a tough-minded business move that made good on Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to put America\u2019s commercial interests first.This full-throated support from the small-business community comes even as the Trump administration struggles to advance health care legislation and tax reform plans through Congress \u2014 and despite the swelling controversy over Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.In Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and beyond, many small businesses are reporting improved sales and bigger work forces \u2014 regardless of what is going on in Washington.\u201cThere is a new sheriff in town,\u201d said Louis M. Soltis, the owner of a company in Toledo that manufactures control panels for large factories. \u201cBut the biggest frustration that I have is that there is so much resistance that is keeping him from moving forward.\u201dIn the months following Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory, as stock markets hit historical highs and companies kept adding jobs, the business community as a whole seemed willing to give the president a chance to follow through on his bold promises to revitalize the economy by cutting taxes and rolling back regulations.Many small-business leaders in the Midwest, on the other hand, were largely unfazed.For those more concerned with their local economies than global greenhouse gas emissions, walking away from the Paris agreement was just another example of a bottom-line business decision made by a president who knows a good deal from a bad one.\u201cThis just heightens the divide between big business and small business,\u201d said Jeffrey Korzenik, an investment strategist for Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati who spends much of his time talking to small businesses in the Midwest. \u201cThey really have different worldviews.\u201dAt the root of this disconnect is a sense that companies that employ up to a few hundred workers \u2014 such companies make up 99 percent of businesses in the United States and account for half of its private sector employment \u2014 are held to a more onerous standard than their larger peers when it comes to complying with regulations.At the Toledo luncheon, for example, much of the discussion centered on the fact that the climate treaty is nonbinding. To businessmen who have spent the past 10 years complaining of ceaseless rules and regulations, the very idea that the climate pact lacked teeth was galling.\u201cWhen companies here do business with a Ford or a G.M., they sign a contract that is not only binding \u2014 in many cases it is pretty harsh,\u201d Mr. Longenecker said. \u201cNow we have this deal to prevent a global catastrophe, and it\u2019s nonbinding? That is ridiculous. And it makes us think that there is a hidden agenda, that we are just transferring trillions of dollars to China.\u201dTo some small business executives, seeing the president talk tough to the Europeans and the Chinese was a reminder of why they voted for him in the first place.\u201cI think that we\u2019re making a very big deal over a molehill,\u201d said Dave Griggs, owner of Dave Griggs Flooring America in Columbia, Mo. which employs 16 people. \u201cI think the president is exactly right, we need to certainly renegotiate.\u201dBut local business leaders are not without their worries.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a Republican Congress, a Republican president; hopefully we can get some initiatives passed,\u201d Mr. Griggs said. \u201cI am highly optimistic.\u201dBut by and large, local business leaders said they remained supportive of the president and believed the attention on his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia was overblown.John Bagge, 64, who runs a catering company in Kirkland, Wash., with his wife and two daughters, said his business was booming \u2014 so much so that this was the first summer he has had to turn away customers in 40 years.The chief executives of big American companies were less sanguine, and many distanced themselves from Mr. Trump.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, both resigned from the president\u2019s economic advisory council on Thursday.\u201cClimate change is real,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter. \u201cLeaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\u201dOther big company executives \u2014 including the chief executives Douglas McMillon of Walmart and Virginia M. Rometty of IBM \u2014 voiced their opposition to the president\u2019s decision but said they would remain on the council.\u201cDisappointed in today\u2019s news about the Paris Agreement,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cWe think it\u2019s important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201dDespite remaining broadly supportive of the president, some businessmen said that the whirlwind of controversies was beginning to raise questions about just how effective this administration could be.Jim Stouffer, Jr. the president of Catawba Island Club, a local resort in Port Clinton, Ohio, said he supported the decision to leave the Paris agreement, but added that he was growing more uncertain of what the future holds.\u201cI don\u2019t know what his endgame is,\u201d he said.Rachel Abrams contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robot Cars Can\u2019t Count on Us in an Emergency", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Three years ago, Google\u2019s self-driving car project abruptly shifted from designing a vehicle that would drive autonomously most of the time while occasionally requiring human oversight, to a slow-speed robot without a brake pedal, accelerator or steering wheel. In other words, human driving was no longer permitted.The company made the decision after giving self-driving cars to Google employees for their work commutes and recording what the passengers did while the autonomous system did the driving. In-car cameras recorded employees climbing into the back seat, climbing out of an open car window, and even smooching while the car was in motion, according to two former Google engineers.Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Google\u2019s self-driving car effort, now called Waymo, disputed the accounts that went beyond what Mr. Urmson described, but said behavior like an employee\u2019s rummaging in the back seat for his laptop while the car was moving and other \u201cegregious\u201d acts contributed to shutting down the experiment.We humans are easily distracted by our games, phones and mates. And automotive engineers, computer interaction designers and, yes, lawyers, wonder if the self-driving cars they are working on will ever really be able to count on us in an emergency.Engineers say they believe that cars will be intelligent enough to do all the driving, somewhere between five years and a decade from now, depending on whom you ask. But until then, what passes for autonomous driving will be a delicate ballet between human and machine: Humans may be required to take the wheel at a moment\u2019s notice when the computer can\u2019t decide what to do.But many automotive technologists are skeptical that the so-called handoff from machine to human can be counted on, because of the challenge of quickly bringing a distracted human back into control of a rapidly moving vehicle.Nauto\u2019s data shows that a \u201cdriver distraction event\u201d occurs, on average, every four miles. Mr. Heck said there was evidence that the inattention of human drivers was a factor in half of the approximately 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.\u201cThere is a motor-learning process if I haven\u2019t been controlling the vehicle and I have to take control,\u201d said J. Christian Gerdes, a Stanford University mechanical engineering professor who was one of the authors of the study.The handoff challenge is compounded by what is known as \u201cover-trust\u201d by automotive engineers.Solving the over-trust issue is a key to autonomous vehicles in the Level 3 category, where the computer hands off to humans.The first commercial vehicle to offer Level 3 autonomy is expected to be released next month by Audi. A version of its luxury A8 model will be able to drive in stop-and-go freeway traffic up to 37 miles an hour while allowing drivers to pursue other tasks. The vehicle reportedly will notify drivers in emergencies, giving them eight to 10 seconds to intervene.Despite these limited advances, many automotive technologists remain uncertain about whether technology will ever be able to operate smoothly with a human driver who may be reading email or playing World of Warcraft.\u201cI believe that Level 3 autonomous driving is unsolvable,\u201d said John Leonard, a mechanical engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has collected detailed examples of driving situations that are currently impossible for state-of-the-art autonomous driving systems. \u201cThe notion that a human can be a reliable backup is a fallacy.\u201dYet, despite widespread skepticism, the automotive industry is spending heavily on artificial intelligence technologies designed to make cars safer before they are fully autonomous. The idea is that self-driving technology (warning lights, emergency braking) can help humans be safer drivers.Instead, he said, he saw the ratings as different ways of addressing the same car-safety question, regardless of who or what is in control.Unlike many in the industry who say that advances in machine learning will soon make self-driving cars safer than those driven by humans, Mr. Pratt has pushed for less futuristic \u201cguardian\u201d technologies that could be added to a car the same way that anti-lock brakes, stability control, blind-spot warning lights and other features have become common.One possible new feature being designed by the Toyota Research Institute is adding the ability not just to stop when a pedestrian is detected, but also to swerve to avoid an accident, he said.Toyota is also working on technologies that will assist human drivers in remaining vigilant when they are required to oversee an autonomous driving system for long stretches of time. There is already a rich literature that explores the challenges of keeping airplane pilots vigilant; Toyota researchers say they will be able to develop techniques to maintain human driver attention.Mr. Pratt said Toyota had not given up on the challenge of Level 3 driving. But to make a safe Level 3 car, he said, it may be necessary to develop technologies that see risks as much as 15 seconds in the future.Still, over-trust will be a tough challenge to overcome. \u201cImagine if the autopilot disengages once in 10,000 miles,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will be very tempted to over-trust the system. Then when it does mess up, you will be unprepared.\u201dAnd if all those issues do get resolved, there is one more question: Will people really use self-driving cars?The researchers found that 23 percent of Americans would refuse to drive in autonomous cars and 36 percent would be so nervous that they would not take their eyes off the road. An additional 3 percent said they would be too motion-sick to take advantage of the cars.\u201cAlso of importance is the fact that current trips in light-duty vehicles average only about 19 minutes, a rather short duration for sustained productive activity or invigorating sleep,\u201d the researchers concluded.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of the level of automotive human-to-machine control that is consider complete autonomy. It is Level 6, not 5.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. and Tesla Shareholders Rebuff Dissidents\u2019 Proposals", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 General Motors and Tesla are automakers of different vintages but increasingly mutual aspirations. They found another bit of common ground on Tuesday as both beat back proposals from dissident investors to shake up their ways of doing business.For General Motors, it was a bid to replace three company directors and split the automaker\u2019s stock into two classes. For Tesla, the electric-car upstart, it was an initiative to impose one-year terms on board members to create more independence from the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Elon Musk.The proposals at G.M., by the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, which owns a 3.6 percent stake in the company, were aimed at bolstering the sagging value of the automaker\u2019s stock.G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, and its board opposed the moves, which would have included creating two classes of stock \u2014 one paying a dividend and a second tracking earnings growth.\u201cWe determined the Greenlight proposal was not in the best interests of our shareholders,\u201d Ms. Barra, who leads G.M.\u2019s board, said at the company\u2019s annual meeting in Detroit.Greenlight\u2019s president, David Einhorn, did not attend the meeting. Mr. Einhorn, who had criticized what he termed \u201cuninspired\u201d leadership at G.M., sought to replace three of the 11 board members with a Greenlight-nominated slate.But his proposals lost by substantial margins, even though G.M.\u2019s stock price has barely increased in value since its post-bankruptcy stock offering in 2010.Instead, shareholders showed broad support for the strategic direction of the company under Ms. Barra, who became its chief executive three years ago.At Tesla\u2019s annual meeting in Mountain View, Calif., shareholders considered a proposal from a group of Connecticut pension funds for directors to face re-election annually, rather than serve staggered three-year terms.Although the proposal failed \u2014 Tesla said it would announce the tally in a filing in the coming days \u2014 Mr. Musk said the company was interviewing potential independent directors and would add two or three to the seven-person board, with an announcement probable in the next couple of months.G.M. remains the nation\u2019s largest automaker by sales and has earned more than $40 billion in profit since it emerged from its government-sponsored bankruptcy in 2009. But in recent months Tesla has vaulted past both G.M. and Ford Motor in market capitalization as Wall Street has been captivated by its electric-vehicle ambitions and battery technology.Ms. Barra acknowledged the frustration of G.M.\u2019s investors, but she said the company would continue to take \u201cdecisive actions\u201d to unlock value for shareholders.\u201cWe have to keep earning our way,\u201d she said.Although G.M.\u2019s stock has lagged behind the overall market, Greenlight\u2019s proxy battle never gained traction with investors or Wall Street analysts.Part of the reason was G.M.\u2019s stiff resistance to the proposals and its early support from credit-rating agencies that considered the two-stock plan a risk to the automaker\u2019s balance sheet.\u201cI think the vote against Greenlight reflects the support that shareholders and the G.M. board have for Mary Barra,\u201d said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book.Shareholders may be frustrated over G.M.\u2019s share price, but Ms. Lindland said most appeared to accept that the company\u2019s transformation was a work in progress. And G.M. and Ford are still burdened by their history of financial problems during economic downturns.\u201cThe biggest drag on the stock prices of G.M. and Ford are their legacies,\u201d Ms. Lindland said. \u201cPeople have not been burned by Tesla yet, whereas G.M. and Ford have 100 years of ups and downs to consider.\u201dAs for Tesla\u2019s plans, Mr. Musk updated shareholders on its coming Model 3 electric vehicle, which will be priced at about $35,000 \u2014 significantly lower than its two current models.He said the first Model 3 was on track to be produced next month at the company\u2019s factory in Fremont, Calif. But he gave no timetable on when the product would be available in large volumes for delivery to customers who have already put down $1,000 deposits.Mr. Musk said Tesla expected to expand its manufacturing capabilities as it expanded its product lineup. He said that the company could ultimately operate as many as 20 factories worldwide and that it would need a new plant as soon as it brought out its next product, the Model Y.\u201cThere is no room at Fremont,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bursting at the seams.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In that instance, a Turo vehicle struck another car and killed its driver in Smyrna, Ga. Brian Lewis, a lawyer representing a passenger in the Turo vehicle, said that the Turo renter was not the person actually behind the wheel, and that the suit would resolve the question of whether Turo\u2019s insurance ought to cover that situation. (The lawyers for the insurance company did not respond to a request for comment.)In an email, Mr. Webb said that the Turo vehicle in the Smyrna accident had been stolen, that the insurance company does not believe it owes coverage to a criminal, and that the coverage would indeed protect the car owner. He declined to provide overall theft figures, though he did say that it was \u201cextraordinarily rare.\u201dA spokeswoman for Getaround, Jacqueline Tanzella, said that its rate of recovered cars from in-trip thefts was 100 percent.Even Mr. Root is willing to give Turo a fourth chance if he replaces his car after the three accidents. While he found the company difficult to deal with after the damage occurred, he was often making twice as much from renting it out as the car cost in monthly lease payments, at least until it was totaled.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oracle Arena vs. Quicken Loans: Like Night and Day (or Warriors and Cavs)", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byCLEVELAND \u2014 Sports arenas for successful franchises can sometimes seem interchangeably generic, all noise and flash and money. But if there are two places that can be said to reflect the character and ethos of the teams that play within them, they are surely the basketball arenas in Oakland, Calif., and Cleveland.You might start with their names: Oracle Arena, named after a multinational computer technology company based in the rich community of Redwood Shores, Calif.; and Quicken Loans Arena, named after a national mortgage company based in downtown Detroit. (Some people in Cleveland call it the Q, but Quicken Loans it is.)As is so often the case with places in California, Oracle is situated right off the highway. It\u2019s hard to get there without driving or using public transportation. In Cleveland, by contrast, Quicken Loans is right downtown, next to the Cuyahoga River.Speak to Warriors fans at a home game, and they\u2019ll tell you straight out how much they love their team and who wouldn\u2019t? Have the same conversation in Cleveland, and Cavaliers fans will answer with passionate reveries about their love for their city, and how city and team are symbiotically linked.They\u2019ll mention Cleveland\u2019s old reputation as a symbol of backwater parochialism and Rust Belt decline, and how all that has changed with a resurgent economy, the improved fortunes of the Cavaliers and also the Indians, and the Republican National Committee\u2019s decision to hold its convention here last year.\u201cBut now the city is really wonderful,\u201d Smart said.The contrast between the two arenas has become only more striking now that they are the sites for this year\u2019s finals. Last Sunday, when Golden State was pounding Cleveland in Game 2 \u2014 the Warriors now lead the series, three games to one \u2014 the mood at Oracle Arena was brash, self-congratulatory, unsurprised, as if the Warriors\u2019 dominance was as much a natural right as the shiny presence of the Teslas, Priuses and Porsches that dotted the parking lot outside.Oracle Arena can have a kind of improvisational feel, as if it just now happens to be home to the endless party that is the world\u2019s best basketball team. But it never lets you forget that its fans live in Northern California, with all its attendant preoccupations.\u201cA lot of people want gluten-free hot dogs or burgers,\u201d said Delilah Gaden, who works at an Oracle concession stand featuring (healthy) grilled food. \u201cOr they\u2019ll ask what kind of oil is in the popcorn, or if we use real butter.\u201d The veggie burgers are the same kind you can get at Whole Foods, Gaden noted, adding, \u201cJust because they\u2019re fans, doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t also be vegetarians.\u201dThat makes sense, said Mark Figueiredo, 46, a businessman and longtime Warriors fan who was buying Chinese food (MSG-free) at Oracle during Game 2 on Sunday.\u201cA lot of people are allergic to gluten,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between the Bay Area and the Midwest. Vegans, vegetarians, fruitarians, pescatarians \u2014 we have it all here.\u201d (That, and Larry Page of Google, who was sitting in front of him at Game 1, he said.)At Quicken Loans, even the food stands were Cleveland-themed. Cleveland on the Rocks was the name of a bar in the concourse, with \u201con the\u201d written in tiny letters, inside the \u201co\u201d in Rocks. Another stand featured \u201cThe Best Chefs in the Land\u201d and their signature dishes, including \u201cChef Heather Haviland\u2019s Reuben Balls,\u201d basically Reuben sandwiches shaped into balls, coated with bread crumbs and deep fried.\u201cSure, people here might ask about the ingredients if they have a peanut allergy or are vegetarians,\u201d said John Kitko, a salesman for a company selling erosion-control geotextile products, who was raising money for charity by volunteering at the Quicken Loans Quaker Steak and Lube concession stand. (\u201cLube,\u201d in this context, means beer.) \u201cBut in Cleveland you\u2019re going to get some nice cooked kielbasa and pierogies.\u201dThe songs blaring from the loudspeakers before Game 3 included \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019 \u201d by Journey and \u201cDream On\u201d by Aerosmith. When the drum fill in Phil Collins\u2019s \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d came on, a whole hallway of Cleveland men began reflexively air-drumming.The Warriors have their share of passionate fans who stuck around during the ignominious years and are now reveling in their current great fortune. But the come-lately fans from the Bay Area\u2019s high-tech world, old-time fans say, have changed the experience, pricing out some of the locals. Tickets for the finals, they said, can easily resell for $5,000.Some fans wistfully recalled the days when you could buy a family package \u2014 four seats, four meals \u2014 for under $100. \u201cIf you\u2019re a middle-class kid, you can\u2019t afford it anymore,\u201d said Albert Blackwell, 60, a doorman in his 17th season as a fan, whose Game 2 ticket was a gift from a friend.At Oracle, people were not spending a ton of time thinking about Cleveland. But in Cleveland, at least in the fans\u2019 minds, the contrast was striking.\u201cThey\u2019re shiny and glossy and fueled by tech money and start-ups,\u201d said Pradeep Giri, 33, a manager at PricewaterhouseCooper. \u201cBut we\u2019re a lunch-pail, blue-collar team. They have Eddy Cue and the Apple and Google execs down on the floor. Here we have the guy who owns 20 car dealerships.\u201d\u201cThe popular television show \u2018The Drew Carey Show\u2019 was set in Cleveland,\u201d you read above one of the arena gates. \u201cCleveland\u2019s Willard Park is home to the world\u2019s largest rubber stamp,\u201d it says atop one of the women\u2019s bathrooms on the main concourse. And down the hall: \u201cCleveland\u2019s own Arthur Lovett invented the first padded bicycle seat in 1897.\u201dAs heartbroken as they were after the loss in Game 3, Cleveland fans said there was no need to lose faith in a city that has more than proved its worth to the rest of the country.\u201cWe\u2019ve had such a good run,\u201d Giri said. \u201cWe won the finals last year. The fact we made it this far, this is gravy.\u201dSo the Cleveland fans streamed out of the Q, dejected but not despairing. Their faith in the Cavaliers would more than pay off in Game 4 on Friday night. And besides, they also have the Indians. (Plus the Browns, a fixer-upper team that managed to win just one game last year, losing the other 15.)\u201cCleveland has an identity, a brotherhood \u2014 we\u2019ve been through so much,\u201d said Joel Bailey, 55, an executive in an electric company. (\u201cDon\u2019t hold that against me.\u201d) \u201cWe\u2019re Charlie Brown, and one day the Great Pumpkin will come.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the company quintupled the price of Evzio in the middle of a national opioid abuse epidemic, prompting letters from lawmakers who demanded to know why the price had shot up.Express Scripts says it is owed more than $14.5 million in fees and rebates related to Evzio, and it has dropped the drug from its preferred list.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Car Companies Are Hiring Computer Security Experts", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byBitsIt started about seven years ago. Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientists were being assassinated in a string of similar attacks: Assailants on motorcycles were pulling up to their moving cars, attaching magnetic bombs and detonating them after the motorcyclists had fled the scene.In another seven years, security experts warn, assassins won\u2019t need motorcycles or magnetic bombs. All they\u2019ll need is a laptop and code to send driverless cars careering off a bridge, colliding with a driverless truck or coming to an unexpected stop in the middle of fast-moving traffic.Automakers may call them self-driving cars. But hackers call them computers that travel over 100 miles an hour.\u201cThese are no longer cars,\u201d said Marc Rogers, the principal security researcher at the cybersecurity firm CloudFlare. \u201cThese are data centers on wheels. Any part of the car that talks to the outside world is a potential inroad for attackers.\u201dThose fears came into focus two years ago when two \u201cwhite hat\u201d hackers \u2014 researchers who look for computer vulnerabilities to spot problems and fix them, rather than to commit a crime or cause problems \u2014 successfully gained access to a Jeep Cherokee from their computer miles away. They rendered their crash-test dummy (in this case a nervous reporter) powerless over his vehicle and disabling his transmission in the middle of a highway.\u201cCar hacking makes great headlines, but remember: No one has ever had their car hacked by a bad guy,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter last Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s only ever been performed by researchers.\u201dStill, the research by Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek came at a steep price for Jeep\u2019s manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler, which was forced to recall 1.4 million of its vehicles as a result of the hacking experiment.It is no wonder that Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, called cybersecurity her company\u2019s top priority last year. Now the skills of researchers and so-called white hat hackers are in high demand among automakers and tech companies pushing ahead with driverless car projects.Uber, Tesla, Apple and Didi in China have been actively recruiting white hat hackers like Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek from one another as well as from traditional cybersecurity firms and academia.Last year, Tesla poached Aaron Sigel, Apple\u2019s manager of security for its iOS operating system. Uber poached Chris Gates, formerly a white hat hacker at Facebook. Didi poached Mr. Miller from Uber, where he had gone to work after the Jeep hack. And security firms have seen dozens of engineers leave their ranks for autonomous-car projects.Mr. Miller said he left Uber for Didi, in part, because his new Chinese employer has given him more freedom to discuss his work.\u201cCarmakers seem to be taking the threat of cyberattack more seriously, but I\u2019d still like to see more transparency from them,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter on Saturday.Like a number of big tech companies, Tesla and Fiat Chrysler started paying out rewards to hackers who turn over flaws the hackers discover in their systems. GM has done something similar, though critics say GM\u2019s program is limited when compared with the ones offered by tech companies, and so far no rewards have been paid out.Granted, they had to be in the Jeep to make all that happen. But it was evidence of what is possible.Security researchers have also had their way with Tesla\u2019s software-heavy Model S car. In 2015, Mr. Rogers, together with Kevin Mahaffey, the chief technology officer of the cybersecurity company Lookout, found a way to control various Tesla functions from their physically connected laptop.One year later, a team of Chinese researchers at Tencent took their research a step further, hacking a moving Tesla Model S and controlling its brakes from 12 miles away. Unlike Chrysler, Tesla was able to dispatch a remote patch to fix the security holes that made the hacks possible.In all the cases, the car hacks were the work of well meaning, white hat security researchers. But the lesson for all automakers was clear.The motivations to hack vehicles are limitless. When it learned of Mr. Rogers\u2019s and Mr. Mahaffey\u2019s investigation into Tesla\u2019s Model S, a Chinese app-maker asked Mr. Rogers if he would be interested in sharing, or possibly selling, his discovery, he said. (The app maker was looking for a backdoor to secretly install its app on Tesla\u2019s dashboard.)Criminals have not yet shown they have found back doors into connected vehicles, though for years, they have been actively developing, trading and deploying tools that can intercept car key communications.But as more driverless and semiautonomous cars hit the open roads, they will become a more worthy target. Security experts warn that driverless cars present a far more complex, intriguing and vulnerable \u201cattack surface\u201d for hackers. Each new \u201cconnected\u201d car feature introduces greater complexity, and with complexity inevitably comes vulnerability.Twenty years ago, cars had, on average, one million lines of code. The General Motors 2010 Chevrolet Volt had about 10 million lines of code \u2014 more than an F-35 fighter jet.Today, an average car has more than 100 million lines of code. Automakers predict it won\u2019t be long before they have 200 million. When you stop to consider that, on average, there are 15 to 50 defects per 1,000 lines of software code, the potentially exploitable weaknesses add up quickly.The only difference between computer code and driverless car code is that, \u201cUnlike data center enterprise security \u2014 where the biggest threat is loss of data \u2014 in automotive security, it\u2019s loss of life,\u201d said David Barzilai, a co-founder of Karamba Security, an Israeli start-up that is working on addressing automotive security.To truly secure autonomous vehicles, security experts say, automakers will have to address the inevitable vulnerabilities that pop up in new sensors and car computers, address inherent vulnerabilities in the base car itself and, perhaps most challenging of all, bridge the cultural divide between automakers and software companies.\u201cThe genie is out of the bottle, and to solve this problem will require a major cultural shift,\u201d said Mr. Mahaffey of the cybersecurity company Lookout. \u201cAnd an automaker that truly values cybersecurity will treat security vulnerabilities the same they would an airbag recall. We have not seen that industrywide shift yet.\u201dThere will be winners and losers, Mr. Mahaffey added: \u201cAutomakers that transform themselves into software companies will win. Others will get left behind.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Both Climate Leader and Oil Giant? A Norwegian Paradox", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported byOSLO \u2014 On an unseasonably warm day in May, Norway\u2019s climate minister, Vidar Helgesen, strolled through a vast parking lot for electric cars, counting Teslas.\u201cTwo, three, four, five,\u201d the minister marveled. And that was just one aisle.There are big perks to buying a Tesla \u2014 or any electric car \u2014 in Norway. The government waives the high taxes it imposes on sales of other cars. It lets electric cars cruise up bus lanes. Toll roads are free. Parking lots like this one offer a free charge, and new charging stations are being built on the nation\u2019s highways.In fact, Norway hopes that only electric cars will be sold in the country by 2025 \u2014 a surprising goal, given that it means kicking the nation\u2019s powerful oil industry in the shins.But Norway\u2019s big electric push on cars does not mean the nation is abandoning fossil fuels, revealing what critics call a notable contradiction in its climate policy.Spurred by attractive state subsidies, the Norwegian oil company Statoil is chasing after new oil and gas fields in the Arctic. Nearly all of the supply is destined for export \u2014 and to show up in the carbon emissions of countries that burn Norwegian oil and gas.As governments wrestle over what they should do to keep the planet from heating up to dangerous levels, critics contend that Norway should curb the supply of fossil fuels, rather than just trimming demand among its own people.It\u2019s one of the problems built into the Paris climate accord that President Trump promises to leave, Mr. Erickson argued: Countries are measured by how much they reduce their own emissions, within their own borders, not by the impact they have on the planet as a whole.And while there may be a global effort under the Paris agreement to reduce emissions, that certainly has not stopped the international race for Arctic oil. Norway is in the vanguard of that scramble, trailed by Russia, Canada and the United States.In May, Statoil began work on five new exploration wells in the Barents Sea, and the company is bullish on the prospects. It says that it explores only in ice-free waters. (Cleaning up an oil spill in ice is next to impossible, environmentalists say.)\u201cThere will be demand for oil and gas even in a 2-degree scenario going forward,\u201d Mr. Eek said.In any case, he pointed out, it can trade its emissions allowances across Europe, as part of the European Union\u2019s emissions cap-and-trade system, meant to create incentives to reduce a company\u2019s carbon footprint.\u201cThe world might not need our oil,\u201d she said.Oil drilling can be a politically contentious topic for Norwegians. A proposal to explore for oil near the Lofoten Islands, an ecologically sensitive cod breeding ground, was bitterly opposed by environmentalists and fishermen \u2014 and shelved until after national elections this fall.On a recent bright, hot day \u2014 \u201cThis would be a great day in July, and it\u2019s only May,\u201d said Norway\u2019s environment minister, Mr. Helgesen \u2014 the minister emphasized that his country was aggressively trying to curb demand for oil and gas. He drives an electric Volkswagen Golf. It can carry on for nearly 100 miles on a full charge, though in the bitter Norwegian winters, he concedes, it conks out much sooner.Mr. Helgesen hopes there will soon be a pilot project with an electric-powered passenger plane to handle a short-distance flight in the north of the country. With stepped-up demand for electric vehicles, he says battery companies are finding Norway an attractive destination.Norway has sought to reduce its carbon footprint in other ways, too. It has divested its enormous sovereign wealth fund from coal. It donates heavily to a global fund to save forests. It was one of the first countries to sign the Paris deal, alongside France itself.Now, Mr. Helgesen says his country is facing the inevitable. \u201cWe are readily saying, \u2018Oil and gas will not be the driver of our economy in the future,\u2019\u201d he argued. \u201cWhile we are still drilling, we are identifying ways to build more legs for the Norwegian economy to stand on.\u201dThat is an existential challenge for the country. The oil industry is politically powerful. Oil exports create wealth. Oil drilling creates jobs. Passing up opportunities in the shallow waters of the warming Arctic is difficult.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bounty Hunter of Wall Street", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "FeatureAndrew Left sniffs out corporate fraud \u2014 and gets rich doing it.Supported byIn the finance world, Left, 46, is what is known as an \u201cactivist\u201d short-seller. After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company\u2019s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries \u2014 Tesla, Valeant, GoPro \u2014 and though he makes mistakes, he has an unusually high success rate.For a year he had been assembling a file on Express Scripts, a pharmacy-benefits manager with $100 billion in revenue. Pharmacy-benefits managers occupy an eye-glazingly complex netherworld in the prescription-drug supply chain, serving as intermediaries between drug makers and insurers. Express Scripts ostensibly exists to keep drug prices low, by negotiating with drug makers on behalf of insurers, but Left believed that the company was actually inflating them, because higher prices meant larger rebates from the drug makers, which meant more profit. He believed that this was true of all pharmacy-benefits managers, but especially of Express Scripts, the most powerful. Its second-largest customer was the Department of Defense; downward pressure on drug pricing from the government could seriously threaten its bottom line.By rights, then, Trump\u2019s threat in the interview should have tanked Express Scripts\u2019 stock. That the price remained unchanged indicated to Left that many people on Wall Street had no clue what a pharmacy-benefits manager does. Trump, he thought as he pulled out of the Madison Club, had given his stale, year-old story a fresh hook. (A spokesman for Express Scripts denied Left\u2019s claims, noting that \u201croughly 90 percent of rebates go directly to our clients.\u201d)Fifteen minutes later, Left was driving west on Interstate 10 in his black Bentley Continental GT. From the car, he placed a call to a hedge-fund manager, a man who was already short Express Scripts and therefore had a stake in providing Left with information. Express Scripts, this man reminded Left, did not disclose the amount it made in rebates, while some of its operating metrics exceeded those of Apple; something seemed wrong.Left heard \u201crebates\u201d and thought \u201ckickbacks.\u201d Express Scripts was, in Left\u2019s mind, \u201cthe man behind the man\u201d; it was \u201cthe mob.\u201d If he went public with a short position tomorrow, he wagered, he could sour Wall Street\u2019s perception of the company, transforming it from a sure thing into a noisy, chaotic mess. That attention might in turn attract regulators, further driving down the share price. He called his web designer, Mike Leznik, and told him that he wanted to buy a domain name to host his research on Express Scripts. An hour later the road snaked above Studio City, and he arrived at Mulholland Estates, his gated community in Beverly Hills.The next morning, Left stood in his home office and put CNBC on the television. The anchors were discussing the \u201cTrump bump,\u201d as the recent stock rally was being called. \u201cThey sit around all day long without ever knowing anything,\u201d Left said. \u201cIt\u2019s so annoying to watch them.\u201d Seated beneath the TV was Leznik, a sweet-natured Angeleno in jeans and blue-suede sneakers. Leznik lacked the macho swagger that made Left, with his money and filthy mouth, the center of a room. Nowhere was this truer than in his office. A giant desk dominated the back half. On the credenza sat cigar boxes from Enron and Madoff Securities \u2014 a short-seller\u2019s version of trophy antlers.\u201cWhat should I register the domain name as?\u201d Leznik asked.\u201cYour mother is a whore dot com?\u201d Left said.\u201cThe real story of \u2014 \u201d Leznik suggested.\u201cThe real story of your mother being a whore?\u201d Left said.Leznik settled on TheRealExpressScripts.com, then asked Left for his credit card to buy the URL.\u201cWhat are you, my wife?\u201d Left said.There were several obvious comebacks to this \u2014 \u201cYou wish\u201d being the absolute minimum \u2014 but none occurred to Leznik, who after fumbling for a moment said, \u201cI could be, if you had enough room.\u201d A whiff. The room was silenced.At 10 a.m., having placed his bet against the stock the night before, Left put out his first tweet, which he misspelled and deleted four times. Such is his mystique in the world of finance, however, that one of his followers assumed that the misspellings and deletions were part of a premeditated scheme to exploit Twitter\u2019s visibility algorithms. Finally the corrected version of the tweet came out from Left\u2019s handle, @CitronResearch, followed moments later by another: \u201cWhen @RealDonaldTrump goes after $ESRX,\u201d it read, using the ticker symbol for Express Scripts, \u201cheads will roll.\u201d We sat back and waited, eyes on CNBC. Twenty minutes passed. Suddenly a news flash interrupted the show. \u201cExpress Scripts shares are falling sharply on a spike in volume,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cCitron Research, run by Andrew Left, tweeted about the stock. They\u2019re now down by 9 or 10 percent, about 9.2 million shares so far.\u201d Left\u2019s tweet appeared in the corner of the screen. In the office, the atmosphere went taut.We watched as the stock came down, dollar after dollar, from 75 to 74 to 73; 72, 71, 70. Left wrote two more tweets, including a promise to appear on television with further revelations. Soon, the phone started ringing \u2014 reporters calling. Linette Lopez from Business Insider texted for quotes. CNBC booked him for 2 p.m. that day. \u201cThe question is,\u201d Left told a journalist from Bloomberg, \u201cis the new administration serious? He\u2019s going to rein in drug pricing. O.K., Mr. Trump, here\u2019s my advice: I know the industry. Go after Express Scripts.\u201d\u201cDo you have a short position?\u201d the reporter from Bloomberg asked.\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Left said.\u201cExpress Scripts, as we\u2019re talking, continues to drop,\u201d the anchor on CNBC said.In 15 minutes, $6 billion of market capitalization vanished. (Five months later, the stock price is still down 13 percent.) Left considered the circus around him. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201csome guys know this stuff better than me. But I know how to put it in [expletive] tweets.\u201dAt any given moment, someone, somewhere, has a short position in whatever stock you can think of \u2014 99 percent of all stocks in the world, by some estimates. Blue-chip stocks like Apple and Google are being shorted. Shake Shack is being shorted to an unhealthy degree: Almost half its shares are borrowed. As you read this, people are short on The New York Times. Almost uniquely among Wall Street maneuvers, short-selling entails what traders call infinite downside. While potential profit is constrained by the distance between the current share price and zero, the potential loss is not, because the shares, once borrowed, can rise in price indefinitely, which means the cost of returning them can, too. It\u2019s unsurprising that short-sellers tend to be aggressive men who are convinced that they see what other people miss and are comfortable with \u2014 or addicted to \u2014 risk.For many years that risk was taken on in secret: Short-sellers would make their bets and passively wait for the market to move in their direction. The figure of the activist, who goes public with his positions, emerged into prominence in recent years. One crucial event in Wall Street history provided the foundation. In 2001, James Chanos, a hedge-fund manager, discovered an accounting scandal at Enron, then a little-known energy company in Texas, and shared his information with journalists from Fortune. The journalists got a best seller, Chanos got his money and Jeffrey Skilling, Enron\u2019s chief executive, got 24 years at the Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery, Ala.Short-sellers of Left\u2019s generation are following this example but cutting out the middleman. You don\u2019t need an office in a flashy building in the Battery, they have realized, or the validation of the press. If you build enough of a reputation, all you need are some Twitter followers and a website. Left has emerged at the forefront of this new guard. Unlike Chanos, who managed billions of dollars of other people\u2019s money, Left invests his own, which exempts him from disclosing his holdings to the public. And now that his work has brought him national attention, he has found that others are willing to make it easier, by leaking documents to him and passing tips. In many cases, Left\u2019s dossiers against his targets are not wholly his own but built using information from a confidential source. He is, in this sense, a bit like a journalist.He also makes it look easy. One result of Left\u2019s fame is that today\u2019s younger traders believe that they, too, could be him. Wuyang Zhao, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin, who wrote his dissertation on activist short-selling, told me: \u201cPeople read Andrew Left, and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, my God, it\u2019s not impossibly difficult. It\u2019s not a lot of work, and you can bring down a big company.\u2019\u2009\u201d One of Left\u2019s friends recalled a visit Left made to a university to give a lecture. In the hallways afterward, the students swarmed him. \u201cIt was like he was Mick Jagger,\u201d the friend said.From 2006 to 2015, the number of activist short campaigns rose by 1,300 percent, to 1,289. In the past three years, the number of activist short-sellers working globally has nearly doubled, to 72 from 39. Very few have a positive track record. Left does. On average, the value of companies he writes about drop 10 percent in a year, and some drop as much as 95 percent.One morning last spring, Left and I stood in his lush backyard while he smoked a Marlboro Light. Beyond the swimming pool, the land fell sharply into the valley, and Los Angeles lay prone in the heat. We could see DJ Khaled\u2019s recently purchased house over the fence to our left. Tan and unshaven in loafers, Left possessed the vaguely louche charisma of a club promoter, which is what you might mistake him for were it not for his eyes \u2014 green, wet, melancholy eyes, which, because they cannot but project sincerity, are his greatest tools on television. His eyes are the reason he could stand in his million-dollar lawn and say to me, without irony, \u201cI\u2019m an investigative journalist who trades on his information.\u201dI observed that most investigative journalists could not count DJ Khaled as a neighbor.\u201cThe difference between this and journalism is you can make millions of dollars,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut you can lose millions of dollars, too.\u201dWhen I found him at the airport, he was wearing distressed jeans and a golf shirt, barking into an iPhone. He had just flown back from a vacation in Florida. During the 45-minute drive to his house, Left, never hanging up, floated and discarded a variety of plans. They were: exposing a jewelry chain as a subprime lender in disguise; shorting a maybe-fraudulent media company in Canada; and withdrawing a million-dollar cashier\u2019s check from his bank, made out to a pharmaceutical company, to be offered as a donation to the charity of its choice if it could prove to him the efficacy of a drug for multiple sclerosis, still in trials, which Left had on authority from the \u201crabbi of M.S.\u201d didn\u2019t work.The man on the other end of the line was a hedge-fund manager, this one a very close associate of Left\u2019s, at the center of his circle of sources. His relationship with Left was completely informal. His role was to trade ideas back and forth, sometimes shorting the companies they discussed. In exchange for sharing his insight and institutional muscle, Left\u2019s source avoided the legal liability that came from going public with a position. (A short campaign based on faulty information leaves you open to accusations of market manipulation, something Left has never been charged with in the United States.) Left has a number of sources on Wall Street, and during the months I spent reporting on him, he took care to keep their names from me, lest he burn them.Left also got tips as many journalists do, in large quantities, most of them useless. Business-school wannabes emailed him to get noticed. E-Trade cowboys offered schemes \u201cfor your eyes only.\u201d Hedge funds sent him research and ideas, most often because they wanted him to catalyze a short position they already held, by taking it public. What many of these people failed to grasp was that a bad company wasn\u2019t necessarily a good story. One morning, I watched him read his emails. \u201cGildan T-shirts,\u201d he snorted. \u201cThat idea does nothing for me. Who gives a [expletive] about Gildan?\u201dThen there was a third set of sources he used: tips of no discernible origin. In March 2012, for instance, a package without a return address landed on his doorstep. Inside were 68 pages of research claiming that a Chinese real estate company, Evergrande, was perpetrating an accounting fraud and would collapse. An odd tone pervaded, as if a very strait-laced stock analyst were trying to loosen up and channel Left\u2019s combative voice (\u201cChairman Hui\u2019s pet projects are comically off-strategy ... the endgame is nearing ... a maze of Ponzi-esque debt\u201d). Left hired a fact-checker, became convinced that the claims were accurate, updated some figures and published. The stock instantly dropped 7 percent. He covered a portion of his position two hours later, taking $280,000 in profit.But the profit was only the beginning of the story. In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission sued Left for \u201cfalse and misleading claims,\u201d a failure to adequately support his accusations with evidence. The judge found him guilty and barred him from trading on the Chinese markets for five years. (Left objects to the decision on free-speech grounds and is appealing the ruling.) He refused to give up the name of his fact-checker. As to the identity of the anonymous sender, there was nothing to give up: Left had no idea who it was, except someone who almost certainly had a short position in Evergrande and made a fortune off the publication without the hassle of appearing in court. That was the point of using physical paper. Courts can subpoena your emails, but good luck tracing the mail backward from your gated community in Beverly Hills.As careful as Left must be to fact-check, hesitation hurts, too. If you\u2019re slow, other shorts can scoop you, which is exactly what happened with the online postage seller: A competitor had published a version of Left\u2019s thesis on a finance blog, and the stock\u2019s price had fallen too far to short. Back at his home office, Left tried to work, but the atmosphere was lazy, diffuse. He called a source. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he said, asking about the postage stock. \u201cWill it bounce?\u201d The source replied that it would not.Left squinted at CNBC. Then he roared. It began as a self-mocking \u201cWhy me?\u201d exasperation but expanded into something more unhindered, a primal American shriek. \u201cUugghHHAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH\u200bHHHHHHHHHH.\u201dWhen he was through, he said, almost to himself, \u201cThere has got to be an easier way to make money.\u201dRecognizing his ability to dazzle an audience at a young age, Black wanted her son to become a lawyer or a rabbi. Instead, he was accepted at Northeastern and chose political science. Boston confronted him for the first time with people who had always had money. They knew that Beverly Hills was an actual place in California, not a made-up city on TV. They wore black. They didn\u2019t drink Bartles & Jaymes.After graduating in 1993, Left responded to a newspaper ad from an outfit called the Universal Commodity Corporation, offering $100,000 a year for work in what the advertiser knew not to call a boiler room. Boiler rooms are cold-call centers for stocks, where men in bare-walled offices put the screws on unsophisticated marks. (As in: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Mrs. Jones. I\u2019d hate to see your husband miss out.\u201d) Roberta Karmel, a former Securities and Exchange Commission regulator who policed the Long Island boiler rooms in the 1980s, described to me a typical employee. \u201cHe tended to go to lesser schools for college,\u201d she said. \u201cOr not go to college at all. And a lot of them were kind of scrappy personalities who thought: Well, I\u2019m just as smart as the people at the white-shoe firms. I can make a lot of money, too.\u201dMaybe \u2014 if you\u2019re good at it. Left was not. He would meander off script and lose the sale. He quit after nine months, ejecting himself into the mid-\u201990s froth, where there was very little oversight and, almost everywhere you looked, a thick layer of scumminess. These were the years when the future \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d author Jordan Belfort ran a brokerage firm on Long Island, taking small companies public. Left started flipping penny-stock I.P.O.s, including Belfort\u2019s \u2014 he would call up the \u201cbucket shops,\u201d or storefront stock exchanges, ask for shares before a company went public and then sell them later at a profit.At the time, the Long Island bucket shops were pumping obscure stocks to whoever would buy them. The typical scam involved inflating the price by lying to your customers, then selling your own shares as close to the peak as possible before those customers got wiped out. (In 1999, a judge sentenced Belfort to four years for fraud. He served 22 months.) In the back of Left\u2019s mind, a realization glimmered. With the money he had saved from a few successful trades, he started shorting Belfort and the others, covering his positions after the price bottomed out \u2014 in effect profiting from their fraud. He was just getting the hang of it when the market crashed. He moved to California.In the mid-\u201990s, traders were just beginning to publish their theses online. An idea occurred to Left: Take the short positions he wielded against the Long Island companies and aim them up at big companies, the more elite the better, using the internet to disseminate the research. Instead of writing in the mode of a traditional stock analyst, he would distill his arguments down to internet-friendly length. The word \u201cblog\u201d was just starting to enter the lexicon. Left registered a domain name. He decided to stay in California. He would come to talk about frauds the way surfers talk about waves.To its fans on Wall Street, Valeant represented a brand-new model for the drug business. It didn\u2019t spend money on research and development, as most drug companies did. Instead, it bought valuable patents for drugs that others had developed, then jacked up the prices. To critics, Valeant was an abusive acquisition machine that produced nothing of value and would choke on its own debt. Senator Bernie Sanders lambasted it. Shares traded above $200.On Sept. 28, 2015, Left released his first report on the company. \u201cThis article is not for you hedge-fund managers who think that this quarter\u2019s profit is more important than human decency,\u201d it read. \u201cThis article is for the millions of Americans who together can mandate change.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhile the whole country is in an uproar about Turing Pharmaceuticals, a one-drug start-up pharma company attempting to raise prices on a single AIDS drug, the real issue is a $100 billion monster only Wall Street could love \u2014 an extremely leveraged company that set the standard for this type of abuse, while being cheered on by a cadre of Wall Street high-rollers too wealthy to fret over their own personal health care costs, and its posse of hedge-fund operators.\u201d A second report followed, demanding that Congress subpoena Valeant\u2019s executives.Pearson called the comparison \u201cerroneous\u201d and asked the S.E.C. to investigate Left. But as any public-relations agent knows, if you\u2019re denying, you\u2019re already on the back foot. By the time the company announced an emergency news conference the following morning, the stock was down 40 percent. \u201cAndrew erased the idea that buying Valeant was a smart strategy,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI just thought it was a good story. Andrew knew it was a ball of gasoline-soaked rags. He threw a match on it.\u201dAmong those who smelled smoke was the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. In November 2016, he indicted two men on charges of wire fraud and kickbacks: Gary Tanner, a senior executive at Valeant, and Andrew Davenport, the chief executive of Philidor. For all intents and purposes, the indictment alleges, Philidor was not an independent company. That much Left had suspected. What was shocking was the nature of the relationship between the businesses. It was not simple channel stuffing, the indictment alleges, but theft. According to the document, Tanner would sell Davenport millions of dollars of drugs. Then Davenport would share with Tanner the incentive payments he received from Valeant, moving the money through a shell company. Meanwhile Tanner misled his Valeant colleagues into believing that a competitor wanted to buy Philidor. The ultimate goal, the indictment claims, was to inflate Philidor\u2019s value until Valeant acquired it at a huge markup, at which point the two would split the millions that Davenport would earn from the sale as Philidor\u2019s largest stakeholder. (Through a representative, Valeant said it was the victim, not the perpetrator, of the fraud. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note the indictment involved one former employee,\u201d the company wrote, adding that it has increased R.&D. investment by 26 percent.)We rode the elevator to a silent floor, where the receptionist clocked him as he entered. \u201cHey, Andy.\u201d Desks sat empty; the morning crew was here to shoot the 9:30 spots for the New York market, but in Los Angeles the day hadn\u2019t started. A tech came out to lead us to the studio. He was a gentle man in middle age, soft-featured, wearing cargo pants and thick black sneakers, a big brown mustache, warm eyes. He knew Left from the Valeant short and liked to watch him stick it to the Wall Street bosses. All day, people came through the studio rattling off finance acronyms, Ebitda this and Gaap that. Left spoke English.The tech set Left up on a director\u2019s chair. A screen behind his head projected a slightly more outdated version of the skyline than was visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows off-camera to the left and right. Left opened his notes and put his earpiece in. A few seconds into the interview, the anchor fell into a trap. \u201cHow much do you think Express Scripts makes off rebates off a high-priced drug?\u201d he asked.The tech was looking at Left. \u201cYou\u2019re our best guest,\u201d he said. \u201cOur most controversial guest.\u201d\u201cBut not the handsomest,\u201d Left said.\u201cWe\u2019re in West Hollywood,\u201d the tech apologized. On-screen, the anchors moved on to the morning\u2019s next story, the appointment to the Trump administration of the president of Goldman Sachs. Left rode the elevator down to the lobby and slipped outside, where the blue glass tower dwarfed him.Claire Stovall, a researcher at the industry analyst Activist Shorts, told me that the situation was not necessarily to be feared. \u201cThe market is often quicker than the government at catching frauds,\u201d Stovall said. And most successful activist short campaigns produce no regulatory action anyway. But Zhao took a dimmer view. \u201cIf you create a deregulated boom not supported by fundamentals,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will have a disaster. The activist short-sellers will make a fortune. But sometimes, as a member of society, you don\u2019t want to have a total collapse.\u201dIn retrospect, it is not coincidental that 2015 was the year Left became famous. His tactics matched our mood. Most of us do not care about a random pharmaceutical company meeting its debt covenants. We care about getting medicine at a price we can afford. We don\u2019t care about organic versus inorganic growth, but we worry that our kids will have no coverage if the Trump administration repeals Obamacare. Left\u2019s very timely gift is to connect our daily human concerns to the convoluted operations of the economy, wrapping financial analysis in a moral, populist language that is calibrated precisely to draw maximum attention in a media environment in which screaming is the only way to be heard.As for those being screamed at, the banks and the business schools that feed them, Left represents at best an interesting character and at worst a nuisance. American high finance is extraordinarily good at absorbing attacks on it. Just a few months ago, Left delivered a keynote speech at Harvard Business School\u2019s annual investment conference, where students who could afford the $72,000 tuition calmly imbibed Left\u2019s strategies, which were once considered fringe. He texted me a photo of himself in Harvard Yard, looking comfortable and middle-aged, smiling, his eyes closed.An article on June 11 about a short-seller referred incorrectly to Daraprim, the drug whose price was increased 56-fold by Turing Pharmaceuticals. The company bought the marketing rights, not the patent, to the drug.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla in Talks to Set Up Electric Car Factory in Shanghai", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Tesla Motors is in discussions to establish a factory in Shanghai, its first in China, a move that could bolster its efforts in one of its major markets even as it further lifts China\u2019s position as a builder of electric cars.In a statement on Thursday, Tesla said it needed to set up more overseas factories to make cars that customers could afford. Such a strategy is a must in China, which charges steep tariffs for imported cars.\u201cTesla is working with the Shanghai Municipal Government to explore the possibility of establishing a manufacturing facility in the region to serve the Chinese market,\u201d a company spokesman said. \u201cTesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market, and we continue to evaluate potential manufacturing sites around the globe to serve the local markets.\u201d\u201cWhile we expect most of our production to remain in the U.S., we do need to establish local factories to ensure affordability for the markets they serve,\u201d the spokesman said.China accounted for about 15 percent of Tesla\u2019s revenue last year, nearly double the percentage it contributed in 2015.Tesla\u2019s negotiations do not guarantee that a plant will be built. Under Chinese law, such a project would require Tesla to find a Chinese joint-venture partner. While China is full of Chevrolets, Fords and Volkswagens, most are made in factories jointly owned by a foreign automaker and a local company.The City of Shanghai controls the SAIC Motor Corporation, one of China\u2019s largest automakers and a partner for General Motors and Volkswagen. It was not clear whether Tesla\u2019s negotiations with the city government would steer the company to negotiate with SAIC. Calls to the Chinese automaker were not returned.Tesla could get around the joint-venture requirement by building a wholly owned factory in a foreign trade zone in China. But it would still have to pay the 25 percent import duty for cars sold in China, as the factory would be treated as outside China for trade purposes.Further complicating matters, China recently announced that it would issue no more business licenses to make automobiles, including electric cars. Tesla does not have a license, although it could form an alliance with a company that has one.These are formidable obstacles. But some in the Chinese auto industry say that the economics of producing in China \u2014 a low-cost supply chain, especially for electric cars, as well as the ability to bypass the import tariffs \u2014 make the proposition attractive.For China, a domestic Tesla factory could represent a big symbolic victory. Spurred by incessant pollution and increasing dependence on foreign oil, China for the last several years has pushed to be a leader in electric car development.That has raised concern in Western countries. In March, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China complained that Chinese law requires manufacturers who set up shop in China to transfer crucial technology to their Chinese partners.The complaint coincides with a broader debate over China\u2019s plan \u2014 called Made in China 2025 \u2014 to become self-sufficient in some technology industries. That plan has led to concerns that China will nurture and subsidize domestic competitors to Western companies.Tesla models carry a hefty price in China. The Model S ranges from 723,500 to 1,399,800 renminbi, or about $104,000 to $203,000. The same model retails for $70,000 to $140,000 in the United States, before government incentives.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Trump Will Withdraw U.S. From Paris Climate Agreement", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced on Thursday that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, weakening efforts to combat global warming and embracing isolationist voices in his White House who argued that the agreement was a pernicious threat to the economy and American sovereignty.In a speech from the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said the landmark 2015 pact imposed wildly unfair environmental standards on American businesses and workers. He vowed to stand with the people of the United States against what he called a \u201cdraconian\u201d international deal.\u201cI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,\u201d the president said, drawing support from members of his Republican Party but widespread condemnation from political leaders, business executives and environmentalists around the globe.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the agreement for environmental action signed by 195 nations is a remarkable rebuke to heads of state, climate activists, corporate executives and members of the president\u2019s own staff, who all failed to change his mind with an intense, last-minute lobbying blitz. The Paris agreement was intended to bind the world community into battling rising temperatures in concert, and the departure of the Earth\u2019s second-largest polluter is a major blow.Mr. Trump said he wanted to negotiate a better deal for the United States, and the administration said he had placed calls to the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Canada to personally explain his decision. A statement from the White House press secretary said the president \u201creassured the leaders that America remains committed to the trans-Atlantic alliance and to robust efforts to protect the environment.\u201dBut within minutes of the president\u2019s remarks, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement saying that the Paris climate accord was \u201cirreversible\u201d and could not be renegotiated.The decision was a victory for Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, and Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who spent months quietly making their case to the president about the dangers of the agreement. Inside the West Wing, the pair overcame intense opposition from other top aides, including Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson.Ms. Trump, in particular, fought to make sure that her father heard from people supportive of the agreement, setting up calls and meetings with world leaders, corporate executives and others. But by Thursday, aides who pushed to remain part of the agreement were disconsolate, and it was Mr. Pruitt whom the president brought up for victory remarks at the Rose Garden event.The president\u2019s speech was his boldest and most sweeping assertion of an \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy doctrine since he assumed office four months ago. He vowed to turn the country\u2019s empathy inward, rejecting financial assistance for pollution controls in developing nations in favor of providing help to American cities struggling to hire police officers.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement drew immediate reaction from big-city mayors, governors and Congress members.\u201cIt would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic affairs,\u201d Mr. Trump said.In Mr. Trump\u2019s view, the Paris accord represents an attack on the sovereignty of the United States and a threat to the ability of his administration to reshape the nation\u2019s environmental laws in ways that benefit everyday Americans.\u201cAt what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won\u2019t be.\u201dBut business leaders like Elon Musk of Tesla, Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs said the decision would ultimately harm the economy by ceding the jobs of the future in clean energy and technology to overseas competitors.\u201cClimate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\u201d he said.By stepping away from the Paris agreement, the president made good on a campaign promise to \u201ccancel\u201d an agreement he repeatedly mocked at rallies. As president, he has moved rapidly to reverse Obama-era policies aimed at allowing the United States to meet its pollution-reduction targets as set under the agreement.\u201cWe are getting out,\u201d Mr. Trump said Thursday. \u201cBut we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that\u2019s fair. And if we can, that\u2019s great.\u201dIn his remarks, Mr. Trump listed sectors of the United States economy that would lose revenue and jobs if the country remained part of the accord, citing a study \u2014 vigorously disputed by environmental groups \u2014 asserting that the agreement would cost 2.7 million jobs by 2025.But he will stick to the withdrawal process laid out in the Paris agreement, which President Barack Obama joined and most of the world has already ratified. That could take nearly four years to complete, meaning a final decision would be up to the American voters in the next presidential election.Republican lawmakers hailed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, calling it a necessary antidote to the overreach of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies aimed at reducing planet-warming carbon emissions.\u201cI applaud President Trump and his administration for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration\u2019s assault on domestic energy production and jobs,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.But Mr. Trump\u2019s call for new global negotiations about the planet\u2019s climate drew derision from Democrats in the United States and other heads of state.President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada each issued rebukes to Mr. Trump. \u201cMake our planet great again,\u201d Mr. Macron said.On Twitter, Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for climate, said that \u201ctoday\u2019s announcement has galvanized us rather than weakened us, and this vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership.\u201dThe United States has emitted more planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than any other country. Now it is walking back a promise to lower emissions.Mr. Obama, in a rare assertion of his political views as a former president, said, \u201cThe nations that remain in the Paris agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.\u201d\u201cEven in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I\u2019m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Obama said.In recent days, Mr. Trump withstood withering criticism from European counterparts who accused him of shirking America\u2019s role as a global leader and America\u2019s responsibility as history\u2019s largest emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gasses.After a fierce debate inside the administration, the White House on Thursday took on the trappings of a celebration. The Rose Garden was packed with reporters, activists and members of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. Scores of staff members lined the sides of the Rose Garden as a military band played soft jazz.Supporters of the Paris agreements reacted with pent-up alarm, condemning the administration for shortsightedness about the planet and a reckless willingness to shatter longstanding diplomatic relationships.President Trump will withdraw the United States from the first worldwide deal to address global warming. Where do other countries stand on the agreement?\u201cRemoving the United States from the Paris agreement is a reckless and indefensible action,\u201d said Al Gore, the former vice president who has become an evangelist for fighting climate change. \u201cIt undermines America\u2019s standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity\u2019s ability to solve the climate crisis in time.\u201dCorporate leaders also condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s action.On its website, I.B.M. reaffirmed its support for the Paris agreement and took issue with the president\u2019s contention that it was a bad deal for American workers and the American economy.\u201cThis agreement requires all participating countries to put forward their best efforts on climate change as determined by each country,\u201d the company said. \u201cI.B.M. believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it.\u201dMr. Immelt, the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, took to Twitter to say he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision. \u201cClimate change is real,\u201d he said. \u201cIndustry must now lead and not depend on government.\u201dBut Mr. Trump was resolute.\u201cIt is time to put Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.; and Pittsburgh, Pa., along with many, many other locations within our great country, before Paris, France,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time to make America great again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This was a short week since we started it off with Memorial Day and, fortunately, no tech companies were sadistic enough to drop news on us on a sacred holiday.I have no idea how this whole thing is going to turn out. All I know is that this is hardly the way Uber wanted its widely acclaimed acquisition of Otto, the self-driving trucking company started by Levandowski, to go.So, I guess, at least that headache is solved, for now?We don\u2019t know what the report will say \u2014 it could be damning, or it could soft-pedal the whole thing \u2014 but either way, Uber\u2019s moment under the media glare isn\u2019t going to end soon.Good for him, though an entirely new consumer electronics company seems like a tough sell in an age where Apple and Samsung are sucking up all the hardware profits.Honestly, the degree to which others have decided to just carve up Snapchat\u2019s product ideas is inspiring. Nothing is sacred in Silicon Valley \u2014 I guess you can thank Mark Zuckerberg and his various properties for that initial inspiration.More than anyone else in tech, Musk has made saving humanity from global catastrophe his thing. It\u2019s the central thread running through his companies \u2014 he wants Tesla to push us to a hyper-efficient, solar-powered future, and he wants SpaceX to get us to Mars, as a backup.What\u2019s interesting is that he thought he could convince Trump of the wisdom of his ideas. Musk was among many executives who\u2019d pleaded with the president not to ditch the Paris agreement. He did so at a heavy cost to his reputation \u2014 and he got nothing for it, apparently.The more cynical side of me wonders why push back on this rather than, say, the tepid and slow-moving response to the travel ban a few months back, which also disproportionately affected tech companies\u2019 work forces? Is it because they have more cover now since this decision was widely disliked? Or is it because they\u2019re realizing no amount of platitudes seem to get through to this president?And I suspect that history informed their moves here. The tech companies are rational and global in their outlook \u2014 they understand that their employees, many of their customers and essentially all of the governments they deal with around the world were going to oppose Trump\u2019s policies. So it made sense for them to push back hard. They had nothing to lose.Advertisement"}

Not too long ago, for much of San Francisco and its environs, the Dubs were a long-forgotten team based in Oakland; you would have seen more Lakers merch around the city than anyone bearing the blue-and-gold.It was only a couple of years ago, after the Warriors began winning, that the larger Bay Area began to recognize that it might have a place in the N.B.A. This year, with the talk of inevitability, Warriors fever became a Bay-wide epidemic. That Dubs logo was everywhere these last few weeks \u2014 on San Francisco office towers, on Teslas and Toyotas. It was nearly as ubiquitous as our other example of homegrown iconography: Apple billboards.But you know what? The Bay Area needed a good bandwagon. This place has always been a fragmented, far-flung metropolis, stretched across bridges, bay and ocean, where sensibilities shift in the blink of a neighborhood \u2014 Palo Alto could be in another country from The Castro, which in turn feels otherworldly in Piedmont, Fruitvale or Telegraph Avenue. Tech-fueled economic success has only exacerbated a larger sense of nowhereness. So many people here are now from somewhere else that the whole place can often feel a bit mercenary, a company town lacking any common bond.This year, the Dubs became that bond. It\u2019s not hard to see why: Their story touches the many parts of the Bay. The Warriors have deep roots and a loyal fan base in Oakland. That\u2019s been layered with newer Silicon Valley money, and an unusual, even countercultural way of playing that feels at home in this mecca for the outr\u00e9 and weird. Then, in the last year, as the Dubs went from underdogs to big dogs, there was another reason for local solidarity: It was us against a world rooting for our defeat.Maybe this is what New York feels like? It\u2019s not a bad feeling.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Hamilton Cline has lived in the Bay Area for seven years. And for seven years, he has been drawing portraits of people on BART.Mr. Cline, 35, teaches in the web design and new media department at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. On his commute between his home in Daly City and his job, he sketches his fellow residents.Asked if he remembered when he drew his first sketch, the artist didn\u2019t hesitate.\u201cProbably the first day,\u201d he said. \u201cBack then, I always had a sketchbook on me, and now I always draw on my phone.\u201dHe said he has filled \u201cbooks and books and books\u201d with such sketches.

He\u2019s particularly drawn to people who have a notable feature \u2014 and those who aren\u2019t moving much.He said that some of his more memorable times on BART come \u201cwhen the whole city unites around an event,\u201d be it Bay to Breakers, SantaCon or the latest Warriors game.\u201cI love seeing that happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes being a part of it.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Our Disgraceful Exit From the Paris Accord", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "Supported byEditorialOnly future generations will be able to calculate the full consequences of President Trump\u2019s incredibly shortsighted approach to climate change, since it is they who will suffer the rising seas and crippling droughts that scientists say are inevitable unless the world brings fossil fuel emissions to heel.But this much is clear now: Mr. Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 the latest of which was his decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change \u2014 have dismayed America\u2019s allies, defied the wishes of much of the American business community he pretends to help, threatened America\u2019s competitiveness as well as job growth in crucial industries and squandered what was left of America\u2019s claim to leadership on an issue of global importance.The only clear winners, and we\u2019ve looked hard to find them, are hard-core climate deniers like Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency and the presidential adviser Stephen Bannon, and various fossil fuel interests that have found in Mr. Trump another president (George W. Bush being the last) credulous enough to swallow the bogus argument that an agreement to fight climate change will destroy or at least inhibit the economy.Mr. Trump justified his decision by saying that the Paris agreement was a bad deal for the United States, buttressing his argument with a cornucopia of dystopian, dishonest and discredited data based on numbers from industry-friendly sources. Those numbers are nonsense, as is his argument that the agreement would force the country to make enormous economic sacrifices and cause a huge redistribution of jobs and economic resources to the rest of the world.In truth, the agreement does not require any country to do anything; after the failure of the 1997 Kyoto Accord, the United Nations, which oversees climate change negotiations, decided that it simply did not have the authority to force a legally binding agreement. Instead, negotiators in Paris aimed for, and miraculously achieved, a voluntary agreement, under which more than 190 countries offered aspirational emissions targets, pledged their best efforts to meet them and agreed to give periodic updates on how they were doing.Paris did not, in short, legally constrain Mr. Trump from doing the dumb things he wanted to do. Which he already has. In the last few months, and without consulting a single foreign leader, he has ordered rollbacks of every one of the policies on which President Barack Obama based his ambitious pledge to reduce America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 \u2014 most prominently, policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants, automobiles and oil and gas wells.But if withdrawing from the agreement will not make Mr. Trump\u2019s domestic policies any worse than they are, it is still a terrible decision that could have enormous consequences globally. In huge neon letters, it sends a clear message that this president knows nothing or cares little about the science underlying the stark warnings of environmental disruption. That he knows or cares little about the problems that disruption could bring, especially in poor countries. That he is unmindful that America, historically the world\u2019s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, has a special obligation to help the rest of the world address these issues. That he is oblivious to the further damage this will cause to his already tattered relationship with the European allies. That his malfeasance might now prompt other countries that signed the accord to withdraw from the agreement, or rethink their emissions pledges.Perhaps most astonishing of all, a chief executive who touts himself as a shrewd businessman, and who ran on a promise of jobs for the middle class and making America great again, seems blind to the damage this will do to America\u2019s own economic interests. The world\u2019s gradual transition from fossil fuels has opened up a huge global market, estimated to be $6 trillion by 2030, for renewable fuels like wind and solar, for electric cars, for advanced batteries and other technologies.America\u2019s private sector clearly understands this opportunity, which is why, in January, 630 businesses and investors \u2014 with names like DuPont, Hewlett Packard and Pacific Gas and Electric \u2014 signed an open letter to then-President-elect Trump and Congress, calling on them to continue supporting low-carbon policies, investment in a low-carbon economy and American participation in the Paris agreement. It is also why Elon Musk, chief executive of the electric vehicle maker Tesla, was resigning from two presidential advisory councils after Mr. Trump announced the withdrawal from Paris.Yet Mr. Trump clings to the same false narrative that congressional Republicans have been peddling for years and that Mr. Trump\u2019s minions, like Mr. Pruitt at the E.P.A. and Ryan Zinke at the Interior Department, are peddling now (Mr. Pruitt to the coal miners, Mr. Zinke to Alaskans) \u2014 that environmental regulations are job killers, that efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions will hurt the economy, that the way forward lies in fossil fuels, in digging still more coal and punching still more holes in the ground in the search for more oil.As alternative realities and fake facts go, that argument is something to behold. For one thing, it fails to account for the significant economic benefits of reducing greenhouse gases, avoiding damage to human health and the environment. And it ignores extensive research showing that reducing carbon emissions can in fact drive economic growth. Partly because of investments in cleaner fuels, partly because of revolutionary improvements in efficiency standards for appliances and buildings, carbon dioxide emissions in this country actually fell nearly 12 percent in the last decade, even as the overall economy kept growing. Under Mr. Obama\u2019s supposedly job-killing regulations, more than 11.3 million jobs were created, compared with two million-plus under Mr. Bush\u2019s antiregulatory regime.It\u2019s true that the coal industry is losing jobs, largely a result of competition from cheaper natural gas, but the renewable fuels industry is going gangbusters: Employment in the solar industry, for instance, is more than 10 times what it was a decade ago, 260,000 jobs as opposed to 24,000.Therein lies one ray of hope that the United States, whatever Mr. Trump does, will continue to do its part in controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Market forces all seem to be headed in the right direction. Technologies are improving. The business community is angry. A Gallup poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans are worried about climate change, and the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that almost 70 percent of Americans wanted to stay in the agreement, including half of Trump voters.And some states are moving aggressively, including New York. On Wednesday, the State Senate in California, always a leader in environmental matters, passed a bill that seeks to put California on a path to 100 percent renewable energy by midcentury. On the same day, Exxon Mobil stockholders won a crucial vote requiring the company to start accounting for the impact of climate change policies on its business.These messages might be lost on Mr. Trump. Hopefully, not on the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biggest, Strangest \u2018Batteries\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "Supported byWhat if you need a battery? A really big one \u2014 big enough to run a city?It\u2019s a question that inventors have been tackling for decades. No one wants the fridge, or the hospital, going on the blink when demand surges or the power plant needs repairs.It turns out to be a surprisingly tricky question to answer. Today, with the rise of green energy sources like solar and wind, the need for industrial-scale energy storage is becoming ever more vital to make sure there\u2019s power even after the sun sets or the breeze dies down.It\u2019s usually (but not always) still too impractical to string together enough traditional batteries \u2014 those powered by chemical reactions, like the ones in smoke alarms and Teslas \u2014 to do the job. Instead, with remarkable ingenuity, technicians have relied on a host of physical forces and states such as temperature, friction, gravity and inertia to keep energy locked up for later release.That\u2019s why in Wales a power company engineered a special lake on a mountaintop. And in Germany a utility pumps underground caverns full of compressed air. Here\u2019s how those and other systems \u2014 all in use today \u2014 work.________Back in the 1970s, a German utility wanted to build a flexible storage plant that could respond to sudden peaks in electricity demand, since its conventional plants \u2014 mainly coal \u2014 weren\u2019t designed to dial up or down quickly.It didn\u2019t have the hilly terrain needed for a hydroelectric plant, which can start operating much more quickly when demand surges. But here\u2019s what it did have: ancient, underground salt deposits.Borrowing a technique commonly used to store natural gas and oil deep underground, it piped water into the salt beds to dissolve the salt and create two caverns roughly a half-mile below the grassy fields in Huntorf. The plant, which opened in 1978, uses electricity from the grid, when it\u2019s cheap because demand is low, to compress and store air in the salt caves.Then, when electricity demand surges, a motor pushes the air to the surface and into a combustion system, where it burns natural gas that spins a turbine to produce electricity. Compressing the air allows it to deliver more oxygen to the turbines, making them more efficient.A similar plant opened in 1991 in McIntosh, Ala. Several energy companies, mainly in the United States and Europe, are exploring mining their salt deposits for storage as well.________Out in the desert of Tonopah, Nev., about 200 miles northwest of Las Vegas, an enormous spiral of mirrors surrounds a concrete tower roughly 55 stories tall. Topped with a 100-foot heat exchanger formed of tubes, it\u2019s not a relic of some mystical pagan rite, but the Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Facility.It is the world\u2019s first utility-scale concentrating solar power plant that uses extremely hot salt to extend the use of solar energy way past sundown.Rather than using solar panels to produce electricity, the plant has more than 10,300 billboard-size mirrors that focus the sun\u2019s heat on the heat exchanger, melting the salt into millions of gallons of 1,050-degree liquid that is stored until electricity is needed. The salt, which can stay liquid at higher temperatures than some other fluids like water, then flows through a steam-generating system that drives a turbine, producing enough electricity for 75,000 homes for as long as 10 hours past sundown \u2014 in essence, allowing the sun to shine at night.________On Kodiak Island in Alaska, the local electric cooperative got an unusual request from the shipping company that operates the port: Could it install an electric crane?The company wanted to replace its aging diesel-powered crane with a new, and faster, electric one. It would be able to service larger ships and higher container stacks, making the shipping operations more efficient.At first, the utility balked. The powerful crane would need to suck up tremendous amounts of electricity in short bursts. The local grid wasn\u2019t really set up to handle that.But after studying the proposal and potential solutions, it settled on the flywheel, which uses a rotor spinning in a vacuum to act as both a motor and a generator. Operating since 2015, the system uses grid electricity to accelerate the flywheels, which maintain their speed through inertia. When the crane lifts, the system converts the momentum of the rotors to electricity. And when the crane lowers, it recharges the flywheels, feeding power back to speed them up again.The installation also helps the electric company balance energy fluctuations on the grid from its wind turbines, which provide about a quarter of the island\u2019s electricity.________In the 1950s, Britain\u2019s need for electricity \u2014 and the facilities to store it \u2014 was rising. Energy officials had an idea: pumped hydro.In other words, you build two lakes, one on top of a hill, and one at the bottom. Off-peak electricity (read: cheaper) would pump water from low to high. Then, when the grid needed power, the upstairs pool would open, sending the water down through turbines to make electricity.Officials made plans to build these contraptions. But demand for electricity kept soaring, so they decided an enormous one was in order.After searching for the perfect location for two years, they settled on Elidir Mountain, on the edge of Snowdonia National Park in North Wales. Though the idea of putting a power plant in a wilderness area raised some hackles, the location was in many ways ideal. It had one lake, Marchlyn Mawr, near its peak, and another, Peris, at the bottom.It also happened to contain the guts of an abandoned slate quarry, making it easier to hide the Dinorwig Power Station inside. Still, it took 10 years of construction to complete, which included expanding both lakes and excavating huge caverns and miles of tunnels.Opened in 1984, it is among the world\u2019s largest plants of its kind and can generate enough energy to run all of Wales for six hours.But it isn\u2019t really used that way. Instead, it has become crucial in meeting a very British need: the sharp spike in electricity demand when popular television shows end \u2014 and millions of people simultaneously plug in their electric kettles to brew some tea.________Almost a decade ago, the founders of a small start-up based in Santa Barbara, Calif., set out to build a green approach to storing renewable energy that could mimic pumped hydro but without the water.Their solution? Load a string of rail cars with rocks and concrete and let gravity do the work.The company, Advanced Rail Energy Storage, proved that concept in Tehachapi, Calif., using electricity from a diesel generator to shuttle a roughly five-ton train up a steep hill. On cue, the train rolled back down, generating electricity from the turning wheels, a technology similar to the regenerative braking common in electric vehicles such as the Prius.The company recently won approval from the Bureau of Land Management for its first commercial-scale project in Pahrump, Nev., about 30 miles east of Death Valley. That installation, to include seven much heavier trains, is designed to reach full capacity within 15 seconds and to produce enough energy to run 14 average homes for a month.________As night falls over 1 Bryant Park, the gleaming office tower at 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas in New York City, employees shut down their computers, grab their cellphones and flood out of the building as the workday ends.But in the basement, the action is just getting started. Using cheaper overnight electricity from the grid, a large refrigerator chills water mixed with glycol (a component of antifreeze) below the freezing point. The system then pumps the mixture into roughly two miles of tubing coiled inside each of nearly four dozen 750-gallon tanks full of water. Hovering around 27 degrees, the glycol solution freezes the water, effectively storing energy in the form of ice.The next day, the glycol mix flows out of the coils and into a closed-loop air-conditioning system. Combining with water and air, it helps to chill the building\u2019s 2.35 million square feet for as many as 10 hours during the day \u2014 when power is typically pricier.Text by Diane Cardwell.

{"Headline": "Envisioning the Car of the Future as a Living Room on Wheels", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "Supported byWheelsSwiveling seats? Movies projected across the windshield? Social media feeds on the windows? As driverless car technology develops, companies, design institutes and researchers are asking the question: What does the car of the future look like on the inside?With companies like Google, Uber and others racing ahead to develop fully autonomous vehicles, the era of the driver hunched over the steering wheel may eventually give way to a living room on wheels. But with its long development lead times, designers are already thinking about how such technology will change the interiors of cars.\u201cWhen people are in an autonomous vehicle, their expectations will shift,\u201d said Hakan Kostepen, executive director for strategy and innovation at Panasonic\u2019s automotive systems unit, a major industry supplier. \u201cThey will want their personal space to become one of smart mobility, connecting them and relevant information to act upon.\u201dWhen cars are fully autonomous, how we sit, inform and entertain ourselves will be up for grabs. If steering wheels are no longer needed, how do we best configure seating positions? What should be done with the space now occupied by a dashboard, once a vehicle handles all driving tasks and even decides when it needs to be serviced?Those are all challenges being taken up by the automotive industry and the schools that supply them with the next generation of designers.At ArtCenter College of Design in Los Angeles \u2014 one of the world\u2019s premier automotive design schools \u2014 14 students recently worked on creating new concepts for a future vehicle interior whose occupants would no longer be shackled by the need to drive.Participants were picked from multiple disciplines, including product design, transportation and graphics. To fuel their discussions, specialists in the fields of sound composition, olfactory reaction and even animal behavior were brought in. Visual strategists from NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory paid a visit as well.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.The proposals, which were reviewed by executives from the carmaker BMW, the electronics firm Nvidia and IBM\u2019s Watson artificial intelligence division, varied wildly.In one concept, social media feeds were displayed on the windows and an all-glass roof, creating what is known as an augmented reality projection, providing contextual information on passing landmarks and approaching sights. As the vehicle drove by a restaurant, reviews of the eatery would be displayed and an online reservation form would appear on the building.Video games would be integrated into the passing environment. Players could fire \u201cweapons\u201d at buildings, and then, via a projection on the glass, see the structure go up in digital flames.Another group envisioned a vehicle\u2019s interior as a constantly changing environment, using variable lighting and temperatures to fit the evolving moods and desires of each occupant, as determined through a sensor analysis of physiological and emotional states.A third proposal contemplated the use of virtual reality and motion-sensing seats to give occupants the feeling of driving a sports car, even when they were simply riding in a tame autonomous vehicle.The concepts are not wholly pie in the sky \u2014 graduates of the ArtCenter have gone on to design vehicles like BMW\u2019s i3 electric car and Tesla\u2019s Model S \u2014 but nevertheless are a step beyond what is being developed by vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, who must take cost, brand reputation and consumer acceptance into account.Panasonic is one such company, and it is considering ideas like altering a vehicle\u2019s internal lighting depending on its occupants\u2019 moods or allowing a child passenger to initiate a search to find a nearby parking spot. Like students at the ArtCenter, Panasonic is also looking at using the windshield as an overlay for additional information or advertisements. The company declined to say how much it was spending on researching vehicle interiors, but said it was a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount.BMW is experimenting with keeping instruments at a low height. When necessary, the \u201cdriver\u201d or responsible party would interact with controls through a holographic projection that would appear to hover closer to eye level in space, meaning they would not need to take their eyes off the road while adjusting the temperature or changing radio stations.To confirm that a command was registered, the driver would receive haptic feedback transmitted in space, but while it would feel as if one were touching a button on an Android smartphone, the user would not physically be touching anything.When the vehicle is in fully autonomous mode, the windshield could be turned into a wide-screen display, allowing passengers to watch a movie; theater-like seats would vibrate in sync with sound effects.Speakers embedded in each seat would also include noise-cancellation technology to ensure that only the person watching could hear the soundtrack, music or phone call in progress. When the driver has to take control of the vehicle, rear-seat passengers could be entertained using a large screen lowered from the roof.In an autonomous vehicle, \u201cwe can push technology into the background and only make it present when it\u2019s needed,\u201d said Holger Hampf, BMW\u2019s head for user experience.One thing the carmaker does not envision: swiveling, rear-facing seats. \u201cWhen you reverse the seats you can induce motion sickness,\u201d Mr. Hampf said.Panasonic and BMW are far from the only companies developing the future of automobile interiors.Valeo, a France-based automotive supplier to General Motors and other companies, has 14,000 engineers working on future vehicle projects, drawing in employees from its visibility, comfort and driving, and thermal systems groups to reimagine interiors. It spent 1.6 billion euros, or $1.75 billion, on such research and development last year alone.The company wants to use light to alert and affect passengers \u2014 a glowing orange light on the right-hand side of the vehicle would point passengers to an oncoming danger, while a blue light would combine with air-conditioning to help make the interior feel cooler.Using artificial intelligence, a vehicle would learn its passengers\u2019 preferences in terms of language, climate and entertainment and then modify itself accordingly, said Guillaume Devauchelle, Valeo\u2019s vice president for group innovation and scientific development. The car could potentially even understand that a passenger had just been to the gym and adjust the cabin temperature accordingly.Similarly, Bosch, a major German automotive supplier, believes cars will eventually be shared rather than individually owned, and so the company is working on systems that will allow vehicles to automatically personalize themselves. An eye scan, fingerprint or smartphone connection will signal who is getting into the vehicle, so that it can adjust its climate, seating position, favored radio stations and other attributes automatically.One major question, however, is already being confronted: While much is doable, should it be done?\u201cOn paper, it seems great that I can read email on my car\u2019s window, but will we actually want it?\u201d Mr. Kostepen of Panasonic said. \u201cA car has to maintain its brand DNA even when it is fully autonomous.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can a Tech Start-Up Successfully Educate Children in the Developing World?", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "FeatureBridge International Academies \u2014 a chain of inexpensive private schools \u2014 has ambitious plans to revolutionize education for poor children. But can its for-profit model work in some of the most impoverished places on Earth?Supported byStepping inside the green-painted metal fencing, I ducked into one of two low, rectangular school buildings, which had been constructed from rough-hewed wood and sheets of bright green metal. From the hallway, one of Bridge\u2019s founders, Shannon May, urged me to look through the chicken-wire windows. The dim, spare, well-swept classrooms had uneven concrete floors and no electric lights. Inside, a third-grade teacher was reading from a computer tablet, reciting a lesson script that had been transmitted from the Bridge headquarters in central Nairobi, a 45-minute drive away. The instructor quietly spoke the lesson as he wrote on the chalkboard, explaining the math symbols that indicate \u2018\u2018greater than\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018less than.\u2019\u2019 Twenty-three third-grade students, all dressed in bright green Bridge uniforms, were doing their best to follow along. Because Bridge schools are standardized, May pointed out that the teachers were working from the same synchronized lesson guide that was being delivered in hundreds of Bridge\u2019s schools in Kenya, allowing the company to ensure that students everywhere were receiving a uniform curriculum.Bridge operates 405 schools in Kenya, educating children from preschool through eighth grade, for a fee of between $54 and $126 per year, depending on the location of the school. It was founded in 2007 by May and her husband, Jay Kimmelman, along with a friend, Phil Frei. From early on, the founders\u2019 plans for the world\u2019s poor were audacious. \u2018\u2018An aggressive start-up company that could figure out how to profitably deliver education at a high quality for less than $5 a month could radically disrupt the status quo in education for these 700 million children and ultimately create what could be a billion-dollar new global education company,\u2019\u2019 Kimmelman said in 2014. Just as titans in Silicon Valley were remaking communication and commerce, Bridge founders promised to revolutionize primary-school education. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the Tesla of education companies,\u2019\u2019 says Whitney Tilson, a Bridge investor and hedge-fund manager in New York who helped found Teach for America and is a vocal supporter of charter schools.The Bridge concept \u2014 low-cost private schools for the world\u2019s poorest children \u2014 has galvanized many of the Western investors and Silicon Valley moguls who learn about the project. Bill Gates, the Omidyar Network, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the World Bank have all invested in the company; Pearson, the multinational textbook-and-assessment company, has done so through a venture-capital fund. Tilson talked about the company to Bill Ackman, the hedge-fund manager of Pershing Square, which ultimately invested $5.8 million through its foundation. By early 2015, Bridge had secured more than $100 million, according to The Wall Street Journal.The fact that Bridge was a for-profit company gave pause to some NGOs that work in developing countries. But others reasoned that in the last decade, for-profit companies backed by what are called social-impact investors \u2014 people and institutions that make money by doing good \u2014 had successfully brought about important innovations, like solar-power initiatives and low-cost health clinics, in poor countries. Bridge\u2019s model relied on similar investors but was even more ambitious in its dreams of scale. \u2018\u2018There is a great demand for this,\u2019\u2019 May said in an M.I.T. video from 2016. Some of the company\u2019s backers, she said, were \u2018\u2018not social-impact investors,\u2019\u2019 continuing that \u2018\u2018it was straight commercial capital who saw, \u2018Wow, there are a couple billion people who don\u2019t have anyone selling them what they want.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 For a 2010 case study on the company, Kimmelman told the Harvard Business School that return on investment could be 20 percent annually.By 2015, Bridge was educating 100,000 students, and the founders claimed that they were providing a \u2018\u2018world-class education\u2019\u2019 at \u2018\u2018less than 30 percent\u2019\u2019 of what \u2018\u2018the average developing country spends per child on primary education.\u2019\u2019 This would represent a remarkable achievement. None of the founders had traditional teaching experience. May had been an unpaid teacher at a school in China; Kimmelman worked with teachers and administrators developing an ed-tech company. How had they pulled it off? In interviews and speeches, they credited cutting-edge education technology and business strategies \u2014 the company monitors and stores a wide range of data on subjects including teacher absenteeism, student payment history and academic achievement \u2014 along with their concern for the well-being of the world\u2019s poorest children. That potent mixture, they said, had allowed them to begin solving a complex and intractable problem: how to provide cheap, scalable, high-quality schooling for the most vulnerable, disadvantaged children on earth. Their achievement, they believed, could change the world \u2014 the subject line of a 2014 Bridge company email read, \u2018\u2018What do Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Jay Kimmelman and Shannon May have in common?\u2019\u2019 The next year, the venture capitalist Greg Mauro, who is a Bridge board member, told The Wall Street Journal that if all went as planned, the company would seek an initial public stock offering in 2017.By 2016, in addition to the hundreds of Bridge schools open in Kenya, 63 were up and running in Uganda and 23 in Nigeria. (They would later open four schools in India.) In March of that year, the Liberian government decided that Bridge might be the key to overhauling the nation\u2019s barely functioning education system, and officials there struck a deal with the company that handed over the operation of 50 primary schools, with the potential for letting them run many more in the future.At the same time, Bridge was facing difficulties in the countries where it had been teaching the longest. In Kenya, enrollment was growing more slowly than the founders anticipated. A teachers\u2019 union was mounting a vocal opposition. Some parts of the Kenyan government were cracking down, too. While Uber and Airbnb exploded in the gray areas in regulations that governed taxis and hotels, Bridge had trouble operating within the thicket of complicated, restrictive Kenyan education regulations. \u2018\u2018Technically, we\u2019re breaking the law,\u2019\u2019 May said in a 2013 article in TES, an education publication, \u2018\u2018but so are thousands of other schools who are operating like this.\u2019\u2019 In February 2017, a high court in the Kenyan county Busia upheld a decision to close 10 of 12 Bridge schools; Bridge appealed, and the schools remained open. In Uganda, a similar dynamic was at play. A few months earlier, the high court issued an order for Bridge schools to be closed because government inspectors said that children were being taught in substandard facilities and unsanitary conditions. Bridge successfully appealed, and the schools remain open.Rather than approaching profitability, the company was operating at a loss of $1 million a month. In March of this year, May went to London to provide testimony to Parliament as part of a series of hearings about the British government\u2019s international-development efforts in education, including $4.4 million of British government funding for Bridge that had allowed them to expand to Nigeria. In April, the committee chairman issued an open letter to Britain\u2019s secretary of state for international development saying no further investments should be made until there has been \u2018\u2018clear, independent evidence that the schools produce positive learning outcomes for pupils\u2019\u2019 and that there were \u2018\u2018serious questions about Bridge\u2019s relationships with governments, transparency and sustainability.\u2019\u2019 Those questions were echoes, perhaps, of the same question that Bridge skeptics had asked from the beginning: Even if its big dream made sense in theory, could it actually work amid the complicated political forces and brutal poverty of the nations whose children were most in need?May and Kimmelman married, and in 2007 they went on an extended honeymoon in Africa, where they met up with Frei, Kimmelman\u2019s former roommate, who previously worked at the Bay Area design and consulting firm IDEO and was working for an agricultural nonprofit in Malawi. Together the three of them came up with a plan, which eventually evolved into an idea for a vast chain of replicable schools, their growth powered by small tuition payments from working parents \u2014 fruit sellers, night watchmen and washerwomen. They\u2019d keep costs affordable by training instructors (many of them uncertified) to deliver a scripted curriculum and by using inexpensive building materials in the construction of their schools.The upfront costs of developing Bridge\u2019s software and data-collection system were daunting. Acquiring land was costly, too. Raising enough money early on was vital. \u2018\u2018Jay\u2019s success as an ed-tech entrepreneur opened doors\u2019\u2019 in Silicon Valley, says Frei, who left the company in 2013. According to an unpublished 2014 Stanford Graduate School of Business case study that Bridge provided, profitability would depend on achieving scale very quickly. By 2016, they planned to enroll more than 750,000 students, at which point they would be breaking even. By 2022, they estimated that they would educate 4.1 million students and generate $470 million in revenue.The company\u2019s pitch was tailor-made for the new generation of tech-industry philanthropists, who are impatient to solve the world\u2019s problems and who see unleashing the free market as the best way to create enduring social change. Investors were impressed by Kimmelman and the audacity of their plan. The idea of doing \u2018\u2018high quality at low cost was really interesting,\u2019\u2019 says Kevin Starr, managing director of the Mulago Foundation, which eventually provided Bridge with $1 million in grant money and introduced a handful of tech moguls to Bridge. \u2018\u2018We knew he had a track record as an entrepreneur. He could execute.\u2019\u2019The founders decided to build their headquarters in Nairobi, and they opened their first school there in 2009. Long known as the Green City in the Sun, Kenya\u2019s capital had begun to reimagine itself as the tech capital of East Africa; newly formed telecommunications companies were placing cheap mobile phones in the hands of millions of farmers, merchants and low-wage workers, and mobile banking quickly followed. The public-education system, though, was not keeping pace. In 2003, the Kenyan government officially abolished fees for public primary education but afterward found itself unable to construct enough schools for the poor children who tried to enroll. Public schools, which receive money from the government for teachers\u2019 salaries and building maintenance, still charge parents small amounts to cover costs like classroom supplies and firewood. The schools\u2019 quality varies, but in some, reading materials, textbooks and even chalk can be in short supply. All public-school teachers are certified. Teacher absenteeism is widespread. According to a 2007 World Bank report, 30 percent of teachers in one region in Kenya fail to show up on any given school day. Learning levels for children are low: 70 percent of third graders cannot do second-grade work. And while some catch up, many don\u2019t.Wealthy Kenyans and foreigners send their children to private schools, which are taught in English and enjoy lavish resources. The working poor often opt to send their children to parochial or local private schools, known as informal schools, that take no money from the government but charge fees that are slightly higher than public schools\u2019. Some provide a basic education, but many do not. Sixteen percent of Kenya\u2019s poor school-age children do not attend any school because their parents can\u2019t afford even the smallest school payments. All Kenyan schools are required to teach the precisely prescribed national curriculum, which is taught in Kiswahili and English and mastery of which is measured by an eighth-grade test called the K.C.P.E. Obtaining a high grade on the K.C.P.E., which is seen as a sign of a child\u2019s industriousness, intelligence and moral rectitude, means a student may continue on to high school.For many who did enroll, Bridge\u2019s strict payment system quickly became onerous. Bridge\u2019s business in Kenya depends on most parents making routine electronic payments by mobile phone. But slum-dwelling parents in Kenya are mostly occasional workers who rarely have a predictable income. In informal settlements around Nairobi, I visited 10 or so parents in their homes who explained the fragile finances of their lives. A sick child, an uptick in the price of corn meal or even a prolonged rainstorm can throw a family on the margins into an economic crisis. In most informal and public schools, payment terms are flexible, and the subject of protracted negotiation. Bridge says that it works with families to meet their needs. But many people told me that the school sends children home if fees are not paid.\u2018\u2018They tell you, \u2018Sit at home with your child until you get the money,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 says one parent, a vegetable seller married to an unemployed welder who has two children enrolled at a Bridge school in Nairobi\u2019s Mathare slum. Another mother with a 9-year-old child says she found it difficult to make Bridge payments: \u2018\u2018At times I\u2019ve gone without eating so I can pay school fees.\u2019\u2019Bridge executives say their schools depend on paying customers. \u2018\u2018We get criticized for being bloodless capitalists,\u2019\u2019 Michael Conway, Bridge\u2019s East Africa director of operations, told me when I met him in Nairobi last September, \u2018\u2018but we know families make choices about who gets paid first. We don\u2019t want to be the last vendor paid. If we become that, then our financial model would be difficult to sustain.\u2019\u2019Bridge does not comment on the details of its financial performance, so neither May nor Kimmelman would say how many of Bridge\u2019s Kenyan schools maintain enough enrollment to sustain their model. May says that Bridge currently has 80,000 students enrolled, down 10,000 from last year. \u2018\u2018Before the campaign to attack Bridge began, the academies across Kenya were financially sustainable,\u2019\u2019 she says. Conway acknowledged that the situation on the ground made things complicated. \u2018\u2018It is difficult to keep up enrollment and make the schools break even,\u2019\u2019 Conway said, \u2018\u2018because the churn is so high.\u2019\u2019 He explained that in 2017, thousands of enrolled children were not paid up.Some education experts say that Bridge\u2019s plans for an international chain of low-fee, for-profit private schools rests on a flawed assumption. While such schools can work well for the relatively small number of families in poor communities who have salaries, says Keith Lewin, a professor emeritus of development and international education at the University of Sussex in Britain who has opposed the model, it is unrealistic to expect the most impoverished families to be able to pay. \u2018\u2018People who engage in a discourse around making a vast number of the poorest people in Africa pay $6 every month for school tuition are people who have no idea what the lives of people living at or below the poverty line are actually like.\u2019\u2019After some uncertainty over whether to use \u2018\u2018this\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018that,\u2019\u2019 the children began to dutifully respond. \u2018\u2018This is a FEEEESH.\u2019\u2019Nyambara pressed on, repeating the call-and-response five more times. \u2018\u2018This is a FEESH. Now class?\u2019\u2019 Snap. \u2018\u2018This is a FEESH,\u2019\u2019 responded the children, their voices moving from uncertainty to singsong, pleased to be catching on.The curriculum transmitted into classrooms is one of the company\u2019s main selling points to investors, many of whom see the establishment of a standard curriculum delivered through technology as a solution to struggling schools. In 2013 the company began hiring United States charter-school teachers in Cambridge, Mass., to write Bridge lessons that were then loaded onto the e-reader in East African classrooms each day.The challenge for the American writers was to meet the curriculum set by the Kenyan government while also trying to improve the outcomes. \u2018\u2018We found that teachers in Kenya were used to lecturing at the front of the classroom, and children were passive \u2014 they weren\u2019t asking or even formulating questions,\u2019\u2019 says Michael Goldstein, a charter-school founder who worked as chief academic officer at Bridge from 2013 to 2016. \u2018\u2018So in our lesson scripts, we tried to get away from long periods of teachers talking. In a typical Bridge lesson, the teacher reads the explanation for about 10 minutes, he cold-calls a student to check for understanding, he gets students to talk among themselves or work in groups for 20 minutes as the teacher moved between desks. What we are going for is active classrooms \u2014 and this is something really different for the children we serve.\u2019\u2019 During 2016, Bridge\u2019s curriculum team pushed to learn from their results so far, poring over 10,000 photographs of lesson books in Kenya to see evidence of what teaching techniques are working best.The e-reader all but guarantees that every instructor, despite his or her education or preparation level, has a lesson script ready for every class \u2014 an important tool in regions where teachers have few resources. But scripts can be confining, some teachers told me. And in some of the 20 or so Bridge classrooms I observed, pupils occasionally asked questions, but Bridge instructors ignored them. Teachers say that they are required to read the day\u2019s script as written or risk a reprimand or eventual termination, and they do not have time to entertain questions. Bridge says that \u2018\u2018teachers are required to reference the day\u2019s teachers\u2019 guide and to diligently work to ensure all material is covered in each lesson.\u2019\u2019 Still, an alert teacher at the head of a class is its own victory. Although I saw a range of public-school classrooms, in one, the teacher was sound asleep, head on desk, in front of a classroom of 60 fidgeting fourth graders.Bridge has writers in Nairobi who create the lessons that are in Kiswahili, but many lessons, to be delivered in English, are written in America. And it is challenging to develop lesson plans for teachers and children from a different culture. Misunderstandings can occur. Geordie Brackin, the company\u2019s energetic director of innovation, guided me to a Bridge classroom where students were using flashcards and told me that when he goes to government schools he \u2018\u2018doesn\u2019t see flashcards, and our teachers don\u2019t report using flashcards.\u2019\u2019Brackin\u2019s observation, though, was greeted with embarrassed smiles at local public and private schools a short walk away. \u2018\u2018Of course, people who are trained teachers, we know about flashcards,\u2019\u2019 said Lilian Odhiambo, who runs a small private school in the Mathare slum. She steered me by the elbow into a classroom where a string hung with paper rectangles bisected the room. I watched as students reviewed English vocabulary words by looking up at one side of the rectangles, responding to them aloud, then stepping under the string to check their answer on the other side of the card. \u2018\u2018We are a poor school, and paper is expensive,\u2019\u2019 Odhiambo explained. \u2018\u2018In this way, we make flashcards work for all the children, not just one.\u2019\u2019After eight years of operation, the impact of the Bridge curriculum on learning is uncertain. In 2015, Bridge publicly issued a working paper titled \u2018\u2018The Bridge Effect,\u2019\u2019 its most recent evaluation. The study tracked 2,737 kindergarten, first- and second-grade students for the 2013-14 school year: one set enrolled in Bridge, and another, similar set of students enrolled at local public schools. The students were assessed at the beginning and end of the school year. There was a 43 percent increase in the number of Bridge kindergarten students who reached the \u2018\u2018emergent\u2019\u2019 benchmark in English and a 40 percent increase in learning subtraction in math, compared with 22 percent and 15 percent increases for their public-school counterparts. The percentage increase of Bridge students who reached the \u2018\u2018fluent\u2019\u2019 benchmark in English was high \u2014 among Bridge first graders it was 40 percent, compared with a 17 percent increase among first graders in public schools. Increases in the percentage of students who reached the \u2018\u2018fluent\u2019\u2019 benchmark in addition and subtraction were smaller. The percentage increase of second graders who scored \u2018\u2018fluent\u2019\u2019 in math skills was actually the same or higher in public schools than at Bridge.I asked two experts in statistics \u2014 Nat Malkus, from the American Enterprise Institute, and Bryan Graham, from the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 to help me evaluate the findings. \u201cThis is good evidence of positive effects,\u201d says Malkus. Both pointed out that the study\u2019s results are complicated by Bridge\u2019s high dropout rate: While a third of public-school students dropped out, nearly half of Bridge students left during the study and were unable to take the final assessment. \u2018\u2018The high attrition rate should give one pause,\u2019\u2019 Malkus says, \u2018\u2018when considering the full effect of the program.\u2019\u2019 Graham, co-editor of The Review of Economics and Statistics, says that \u2018\u2018organizations are under a lot of pressure to do these studies and \u2018prove\u2019 their program works. Reasonable and informed people could look at the information in that report and come to widely different conclusions about the effect of Bridge on academic achievement as they measure it. It\u2019s information, just not especially actionable information.\u201dAnother area of achievement that Bridge trumpets is the success of its students on the eighth-grade K.C.P.E. test. In 2015, according to Bridge, 63 percent of Bridge students who had been there for at least two years passed, compared with 49 percent of Kenyan students nationwide. But it\u2019s unclear whether Bridge\u2019s approach will be sustainable as the company grows. Former Bridge employees told me that in preparation for the 2015 exam, those on track to get a lower score were asked to repeat a year. The rest were taken to a residential cram school and prepped for the test by teachers who flew in from the United States.The Bridge founders, Weinstein wrote, decided that every school opening thereafter would as soon as possible feature a ceremony and that every new student would be given a free month of school. Kirchgasler, who studied Bridge for his dissertation, pointed out that this often ended up putting parents in what could become a difficult situation. If a family found that they couldn\u2019t make payments, say, in the middle of the term, it was often difficult to transfer a child to a new school. \u2018\u2018Among the families I studied, moving a child to a new school was a gamble,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Public and informal schools were reluctant to take students back if their new school didn\u2019t work out\u2019\u2019 \u2014 potentially leaving a child out of school and making it difficult for a parent to work.A former Bridge employee told me that the company\u2019s own marketing could sometimes create bad feelings among the people they wanted to serve. \u2018\u2018Many times, they would open a school and invite a local official to a grand-opening ceremony, and the local official took offense,\u2019\u2019 the former employee, who asked that her name not be used, says. The local officials \u2018\u2018wanted to be engaged.\u2019\u2019 Another former employee told me that the free tuition was confusing to many of the poorest parents. \u2018\u2018I believe the word \u2018international,\u2019 combined with foreign founders, led parents to expect higher quality than in other schools,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018I believe they did become disillusioned. I believe many of them became disempowered when they wanted changes in their schools \u2014 like electricity, permanent structures \u2014 but that didn\u2019t happen. They definitely missed the connectedness and mutually beneficial relationships that they would find in other schools.\u2019\u2019Similar concerns were voiced by Salima Namusobya, executive director of the Initiative for Social and Economic Rights, a civil rights group in Kampala, Uganda, that, along with the union there, has campaigned against Bridge and other private-school operators. Far from educating poor children, she says, Bridge uses aggressive marketing to enroll children who are already in public schools. \u2018\u2018The fact that they have the word \u2018international\u2019 in the school name, they think they\u2019re getting an international curriculum.\u2019\u2019May flatly rejects the notion that Bridge\u2019s marketing could be misunderstood. \u2018\u2018We try very hard to communicate clearly and transparently and if we knew about anything that led to confusion, we\u2019d want to correct that,\u2019\u2019 she says.In 2015, teachers\u2019 unions stepped up their agitation against Bridge. The company, May says, was the victim of a smear campaign mounted by the union, and the company has faced hurdles because some government officials run their own schools. \u2018\u2018They see Bridge as a threat,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018They want to maintain the status quo.\u2019\u2019While I was in Kenya, May introduced me to a group of parents who told me that they thought the school was providing their children with the best start in life. Livingston Kagasi, a lanky day laborer who donned a suit, a pressed shirt and a tie for the group interview, said that the local public school was an unappealing option for his son Rivival. Kagasi said that leaving a child in a dirty classroom with 80 others and a teacher who may show up late, or not at all, feels like \u2018\u2018dumping your child\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018not preparing them for life.\u2019\u2019 Not long before, Kagasi\u2019s wife got a job as a clerk in the government that came with a steady salary and transferred their son to Bridge. Elizabeth Mumo, another parent, told me she had high hopes for her two sons, Joshua and Samuel, who attend the Bridge school. In her tidy two-room cinder-block home, Mumo explained to me that when she wakes up in the morning, she offers a prayer of thanksgiving that God has allowed her husband, a livery-car conductor, to make enough money to pay for the cooking gas she needs to make the morning tea. She told me that sometimes money is tight but that she wants her children to go to Bridge. She likes the fact that the teachers and students speak in English. She pointed out that a handful of Bridge students have gone to private schools in the United States \u2014 an almost-unimaginable break for a slum-dweller, and a success story that Bridge markets to Kenyan parents. Mumo imagines her oldest son going to a university: \u2018\u2018I can see Oxford.\u2019\u2019Early on, the company found it difficult to retain instructors. The Stanford case study cited high teacher turnover in 2010. Bridge began requiring instructors to sign a two-year contract; if they broke it, they had to pay back the cost of their training. Teacher turnover slowed.Bridge teachers are discouraged from talking to the press, and their contracts remind them that they may not speak on behalf of Bridge, but some agreed to talk to me provided they were not identified. A few said they were grateful for the job and happy to have a lesson script. Others expressed frustration about hoped-for bonuses that they never were able to achieve. Teachers can receive extra money if they maintain enrollment of at least 25 pupils per class. A middle-aged teacher who provides science instruction at a Bridge school told me she was encouraged to go to the market and try to enroll the children of the fruit sellers when her teaching day was done. But it was hard to recruit new students.All the teachers I spoke to appreciated the regular paycheck. But they chafed at how they were managed, often by unseen bosses communicating with them via text or robocall. Some Bridge staff members described what they saw as a stark contrast between their hopes for Bridge and a grittier reality. One school administrator, an academy manager, described how the pressure to ensure that parents made their payments on time was disheartening. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t realize how hard it would be to talk to parents,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re ill, they\u2019re out of work, they had a fire. No one is in the house who\u2019s making any money. How can they pay when they have no money for food?\u2019\u2019 And working at Bridge, teachers said, can disrupt a career: Instructors are required to sign an employment agreement that includes a noncompete clause that prevents them from working at other nearby schools for a year after they leave.In the public and informal Kenyan schools I visited, school administrators welcomed my impromptu drop-ins warmly, showed me their classrooms and introduced me to their teachers, who spoke frankly about their challenges. Bridge teachers and managers say that sort of openness is not allowed. At some Bridge schools I visited unescorted, staff members said that they would need to contact superiors if I didn\u2019t leave.One of these schools was Bridge Diamond in Mukuru, a slum of 600,000, just east of central Nairobi. The schoolyard fence was made of patched, bent gray metal and barbed wire. The school building itself was shabby and neglected. In the schoolyard, about 30 feet away from where children enter their classrooms, was a deep trench of fetid garbage and rotting bags of feces; when residents can\u2019t use the communal latrines they use \u2018\u2018flying toilets\u2019\u2019 \u2014 defecating in a plastic bag and throwing it as far as they can. The chicken-wire windows were rusted and ripped. Some classrooms were empty. One had 15 students sitting at desks but no teacher.Staff members at Diamond were eager to show the poor conditions in their school but also urged me to leave quickly. Last summer, a University of Alberta doctoral candidate, Curtis Riep, was gathering enrollment information in Uganda for an international organization of teachers\u2019 unions, which later put out a report on the number of children enrolled in Bridge in that country and the number of untrained teachers at the head of Bridge\u2019s classrooms. He made unescorted visits to three of its schools near Kampala. The acad\u00ademy managers contacted company executives, and Riep was arrested by the Ugandan police, though the charges, criminal trespass and falsely identifying himself, were quickly dropped. Riep calls it \u2018\u2018pure intimidation.\u2019\u2019 May says Bridge acted responsibly because a stranger was at the school.Liberia\u2019s education system, ravaged by civil war and then Ebola, was crumbling. Nevertheless, the government\u2019s move faced resistance from those who bridled at the idea of a foreign company running Liberia\u2019s schools. \u2018\u2018An Africa First!\u2019\u2019 read one headline from Mail & Guardian Africa, a pan-African digital publication headquartered in Johannesburg. \u2018\u2018Liberia Outsources Entire Education System to a Private American Firm. Why All Should Pay Attention.\u2019\u2019 After the outcry, the minister of education, George Werner, allowed seven other school operators to run schools in Liberia as well and reduced the number that Bridge managed to 25. A team of independent economists was hired to study the different models and advise Werner. Theoretically, the operators that showed solid teacher and pupil attendance and learning gains would be given contracts for more schools. But Bridge was impatient with that plan. Earlier this year, during heated meetings with Bridge funders and Werner, the funders asked the education minister to allow the company to run up to 250 more schools the following year. \u2018\u2018We built a machine for scale,\u2019\u2019 says Kevin Starr, the managing director of the Mulago Foundation, who sat in on some of those meetings. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s going to have to operate at idle.\u2019\u2019Since entering into the agreement, Bridge has moved formidable resources into Liberia. Justin Sandefur, an economist at the Center for Global Development in Washington and principal investigator in the Liberian schools study, told me recently that he worried that \u2018\u2018there was no longer a governance firewall between the interests of a commercial company and the Ministry of Education, which is supposed to be advocating on what is best for Liberian children.\u2019\u2019 In April, Sandefur, along with seven others, published an open letter cautioning the Liberian government against rapid scaling and to consider a financially sustainable model. In June, Werner gave Bridge the go-ahead to operate dozens of new schools.The new model of working with governments may allow the company to continue to expand, but it\u2019s still an open question whether it can realize its dream of Silicon Valley-style growth, given the messy realities that are part of life in the poorest parts of the world. Greg Mauro, the Bridge board member, says that an I.P.O. is still two to four years away. May says the company may consider selling learning materials. They\u2019ve been collecting data on schoolchildren and their families and might partner with microfinancing institutions to help Bridge parents get loans, as well as working as an intermediary for health-insurance plans. \u2018\u2018While we are very focused on education, it\u2019s hard to say where it might go,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018We are looking for opportunities to help our families.\u2019\u2019An article on July 2 about Bridge Internation-al Academies, a chain of international schools, referred incorrectly to a comment that Shan-non May, a founder of the chain, made about notifying the police about unescorted visits to Bridge schools. She said Bridge staff members acted responsibly in contacting the police; she was not referring to her own actions.An article on July 2 about Bridge International Academies, a chain of international schools, described incorrectly the relationship between it and the Mulago Foundation. The founda-tion has funded Bridge. It is not an investor.Peg Tyre is a journalist and the author of the books \u2018\u2018The Good School\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018The Trouble With Boys.\u2019\u2019This article was written with the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "16 Years Later, Bush\u2019s Climate Pact Exit Holds Lessons for Trump", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "Supported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 The new president decided that the international climate change agreement negotiated by his predecessor was a job killer that sacrificed American sovereignty. So he pulled the United States out while much of the world jeered.Mr. Bush did none of those things, and his advisers rued that he did not, concluding that he paid the price for the rest of his presidency. Whether any of that makes a difference for Mr. Trump remains to be seen. Even with a more elaborate, inclusive process and an expressed willingness to consider alternatives, he does not seem to be winning over many of his opponents.Pressed repeatedly on that question on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said: \u201cThe president has indicated that the climate changes. It\u2019s always changing. I\u2019ve indicated the same.\u201d But he did not say whether Mr. Trump believed that human activity contributed to that, or whether it should be curbed as a result.On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d another adviser, Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations, gave a fuller answer to the same question.\u201cPresident Trump believes the climate is changing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he believes pollutants are part of that equation.\u201d She added: \u201cHe knows that the U.S. has to be responsible with it, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Just because we got out of a club doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t care about the environment.\u201dNone of Mr. Trump\u2019s other actions since taking office, including a move to cancel power plant regulations drafted by the Obama administration, suggest an interest in tackling climate change, even through different means, however. Advocates of the Paris accord who got a chance to make their case to the White House seemed no more assuaged: Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, promptly quit White House advisory councils after Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.Arguing that new restrictions would impose an undue burden on the energy industry, he drafted a letter to Congress renouncing both Kyoto and the carbon cap. Mr. Bush agreed to sign it without first consulting his secretary of state, national security adviser or E.P.A. administrator.In announcing his decision to exit the Paris accord, President Trump scorned the Green Climate Fund. Does the United States contribute an outsize share?By the time he made it the few blocks to the West Wing, it was too late. Mr. Cheney had left to hand-deliver the letter to Capitol Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d Ms. Rice told Mr. Powell.Mr. Powell snapped at the president. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see the consequences of it,\u201d he said.Mr. Bush\u2019s rejection of Kyoto in some ways did not really alter American policy, since even Mr. Clinton had not submitted the treaty to the Senate for ratification, mindful of a 95-to-0 vote in the Senate for a nonbinding resolution opposing an agreement like it.Mr. Bush resisted the most expansive proposals to fight climate change for the rest of his presidency, and government scientists felt muzzled during his administration. But he invested tens of billions of dollars in developing alternative fuels and clean energy technology, and he convened summit meetings of leaders from major economic powers to collaborate on reducing emissions.Still, Mr. Bush and his aides eventually concluded that the way he backed out of Kyoto was a mistake \u2014 too defiant and negative without offering an alternative. \u201cWhile he was right on Kyoto, we were just wrong on the way we did it,\u201d Stephen J. Hadley, then Ms. Rice\u2019s deputy and later her successor, said years later. \u201cWe lived with that one; that is really where this \u2018Bush unilateralism\u2019 starts from.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Those people have all the fun! They seem to know exactly what\u2019s going to happen in whatever market they\u2019re investing in and have this aura of self-assurance that is really annoying. It\u2019s enough to cause even the most rational, non-hip among us to doubt our boring, old-style investing.In fact, I remember feeling a bit this way back in 1999. I was surrounded by tech people with their BlackBerries and Hotmail accounts. I resisted the siren call of the Nasdaq and the technology bubble \u2014 until I finally gave in. Then, I took some hard-earned money out of a boring diversified investment and bought Infospace.Remember that? If you do, it may not be pleasant. In fact, I can\u2019t remember the exact details because they\u2019re too painful, but I know I invested a lot of money (for me) back then. When I sold, I didn\u2019t have enough to pay for a burrito and a Coke. I even considered buying more on \u201cthe dip.\u201d Except I didn\u2019t have any more money to invest, and this wasn\u2019t a dip. The stock never recovered to anything close to what I had paid to buy it. Today, I still have the stock certificate as a reminder of that valuable lesson.So, Shawn, the moral of the story is that your friend just might be right. But then again, he might be flat-out wrong.What he is talking about is speculation at best, and it\u2019s probably closer to gambling. If you have some spare money and you feel like gambling, fire away.But here\u2019s an alternative idea. Keep your low-cost, boring, diversified investments, and have a T-shirt made (black, with white text) that says: \u201cI own Bitcoin.

{"Headline": "G.M. Wants to Drive the Future of Cars That Drive Themselves", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 The chief executive of General Motors, an automaker synonymous with Detroit, saw the future of driving not in the Motor City but on the streets of San Francisco.Mary T. Barra, a G.M. lifer who had worked her way from engineer to the top, was in the back seat of a prototype self-driving electric car as it wound its way through the city\u2019s downtown a year ago.She wanted to see for herself whether automation was ready to take over from a driver \u2014 safely, and on a mass scale. How would it react, for example, when it reached an intersection as a light turned yellow?Driving in a situation like that, \u201cyou have to make a decision,\u201d she recalled in a recent interview. \u201cGenerally if you decide to go, you decide to speed up. Or you stop.\u201d If the technology works, she said, it will make the right decision: \u201cThe car knows.\u201dAfter that drive, Ms. Barra made her own decision to speed up, convinced that such cars were worth betting the company on. Within six months after what she called her \u201caha! moment\u201d in San Francisco, a fleet of self-driving Chevrolet Bolts, the company\u2019s new electric car, was being built at a G.M. assembly plant in Michigan, the pace accelerated at the direction of Ms. Barra and her senior management team.It was a first for any major car company, and the first leg of a race she is determined to win. The question now is whether a company identified with the industry\u2019s bygone glory days can be a trendsetter in 21st-century transportation \u2014 and beat out Silicon Valley rivals like Google, Tesla and Uber with no legacy business to encumber them.\u201cThe auto industry is on the cusp of significant change, and G.M. has to prove that a longtime established player can be up to the task,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst with the car-shopping site Autotrader, who has followed the company since the 1980s. \u201cIf you look at their past performance, their record has been spotty at best.\u201dGeneral Motors is making a big wager that it can succeed, shedding overseas operations while investing $600 million this year in self-driving cars and other advanced technologies. It spent $1 billion on Cruise Automation, a Silicon Valley start-up that developed the driverless technology powering Ms. Barra\u2019s ride in San Francisco.But G.M. is making a case that it can be a leader in the auto industry of both today and tomorrow. \u201cWe are very, very serious and intent on putting something on the road,\u201d Ms. Barra said of the company\u2019s automated vehicles. \u201cWe definitely want to be first.\u201dIn shaping its future, G.M. is betting on products that have yet to gain a foothold in the marketplace and could take years to develop fully.The company is also fending off a campaign by a dissident investor to create two classes of stock, aimed at increasing G.M.\u2019s value to shareholders. One class would pay a steady dividend, while the other would appreciate based on the company\u2019s growth. The fight will culminate on Tuesday at the annual shareholder meeting.In a letter to investors last week, the hedge fund that floated the dual-class proposal, Greenlight Capital, called G.M.\u2019s board \u2014 including Ms. Barra, its chairwoman \u2014 \u201cuninspired\u201d for opposing its proposal. \u201cAfter seven years of a flat stock price, how much longer must shareholders wait?\u201d the letter said.While she agrees the company is undervalued, Ms. Barra insists that G.M.\u2019s performance will ultimately pay off in better returns. \u201cDoes it frustrate me?\u201d she said of the stock price. \u201cYes, but I want to do the right things over the long term to improve the business.\u201dIn beginning to assemble fully automated Bolts in January, G.M. was a step ahead of Google and Uber, which are converting mass-market minivans and sedans into driverless models. It went beyond what Tesla has achieved with autonomous controls on its own models. And it reflected the feverish competition underway.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.\u201cWe don\u2019t go in to compete,\u201d Ms. Barra said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go in to have an entry. With every new product we\u2019re doing, we are going in to win.\u201dFor Ms. Barra, 55, who took the helm at G.M. in 2014 as the first female chief executive of a major automaker, it is the latest chapter in the company\u2019s long comeback.Under Ms. Barra, the company weathered that crisis and is moving to become leaner and stronger. It is selling off its money-losing European division and unwinding its operations in other international markets like Australia, India and Russia. It has cut unprofitable sales of vehicles to rental fleets and reduced shifts and workers at some American factories that make slow-selling cars.\u201cG.M. used to constantly talk about where we were going to spend more money,\u201d said Mark L. Reuss, the company\u2019s executive vice president for product development. \u201cWhat we were doing was robbing our good businesses to fix the broken ones.\u201dAs G.M. streamlines operations in the United States and elsewhere, it is redirecting energy and capital to its self-driving initiative.\u201cI do believe General Motors is a tech company,\u201d Ms. Barra said. \u201cWe put these products on the road that integrate 30,000 parts and have hundreds of millions of lines of code in them already. And we have to make them durable and work in all environments.\u201dIts commitment is on display at a sprawling plant in Orion Township, Mich., about a 45-minute drive northwest of Detroit, where the company builds conventional subcompact cars as well as Bolts.One area of the factory is dedicated to a small-scale assembly line where workers customize Bolts with self-driving equipment, including a large computer in the trunk and modules packed with sensors on the roof and fenders.\u201cWe\u2019re on the cutting edge here,\u201d said Bill Rock, a 22-year G.M. veteran who works on the autonomous vehicle line. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated process, but it\u2019s the direction the company needs to go.\u201dG.M. has built about 140 autonomous Bolts to be used for testing in Arizona, California and Michigan by Cruise Automation, now a subsidiary. Kyle Vogt, a founder of Cruise, said G.M. had given its engineers a distinct advantage by building a state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle, rather than retrofitting a conventional car.\u201cThese vehicles coming off the assembly line have been built from the ground up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real car, and not a mash-up of off-the-shelf parts that need to be integrated into the system.\u201dMs. Barra\u2019s view of what G.M. can accomplish was forged in her years as one of its first female plant managers. And she believes G.M. can lead the self-driving revolution without additional acquisitions or partners. \u201cWe have everything we need,\u201d she said.Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a business professor at Yale and a leadership expert who has known most of Ms. Barra\u2019s predecessors dating back decades, is convinced of her resolve. \u201cMary is the right person at the right time, and she does it without an ounce of showmanship,\u201d he said.Ms. Barra methodically directed the company to fix the defective parts, revamp its safety procedures, compensate accident victims and their families and negotiate settlements and fines with regulators and the Justice Department.She says the episode informed her approach to self-driving cars, which she believes herald a new era of road safety, and left her impatient for results. And she says she is determined for G.M. to lead the technological revolution changing the industry.\u201cIf anyone can,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t we be the ones to do it?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Electronic Setups of Driverless Cars Vulnerable to Hackers", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byBitsAny part of a car that talks to the outside world is a potential opportunity for hackers.That includes the car\u2019s entertainment and navigation systems, preloaded music and mapping apps, tire-pressure sensors, even older entry points like a CD drive. It also includes technologies that are still in the works, like computer vision systems and technology that will allow vehicles to communicate with one another.It will be five to 10 years \u2014 or even more \u2014 before a truly driverless car, without a steering wheel, hits the market. In the meantime, digital automobile security experts will have to solve problems that the cybersecurity industry still has not quite figured out.\u201cThere\u2019s still time for manufacturers to start paying attention, but we need the conversation around security to happen now,\u201d said Marc Rogers, the principal security researcher at the cybersecurity firm CloudFlare.Their primary challenge will be preventing hackers from getting into the heart of the car\u2019s crucial computing system, called a CAN (or computer area network).And the challenge of securing driverless cars only gets messier as automakers figure out how to design an autonomous car that can safely communicate with other vehicles through so-called V2V, or vehicle-to-vehicle, communication.It\u2019s not just V2V communications that security experts are concerned about. Some engineers have imagined a future of vehicle-to-infrastructure communications that would allow police officers to automatically enforce safe driving speeds in construction zones, near schools or around accidents.Given the yearslong lag time from car design to production, security researchers are also concerned about the shelf life of software deeply embedded in a car, which may no longer be supported, or patched, by the time the car makes it out of the lot.And automakers stitch together software from dozens of different suppliers, all of them with different shelf lives and patch cycles. If automakers have any chance of keeping cars secure, figuring out a secure way to roll out patches to every car remotely, for different software components, will be a problem that even the software industry itself has not totally figured out.\u201cThe problem is when people buy a car, they think \u2018Oh, I\u2019m buying a Toyota,\u2019 but what they\u2019re really buying is parts from 100 different suppliers all cobbled together,\u201d said Nidhi Kalra, a senior information scientist at the RAND Corporation. \u201cCybersecurity cannot be applied on top of everything else. It needs to be based in the design of the vehicle and embedded throughout the entire supply chain.\u201dLast year, the Department of Transportation announced a 15-point safety standard for the design and development of driverless cars, which included mention of digital security. But the guidelines were intentionally vague and only required that \u201cThe vehicles should be engineered with safeguards to prevent online attacks.\u201dDiscussions are ongoing about which government body \u2014 the Federal Trade Commission, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or another body \u2014 will ultimately govern the cybersecurity of connected and autonomous cars.For now, a number of private organizations are hosting discussions among automakers, identifying and cataloging common security threats.But, as with any technology, Mr. Rogers said, \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to shut people out forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "Supported byOpinionBEIJING \u2014 What worries you about the coming world of artificial intelligence?Too often the answer to this question resembles the plot of a sci-fi thriller. People worry that developments in A.I. will bring about the \u201csingularity\u201d \u2014 that point in history when A.I. surpasses human intelligence, leading to an unimaginable revolution in human affairs. Or they wonder whether instead of our controlling artificial intelligence, it will control us, turning us, in effect, into cyborgs.These are interesting issues to contemplate, but they are not pressing. They concern situations that may not arise for hundreds of years, if ever. At the moment, there is no known path from our best A.I. tools (like the Google computer program that recently beat the world\u2019s best player of the game of Go) to \u201cgeneral\u201d A.I. \u2014 self-aware computer programs that can engage in common-sense reasoning, attain knowledge in multiple domains, feel, express and understand emotions and so on.This doesn\u2019t mean we have nothing to worry about. On the contrary, the A.I. products that now exist are improving faster than most people realize and promise to radically transform our world, not always for the better. They are only tools, not a competing form of intelligence. But they will reshape what work means and how wealth is created, leading to unprecedented economic inequalities and even altering the global balance of power.It is imperative that we turn our attention to these imminent challenges.What is artificial intelligence today? Roughly speaking, it\u2019s technology that takes in huge amounts of information from a specific domain (say, loan repayment histories) and uses it to make a decision in a specific case (whether to give an individual a loan) in the service of a specified goal (maximizing profits for the lender). Think of a spreadsheet on steroids, trained on big data. These tools can outperform human beings at a given task.This kind of A.I. is spreading to thousands of domains (not just loans), and as it does, it will eliminate many jobs. Bank tellers, customer service representatives, telemarketers, stock and bond traders, even paralegals and radiologists will gradually be replaced by such software. Over time this technology will come to control semiautonomous and autonomous hardware like self-driving cars and robots, displacing factory workers, construction workers, drivers, delivery workers and many others.Unlike the Industrial Revolution and the computer revolution, the A.I. revolution is not taking certain jobs (artisans, personal assistants who use paper and typewriters) and replacing them with other jobs (assembly-line workers, personal assistants conversant with computers). Instead, it is poised to bring about a wide-scale decimation of jobs \u2014 mostly lower-paying jobs, but some higher-paying ones, too.This transformation will result in enormous profits for the companies that develop A.I., as well as for the companies that adopt it. Imagine how much money a company like Uber would make if it used only robot drivers. Imagine the profits if Apple could manufacture its products without human labor. Imagine the gains to a loan company that could issue 30 million loans a year with virtually no human involvement. (As it happens, my venture capital firm has invested in just such a loan company.)We are thus facing two developments that do not sit easily together: enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands and enormous numbers of people out of work. What is to be done?Part of the answer will involve educating or retraining people in tasks A.I. tools aren\u2019t good at. Artificial intelligence is poorly suited for jobs involving creativity, planning and \u201ccross-domain\u201d thinking \u2014 for example, the work of a trial lawyer. But these skills are typically required by high-paying jobs that may be hard to retrain displaced workers to do. More promising are lower-paying jobs involving the \u201cpeople skills\u201d that A.I. lacks: social workers, bartenders, concierges \u2014 professions requiring nuanced human interaction. But here, too, there is a problem: How many bartenders does a society really need?The solution to the problem of mass unemployment, I suspect, will involve \u201cservice jobs of love.\u201d These are jobs that A.I. cannot do, that society needs and that give people a sense of purpose. Examples include accompanying an older person to visit a doctor, mentoring at an orphanage and serving as a sponsor at Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 or, potentially soon, Virtual Reality Anonymous (for those addicted to their parallel lives in computer-generated simulations). The volunteer service jobs of today, in other words, may turn into the real jobs of the future.Other volunteer jobs may be higher-paying and professional, such as compassionate medical service providers who serve as the \u201chuman interface\u201d for A.I. programs that diagnose cancer. In all cases, people will be able to choose to work fewer hours than they do now.Who will pay for these jobs? Here is where the enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands comes in. It strikes me as unavoidable that large chunks of the money created by A.I. will have to be transferred to those whose jobs have been displaced. This seems feasible only through Keynesian policies of increased government spending, presumably raised through taxation on wealthy companies.As for what form that social welfare would take, I would argue for a conditional universal basic income: welfare offered to those who have a financial need, on the condition they either show an effort to receive training that would make them employable or commit to a certain number of hours of \u201cservice of love\u201d voluntarism.To fund this, tax rates will have to be high. The government will not only have to subsidize most people\u2019s lives and work; it will also have to compensate for the loss of individual tax revenue previously collected from employed individuals.This leads to the final and perhaps most consequential challenge of A.I. The Keynesian approach I have sketched out may be feasible in the United States and China, which will have enough successful A.I. businesses to fund welfare initiatives via taxes. But what about other countries?They face two insurmountable problems. First, most of the money being made from artificial intelligence will go to the United States and China. A.I. is an industry in which strength begets strength: The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the more data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you can attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product. It\u2019s a virtuous circle, and the United States and China have already amassed the talent, market share and data to set it in motion.For example, the Chinese speech-recognition company iFlytek and several Chinese face-recognition companies such as Megvii and SenseTime have become industry leaders, as measured by market capitalization. The United States is spearheading the development of autonomous vehicles, led by companies like Google, Tesla and Uber. As for the consumer internet market, seven American or Chinese companies \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 are making extensive use of A.I. and expanding operations to other countries, essentially owning those A.I. markets. It seems American businesses will dominate in developed markets and some developing markets, while Chinese companies will win in most developing markets.The other challenge for many countries that are not China or the United States is that their populations are increasing, especially in the developing world. While a large, growing population can be an economic asset (as in China and India in recent decades), in the age of A.I. it will be an economic liability because it will comprise mostly displaced workers, not productive ones.So if most countries will not be able to tax ultra-profitable A.I. companies to subsidize their workers, what options will they have? I foresee only one: Unless they wish to plunge their people into poverty, they will be forced to negotiate with whichever country supplies most of their A.I. software \u2014 China or the United States \u2014 to essentially become that country\u2019s economic dependent, taking in welfare subsidies in exchange for letting the \u201cparent\u201d nation\u2019s A.I. companies continue to profit from the dependent country\u2019s users. Such economic arrangements would reshape today\u2019s geopolitical alliances.One way or another, we are going to have to start thinking about how to minimize the looming A.I.-fueled gap between the haves and the have-nots, both within and between nations.

{"Headline": "Tech Titans Make Pilgrimage to White House to Discuss Government Systems", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cGovernment needs to catch up with the technology revolution,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who strolled in at the end of the meeting to greet the tech titans. \u201cWe\u2019re going to change that with the help of great American businesses like the people assembled.\u201dHe later said, drawing laughter, \u201cWe have approximately $3.5 trillion of market value in this room \u2014 but that\u2019s almost the exact number that we\u2019ve created since my election.\u201dThe event was organized by Jared Kushner, special adviser to the president and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and Chris Liddell, the White House director of strategic initiatives and former chief financial officer of Microsoft. Mr. Kushner\u2019s Office of American Innovation brought together the executives for 10 workshops on topics such as cybersecurity, analytics and using technology to better connect people to government services.Mr. Kushner opened the event in the White House Indian Peace Treaty room by emphasizing the potential of the companies to improve the government\u2019s outdated and inefficient technology systems.\u201cTogether we will unleash the creativity of the private sector to provide citizen services in a way that has never happened before,\u201d he said.The opportunity for Silicon Valley is enormous. The federal government spends $80 billion a year on information technology, much of it used to maintain outdated technology such as data systems that are decades old and storage that includes floppy disks used at the Defense Department. Federal agencies maintain 6,100 data centers that could be consolidated and moved to the cloud.The meeting occurred as tech company stocks roared back after declining in the last two weeks, pushing the stock market to records on Monday. Apple and Alphabet, the parent of Google, were among the top gainers after three consecutive sessions of declines.Mr. Musk did not attend the meeting Monday. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, was invited but declined because of a scheduling conflict, the company said.\u201cThis is a double-edged sword for the tech C.E.O.s because they don\u2019t want to be window dressing and used for photo ops,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor and associate dean at the Yale School of Management. \u201cBut on the other side, this is the most business-friendly administration since Eisenhower and is much more open than any administration to influence on the spot.\u201dAdministration officials said that the chief executives had done their homework and were engaged in the workshops and discussions.\u201cI don\u2019t think there was any one big suggestion,\u201d Mr. Liddell said in an interview. \u201cBut there was a large number of small suggestions, all of which are interesting for us to follow up.\u201dSeveral tech executives had a chance to address Mr. Trump in a round-table discussion at the end of the day.Mr. Bezos encouraged the president to use commercial technology whenever possible. Amazon\u2019s booming cloud services business has become a contractor to the government. The Amazon founder also emphasized the need to retrain workers and said it was \u201cimpossible to overstate\u201d the importance of artificial intelligence.Peter Thiel, an early Trump supporter and tech investor, praised the president.\u201cYour administration is doing very well,\u201d he said.Two people who were briefed on the tech meeting later said Mr. Trump also voiced support for \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration reform, a term that was used during the Obama administration to generally describe a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States.The president made the promise, the two people said, after being told by Mr. Cook that tech employees may worry they are being targeted amid confusion over the administration\u2019s immigration policy. It was unclear exactly what the president meant, or if he was using the term to mean something else. White House press aides did not respond to a request for comment on Monday night, and a spokesman for Apple declined to comment.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from Washington, Vindu Goel from San Francisco, and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delphi, the Auto Parts Supplier, Embarks on a High-Tech Overhaul", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byBitsTROY, Mich. \u2014 As automakers rush to catch up to Silicon Valley in the race to create the superintelligent, self-driving cars of the future, one old-line parts manufacturer is hoping to win by switching sides.Delphi Automotive has a corporate background that is as greasy and grimy as the steering gears it once produced.It began as the parts arm of General Motors, and years ago operated dozens of unionized plants that churned out the type of mechanical auto components that put venture capitalists to sleep: air-conditioners, brakes, heaters and radios.Its complicated corporate history includes years of downsizing and a long, messy reorganization in bankruptcy court.Cars produced today include dozens of computer chips along with cameras, radar, millions of lines of software and wireless communications links. Future vehicles will have all that and more, said Kevin P. Clark, Delphi\u2019s chief executive.Delphi, he added, hopes to be the supplier of networking components \u2014 like wiring, software and intelligent connectors \u2014 that link all those complex systems and enable them to work together under the hood.\u201cIt\u2019s the intelligent architecture that allows all the advanced safety systems, all the autonomous driving software, all the infotainment software to operate effectively,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Cisco \u201cis a pretty good analogy for us,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner who tracks the development of connected and self-driving cars, said Delphi is attempting the most extensive transformation by an old-line automotive company that he has run across. \u201cThey are the standard-bearer for this,\u201d he said.Its success is by no means assured. Technology shifts quickly, and the company has far more experience in the slower-paced, low-risk approach of the traditional auto industry, where innovations are engineered and tested for years before they are introduced. And Delphi\u2019s investments in start-ups may not pan out.Delphi hopes to create a new business that can gather vast amounts of data from vehicles \u2014 about how and where they go, how they\u2019re driven and how they\u2019re running. The company then envisions selling insights drawn from the data trove to automakers, insurance companies and possibly even advertisers.A driver who frequently drives to Starbucks locations, for example, could be targeted with Starbucks coupons via email or text. Someone whose data shows a pattern of gentle driving could be offered lower insurance rates, said David Ploucha, the president and co-founder of Control-Tec, a start-up Delphi acquired for $124 million as part of this data business strategy.It\u2019s a business model unlike anything the auto industry has ever seen. It\u2019s similar to what Google does by targeting ads to users based on terms they have searched, or how Facebook tailors ads and news posts based on what a member has \u201cliked\u201d on the social networking site.\u201cThe idea is to influence how people spend money in relation to their vehicle,\u201d Mr. Ploucha said.Mr. Clark said he was convinced such data services will evolve into a multibillion-dollar industry, though it may be years before this vision is confirmed.The boldness of Delphi\u2019s plan underscores how dramatic technological changes are loosening the dominant role traditional carmakers have in the auto industry, while opening opportunities for new players.Already, Tesla has jumped ahead in battery-powered cars, and in distributing software updates to its cars over the air, the same way iPhones receive new operating systems. Both Tesla and Google are ahead of many, if not most, automakers in self-driving technology. Uber, the ride-hailing company, is trying to press ahead in autonomous cars, too.Danny Shapiro, a senior executive at Nvidia, a chip maker that provides some of the powerful processors used by Tesla, Audi and many other automakers, said he would not be surprised to see some reordering of the auto industry in the next five to 10 years. \u201cI do believe there will be a rise and fall for some players,\u201d he said.Tesla, thanks to its rising stock, recently passed both Ford and G.M. in terms of market value.Mr. Clark, the Delphi chief executive, hopes his company will be one of the rising stars. For most of the last 20 years, it has been in a slow decline. Delphi was created to take over all the parts businesses G.M. no longer wanted in-house.It was spun off as a stand-alone company in 1999. Six years later, it filed for bankruptcy, slammed by high labor costs and the razor-thin margins of making low-tech commodity parts.Its Chapter 11 reorganization lasted four years, and resulted in plant closings and the elimination of tens of thousands of factory jobs. The company\u2019s steering systems business was sold to a Chinese investor. The remaining company kept operations in automotive electronics and engine technologies such as fuel injectors and diesel components.Over the last few years, as autonomous driving technology began developing rapidly, Mr. Clark saw an opportunity to take Delphi in a new direction.To preserve Control-Tec\u2019s freewheeling start-up culture, Delphi is allowing it to operate largely as an independent company. That includes one lounge where its engineers build Lego cars and occasionally play board games, and another where they share homemade beers.\u201cThe worst thing we could do is stifle the creativity, the energy they have,\u201d Mr. Clark said.This year, Delphi went further, acquiring a start-up with technology for wirelessly transferring data and software to and from vehicles, and investing $15 million in another Israeli company, Otonomo, which specializes in organizing masses of data into forms that automakers and others will pay for. These two investments, along with Control-Tec, make up the foundation of the data business Mr. Clark thinks Delphi can create.Then in May, Mr. Clark announced a final break with the traditional automotive industry. Delphi\u2019s powertrain business, which makes fuel injectors and diesel technology, will be spun off as a separate company by the first quarter of next year.The split will leave behind a new high-tech Delphi, known inside the company for now as \u201cRemain Co.\u201d \u201cHow we get there from here, we\u2019re all doing a lot to figure that out,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated when Delphi will spin off its powertrain business into a separate company. It will be by the first quarter of next year, not the end of this year.Advertisement"}
