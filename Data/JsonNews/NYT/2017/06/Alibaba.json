{"Headline": "U.S. Seeks to Keep Closer Tabs on Chinese Money in America", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byWhen President Trump talked tough about China\u2019s economic impact on America during the campaign, he criticized its trade policies and its approach to its currency.Yet one of the first pieces of legislation under the Trump administration that could have a major impact on the economic relationship between the two countries centers on something different: Chinese deal making in the United States.White House officials and a group of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are pushing for new laws intended in part to keep closer tabs on the surge of Chinese money into America. Some in Washington say that money could help China expand its technological and military abilities. While any legislation would face congressional debate and review, a large number of Trump administration employees who deal with both trade and national security have said they support some sort of overhaul of how the United States vets such deals.The push would expand the powers of a little-known but important panel \u2014 the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius \u2014 that can effectively block foreign deals for American companies on national security grounds. In particular, it could reshape the ways American technology companies, big and small, raise money from Chinese investors.\u201cWe\u2019ll try to enable Cfius to take a tougher line against certain investments emanating from those nations that pose a clear threat to our national security, focused particularly in the area of advanced technology,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, who said last week that he would propose the legislation.The Trump administration has not staked out a formal stance, but trade experts are watching how the committee treats a pair of pending deals as a test of the political winds. The first is a $1.2 billion bid by Ant Financial \u2014 the electronic payments affiliate of the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant \u2014 for a remittances company based in Dallas called MoneyGram. The second is a $1.3 billion offer by a China-backed buyout fund for Lattice Semiconductor, which makes a range of advanced communications and telecommunication chips.Chinese buyers are pouring more and more money into the United States. In 2016, Chinese investment in America jumped threefold to $46 billion from the year before, according to the research firm Rhodium Group. Chinese purchases in recent years have included buildings and movie theater chains.But some deals have been in potentially sensitive areas, like semiconductors, which Cfius has increasingly blocked. A growing number have also been among start-ups working on cutting-edge technology, but they are difficult to track and are often too small to be reviewed by Cfius.Critics also argue that Beijing and companies supported by the government have sought to form joint ventures or license technology, neither of which Cfius currently reviews.\u201cThere is a perception that different financial structures are being used to avoid potential Cfius oversight,\u201d said Andrew Shapiro, a founder of the advisory firm Beacon Global Strategies and former assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs. \u201cSo they will try to close those loopholes.\u201dOver the past two years, Cfius (pronounced sih-fee-us) has broken up a number of major Chinese bids for semiconductor companies, leading to Chinese complaints.It is unclear how China\u2019s government would respond to the revamped regulator, but the move would most likely stoke some tensions. At a recent news conference, Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said, \u201cThere should not be undue political dimensions imposed on commercial takeovers, let alone political intervention.\u201dXiaohe Cheng, an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin University in Beijing, added that some of Cfius\u2019s recent decisions were \u201cdiscriminative towards Chinese companies.\u201dYet foreign businesses often complain of an unfair operating environment in China, and increasingly American officials have begun seeking what they call reciprocity, or bringing American limits on Chinese investment closer to China\u2019s limits on American investment there. Beijing forbids foreign investors from acquiring meaningful stakes in companies in a number of industries, including the media, internet and telecommunications.Such an initiative in the United States would have far wider economic implications and is likely to be dealt with separately from the coming legislation on Cfius.Recently, several Trump administration officials, including Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, have also expressed support for expanding the committee.\u201cHis staff is well versed on the issues, and he clearly sees the need for updating Cfius,\u201d said Paul S. Triolo, the head of practice on technology policy for the Eurasia Group, an advisory firm.\u201cHe appears to be leading the charge on this with the administration,\u201d he added.Cfius includes members of a number of American agencies, including the Departments of Defense, State, Justice, Treasury and Homeland Security, and industry and policy analysts are watching closely to see how the committee acts under the Trump presidency.Ant Financial, the Alibaba affiliate, outbid a company based in Kansas called Euronet Worldwide to acquire MoneyGram. Some lawmakers, led by representatives from Kansas and Texas, where MoneyGram is based, have said an Ant purchase would expose the personal financial details of American users.Douglas Feagin, Ant Financial\u2019s head of international operations, said in an interview that the company intended to allow MoneyGram to continue to operate on its own and that the data it had would continue to be stored in the United States on a network separate from Ant\u2019s networks.\u201cThe test cases will be things like the Alibaba deal,\u201d said Adam Segal, an expert on emerging technologies at the Council on Foreign Relations.While industry and policy analysts say it could be difficult to argue that MoneyGram is important to national security, the potential deal for Lattice Semiconductor offers a more straightforward argument.The Pentagon report released this year cites the bid for Lattice from a venture capital firm called Canyon Bridge as an example of a tactic used to skirt government oversight. The purpose of creating Canyon Bridge, a private equity fund with links to China, was to obscure the source of capital to \u201cenhance the possibility\u201d that the transaction would be approved by Cfius, the report said.Canyon Bridge has said that there was never any intention to obscure the source of the fund\u2019s capital, as shown by meetings it had with Cfius before the deal was signed.The coming debate about Cfius is likely to be undergirded by concerns about reciprocity.\u201cThere\u2019s this question about letting a Chinese company do something in the U.S. that China wouldn\u2019t let a U.S. company do in China,\u201d said James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\u201cThat\u2019s what people say in private,\u201d he added. \u201cThat it\u2019s not a two-way street, that it\u2019s not fair and that we need to do something about it.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo Investors Don\u2019t Think Tax Reform Is Coming Anytime Soon", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe full market value of Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba stake is around $54 billion, while the Yahoo Japan holding is worth $9 billion. So investors seem to be factoring in a 35 percent tax hit. That exactly matches the rate currently in force, not Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred figure or even the 25 percent that has been put forward by House Republicans. The implication is that shareholders are attaching a very low probability, and perhaps also a long wait, to any meaningful reduction in America\u2019s corporate tax rate.Looked at another way, those who believe Mr. Trump will achieve significant tax reform in the near term should perhaps fill their boots with Yahoo stock. After all, if the tax rate were slashed to 15 percent, that would in theory increase the after-tax value of the two big overseas stakes by over $12 billion, by Breakingviews\u2019 math. That would potentially push the company\u2019s shares up nearly a quarter from their closing price on Friday.

{"Headline": "Apple Customer Data in China Was Sold Illegally, Police Say", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byTo Apple\u2019s mounting problems in China, add official scrutiny over privacy.The Chinese police said this week that they had arrested 22 people suspected of selling the personal data of an unspecified number of Apple customers. The police, in Cangnan County in the eastern province of Zhejiang, said the thieves had reaped 50 million renminbi, or about $7.3 million, over an unspecified period.Many of the details were unclear, including the identities of those involved and the severity of the breach.In a statement on Wednesday, the Cangnan police said they found that Apple employees had illegally acquired personal data, then later in the same statement said 20 of the 22 people worked for companies that sell Apple products or are Apple contractors. The police did not disclose information about the other two people. In China, Apple\u2019s products are sold broadly, in electronics chain stores and small booths in shopping malls in addition to the company\u2019s official Apple Stores.The Cangnan police also said the data included the names, Apple identification numbers and phone numbers of Apple users. They did not say whether passwords or financial information like credit card numbers were involved, which would suggest the thieves had access to internal Apple data and would make the breach more serious.The arrests are part of a set of broader difficulties in China for Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif. Sales of iPhones, still a sign of middle-class aspiration in China, have slowed, according to analysts, as the public waits for new models and as Chinese manufacturers of cheaper phones step up their quality and marketing.Still, Apple may simply be caught up in a wider rising of concern over privacy in China.Between widespread malware campaigns and a large number of new internet users, China has become a playground for internet fraudsters. Last year, China tried 361 criminal cases involving violation of personal data, up from 176 in 2015, said Xie Yongjiang, associate director for the Institute of Internet Governance and Law at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.\u201cIt is very common. Every one of us can feel it,\u201d Mr. Xie said. \u201cFor example, after your child is born at a hospital, someone will phone you and ask if you need baby products. When your child turns 3, someone will phone you and ask if your child would go to their nursery school. When your child reaches primary school age, someone will phone you to ask if you need training services.\u201d\u201cYou have no idea who exposed your personal data,\u201d he added.The problem is not new.

{"Headline": "Dissecting Marissa Mayer\u2019s $900,000-a-Week Yahoo Paycheck", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "Supported byIt will also conclude the remarkable five-year run of Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who was paid nearly a quarter of a billion dollars \u2014 a generous sum even by Silicon Valley\u2019s lofty standards \u2014 while presiding over the company\u2019s continued decline.The company ended up so weakened that its board had little choice but to sell.\u201cEveryone acknowledges that it was a difficult situation to come into,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research who has studied Yahoo for years. \u201cBut the company was not run well under her tenure.\u201dSo why did Ms. Mayer receive more than $900,000 a week? The answer, like so many things about Yahoo, is surprisingly complicated. It is rooted partly in the never-lose structure of modern executive compensation packages, but also in two farsighted investments made long ago by one of Yahoo\u2019s founders, Jerry Yang.Ms. Mayer\u2019s pay was mostly in stock and stock options, and she reaped the rewards alongside the other stockholders.\u201cThe only sign you can point to when evaluating a company over a long period of time is how shareholders have done in the exchange,\u201d said David Wise, who heads North American sales at Korn Ferry Hay Group, a firm that advises companies on executive pay packages. \u201cOver the last five years, Yahoo shareholders couldn\u2019t have done a lot better than this.\u201dMore than most chief executives, Ms. Mayer was working for those shareholders.She was essentially hired by one hedge-fund manager, Daniel S. Loeb, who got her predecessor fired and won three seats on Yahoo\u2019s board in 2012. Mr. Loeb was particularly interested in finding a way to unlock the value of Yahoo\u2019s stake in Alibaba, which was already shaping up to be one of China\u2019s leading internet companies. He pushed the board to recruit a star like Ms. Mayer to get people excited about a company that had been stumbling for years.When Ms. Mayer\u2019s early efforts to turn around Yahoo\u2019s business and spin off the Alibaba shares failed to bear fruit, another hedge fund manager, Jeffrey C. Smith of Starboard Value, led a campaign to push for her ouster. Mr. Smith eventually garnered four board seats so he could keep the pressure on.Yahoo declined to comment for this article, citing this coming Thursday\u2019s shareholder vote to approve the Verizon deal. Ms. Mayer and the board chairman, Maynard Webb, who approved her pay packages, also declined interview requests. So did Mr. Smith.\u201cShe was an attractive, high-visibility C.E.O. trying to bring some excitement and glamour to Yahoo,\u201d said Martha Josephson, a senior partner at the recruiting firm Egon Zehnder, who helped Ms. Mayer find several of her top executives. \u201cAs hard as the job was, she didn\u2019t get a break. If she were an ugly man, she\u2019d be a hero.\u201dOn July 16, 2012, the day she was hired, Yahoo\u2019s share price was $15.65. On Friday, it closed at $50.60. The stock\u2019s performance has topped other venerable tech companies like Microsoft, Oracle and Cisco Systems, and matched the gains of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Yahoo\u2019s most direct competitor.As Yahoo shareholders profited, so did Ms. Mayer. By the time the deal closes, she will have made about $239 million, based on Friday\u2019s share price, according to calculations by Equilar, a provider of executive compensation data.To lure Ms. Mayer from Google and compensate her for options she forfeited there, Yahoo\u2019s board offered her a lucrative employment agreement. She initially received restricted stock worth $35 million and stock options worth $21 million, based on 2012 stock prices for Yahoo, along with a cash salary and bonus. Although she gave up a portion of those stock grants after failing to meet performance targets, the rise in Yahoo\u2019s share price more than offset the losses. She received further stock grants in later years, adding to her overall compensation.Yet most of Ms. Mayer\u2019s paycheck ultimately came from the gains in Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba and Yahoo Japan investments, over which she had little control. Thanks to an investment made in 2005, Yahoo had a 24 percent stake in Alibaba, which today is China\u2019s leading e-commerce company.When Alibaba first sold shares to the public in 2014, Yahoo sold 140 million shares in the offering. It hung on to 384 million shares, which are now worth about $48 billion.Yahoo also owns about 36 percent of Yahoo Japan, now worth about $9 billion, that it received as part of a deal struck in 1996, shortly after Yahoo was founded.The surging value of those investments \u2014 not any brilliant business moves by Ms. Mayer \u2014 is why Yahoo\u2019s shares went up. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone coming into an oil company, and all of a sudden oil prices go up and the stock goes up,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, the director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cWas the return based on what she did?\u201dStill, managing those investments was a key reason that Yahoo\u2019s board hired Ms. Mayer. Mr. Loeb had accused Yahoo\u2019s previous leaders of mishandling both their core business and the Alibaba relationship. When he and two allies gained seats on the board in 2012, they wanted a new chief executive who would fix both problems.Ms. Mayer delegated the Alibaba issue, hiring an experienced dealmaker, Jacqueline Reses, to be the company\u2019s principal liaison to Alibaba and its leaders, Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai. Ms. Reses helped the Chinese company navigate its initial public offering. She also renegotiated an agreement, struck just before Ms. Mayer arrived, that would have forced Yahoo to sell an additional 122 million shares in the offering. Those extra shares are now worth $15 billion.Ms. Mayer, meanwhile, focused on turning around Yahoo\u2019s internet business. It had missed the mobile revolution and was experiencing steady declines in its display and search advertising. There, her record is decidedly mixed.Yahoo had no real strategy for reaching customers on mobile devices when she arrived \u2014 a sure route to obsolescence as smartphones became the principal internet device for most people.Through a combination of acquisitions and hiring, she vastly expanded Yahoo\u2019s mobile team, which initially produced some buzzy hits like the Yahoo Weather app and Yahoo News Digest, along with more prosaic updates of core Yahoo features like fantasy sports and email. Yet Ms. Mayer largely failed in her quest to make Yahoo a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for more users in online video, search and messaging.Yahoo did acquire advertising technology and built a new ad system from scratch, but marketers never embraced it.Yahoo\u2019s board recognized Ms. Mayer\u2019s failure to meet business targets and docked her bonuses and stock awards in four of the five years she was in charge. But under terms of her original employment agreement, it also granted her new shares annually, easing the sting.Given those missteps, was Ms. Mayer overpaid?\u201cFor the existing amount of compensation, could Yahoo shareholders have done better?\u201d Mr. Wieser of Pivotal Research said. \u201cOr for the same outcome, could they have paid less? Ultimately it\u2019s a hard question to answer.\u201dPeter Monaco, who was a vice president for engineering at Yahoo for three years before leaving for Facebook last September, said Ms. Mayer does not get enough credit for transforming Yahoo\u2019s culture. \u201cShe eliminated the dead wood, drove out the politics, put in place compensation policies that rewarded high achievers and energized people to create great products again,\u201d he said.Arguably, Yahoo was unfixable. The company\u2019s DNA and technology were built around its original identity as a web portal \u2014 a powerful position in the early 2000s but increasingly outmoded in the mobile era, as apps and phone platforms like iOS and Android became the gateways to the internet.\u201cGiven the hand she was dealt, I doubt anyone could have done a better job transforming the culture and making Yahoo healthy again,\u201d Mr. Monaco said.Unlike Kilimanjaro, though, the Yahoo challenge proved insurmountable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.E.C. Lets All Firms Keep Parts of I.P.O. Filings Secret", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byIn an attempt to revitalize the public capital markets, the nation\u2019s top regulator of stocks is turning to stealth mode.The Securities and Exchange Commission, in Walter J. Clayton\u2019s first major policy move as chairman, is expanding a program that will allow all private companies to keep some details of their finances and business strategies under wraps early in the process of an initial public offering.Currently, only smaller companies are allowed to confidentially file draft registration statements for review by the agency before offerings. Some well-known companies, like Snap, Twitter and the burger chain Shake Shack have been able to do so, but the threshold of annual gross revenue of $1 billion has barred others.Filing confidentiality is intended to make it easier for companies that want to go public. It allows companies to iron out any wrinkles in their financial reporting with the regulator privately. And they do not have to worry about competitors getting an early peek at their figures.Yet some market specialists say confidential filing has had little impact and question why markets regulators are emphasizing secrecy over openness.Since the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Start-Ups) Act was enacted, some 1,350 confidential filings have been submitted, as of March 31, the Securities and Exchange Commission said.The Nasdaq stock market, which competes with the New York Stock Exchange for the listings of new companies, cheered the S.E.C.\u2019s decision.\u201cWe have long supported such an action and believe it is one step forward in making the public markets more attractive, which will foster economic growth,\u201d Adena Friedman, the chief executive of Nasdaq, said in a statement.Jay R. Ritter, a professor at the Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida, who studies initial public offerings, was more skeptical about its effects, although he generally supported the idea.\u201cThis is not necessarily going to encourage more companies to go public,\u201d Professor Ritter said. \u201cThe whole JOBS Act has had very marginal impact.\u201dOne criticism of the confidentiality provision has been that it shortens the time between when a prospectus becomes public and the road show for investors before the trading debut of a stock. But that should not be a major obstacle for big investors who can spend time poring over the filing, Professor Ritter said.At his confirmation hearing in March, Mr. Clayton \u2014 who as a longtime lawyer at the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell worked on a number of initial public offerings, including Alibaba\u2019s and Och-Ziff Capital Management\u2019s \u2014 emphasized that he would \u201clike to see more companies going public here.\u201dHe and Republican lawmakers have pointed to regulation as a prime culprit for the shrunken universe in American stocks.\u201cWe are striving for efficiency in our processes to encourage more companies to consider going public, which can result in more choices for investors, job creation and a stronger U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Clayton said on Thursday.Yet other forces have clearly been at work over the last two decades. Wave after wave of mergers and acquisitions have caused many stocks to be delisted. Mutual funds and other big investors tend to prefer bigger investments to many small investments in new company offerings and the like.Perhaps more important, younger companies, particularly in technology, are now able to raise huge sums of capital privately and have no need of public markets. Take Uber, which has raised more than $14 billion from venture capitalists and other investors, giving the private company a valuation of $70 billion.Mr. Clayton cited Uber during his confirmation hearing as an example of a company that 20 years ago probably would have gone public at this point.This year, however, there have been signs of improvement in the market for new stocks. Renaissance Capital noted on Thursday that 54 initial offerings raised $11 billion in the second quarter \u2014 the most in number and proceeds in two years. Already, the market for new stocks, led by companies like Altice USA and Blue Apron, has raised more capital this year than in all of 2016.The commission said on Thursday that permitting all companies to file secretly would give them more flexibility to plan their offerings and reduce \u201cthe potential for lengthy exposure to market fluctuations that can adversely affect the offering process and harm existing public shareholders.\u201dAnna Pinedo, a partner at Morrison & Foerster who specializes in securities law, said the expansion on confidential filing would also apply to companies considering a direct listing on a stock exchange without seeking to raise capital through a public offering.But until now, a company considering a direct listing had to make its filing public when it applied. Ms. Pinedo said the commission\u2019s action would permit any company to keep its financial statements confidential until 15 days before its shares are set to begin trading.\u201cIf you look at how much money unicorns have raised, perhaps they don\u2019t need to do a conventional I.P.O.,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the burger chain that recently made its initial public offering. It is Shake Shack, not Snack Shack.Jeffrey Cane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Samsung plans to open the plant in a former Caterpillar factory in the town of Newberry, about 40 miles northwest of the state capital in Columbia.Samsung joins a growing list of international companies that have said they would aid job creation in the United States, which was a central tenet of Mr. Trump\u2019s election campaign. His statements about renegotiating free-trade agreements and potentially imposing import duties alarmed manufacturers overseas, which were suddenly faced with potentially losing access to the biggest consumer market in the world.While many international companies and business owners have promoted their plans to add jobs in the United States in recent months, a confluence of economic trends has been pushing them to invest in plants in America for years.Tim Brown, a managing director of a supply chain research center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said those factors include rising labor costs in China and demands from some retailers, such as Walmart, for more American-made goods. Pleasing the Trump administration would most likely be a \u201ctiebreaker\u201d after those concerns, Mr. Brown said.\u201cIt\u2019s staying on the good side of the administration, keeping stability in global trade by shifting a bit more onshore,\u201d he said.South Carolina\u2019s manufacturing jobs have grown 16 percent to 244,700 positions from June 2009 to May of this year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the fifth-fastest growth rate in the country. The state has attracted the investment in part because of its lack of unions and its transportation networks, which include the Port of Charleston.Samsung said in an email that it has been considering opening a home-appliance manufacturing plant in the United States for about three years. The company also operates a call center in South Carolina, where 800 people work in full-time and contract positions.With the investment, Samsung will receive financial incentives from the State of South Carolina tied to job creation.In a statement Wednesday, Gov.

{"Headline": "Alibaba Predicts Strong Sales in a Sign of Strength From China", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byThe Alibaba Group signaled on Thursday that for all the global worries about China\u2019s rising debt and bloated state industries, its economy still enjoys a strong pillar of support: online shoppers.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, said Thursday during an investor conference that it expected revenue for its current fiscal year to grow at a much higher rate than analysts had forecast. It cited expectations for growing sales volumes on its online marketplaces and, even more strongly, surging demand by merchants for its digital ad space.China\u2019s digital growth will not last forever, though, and even Alibaba\u2019s numbers show that China\u2019s online world cannot counter the laws of diminishing returns. Still, the ranks of China\u2019s online shoppers grew nearly 13 percent last year to a considerable 467 million, according to official statistics, showing the already vast market is still growing.During a speech at the conference, Alibaba\u2019s chief financial officer, Maggie Wu, said that the company expected revenue for the year that will end next March to grow between 45 percent and 49 percent. That is slightly down from the 56 percent growth the company registered in fiscal year 2017, which ended in March. Still, it nonetheless shows the company is expecting to keep growing at a fast pace in the coming year.Although Alibaba is China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, it does not directly sell the goods on its websites. Instead, it provides marketplaces where anyone from small village dwellers to big global brands can set up online shops and sell to Chinese customers. To reach those customers, Alibaba also offers online advertising space.That space is looking increasingly valuable.During her speech, Ms. Wu said the company got about 60 percent of its revenue from its Alimama advertising platform, which works as an auction site on which Alibaba\u2019s many vendors can bid for advertising space on its sites. On that platform the price for ads has been rising as a result of market forces, Ms. Wu said.At times in the past, Alibaba\u2019s merchants, many of which are small businesses that duke it out with other small sellers on the company\u2019s Taobao marketplace, have complained about increases in what the company would charge for promotions. Such criticism even led to several protests at the company\u2019s offices.Still, the pricing of online ad space in China has long lagged behind what it can cost in more developed markets in Europe and the United States. Alibaba\u2019s high revenue growth target shows that gap may be starting to close, which is good news for a company that is in essence an advertising company.\u201cWe\u2019re not holding a gun to merchants\u2019 heads to make revenue grow,\u201d Ms. Wu said.\u201cIt\u2019s all determined by merchants,\u201d she said. \u201cThey bid for every single click.\u201dThe big revenue growth target is important because investors have been concerned about the slowdown in the total value of the merchandise Alibaba sells on its online platforms. That figure, which Alibaba calls gross merchandise value, grew 22 percent in 2017, a figure smaller than what the company had posted in recent years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Lies. China Thrives.", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byOne of the many dangers posed to our society by having a president who\u2019s a serial liar \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t behave like an adult, let alone a president \u2014 is that we more easily ignore him even if he happens to say something true.Yes, some things are true even if Donald Trump believes them. I explored one of them in China last week \u2014 Trump\u2019s charge that China is playing unfair on trade.Chinese men and women friends tell me they don\u2019t carry purses or wallets anymore, only a mobile phone, which they use for everything \u2014 including for buying vegetables from street vendors.\u201cAmerica has been dreaming of becoming a cashless society,\u201d Ya-Qin Zhang, president of Baidu, China\u2019s main search engine, remarked to me, \u201cbut China is already there.\u201d It has \u201cleapfrogged the rest of world\u201d and is now going mobile-first in everything.Wang Xing, the founder of Meituan.com \u2014 a Chinese mobile website that is a combination of Fandango, Yelp, OpenTable, Grubhub, TripAdvisor, Booking.com and Angie\u2019s List \u2014 told me that he has around 300,000 people on electric bicycles who deliver takeout food and groceries to 10 million Chinese mobile internet users daily. \u201cWe are the largest food delivery company in the world,\u201d said Xing.And in an age when raw data from the internet of people and the internet of things is the new oil, the fact that China has 700 million people doing so many transactions daily on the mobile internet means it\u2019s piling up massive amounts of information that can be harvested to identify trends and spur new artificial intelligence applications.Moreover, while Trump is pulling out of the Paris climate deal, China is steadily pulling out of coal. Xin Guo, C.E.O. of Career International, told me two of his hottest job openings in China are in \u201csoftware and new energy\u201d \u2014 everyone is looking for engineers for electric cars, solar and wind. Walter Fang, a top executive at iSoftStone, which helps design China\u2019s smart, sustainable cities, told me that \u201cjust two weeks ago I brought in about a dozen green energy start-up companies from Massachusetts\u201d to show them opportunities in China.And yet, as smart as China has been in adopting new technologies, Trump\u2019s broad complaint that China is not playing fair on trade and has grown in some areas at the expense of U.S. and European workers has merit and needs to be addressed \u2014 now. Before going to Beijing I emailed the smartest person I know inside China on trade (who will have to go nameless) and asked if Trump had a point.He answered: \u201cYour note has arrived as I slide across the Chinese countryside at 300 kilometers per hour from Beijing to Shanghai. There are nearly 60 trains going from Beijing to Shanghai every day, typically with 16 cars able to carry nearly 1,300 people. \u2026 We glide past endless brand-new factories and immaculate apartment buildings in practically every city along the way, with many more still under construction. As you suspect, I have been sympathetic to many of Trump\u2019s trade and industrial policy ideas. But if anything, Trump may be too late.\u201dOuch.The core problem, U.S. and European business leaders based in China explained, is that when the U.S. allowed China to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 and gain much less restricted access to our markets, we gave China the right to keep protecting parts of its market \u2014 because it was a \u201cdeveloping economy.\u201d The assumption was that as China reformed and become more of our equal, its trade barriers and government aid to Chinese companies would melt away.They did not. China grew in strength, became America\u2019s equal in many fields and continued to protect its own companies from foreign competition, either by limiting access or demanding that foreign companies take on a Chinese partner and transfer their intellectual property to China as the price of access, or by funneling Chinese firms low-interest loans to grow and buy foreign competitors.Once those companies got big enough, they were unleashed on the world. China plans to use this strategy to implement its new plan \u2014 \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d \u2014 to make itself the world leader in electric vehicles, new materials, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, bio-pharmacy, 5G mobile communications and other industries.The latest annual survey of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, released in January, found that 81 percent of its members felt \u201cless welcome\u201d in China than in the past and had little confidence any longer that China would carry through on promises to open its markets. APCO Worldwide\u2019s James McGregor, one of the keenest observers of China trade, recently noted that China tells the world that its policy is \u201creform and opening,\u201d but on the ground its policy \u201cmore resembles reform and closing.\u201dToday, Alibaba can set up its own cloud server in America, but Amazon or Microsoft can\u2019t do the same in China. China just agreed to allow U.S. credit card giants, like Visa and MasterCard, access to its huge market \u2014 something it was required to do under W.T.O. rules but just dragged its feet on for years \u2014 but now domestic Chinese financial services companies, like UnionPay, so dominate the Chinese market that U.S. companies will be left to fight over the scraps. The world leader in industrial robots, the German company Kuka Robotics, was just bought by the Chinese company Midea; Beijing would never allow the U.S. to buy one of China\u2019s industrial gems like that.This is not fair. China needs to know that some people who disagree with everything else Trump stands for \u2014 and who value a strong U.S.-China relationship \u2014 might just support Trump\u2019s idea for a border-adjustment tax on imports to level the playing field. Because our economic relationship with China is out of whack \u2014 and not just because China makes great products, but because we do, too, and it\u2019s high time they are all allowed through China\u2019s front door.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Global Investors See Fresh Worries in an Old Problem: China", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 While investors have been preoccupied with President Trump and chaos in Washington, nerve-rattling elections in Europe and the uncertainty created by Federal Reserve policy and Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, a once-familiar \u2014 and possibly bigger \u2014 risk to global markets has been bubbling in the background.China.Two years after China first set off investor alarm bells worldwide with a stock market crash, a slumping currency and concerns over rising debt, many investors have put those concerns out of mind. Shares of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong and other places outside the mainland have surged to their highest levels since the crash, beating markets in other developing countries, as investors embrace China\u2019s thriving technology and consumer scenes.Even in China, where the long-downtrodden domestic stock market still suffers from investor skepticism and government meddling, local shares enjoyed a run-up for much of this year before falling back recently.\u201cThe vast majority of consensus opinion is that China is fine,\u201d said Kevin Smith, the founder and chief executive of Crescat Capital, an asset management firm based in Denver that is betting against Chinese investments. Referring broadly to China\u2019s debt and other financials, he added: \u201cPeople are really not looking at the potential bubble. The bubble just keeps getting bigger.\u201dChina\u2019s fate has major sway over global markets, given its longtime role as a growth driver \u2014 and investors may soon have a bigger stake in the ups and downs of Chinese stocks.MSCI, an investment advisory firm that compiles stock indexes that are widely tracked by mutual funds and pension funds around the world, is considering adding domestic Chinese stocks to a key benchmark. The company is scheduled to unveil its decision on Tuesday.Investors have already received some encouragement to jump in. In March, Goldman Sachs recommended investors increase their holdings of Chinese stocks, citing improved economic growth, stable policies and other positives.But some investors have started to worry again. In a survey released by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, fund managers in May named China the biggest potential source for an unpleasant surprise for global markets for the first time since January 2016. The investor services firm Moody\u2019s also downgraded China\u2019s sovereign credit rating last month, its first such move in 28 years.Debt is a central theme to these rising concerns. To shore up its economy, China resorted to pumping up credit, adding to an already mountainous pile of debt. According to the Bank for International Settlements, that debt reached 257 percent of its gross domestic product at the end of 2016, slightly above the same measure in the United States, and significantly higher than the 184 percent for emerging economies over all.But what worries economists most is the pace at which it has mounted. At the end of 2007, China\u2019s debt stood at only 152 percent of G.D.P.The research company Capital Economics, in a June report, warned that debt in China \u201chas risen far faster than in almost any other major economy on record,\u201d and that its continued buildup was the \u201cbiggest risk facing emerging Asia.\u201dOver the last several months, the government has tried to reverse this trend, helping slow credit growth. But that, too, has rattled financial markets in China. The fear is that tighter credit could both slow growth and make it more difficult for highly indebted firms to pay back those loans. In a sign of strain, the interest rates charged by banks when lending to one another have been rising.Policy makers in China appear more worried, too. In late May, the government indicated it would tighten its grip on the renminbi, stepping back from a longstanding commitment to allow market forces a greater role in its valuation.Mr. Smith of Crescat said he believed global investors remained too complacent about the China threat. Calling China \u201cthe largest macro bubble in our lifetime,\u201d he said the situation had \u201calready gone beyond what global financial watchdogs claim are levels where other countries historically have gotten into trouble.\u201dMr. Smith has arranged his portfolio with these fears in mind. He said he was shorting China equity funds. (When investors short, they are making financial bets that the price of something is going to fall.) And though such positions have subtracted from his returns so far this year, he has doubled down.Just since May, he has shorted individual Chinese companies listed in New York, including the e-commerce companies Alibaba Group and JD.com and the search engine specialist Baidu, which he argues are more exposed to China\u2019s shaky financial sector than many investors realize.Investors may steer clear of China until the uncertainty about its heavy debt \u2014 and the government\u2019s will and ability to handle it \u2014 clears up.\u201cThe biggest crisis tends to happen when people are not looking, when the government is not trying to tackle the risk,\u201d said Jian Shi Cortesi, who oversees the Asian equities portfolio at the asset-manager GAM, based in Zurich. \u201cSo far they are managing it quite well. But the market is always scared if they cannot manage it. \u201dNot all China watchers are quite so nervous. Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist in Hong Kong at AXA Investment Managers, which has more than $800 billion under management, said investors should see the current effort to bring down leverage as a positive for the economy\u2019s future health.\u201cRight now, I\u2019m not all that concerned,\u201d Mr. Yao said. Policy makers, he added, \u201care managing the situation quite carefully.\u201dThere is also some confidence among China analysts that politics will keep the country\u2019s currency and stock markets on track in the coming months. This year, a major Communist Party conference will take place. To avoid any undue surprises, policy makers are likely to do whatever they can to prevent drastic shifts in asset values before the meeting.It is unclear whether MSCI, the stock-index compiler, will broaden global access for Chinese stocks. It has rejected adding China\u2019s domestic shares for three consecutive years, citing regulations that hamper an investor\u2019s ability to sell shares and take funds out of the country. The Chinese authorities have introduced some measures to address these issues.Mr. Yao of AXA said he believed that Chinese regulators had opened up enough access to domestic markets to win over MSCI. But even he does not see that translating into an immediate rush into Chinese stocks, given China\u2019s problems.\u201cLong term, we are fairly cautious as well,\u201d Mr. Yao said. \u201cPeople already know there is no easy out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Verizon to Lay Off 2,100 Employees After Finalizing Yahoo Deal", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Verizon plans to lay off 2,100 people once it completes its acquisition of Yahoo\u2019s internet business on Tuesday.The sting will be soothed a bit for some of the Yahoo employees who lose their jobs: A 10 percent surge in the company\u2019s share price on Thursday enhanced the value of their accumulated stock compensation.The layoffs, which were described by a person briefed on Verizon\u2019s plans, represent about 15 percent of the work force at Yahoo and AOL, the Verizon unit with which it is to be combined.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Yahoo\u2019s share price rose by $5.16 after the vote on Thursday, to close at $55.71. That will raise the payouts to Yahoo employees who are terminated.Other senior Yahoo executives who are laid off will also get big severance packages, including up to two years of pay and accelerated vesting of all stock compensation. For example, Lisa Utzschneider, the chief revenue officer, will receive about $22 million, and Ken Goldman, the chief financial officer, will get about $12 million, based on the current stock price and securities filings by the company.Lower-level Yahoo employees will also receive enhanced severance benefits that were established before the Verizon deal was struck last summer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "Supported byOpinionBEIJING \u2014 What worries you about the coming world of artificial intelligence?Too often the answer to this question resembles the plot of a sci-fi thriller. People worry that developments in A.I. will bring about the \u201csingularity\u201d \u2014 that point in history when A.I. surpasses human intelligence, leading to an unimaginable revolution in human affairs. Or they wonder whether instead of our controlling artificial intelligence, it will control us, turning us, in effect, into cyborgs.These are interesting issues to contemplate, but they are not pressing. They concern situations that may not arise for hundreds of years, if ever. At the moment, there is no known path from our best A.I. tools (like the Google computer program that recently beat the world\u2019s best player of the game of Go) to \u201cgeneral\u201d A.I. \u2014 self-aware computer programs that can engage in common-sense reasoning, attain knowledge in multiple domains, feel, express and understand emotions and so on.This doesn\u2019t mean we have nothing to worry about. On the contrary, the A.I. products that now exist are improving faster than most people realize and promise to radically transform our world, not always for the better. They are only tools, not a competing form of intelligence. But they will reshape what work means and how wealth is created, leading to unprecedented economic inequalities and even altering the global balance of power.It is imperative that we turn our attention to these imminent challenges.What is artificial intelligence today? Roughly speaking, it\u2019s technology that takes in huge amounts of information from a specific domain (say, loan repayment histories) and uses it to make a decision in a specific case (whether to give an individual a loan) in the service of a specified goal (maximizing profits for the lender). Think of a spreadsheet on steroids, trained on big data. These tools can outperform human beings at a given task.This kind of A.I. is spreading to thousands of domains (not just loans), and as it does, it will eliminate many jobs. Bank tellers, customer service representatives, telemarketers, stock and bond traders, even paralegals and radiologists will gradually be replaced by such software. Over time this technology will come to control semiautonomous and autonomous hardware like self-driving cars and robots, displacing factory workers, construction workers, drivers, delivery workers and many others.Unlike the Industrial Revolution and the computer revolution, the A.I. revolution is not taking certain jobs (artisans, personal assistants who use paper and typewriters) and replacing them with other jobs (assembly-line workers, personal assistants conversant with computers). Instead, it is poised to bring about a wide-scale decimation of jobs \u2014 mostly lower-paying jobs, but some higher-paying ones, too.This transformation will result in enormous profits for the companies that develop A.I., as well as for the companies that adopt it. Imagine how much money a company like Uber would make if it used only robot drivers. Imagine the profits if Apple could manufacture its products without human labor. Imagine the gains to a loan company that could issue 30 million loans a year with virtually no human involvement. (As it happens, my venture capital firm has invested in just such a loan company.)We are thus facing two developments that do not sit easily together: enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands and enormous numbers of people out of work. What is to be done?Part of the answer will involve educating or retraining people in tasks A.I. tools aren\u2019t good at. Artificial intelligence is poorly suited for jobs involving creativity, planning and \u201ccross-domain\u201d thinking \u2014 for example, the work of a trial lawyer. But these skills are typically required by high-paying jobs that may be hard to retrain displaced workers to do. More promising are lower-paying jobs involving the \u201cpeople skills\u201d that A.I. lacks: social workers, bartenders, concierges \u2014 professions requiring nuanced human interaction. But here, too, there is a problem: How many bartenders does a society really need?The solution to the problem of mass unemployment, I suspect, will involve \u201cservice jobs of love.\u201d These are jobs that A.I. cannot do, that society needs and that give people a sense of purpose. Examples include accompanying an older person to visit a doctor, mentoring at an orphanage and serving as a sponsor at Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 or, potentially soon, Virtual Reality Anonymous (for those addicted to their parallel lives in computer-generated simulations). The volunteer service jobs of today, in other words, may turn into the real jobs of the future.Other volunteer jobs may be higher-paying and professional, such as compassionate medical service providers who serve as the \u201chuman interface\u201d for A.I. programs that diagnose cancer. In all cases, people will be able to choose to work fewer hours than they do now.Who will pay for these jobs? Here is where the enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands comes in. It strikes me as unavoidable that large chunks of the money created by A.I. will have to be transferred to those whose jobs have been displaced. This seems feasible only through Keynesian policies of increased government spending, presumably raised through taxation on wealthy companies.As for what form that social welfare would take, I would argue for a conditional universal basic income: welfare offered to those who have a financial need, on the condition they either show an effort to receive training that would make them employable or commit to a certain number of hours of \u201cservice of love\u201d voluntarism.To fund this, tax rates will have to be high. The government will not only have to subsidize most people\u2019s lives and work; it will also have to compensate for the loss of individual tax revenue previously collected from employed individuals.This leads to the final and perhaps most consequential challenge of A.I. The Keynesian approach I have sketched out may be feasible in the United States and China, which will have enough successful A.I. businesses to fund welfare initiatives via taxes. But what about other countries?They face two insurmountable problems. First, most of the money being made from artificial intelligence will go to the United States and China. A.I. is an industry in which strength begets strength: The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the more data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you can attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product. It\u2019s a virtuous circle, and the United States and China have already amassed the talent, market share and data to set it in motion.For example, the Chinese speech-recognition company iFlytek and several Chinese face-recognition companies such as Megvii and SenseTime have become industry leaders, as measured by market capitalization. The United States is spearheading the development of autonomous vehicles, led by companies like Google, Tesla and Uber. As for the consumer internet market, seven American or Chinese companies \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 are making extensive use of A.I. and expanding operations to other countries, essentially owning those A.I. markets. It seems American businesses will dominate in developed markets and some developing markets, while Chinese companies will win in most developing markets.The other challenge for many countries that are not China or the United States is that their populations are increasing, especially in the developing world. While a large, growing population can be an economic asset (as in China and India in recent decades), in the age of A.I. it will be an economic liability because it will comprise mostly displaced workers, not productive ones.So if most countries will not be able to tax ultra-profitable A.I. companies to subsidize their workers, what options will they have? I foresee only one: Unless they wish to plunge their people into poverty, they will be forced to negotiate with whichever country supplies most of their A.I. software \u2014 China or the United States \u2014 to essentially become that country\u2019s economic dependent, taking in welfare subsidies in exchange for letting the \u201cparent\u201d nation\u2019s A.I. companies continue to profit from the dependent country\u2019s users. Such economic arrangements would reshape today\u2019s geopolitical alliances.One way or another, we are going to have to start thinking about how to minimize the looming A.I.-fueled gap between the haves and the have-nots, both within and between nations. Or to put the matter more optimistically: A.I. is presenting us with an opportunity to rethink economic inequality on a global scale. These challenges are too far-ranging in their effects for any nation to isolate itself from the rest of the world.Kai-Fu Lee is the chairman and chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm, and the president of its Artificial Intelligence Institute.Advertisement"}
