{"Headline": "In Year of Anti-Muslim Vitriol, Brands Promote Inclusion", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingThe gentle piano music starts as the doorbell chimes. A white-haired Christian pastor greets his friend, a Muslim imam, and the two converse and laugh over a cup of tea, wincing about their creaky knees as they prepare to part ways. Later, it spurs the same idea in each for a gift: kneepads sent via Amazon Prime. (It is a commercial, after all.)The piano notes accelerate as the men open their deliveries with smiles, and then each uses the item to kneel in prayer: one at a church, the other at a mosque. The final chords fade.\u201cThis type of a project is definitely a first for us,\u201d said Rameez Abid, communications director for the social justice branch of the Islamic Circle of North America, one group Amazon worked with. \u201cThey were very aware that this was going to cause controversy and might get hate mail and things like that, but they said it\u2019s something that they wanted to do because the message is important.\u201d\u201cFor me as a Muslim woman, I represent something right now in the country that for some people incites fear,\u201d said Ms. Haydar, 28, who wears a hijab and hails from Flint, Mich. \u201cThis normalizes the narrative that we are just human beings.\u201d\u201cWith the kind of gay parent issue, we\u2019ve gotten a little closer to acceptance, but the Muslim issue in America is still pretty raw for a lot of people,\u201d said Kevin Brady, an executive creative director at the ad agency Droga5, which worked last year with Honey Maid on a commercial about white and Muslim-American neighbors. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be, but it\u2019s one that I think brands took an extra step of courage to really go out there with in 2016.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think diversity is a political statement,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an issue of universal humanity.\u201dFor its ad, Amazon was painstaking in its attention to detail, checking with religious groups about costuming and background imagery, and sending over final proofs of the ad for review, said Mr. Abid and Antonios Kireopoulos, an associate general secretary of the National Council of Churches, another group Amazon consulted.The response from her community was positive, she said. Such ads are \u201cencouraging for the younger generations, like those who are afraid to mention that they\u2019re Muslims,\u201d she added. \u201cMy daughters are more confident now, and I believe their friends who are Muslims, they know that we\u2019re accepted and we\u2019re loved.\u201dWith more Americans dwelling in siloed information bubbles, commercials have the potential to reach audiences with diverse viewpoints. Amazon said its ad had aired during programs including the \u201cToday\u201d show, \u201cEmpire\u201d and \u201cBlue Bloods,\u201d while Microsoft said its placements had included \u201cThe Voice,\u201d \u201cPitch\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d\u201cI imagine the violence will unfortunately continue, so it will take more vigilance on the part of community leaders and everyday believers to work together,\u201d he said.Ms. Haydar is hopeful about the potential.\u201cIn 10 years, this commercial might have lived on in the heart of some young kid who saw a Muslim woman in a commercial and didn\u2019t see the boogeyman in my face, and instead saw a normal human being,\u201d she said. \u201cThen if somebody says something about Muslims that\u2019s kind of crazy, maybe that kid can say, \u2018I saw this commercial, and she actually just seemed kind of normal.\u2019 You don\u2019t know what the reverberations look like.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Snap Goes Public, Some Shareholders\u2019 Voting Rights May Disappear", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe current rising star of tech start-ups, the parent company of the messaging app Snapchat, is apparently planning to issue shares with no voting rights when it goes public this year.It\u2019s another sign of how the balance of power has tilted to tech founders. But Snap may have gone too far.Still, a total disenfranchisement of public shareholders has been a long time coming among technology companies.When Apple and Microsoft went public decades ago they had the traditional corporate structure of one share, one vote. Google started the trend of making public shareholders lesser citizens in 2004, when it issued to public shareholders shares having one vote while the founders and insiders held shares with 10 votes.That has become the norm among new tech companies, as Facebook, Zynga and Groupon (among others) followed, as well as nontech companies such as Shake Shack. The typical structure was to give 10 votes per share to the Class A stock held by the founders and one vote to the public, though some companies went even further: Zynga\u2019s class A had 70 votes per share. (Twitter, however, was a noticeable exception and instead adopted a more traditional one-share, one-vote structure.)But Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, as well as other tech founders, soon discovered a problem. Even with all of those high-vote shares, they might lose control if they sold their stock to fund their charities or other ventures. As a result, Google, Zillow and even Under Armour have created no-vote shares to issue to employees and for future offerings.This is having your cake and eating it, too.Snap could go public with a Google-like structure and then issue out no-vote shares later. But why deal with all those pesky shareholders who may challenge such a conversion?Instead, Snap is apparently going to make sure that the public has no vote and hence never the opportunity to have a say in the company\u2019s governance. While public shareholders will be totally disenfranchised, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy are reportedly going to have 70 percent of the total vote despite owning only 40 percent of Snap.The discrepancy is not bad compared with other companies. At Facebook, for example, Mark Zuckerberg currently casts 53.8 percent of Facebook\u2019s votes while owning 15 percent of the company.Snap\u2019s rationale for wanting its co-founders to have this power has not been explained. But from news media reports and otherwise, we can figure out the gist. Snap is likely to argue that Mr. Spiegel, 26, is a visionary who knows how to sell to teenagers and 20-somethings. He is the one who can lead the company to join the superpower ranks of Facebook and Google, justifying Snap\u2019s valuation of over $20 billion.Indeed, that appears to be why Snapchat changed its name to Snap, so it could mimic the big boys like Google and be an umbrella company for other innovative and presumably lucrative products. Mr. Spiegel, the argument goes, needs total control over the company to ensure that this ambitious vision is executed.There are warning signs that the hype over Snap\u2019s initial public offering is going to be extreme. Already the company is indicating that it will focus not on revenues or profits, but on alternative metrics like user engagement.Yet is there any doubt that Snap\u2019s initial public offering will be a stunning success? After all, how can you miss out on the Next Big Thing, like, say, Myspace, Zynga, Groupon or perhaps Theranos? Oh, Snap.Sarcasm aside, few big social media players come to market, so investors will be sure to gobble up Snap shares.And risks and governance problems will be ignored in the rush not to miss out. The euphoria over Snap is noticeable even among banks, which are providing the company with a loan of $1.4 billion \u2014 more than Snap\u2019s entire expected 2017 revenue. So much for sober and prudent banking.When you think about it, this emphasis on vision in technology is tiresome. It drives money to companies but often seems hype to build up the egos of founders who often get lucky. I mean, were messages that disappear \u201cvisionary\u201d five years ago?Couldn\u2019t it be easier to say that instead of a visionary, Mr. Spiegel will be a multibillionaire with total control of a company and a track record of only a few years?Without picking on Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy, this type of corporate power concentration in one or two people has too much chance of going wrong \u2014 especially someone who might be around for 70 years and is running a company with so much uncertainty in its future. Their vision may change or just go bad, but shareholders who own part of the company are stuck as are the employees and consumers of the company who then are kept in this scenario.Even Google was criticized for overspending on investment, something shareholder pressure pushed back on and caused the company to change. Shareholders can provide some measure of check on these issues, but Snap would be saying: We won\u2019t care.Defenders of such a class-share structure point to the ability to look at the long term while arguing that the market will price any governance defects. Shareholders will pay less for Snap\u2019s shares because of these risks.This assumes a rational market, but it is hard not to see that people may be discounting the risks in the rush to buy the next hot tech stock. And while there may be real benefits to this structure in preserving a singular mission, given the early trajectory of Snap, it seems too risky.Perhaps the supporters are right. But the real test of this structure will come if the institutional investment firms who have the greatest influence in the stock market, like Vanguard and BlackRock, idly stand by.But I doubt that the institutions will do much more than complain, instead leaving Snap with corporate governance that mimics its disappearing messages, leaving nothing there.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

It puts Apple and Google in a difficult position. The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens.When LinkedIn\u2019s website was blocked, the apps stopped functioning properly. Removing them from the Google Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store may not have cut off access to content, but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps.\u201cApps are the new choke point of free expression,\u201d said Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America.LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service, which the company confirmed was extended to apps in Russian Apple and Google Play stores.\u201cIt denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,\u201d said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn.Apple confirmed it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. It has also confirmed it was asked by China to block The New York Times app, but declined to comment further on both events. Google would not confirm it has removed LinkedIn in Russia but said it adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates.\u201cInternet free speech and internet freedom are increasingly under attack all over the globe, and not just from authoritarian regimes,\u201d said Robert M. McDowell, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission and partner at Cooley law firm. \u201cIt appears to be a one-way ratchet with speech control getting tighter.\u201dLinkedIn has several million users in Russia, it said. In November, a Russian court ruled that the professional networking site broke local laws that require foreign internet firms to keep their servers holding information on Russian accounts within the nation.Most American internet companies in Russia operate in violation of the law, but without explanation, Russian regulators at a body known as Roskomnadzor took the rare step of enforcing its rules. The Russian regulators could not be immediately reached for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Basic Economy\u2019 Airline Service Squeezing Business Travelers", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byItinerariesAs more airlines embrace \u201cbasic economy,\u201d many business travelers are feeling the pinch.Bevan Lindsey doesn\u2019t mind trying to save his company money when he flies for work. But lately he has been getting squeezed \u2014 literally.Mr. Lindsey, an industrial salesman who is more than six feet tall, says he already pays out of his own pocket to get a seat with a little more legroom, at an average of $50 per flight. He worries that he soon might have to start self-subsidizing even more of his business travel, as airlines continue to add fees to even the most basic features of economy class while his employer wants him to find the lowest fares available.Like many other work travelers whose bosses will not spring for business-class tickets, or even economy-plus fares, Mr. Lindsey is caught between corporate travel managers who want to save money and airlines that want to wring every last dollar from the least expensive seats on the plane.\u201cThe company is definitely trying to move toward the cheapest option, and if not, you have to get approval,\u201d Mr. Lindsey said of his employer.The bind for business travelers like Mr. Lindsey may seem an unintended consequence of the airline industry\u2019s race to the bottom in economy class. But travel consultants say it is partly a deliberate strategy by airlines, which are trying to nudge \u2014 or maybe shove \u2014 more passengers into paying business-class or economy-plus fares.\u201cThe basic economy fares have the added restrictions, which the airlines have created to make them deliberately unattractive to business travelers,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a founder of Atmosphere Research Group, an airline industry consulting firm.For Mr. Lindsey, the choice is either pressing his knees into the seat in front of him or spending his own money to secure bulkhead or similarly roomier seats.\u201cThey\u2019ve taken every single thing and just nickel-and-dimed consumers,\u201d he said of the airlines. \u201cThey have done some upgrades as far as entertainment, but I\u2019d rather pay for that and not get squished.\u201dThe mainstream airlines, aiming to compete with low-fare carriers like Spirit and Frontier, have adopted \u201cbasic economy\u201d fares that strip out options like choosing seats and using the overhead bins.United Airlines said in November that it would begin selling basic economy fares in the first quarter, starting with flights for the second quarter of the year. Initially, the airline announced last week, travelers will be able to buy basic economy tickets on routes between United\u2019s seven domestic hubs and Minneapolis.The trade-off for passengers with those bare-bones tickets will include having no choice in seat assignment, being last to board and not being allowed to stow a carry-on bag in the overhead bins, although the airline won\u2019t impose these last two restrictions on some loyalty program members or holders of some United-affiliated credit cards. (Passengers will be able to check their carry-on bags for a fee, and an airline spokesman said passengers would be alerted at check-in about the carry-on regulations. Passengers will still be able to bring a personal item like a handbag that fits under the seat in front of them.)These ticket holders also will not earn frequent-flier miles that count toward their totals for premier status. Nor will they be eligible for free or even paid upgrades. And they will not be able to rebook or otherwise change flights.American Airlines also announced last week that it would start selling its own version of basic economy fares in 10 domestic markets next month. The terms are similar to United\u2019s, with some of the more onerous restrictions \u2014 such as not being allowed to use the overhead bins and having to board last \u2014 waived for elite loyalty members and holders of some airline-affiliated credit cards.Delta Air Lines was the first legacy carrier in the United States to adopt a basic economy fare, in 2012, and it has revised it slightly since then. As with United\u2019s and American\u2019s planned ticket tier, Delta\u2019s basic economy option prohibits ticket changes, seat selection and upgrades, although Delta travelers can still use the overhead bins and earn frequent-flier miles that count toward their status requirements.Peter Ooi, an information technology engineer who travels regularly for work, said that his employer\u2019s policy required him to book tickets within $50 of the lowest fare available. He is unhappy about the prospect of not being able to use overhead bins or accrue as many \u2014 or any \u2014 frequent-flier miles.\u201cAs a business traveler, that\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Mr. Ooi said.Those in the business of corporate travel say they have been scrambling to address the changing fare restrictions and the complications they can pose in booking.\u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a surprise to a lot of travel managers in terms of: What does this entail, what does this include?\u201d said Jeremy Quek, the air practice line lead of the Global Business Consulting division of American Express Global Business Travel.\u201cAs we look forward into 2017, as both United and American are looking to introduce theirs, it\u2019s very important to remember that not all basic economy fares are going to be the same,\u201d he said.While travel managers can, and often do, choose not to include low-fare carriers like Spirit in their booking engines \u2014 because of contractual relationships with full-service carriers, for instance \u2014 that is not an option when the cut-rate tickets are being offered by full-service airlines.\u201cIt\u2019s going to become more difficult for companies,\u201d said Bob Neveu, the chief executive of Certify, a provider of travel and expense-management software. \u201cIf it\u2019s really important to them, they\u2019re going to have to put the fare class categories into the search parameters.\u201dSome travel professionals see merit in enabling employees to view all fare options. A traveler taking a one-day trip, for instance, might not need to tote more than a laptop bag.\u201cWe try to include all fares whenever possible; we want people to see all the fares that can be booked,\u201d said Eric Bailey, the director of global travel and payments at Microsoft.In Microsoft\u2019s case, employees are not required to base their bookings on price alone. \u201cWe\u2019re really looking for people to fly based on value,\u201d Mr. Bailey said. \u201cWe leave that up to the traveler\u2019s judgment.\u201dMany travel managers also know that there can be false economy in insisting on basic economy tickets.Rock-bottom fares have additional, indirect costs \u2014 especially if they do not contribute toward travelers\u2019 attaining frequent-flier status, said Greeley Koch, the executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives.\u201cI think the better travel programs out there realize it\u2019s in their best interest to have travelers be able to earn status,\u201d Mr. Koch said, noting that travelers with status often get fees waived for perks like checked bags, and that they are more likely to be eligible for the upgrades that let them sleep or be more productive in-flight.And if a basic economy fare means that a flight cannot be changed or rebooked, the employee might end up with a worthless ticket.If the employee with the nonrefundable ticket misses the flight \u2014 maybe because a client meeting ran late \u2014 there may be no choice but to pay the last-minute, walk-up fare price.\u201cThe risk of nonrefundability is a very big piece here,\u201d said Mr. Quek of American Express. \u201cThose fares are basically use-it-or-lose-it fares.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Data Could Be the Next Tech Hot Button for Regulators", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byWealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on.Now data \u2014 gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations \u2014 is increasingly a focus of technology competition. And academics and some policy makers, especially in Europe, are considering whether big internet companies like Google and Facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation.In recent years, Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion, privacy or antitrust investigations. But in the coming years, who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in American tech giants.As government regulators dig into this new era of data competition, they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make. Using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit, for example. And higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services.The competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990s about software and Microsoft. The worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers, and gather more data, a powerful \u201cnetwork effect\u201d effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform, like Google in search or Facebook in consumer social networks.Evidence of the rising importance of data can be seen from the frontiers of artificial intelligence to mainstream business software. And certain data sets can be remarkably valuable for companies working on those technologies.Microsoft is betting LinkedIn, combined with data on how hundreds of millions of workers use its Office 365 online software, and consumer data from search behavior on Bing, will \u201cpower a set of insights that we think is unprecedented,\u201d said James Phillips, vice president for business applications at Microsoft.IBM estimates that 70 percent of the world\u2019s data is not out on the public web, but in private databases, often to protect privacy or trade secrets. IBM\u2019s strategy is to take the data it has acquired, add customer data and use that to train its Watson artificial intelligence software to pursue such tasks as helping medical researchers discover novel disease therapies, or flagging suspect financial transactions for independent auditors.\u201cOur focus is mainly on nonpublic data sets and extending that advantage for clients in business and science,\u201d said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s Watson and cloud businesses.At Google, the company\u2019s drive into cloud-delivered business software is fueled by data, building on years of work done on its search and other consumer services, and its recent advances in image identification, speech recognition and language translation.For example, a new Google business offering \u2014 still in the test, or alpha, stage \u2014 is a software service to improve job finding and recruiting. Its data includes more than 17 million online job postings and the public profiles and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of more than 200 million people.Its machine-learning algorithms distilled that to about four million unique job titles, ranked the most common ones and identified specific skills. The job sites CareerBuilder and Dice are using the Google technology to show job seekers more relevant openings. And FedEx, the giant package shipper, is adding the service to its recruiting site.That is just one case, said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google\u2019s cloud business, of what is becoming increasingly possible \u2014 using the tools of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, to sift through huge quantities of data to provide machine-curated data services.\u201cYou can turn this technology to whatever field you want, from manufacturing to medicine,\u201d Ms. Greene said.Fei-Fei Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is taking a sabbatical to become chief scientist for artificial intelligence at Google\u2019s cloud unit. She sees working at Google as one path to pursue her career ambition to \u201cdemocratize A.I.,\u201d now that the software and data ingredients are ripe.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have the current era of A.I. without the big data revolution,\u201d Dr. Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s the digital gold.\u201dIn the A.I. race, better software algorithms can put you ahead for a year or so, but probably no more, said Andrew Ng, a former Google scientist and adjunct professor at Stanford. He is now chief scientist at Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant, and a leading figure in artificial intelligence research.Rivals, he added, cannot unlock or simulate your data. \u201cData is the defensible barrier, not algorithms,\u201d Mr. Ng said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Seem Invincible. That Worries Lawmakers.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech \u2014 from IBM to Hewlett-Packard to Cisco to Yahoo \u2014 were eventually outmaneuvered by start-ups that came out of nowhere.The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place.Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable.In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world\u2019s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will.The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump\u2019s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds.This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year.Let\u2019s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends \u2014 mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs.Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech \u2014 on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance.The Five aren\u2019t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple\u2019s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet\u2019s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren\u2019t entirely safe from competition from start-ups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot.Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from start-ups; today\u2019s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five.But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you\u2019re supposed to in America \u2014 by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren\u2019t considered that bad. They weren\u2019t causing environmental disasters. They weren\u2019t selling cigarettes. They weren\u2019t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five\u2019s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn\u2019t I called them the Fabulous Five?Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with.During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos\u2019s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry\u2019s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public.For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised \u2014 entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others.\u201cDuring the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U.S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,\u201d said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them.During Mr. Genachowski\u2019s term at the F.C.C., and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201d which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies.But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. \u201cThe next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things \u2014 battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,\u201d he said.That\u2019s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger \u2014 their benefits to society as well as their potential costs \u2014 when deciding how to police them.But there\u2019s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today\u2019s start-ups. The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining, voice-activated assistants, self-driving cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five.That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more; and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful.Advertisement"}

And the conversations tend to be dominated by issues like inequality, climate change and the economic challenges facing developed and emerging countries.This year, the guest list includes names like President Xi Jinping of China; Vice President Joseph Biden; JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon; the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde; and former Vice President Al Gore.And yet missing from these high-minded conversations have been meaningful challengers or critics of the underlying theme that was seemingly stipulated from the birth of this event 46 years ago: Globalization has the potential to benefit everyone.\u201cTrump\u2019s election victory is a clear indication that the majority of people are not interested in a world government, but want to return to a classical, local democracy,\u201d John Mauldin, an economic researcher and author, recently wrote. \u201cStrange as it may seem to the Davos men, most people tend to love their \u2018patria,\u2019 the land of their fathers.\u201dDissenting voices like those of Mr. Trump and Mr. Farage have rarely been part of the discussion \u2014 though perhaps that will change. Theresa May, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, will attend this year, as will some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers.But the victories of Mr. Trump and the Brexit campaign can be viewed as a rebuke of \u201cDavos Man,\u201d a name that Samuel Huntington, the Harvard political scientist, gave attendees in 2004, describing them as \u201ctransnationalists\u201d who \u201chave little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite\u2019s global operations.\u201dThe middle class in the United States and Britain \u2014 and perhaps in France if Marine Le Pen, the far-right presidential candidate who has also never been invited to Davos, wins this spring \u2014 clearly haven\u2019t felt the benefits of the border-free world encouraged by multinational corporations that allows both immigration and commerce to take place without friction.\u201cThey have witnessed the rise of the Davos class, a hyper-connected network of banking and tech billionaires, elected leaders who are awfully cozy with those interests, and Hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous,\u201d Naomi Klein, a columnist for The Guardian, wrote in a searing analysis of the American election in November. She described the failure of \u201celite neoliberalism\u201d to address the economic challenges of the masses.\u201cSuccess,\u201d she wrote, continuing to describe the middle class, \u201cis a party to which they were not invited, and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness.\u201dThe Davos Man has either failed to properly articulate the benefits of open trade \u2014 or the reality of open trade is more complicated than previously imagined.In a nod to this new reality, the World Economic Forum has put together an index of what it calls inclusive growth and development, which measures 109 countries according to their progress on economic growth and reducing income inequality and breaks out subsets of those countries to compare with different data sets. According to the index, median income actually declined by 2.4 percent between 2008 and 2013 across the 26 advanced economies where data is available, which may help explain the shifting political winds.\u201cIt\u2019s our response to how capitalism has failed us \u2014 and how we need to fix it,\u201d said Adrian Monck, a member of the forum\u2019s executive committee.The United States ranked 23rd out of 30 advanced economies. In terms of wage and nonwage compensation, it ranked last; in social protection, it came in 25th. It also came in 25th on \u201cintermediation of business investment\u201d \u2014 in other words, the amount of money that goes into productive investments, such as research and development and infrastructure as opposed to share buybacks. (Norway ranked No. 1. Living standards there rose by 10.6 percent from 2008 to 2013 while the economy grew only 0.5 percent.)Mr. Monck defended the idea of a globalist approach. \u201cThe benefits of globalization are there to see, in jobs in China, India and many emerging markets,\u201d he said. \u201cBillions of people owe better lives to it.\u201dHe invoked Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum. \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t been listened to in Davos is persistent warnings from people like Klaus that the benefits need to be shared, and that you can\u2019t have winner-take-all capitalism,\u201d Mr. Monck said.Still, he acknowledged that the invitation list of insiders is by design.\u201cWe always want the most comprehensive political attendance in Davos, to help support public-private cooperation, which is what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat inevitably means current, serving political figures. There are politicians in office now \u2014 and coming to Davos \u2014 who reflect this emergent agenda that you\u2019ve seen in the U.S.\u201dFor example, he said, leaders from Poland, Finland, Portugal and even Switzerland \u2014 where the Swiss People\u2019s Party was an early example of the shift in the political landscape \u2014 will be on hand this week.A bevy of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers and members of his business council are expected to attend, including Anthony Scaramucci, who joined the president-elect\u2019s White House staff as an adviser and public liaison to government agencies and businesses. He will be joined by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman of the Blackstone Group and also of Mr. Trump\u2019s President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum.A few people who were once anti-establishment crusaders \u2014 like Ms. May of Britain \u2014 are now insiders. And, depending how the political winds shift, more people of her ideological ilk may join the Davos class in 2018.Many of today\u2019s policy makers and executives gathering here are expected to speak about the rise of populism and the need to adjust economic incentives. Hamdi Ulukaya, the chief executive of Chobani, the yogurt company, is expected to encourage business leaders to do more to address wealth building among employees; he provided shares in his company to every full-time employee, making many of them millionaires.The question, of course, is whether those discussions can ever get beyond the theoretical for a group that is seen by many middle-class voters as out of touch with the real economic challenges that people face. Conversations about income inequality, for example, have long had a tinge of class envy as opposed to a real appreciation for the basic jobs and wages that people are seeking.Still, with the word \u201cDavos\u201d being tossed around as an epithet, some politicians are staying away from the Alps this year. Ms. Merkel, for example, has passed on attending now for two years in a row, in the face of continued criticism among German voters that she is too much of a globalist.So why do so many policy makers and executives still covet an invitation? Because Davos remains the world\u2019s one-stop shop to meet leaders from all corners of the globe. And despite the critiques of the gathering, a remarkable amount of business \u2014 both political and corporate \u2014 takes place behind the scenes.One thing is sure: The predictions made here \u2014 known as the Davos consensus \u2014 have a tendency to be wrong. Mr. Trump, with very few exceptions, was largely written off last year as a bad joke.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Profit Rises 4 Percent, as Cloud Business Booms", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 At Microsoft, cloud computing is the future, and investors are happy as long as the company keeps delivering growth from it.For several years, Microsoft has sought to shed its reputation as a stodgy seller of traditional software, highly dependent on the ups and downs of the personal computing market. The company misfired along the way as it competed head-on with Google in internet search and Apple in smartphones.Microsoft\u2019s shares, which languished for years, are now trading near record highs. After its results were released, the company\u2019s stock rose almost 1 percent to $64.27.For the quarter, Microsoft reported net income of $5.2 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with $5.02 billion, or 62 cents a share, during the period a year earlier.Revenue rose to $24.09 billion from $23.8 billion a year ago.With adjustments to exclude results from LinkedIn and the impact of nearly $2 billion in deferred revenue related to its Windows 10 operating system, Microsoft earned 84 cents a share and revenue of $25.84 billion, exceeding the estimates of Wall Street analysts, who also excluded those items from their forecasts.The average analyst estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters had called for Microsoft earnings of 79 cents a share and revenue of $25.28 billion.Sales from the company\u2019s Azure cloud computing business, which caters to businesses that want to move basic computing functions into Microsoft\u2019s data centers, increased 93 percent from a year ago. Revenue for intelligent cloud, Microsoft\u2019s name for the category that includes Azure, rose 8 percent to $6.9 billion.\u201cWe know their cloud business is doing well,\u201d said Christopher Voce, an analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cThey delivered on that front.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s Office business also had strong results as more of its customers signed on to use a subscription version of Office 365 software. Revenue in the Microsoft category dominated by Office rose 10 percent to $7.4 billion.The category also benefited from $228 million in revenue that LinkedIn brought in for Microsoft after the acquisition closed. LinkedIn showed an operating loss during that period of $201 million.One of the biggest surprises of the quarter was a 5 percent increase in the revenue Microsoft received from personal computer makers for licenses to its Windows software. Windows revenue that Microsoft received from agreements with corporate customers rose by the same amount.The personal computer market has been in a slump for years as buyers have shifted to newer categories of devices like tablets and smartphones. In the last three months of 2016, worldwide personal computer shipments fell 3.7 percent, according to Gartner, the technology research firm.But Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., still occasionally outperforms the overall market, especially during a surge in sales of higher-end personal computers. In an interview, Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said that corporations were increasing their deployments of Windows 10 on their personal computers and that innovative new machines aimed at consumers sold well.\u201cWe\u2019re feeling very good about growth in the PC segment,\" Ms. Hood said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Non-Tech Companies, if You Can\u2019t Build It, Buy a Start-Up", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byFor years, mergers and acquisitions in technology were fairly straightforward: Every investment bank kept a list of a dozen or so companies like Google and IBM that had a track record of acquisitions and cash to deploy. When the time and price were right, bankers would seek to match the tech giants with a start-up, and a deal would be hatched.Now the technology deal-making club has had its doors blown wide open.All kinds of companies, including century-old industrial stalwarts like General Motors and General Electric, are among the corporate giants acquiring tech start-ups of late.This trend, of course, reflects how new technology is radically changing many traditional businesses. Developments like connected homes and driverless cars are upending old models. Many companies have come to the realization that building technology in-house was a painstaking process that often meant getting leapfrogged by start-ups.So companies not usually thought of as being in the tech sector have become more aggressive, making more than $125 billion worth of acquisitions in 2016, the most ever. Five years ago, that figure was $20 billion.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that many non-tech companies have tried to build and have made the determination that it\u2019s enormously challenging,\u201d said Anthony Armstrong, co-head of technology mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley. \u201cIt\u2019s better to acquire disruptive technology than to be disrupted by that technology.\u201dLast year, the number of technology companies sold to non-tech companies surpassed those acquired by tech companies for the first time since the internet era began, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding private equity buyers, 682 tech companies were purchased by a company in an industry other than technology, while 655 were acquired by tech companies, Bloomberg\u2019s data showed.More broadly, merger activity was down in 2016. Companies around the world announced $3.6 trillion worth of deals last year, a decline of 16.6 percent from 2015, which was a record year, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. The number of deals signed rose slightly from 2015, the data showed.Of the 45,416 transactions announced last year, 6,657, or 15 percent, were acquisitions of technology companies, more than any other sector, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters on Thursday. That was in line with the proportion of technology deals in 2015.Still, many of tech\u2019s big traditional buyers were quiet last year. Four of the five largest tech companies by market capitalization did not announce any giant deals in 2016.Investment bankers expect this trend to continue this year as well. They have been fielding many calls from companies outside the tech sector wondering what shareholders might think about a potential tech acquisition.Non-tech chief executives have been found mingling at technology conferences, trying to spot their next potential target. And the assortment of so-called unicorns, or private companies valued at $1 billion or more, may be more inclined to sell this year after very few went public or sold in 2016.Only 20 technology companies went public last year, the fewest since 2009, according to Thomson Reuters. With almost 200 unicorns, there could be more exits this year if the markets hold up.One major shift as to why non-tech executives are becoming more active in tech deal making is that they have become more comfortable with the technology itself.\u201cVery rarely are management teams willing to get into businesses that they absolutely don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Scott Adelson, co-president and global co-head of corporate finance at Houlihan Lokey. \u201cSoftware and internet are so pervasive that it\u2019s no longer something that the average management team can\u2019t wrap their head around.\u201dSome companies are also trying to recast themselves as tech companies.General Electric has moved its headquarters to Boston, more of a hub for tech and start-ups than its previous home in Fairfield, Conn. The company\u2019s recent commercials feature the tagline: \u201cThe digital company. That\u2019s also an industrial company.\u201dHoneywell\u2019s incoming chief executive, Darius Adamczyk, was formerly the head of a technology company that Honeywell acquired eight years ago. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering, and a master\u2019s degree in computer engineering.Historically, non-tech companies have largely not felt comfortable paying the high prices that many tech companies can fetch. Older, mature companies tend to trade at lower valuations relative to measures like revenue and earnings, compared with young technology companies \u2014 which sometimes do not even have earnings.\u201cWhen it comes to M.&A., boards and C.E.O.s of non-tech companies have become much more fluent in the language of tech company valuations,\u201d Mr. Armstrong of Morgan Stanley said.The next challenge for many of these companies might be in integrating their tech start-ups with the main business.When traditional companies acquired small technology companies, they typically would place them in a \u201cdigital division\u201d separate from the rest of the company.That too needs to change, according to Aryeh Bourkoff, the founder and chief executive of the investment bank LionTree.\u201cTechnology should not be a division of a company. It should be integrated into every division,\u201d he said.For now, investors in traditional companies seem willing to let these companies make bets and take risks because they too know the stakes of disruption are high.\u201cShareholders are judging management teams on their ability to be bold and not just make short-term moves,\u201d Mr. Bourkoff said. \u201cThe bold C.E.O.s are the ones that play to the future.\u201dGraphic by The New York TimesAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Takes a Right Turn", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byMost tech executives and employees remain supportive of Democrats, especially on social and cultural issues. The Republican tilt of the PACs at Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook suggests, however, that as these companies\u2019 domains grow larger, their bottom-line interests are becoming increasingly aligned with the policies of the Republican Party.In 2016, the Microsoft PAC gave $478,818 to Republican House candidates and $272,000 to Democratic House candidates. It gave $164,000 to Republican Senate candidates, and $75,000 to Democratic Senate candidates.This was not small change. In 2016 Microsoft employees gave a total of $6.47 million.The firm first became a noticeable player in the world of campaign finance in 2012 when employees and the company PAC together made contributions of $910,000. That year, Facebook employees backed Democrats over Republicans 64-35, while the company\u2019s PAC tilted Republican, 53-46.By 2016, when total Facebook contributions reached $3.8 million, the Democratic advantage in employee donations shrank to 51-47, while the PAC continued to favor Republicans, 56-44.While the employees of the three other most valuable tech companies, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and Apple, remained Democratic in their giving in 2016, at the corporate level of Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 that is, at the level of their PACs \u2014 they have not.Tech giants can no longer be described as insurgents challenging corporate America.American consumer technology companies are getting larger, more entrenched in their own sectors, more powerful in new sectors and better insulated against surprising competition from upstarts.Among Ferenstein\u2019s findings: a minority, 29 percent, of tech company founders described labor unions as \u201cgood,\u201d compared to 73 percent of Democrats. Asked \u201cis meritocracy naturally unequal?\u201d tech founders overwhelmingly agreed.Ferenstein went on:One hundred percent of the smaller sample of founders to whom I presented this question said they believe that a truly meritocratic economy would be \u201cmostly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unequal. This is a key distinction: Opportunity is about maximizing people\u2019s potential, which founders tend to believe is highly unequal. Founders may value citizen contributions to society, but they don\u2019t think all citizens have the potential to contribute equally. When asked what percent of national income the top 10% would hold in such a scenario, a majority (67%) of founders believed that the richest individuals would control 50% or more of total income, while only 31% of the public believes such an outcome would occur in a meritocratic society.One of the most interesting questions posed by Ferenstein speaks to middle and working class anxieties over global competition:In international trade policy, some people believe the U.S. government should create laws that favor American business with policies that protect it from global competition, such as fees on imported goods or making it costly to hire cheaper labor in other countries (\u201coutsourcing\u201d). Others believe it would be better if there were less regulations and businesses were free to trade and compete without each country favoring their own industries. Which of these statements come closest to your belief?There was a large difference between tech company officials, 73 percent of whom chose free trade and less regulation, while only 20 percent of Democrats supported those choices.Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University who writes about demographic, social and economic trends, sees these differences as the source of deep conflict within the Democratic Party.The disruptive force is largely Silicon Valley, a natural oligarchy that now funds a party teetering toward populism and even socialism. The fundamental contradictions, as Karl Marx would have noted, lie in the collision of interests between a group that has come to epitomize self-consciously progressive mega-wealth and a mass base which is increasingly concerned about downward mobility.The tech elite, Kotkin writes, \u201cfar from deserting the Democratic Party, more likely will aim take to take it over.\u201d Until very recently, theconflict between populists and tech oligarchs has been muted, in large part due to common views on social issues like gay marriage and, to some extent, environmental protection. But as the social issues fade, having been \u201cwon\u201d by progressives, the focus necessarily moves to economics, where the gap between these two factions is greatest.Kotkin sees future partisan machination in cynical terms:One can expect the oligarchs to seek out a modus vivendi with the populists. They could exchange a regime of higher taxes and regulation for ever-expanding crony capitalist opportunities and political protection. As the hegemons of today, Facebook and Google, not to mention Apple and Amazon, have an intense interest in protecting themselves, for example, from antitrust legislation. History is pretty clear: Heroic entrepreneurs of one decade often turn into the insider capitalists of the next.In 2016, Donald Trump has produced an upheaval within the Republican Party that shifted attention away from the less explosive turmoil in Democratic ranks.Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed bid to finesse the inherent conflict between her dependence on corporate contributions and her need for a strong turnout by union workers, minorities and idealistic millennials embodies the Democratic Party\u2019s long term struggle.The public, at least for the moment, is not willing to support the continued compromise of principle that has been a hallmark of both parties. Trump has provided a temporary solution for the Republican Party; the Democrats need to find a legitimate and more lasting one.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Exercise Can Be a Boon to People With Parkinson\u2019s Disease", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byPersonal HealthSusan Sills, a Brooklyn artist who until recently made life-size cutouts on plywood using a power saw, long suspected she might be at risk for developing Parkinson\u2019s disease. Both her mother and grandfather had this neurological movement disorder, and she knew that it sometimes runs in families.So she was not surprised when at age 72 she first noticed hand tremors and a neurologist confirmed that she had the disease. But to watch her in action three years later, it would be hard for a layperson to tell. She stands straight, walks briskly, speaks in clarion tones and maintains a schedule that could tire someone half her age.Having wisely put the power saw aside, Ms. Sills now makes intricately designed art jewelry. She is also a docent at the Brooklyn Museum, participates in a cooperative art gallery and assists her husband\u2019s business by entertaining customers.Ms. Sills attributes her energy and well-being partly to the medication she takes but primarily to the hours she spends working out with a physical therapist and personal trainer, who have helped her develop an exercise regimen that, while not a cure, can alleviate Parkinson\u2019s symptoms and slow progression of the disease.\u201cThe exercises opened me up,\u201d said Ms. Sills, allowing such symptoms as small steps, slow movements and tiny, cramped handwriting to subside.\u201cThe earlier people begin exercising after a Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis, and the higher the intensity of exercise they achieve, the better they are,\u201d Marilyn Moffat, a physical therapist on the faculty of New York University, said. \u201cMany different activities have been shown to be beneficial, including cycling, boxing, dancing and walking forward and backward on a treadmill. If someone doesn\u2019t like one activity, there are others that can have equally good results.\u201dUnfortunately, Dr. Moffat added, \u201cno one tells people with Parkinson\u2019s what they could and should be doing unless they get to a physical therapist.\u201d The typical delay in starting an effective exercise program also stems from the ability of medication to alleviate early symptoms, leaving patients with little incentive to exercise.While everyone can benefit from exercise, it is especially important for people with a progressive movement disorder like Parkinson\u2019s that can result in weakness, stiffness, difficulty walking, poor balance and falls, as well as impaired cognitive processing. Regular exercise bestows increased levels of fitness; a greater sense of well-being; stronger muscles and bones; healthier joints; more efficient breathing; and better digestion and blood circulation. The result is enhanced physical, mental and cognitive health, all of which are especially important to people with a chronic ailment.For Parkinson\u2019s patients in particular, regular exercise tailored to their needs can result in better posture; less stiffness; improved flexibility of muscles and joints; faster and safer walking ability; less difficulty performing the tasks of daily living; and an overall higher quality of life.Patients who participate in exercise programs designed to mitigate symptoms and perhaps delay progression of Parkinson\u2019s \u201ccan function independently at a higher level, have stronger feelings of well-being, and are happier about their quality of life,\u201d said Dr. Moffat, who has witnessed major improvements in people she\u2019s worked with.In a report on their work in Physical Therapy, the journal of the American Physical Therapy Association, Dr. King and Dr. Horak explained that intense exercise can improve \u201cplasticity\u201d of the brain, protect against nervous system degeneration, and even reverse motor deficits.Another program, called Rock Steady Boxing, was founded by Scott C. Newman, a former prosecutor in Marion County, Ind., who developed Parkinson\u2019s at age 40. He reported significant improvements in his physical health, agility, daily functioning and quality of life shortly after he began high-energy workouts doing boxing moves a few years after his diagnosis.Mr. Newman has pointed out that Parkinson\u2019s is not a muscle wasting disease. Rather, the brain forgets how to tell the muscles what to do. He believed it should be possible to teach the brain to get muscles to work more effectively, which is what Rock Steady Boxing and other exercise programs for Parkinson\u2019s disease seem to have achieved.While it is best to begin a challenging exercise program early in the disease, Dr. Moffat and Mr. Newman say it can help at any stage. Rock Steady Boxing, for example, has created training programs suited to fitness levels at all stages of Parkinson\u2019s.Another personal experience, by a cross-country cyclist, resulted in a tandem cycling program for Parkinson\u2019s patients. In a 200-mile trip across Iowa in 2003, Jay Alberts, a biomedical engineer at the Cleveland Clinic, pedaled in the lead position with a woman who has Parkinson\u2019s. The pace he set forced her to pedal a third faster than she would have done on her own. The woman\u2019s tremors disappeared while she was pedaling with Dr. Alberts, and he later showed in a controlled study that the ability of forced pedaling to suppress Parkinson\u2019s symptoms can persist for weeks afterward.The exercise program that has mainly helped Ms. Sills, called L.S.V.T. BIG, evolved from the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment program \u2013 L.S.V.T. LOUD \u2014 created to improve the speech of Parkinson\u2019s patients, who tend to talk more and more softly. Developed specifically to counter the unique movement impairments associated with Parkinson\u2019s, it trains patients to \u201cmake big strong movements, not little weak ones,\u201d Ms. Sills said, for example, taking big steps and swinging your arms widely when you walk. \u201cThis is the normal way to walk, but not when you have Parkinson\u2019s, but it no longer feels strange to me,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the affiliation of Laurie A. King and Fay B. Horak. They are at Oregon Health and Sciences University, not the Cleveland Clinic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Ambivalence Toward Trump Turns to Anger", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Friday morning, Silicon Valley was largely ambivalent about President Trump. The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration.By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination.In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades.Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the 10th-richest man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He good-naturedly obliged.The tech companies\u2019 reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did.That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump\u2019s order proclaimed that \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d and would be suspended indefinitely.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said that his great-grandparents had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam.Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was \u201cnot the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201d Mr. Musk was born in South Africa.Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, \u201cthere was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is.\u201dBeyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world.\u201cAlmost every company\u2019s products \u2014 Google, Apple, Airbnb \u2014 has a global customer base,\u201d Mr. Levie said. \u201cThese policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors.\u201dBy early last week, the companies sensed trouble.Murtadha al-Tameemi, 24, an Iraqi-born software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out.\u201cIt may be my na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how politics and industries interact, but I don\u2019t interpret the tech community\u2019s opposition to the president as a political stance,\u201d Mr. Tameemi said. \u201cIt seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them.\u201dThe larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was \u201cconcerned.\u201d Apple said, \u201cIt is not a policy we support.\u201d Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards\u201d and said it would create \u201ccollateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dIt was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. \u201cIt feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,\u201d said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One.Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists.Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media.Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory team.That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day.In an email to employees on Saturday titled \u201cStanding up for what\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday.As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers \u2014 largely immigrants \u2014 began a one-hour work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order.Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen.\u201cAfter the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,\u201d Mr. Altman said. \u201cNow they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come.\u201dMr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p.m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump May Not Like Alternative Energy, but Investors Should", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersGIVEN what President-elect Donald J. Trump has said about his energy strategy \u2014 he favors coal and wants to end federal subsidies to the clean energy industry \u2014 does it still make sense to invest in wind, solar and other alternative sources of power?The answer is an emphatic yes, according to investment advisers, who say clean energy companies will continue to thrive during a Trump administration, regardless of what the president says or does. The sector has become as much about getting returns on investments and catching the next technological boom as it is about reducing greenhouse gases and helping the environment.And clean energy is creating jobs in every state, not just the ones that have oil or gas in the ground. Even the most politically conservative states, like Kansas and Iowa, are leaders in wind power and are likely to continue investing in it.\u201cNo longer is there a trade-off between what you believe in and what you can make money off of,\u201d said Nancy Pfund, a founder and managing partner of DBL Partners, which made early investments in SolarCity and Tesla.She predicts that investors \u201care going to redouble their efforts to migrate their portfolios to a 21st-century energy economy.\u201d Even without subsidies, she said, alternative energy sources will be well positioned to compete with coal and other carbon spewers.\u201cIt really has to do with the cost of wind, solar and electric cars compared to where we were 12 years ago,\u201d Ms. Pfund said.But the challenge for all investors during the Trump administration and beyond will be to make sure that passions for change and innovation, or anger at environmental policies that favor fossil fuels, do not cloud sound investment analysis.\u201cRecently, people have taken the green mandate and said, \u2018You need to invest in the future,\u2019\u201d said Chat Reynders, the chief executive and chairman of Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, a $1.3 billion asset-management firm. \u201cPeople have chased some investments that weren\u2019t timely or were not quality investments in order to participate.\u201dFor example, back in the 1970s, some investors were eager to back manufacturers of solar panels. But what was then a cutting-edge technology with high barriers to entry is now a commodity, with prices dropping as more manufacturers enter the market. This is good for the consumer, but not great for investors in the panel makers.\u201cYou can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle when it comes to the economics driving solar, wind and battery storage,\u201d said Thomas Van Dyck, managing director in the SRI Wealth Management Group at RBC Wealth Management.\u201cThe economics are such that in California, wind and solar are the cheapest form of power you can put in place,\u201d Mr. Van Dyck said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a long-term investor, you need to look at these long-term trends.\u201dDespite the economic forces lining up behind clean energy, investors and analysts caution that people interested in investing in this area should be prepared for a rough ride in the short term.\u201cIf you\u2019re a long-term investor and looking out five to 10 years, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Mr. Van Dyck said. \u201cIt\u2019s like looking at Intel or Microsoft in the 1990s \u2014 they had some cyclical issues, but look at them today.\u201dR. Paul Herman, the chief executive of HIP Investor, an investment rater and portfolio manager, said investors looking for broad guidance should keep three things in mind. They should look for companies that are trying to save money and reduce risk through clean energy. This is the Walmart example.They should monitor their investments in fossil-fuel producers closely, lest their stocks plummet again as renewable energy gets cheaper and the value of their reserves diminishes. And those with a longer-term investment horizon and a higher tolerance for risk should look for companies focused on energy innovations.The last is the holy grail. Ms. Pfund\u2019s firm, DBL Partners, had great success investing in Tesla and SolarCity, but she said she was not looking to mimic those investments today.\u201cThe last thing I\u2019m going to do is keep investing in the same old, same old,\u201d she said. \u201cThe venture-backed electric car company was a smart investment 10 years ago, but today it\u2019s things like storage \u2014 the batteries in a Tesla or stationary storage \u2014 that are going to play a huge role in the electric grid of the future.\u201dWith storage, the energy created by the sun and wind can be used on demand \u2014 or on cloudy, calm days.Mr. Reynders said he was steering clear of solar panels but liked companies that install the panels. He also said he thought the Trump administration would be good for alternative-energy investment, though not as its cheerleader. If the administration follows through on Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to cut clean-energy subsidies, it could force a shakeout in the industry and prompt investors to pay closer attention to company fundamentals.For investors with a greater appetite for risk, there are certainly longer-term energy investments. One is graphene, a superthin, incredibly strong material that can be used as a conductor. Its promise is for batteries of the future, and probably much more.William Page, portfolio manager for global environmental opportunities strategy at Essex Investment Management, said he saw the potential in investing in graphene but was avoiding it for now.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to invest in a technology that might work in the lab today but it\u2019s not something that is a viable investment today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want something that is profitable today.\u201dLike Mr. Reynders, Mr. Page thinks that companies that install solar panels are a good investment. He also likes LED lighting installation \u2014 not the exactly the sexiest clean energy investment, but one that is environmentally sound and profitable today.At the opposite end of the risk spectrum, Matthew Weatherley-White, co-founder and managing director at the Caprock Group, said people could make alternative energy investments in themselves, as it were.\u201cSay you have $10,000,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to invest in a solar panel company or in a solar array for your house?\u201dOf course, it depends on whether you are a city or country dweller. \u201cIn Idaho, where I live, there\u2019s 6 percent internal rate of return for a solar array, so you get paid back in 18 years,\u201d Mr. Weatherley-White said. \u201cThat might not blow the socks off as an investment, but it\u2019s pretty predictable.\u201dIn places like California, where state policies favor solar power, that rate of return could be three to four times what it is in Idaho, he said. Still, it comes down to a question every investor should ask: \u201cWhere am I going to invest for a positive financial return and an environmental impact?\u201dAnd in the United States, it is the states rather than the federal government that may wield the greatest influence over the clean-energy sector. \u201cWhile the Trump victory for some was disturbing or took the wind out of their sails,\u201d Ms. Pfund said, \u201cthe federal government can only do so much.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They have been edited and condensed.\u201cI thought I was impervious to scams since I had installed security software from a known, trusted company (\u2018ABC\u2019).\u201cTwo months ago ABC sent me an email saying that I didn\u2019t have adequate protection on my system. The email asked me to download a new module to update my security package. Not even thinking remotely about potential problems with this approach, I did as they asked. But the module wouldn\u2019t install, and it gave me an error code and a number to call. Not only that, but I was called several times from someone claiming to be their representative who would help me with this problem. So I called them back and was connected to \u2018Chris Coleman,\u2019 a fellow with a deep accent who spoke broken English. \u2018Chris\u2019 told me he needed to \u2018take control\u2019 of my system to search for viruses. Long story short, I finally tumbled to the truth when Chris asked me for my credit card to \u2018buy\u2019 some new, improved security software!\u201d\u201cMy 82-year-old mother, whose memory and judgment are fading, has been getting calls from \u2018Windows tech support\u2019 for a couple years. I keep telling her to just hang up, it\u2019s a scam, but she keeps talking to them. So far they only got $300, but last month there were a couple close calls. One guy took control of her computer and tried to have her sign up for online banking (she called me before they got any money). I am taking steps to limit her access to her money. This is the only way to protect someone like her from these awful scams.\u201d\u201cAshamed, for what the youth of my country has got themselves into. I hope such scammers are busted as early as possible. It\u2019s not just American citizens; international students are also targeted. My cousin was duped of 3,000 Australian dollars and another one of $4,000.\u201d\u201cMy 90-year-old father was tormented by these people for a year. He believed they were going to fix his computer, and he gave them his log in and password. And he paid them for lifetime service on his PC.\u201cThen they started calling and threatening him to send more money. Said they would destroy his PC. I had Montgomery County police (in Maryland) come to the house and provided them the contact info. They said they see this all the time and there was \u2018nothing they could do.\u2019\u201cI told them I had contacted the F.T.C. but there was no one to speak with \u2014 only a \u2018contact us\u2019 form \u2014 as if that would help.\u201cI begged Dad to stop answering the phone, but he didn\u2019t because he\u2019s lonely and that\u2019s what his generation does when the phone rings.\u201cReturned after a three-day trip to find receipts on the table for $300 worth of iTunes cards. Dad doesn\u2019t even know what iTunes is.\u201cSo a feeling of total helplessness. No legal authority in this country is able to protect our elderly from this kind of fraud.\u201d\u201cBeing the victim of financial fraud is often one of the first signs that someone is suffering from this disease [dementia]. Caller ID is of no use to someone who is beginning to lose their faculties.\u201cI watched my father deal with this on a daily basis for six years, screening phone calls, intercepting letters from fraudulent charities and contests (an average of about six per day), and doing other things to protect a relative with dementia.\u201cOne called back and told him to look out his front window; he was about to be killed by someone waiting outside.\u201d\u201cAs a young man I was trained as a collections agent by a major retailer. I was taught all manner of tactics to get people to pay their bills. We were paid a bonus and promoted if we got tough. There was no Fair Debt Collections Practices Act then, but still there were laws and our employer taught us to ignore them. I helped set up call centers in Madras, Bangalore and Bombay, so far back those places still had those old names.\u201cOver the years I\u2019ve also interviewed for jobs in the U.S. that involve scamming people over the phone. Never took the job, though. This kind of fraud doesn\u2019t just originate overseas. We need a stronger Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, yet the president-elect wants to gut the office.\u201d\u201cI do not ever, ever, ever answer a call from a number I don\u2019t recognize \u2014 ever, not at home, not on my cell, not at work. If it\u2019s important, and genuine, the caller usually leaves a message, and I return the call if I choose.\u201d\u201cOne time, with one of these I.R.S. Treasury calls, I was particularly incensed, knowing that these scammers were going to victimize more gullible people. So I called them back, and lectured the guy who answered. He hung up. So I called back again \u2014 and lucky me, the same guy answered the phone. Again, another lecture, and I worked to shame him as much as I could. He hung up.\u201cYeah, I called again \u2014 and, again, the same guy. This time I pointed out to him the sad futility of his life, pointing out how he clearly had some basic skills \u2014 good enunciation, good tone of voice \u2014 and how he could be working a legitimate job if he wanted to, yet he was pursuing life as a scam artist. He broke down crying, saying he had to pay his bills. But he got no sympathy from me.\u201d\u201cI was able to get the Microsoft scammers to stop by saying in a stern voice \u2018O.K., Detective \u2014 you\u2019re on the line? This is the fraudulent call I want you to trace,\u2019 and pressing any button on the keypad, which emits a tone that sounds like the start of a recording.\u201cI am convinced they target older people, thinking we are too stupid to realize these are phony calls.\u201d\u201cI get the \u2018Microsoft Support\u2019 calls fairly regularly. The usual pitch, \u2018We have detected that your PC is infected \u2026\u2019 My response is to play along: \u2018Oh, no! No, I am not in front of my PC right now \u2026,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going to put the phone down while my PC boots up \u2026\u2019\u201cThen I just put the phone down. I wait until I hear the scammer shouting themselves hoarse for me to come back to the phone.\u201cThen I ask them if their mother knows that they are working as a scammer. That\u2019s when they curse and hang up.\u201d\u201cThe approach I use when receiving such scamming phone calls is to say: Please give me your phone number and location, and I will have my attorney call you.\u201d\u201cIt happens in Canada, too. I was getting dozens of calls a day \u2014 really annoying as I work from home a lot. I let them go to voice mail except for once where I told the guy where to go. OMG! He really got mad. We\u2019re urged to report such incidents to the police. However, nothing stops it.\u201d\u201cGot a call from an Andrew McGowen, supposedly an F.B.I. agent informing me that my I.R.S. tax issues will cause me to be arrested in the next 24 hours if I did not send a gift card loaded with $2,500 immediately. His heavily accented English didn\u2019t seem right for someone of Irish heritage.\u201cHaving a little fun, I wasted as much of his time as I could, ending with a question: \u2018How is the weather in Mumbai today?\u2019 Silence.\u201d\u201cEvery week I get two or three early-morning scam calls from India, and I am sick of them. I get either the I.R.S. scam or the Microsoft computer virus scam. They have given me very negative feelings toward India.\u201d\u201cWhen I hear an Indian voice on the phone, I immediately distrust whoever it is. That is sad. These people are doing no service for their own country. They are giving India a bad reputation.\u201d\u201cI was the lucky recipient of probably 100 of these calls over several years, and I watched the scam evolve, with interest. At first, it was laughable: Guys with heavy accents, claiming to be \u2018Steve Martin\u2019 (seriously?), using language that was very British-influenced and awkward-sounding. After about three years, the caller became an educated sounding Indian woman, with the language and agency names considerably cleaned up. Then, the messages became computer generated so no accents and no names.\u201cI think we\u2019re unlikely to get smarter, but they can only get better at scamming.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed comments to one reader, Ellen D.

{"Headline": "Is Your Digital Life Ready for Your Death?", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byYou\u2019ve probably thought about what will happen to your finances, your possessions and maybe even your real estate when you die. But what about your Facebook account? Or your hard-drive backups?For the past two decades, most of us in the modern world have gradually shifted our central living space online. That\u2019s 20-ish years of documenting our real-life experiences while also creating entirely new versions of ourselves in countless places online.These digital lives are basically immortal, so you may as well figure out while you\u2019re still alive what will happen to them after you\u2019re gone.There are two main things to consider: What will happen to your accounts and what will happen to the data contained therein. For example, you can give someone authority to delete your Google account and to download all your photos stored there after you die.It\u2019s a grim thought, but like writing a last will and testament, this has become just another part of death preparation.Many online spaces offer some form of death planning. But this is still a relatively new concept, and some of the most popular destinations on the internet don\u2019t give users a way to plan for their death. In that case, it\u2019s best to establish a plan now with a trusted loved one.For the websites and services that do offer help, here\u2019s what to know.This person will be able to write a post that will remain at the top of your profile, update your profile photo and respond to friend requests. You can also allow that person to download an archive of your public activity (including posts, photos and \u201clikes\u201d), but he or she can\u2019t read your messages, so your most intimate secrets will be safe.Alternatively, you can set your account to delete everything once Facebook is notified of your death.To set this up, choose an amount of time between sign-ins for your account to be designated \u201cinactive.\u201d Once that threshold is met (for example, you don\u2019t sign into any Google service for a certain number of months), your chosen contact will get a prewritten email from you with, presumably, your wishes for your account.Unlike your legacy contact on Facebook, you can designate this person to have full access to your Google account, including email and chat histories, and he or she can download the data you specify. (You also have the option not to give that person access to any of it.)Google also allows you to delete your account and all its data.A similar protocol is in place in the event a user becomes incapacitated, though in that case someone will have to have proof of power of attorney.These three networks offer no type of death planning, though all offer some form of account management for the deceased.Snapchat said it can delete the account of a deceased person at the request of a next-of-kin (with a death certificate).And Tumblr will let a next-of-kin request that an account be deleted.Snapchat and Tumblr declined to say whether they\u2019ll eventually add a similar legacy-contact feature, and LinkedIn said it\u2019s \u201cconsidering\u201d some form of death planning or account memorialization.Beyond that, many sites (including Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL) have relatively standard protocols in place for immediate family members to request the deletion of a deceased person\u2019s account.Online data storage is an especially tricky part of death planning. The industrywide push for privacy and encryption, while great for personal protection, has created its own problems.\u201cThere\u2019s a very real security and privacy implication that can somewhat conflict\u201d with online death planning, said Ahin Thomas, the vice president of marketing for Backblaze, an online backup service. \u201cIf you set up a private encryption key \u2014 we\u2019re not joking \u2014 we don\u2019t have access.\u201dIn one recent case, a widow contacted the company for access to her late husband\u2019s backups, but the data was inaccessible because it had been encrypted.\u201cIt was heartbreaking and sad, and I wish we could\u2019ve done something,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cBut the stuff was encrypted.\u201dSo what can we do? The best advice, Mr. Thomas said, is to simply give the keys to your data to someone you trust. (Some backup services have protocols in place for this. Check with yours.)Advertisement"}

In a filing on Thursday with securities regulators related to its quarterly financial results, Microsoft included new language related to immigration.\u201cChanges to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts,\u201d the company said in the filing.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in a statement that the company believes \u201cin a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system and in broader immigration opportunities for talented and law-abiding young people like the Dreamers,\u201d a reference to young people who entered the country illegally as children but were allowed to remain by President Barack Obama.\u201cWe are a nation of immigrants, and we all benefit when the best and brightest from around the world can live, work and contribute here,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cI hope we find the courage and compassion to bring people together and make this world a better place for everyone.\u201dThe technology industry is open to changes that have been proposed by members of Congress to better enforce the skilled worker program and adjust limits on the number of visas. But the companies see skilled worker visas as a signature policy issue that they have fought to protect and expand.They fear Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, and others in the administration will take a more severe approach to immigration and sweep up H-1B visas into prohibitions on refugees and stronger border protection.\u201cThe effect would end up being exactly the opposite of what Trump wants. Companies would go offshore like Microsoft did with Vancouver, Canada\u201d to seek talent, said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research group sponsored by several tech firms.But Mr. Trump has made it increasingly clear that immigration policy may change drastically.Any changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, initiated under the Obama administration, could have significant effects on current tech employees who fear for their status.\u201cRight now, we are focused on making sure for protections for 750,000 Dreamers who have DACA stay in place,\u201d said Todd Schulte, president of Fwd.us, in an interview. \u201cIf the goal is to increase public safety and prevent future illegal immigration, the way to do that is to modernize the legal immigration process. That\u2019s radically different than a large-scale ramp-up of rapid deportation.\u201dThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Where Does Cloud Storage Really Reside? And Is It Secure?\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byAsk The TimesA reader asks: \u201cWhere does cloud storage really reside? And is it secure?\u201d_____\u201cCloud\u201d data is stored on hard drives (much the way data is usually stored). And yes, it\u2019s probably more secure than conventionally stored data.What makes cloud storage different? Instead of being stored directly on your own personal device (the hard drive on your laptop, for example, or your phone), cloud-based data is stored elsewhere \u2014 on servers owned by big companies, usually \u2014 and is made accessible to you via the internet.When people think of cloud computing, they often think of internet-connected public clouds run by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. (If you use Gmail, Dropbox or Microsoft\u2019s Office 365, you are using a cloud service.) There are also consumer clouds that, for example, hold your pictures and social media posts (think of Facebook or Twitter), or store your music and email (think of Apple or Google).Each of these companies has cloud computing systems \u2014 computer servers and storage devices, connected with computer networking equipment \u2014 that span the globe. (Facebook\u2019s systems can allow more than one billion people to interact with them.) Your data is in their computers, usually stored in a regional data center close to where you live.Individual companies can also have their own clouds, called private clouds, that employees and customers access, usually over the internet and on their own private networks.Storage aside, computing clouds can also process information differently; they have special software that enables workloads to be shared among different machines. Your Facebook photos, for example, don\u2019t have a permanent home on a specific chip, but may move among computers.That is a big deal. When workloads are shared, computers can run closer to full capacity, with several programs going at the same time. It\u2019s much more efficient than stand-alone computers running one job at a time.For the people running the computers, it doesn\u2019t really matter where the data or the programs are at any one moment: The stuff is running inside a \u201ccloud\u201d of computing capability. Ideally, if one machine fails, the operation moves over to another part of the system with little downtime.Nowadays, computing clouds are everywhere \u2014 which is one reason people worry about their security. We hear more and more often about hackers coming over the internet and looting the data of thousands of people.Most of those attacks hit traditional servers, though. None of the most catastrophic hacks have been on the big public clouds.The same way that your money is probably safer mixed up with other people\u2019s money in a bank vault than it is sitting alone in your dresser drawer, your data may actually be safer in the cloud: It\u2019s got more protection from bad guys.In the case of the big public clouds, the protection is the work of some of the world\u2019s best computer scientists, hired out of places like the National Security Agency and Stanford University to think hard about security, data encryption and the latest online fraud.And they\u2019re pretty good at keeping things safe online.At least, they have been so far.__________Have a question for Ask The Times?

{"Headline": "Dumping a Bad App? Tips for a Painless Breakup", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byTech FixEVERYONE is familiar with this scenario: An app you once loved no longer brings the same joy. It\u2019s gotten buggy over time, or an update transformed it to the point it became unusable.Chances are you thought about calling it quits. But after years of sharing your personal data with this app, you probably gave up and stayed in this stale relationship. You put up with the productivity-killing bugs and odd design changes because moving to a new, potentially better app felt harder than sticking with the bad one.Even so, people have stuck with Evernote partly because taking their notes elsewhere is hardly easy.\u201dWe understand those kind of changes don\u2019t make everyone happy,\u201d said Greg Chiemingo, an Evernote spokesman. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve seen continued growth of paying customers over the last two years.\u201dPeople deserve better than this. Every day you stay with a bad app is time you could be spending with a superior product that will make life better. Here are my tips, based on interviews and personal experience, for a clean break.No app is perfect, but you have to draw the line somewhere. The problem is, you may be in such a rut that you can\u2019t recognize the warning signs.An obvious one is when an app stops working reliably in a way that affects your life. For instance, I called it quits on Apple\u2019s Calendar app when I was planning a dinner with friends last month and the software sent a calendar invite in Greenwich Mean Time rather than Pacific Standard Time. As a result, one person thought we were meeting on Saturday instead of Friday and didn\u2019t show up. (It wasn\u2019t the first time this happened, either.)Brian Fitzpatrick, a former manager at Google who led a team that developed tools to help people move their data to and from Google, said he dumps an app when it has stopped improving.\u201cIt\u2019s still functioning, but you don\u2019t see any changes in it for a very long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a zombie app, I would call it at that point.\u201dAnother sign that it\u2019s time to move on is when you have nobody to talk to. Many popular apps for tasks like note taking, photo management and word processing are connected to social networks, or people you can share data with. If an app\u2019s audience is a ghost town \u2014 like Yahoo\u2019s photo-sharing app, Flickr, which sank in popularity after mobile photo-sharing services like Instagram emerged \u2014 then it\u2019s probably time to leave.Yahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Flickr.The hardest part of breaking up with an app is moving your data. So as a rule of thumb, save a backup copy of your data so that you can export it into a new app. Then carefully search for a better app to suit your needs.As a safety measure before changing apps, you should always keep extra copies of your data somewhere, whether it be in the cloud with a service like Dropbox or on a physical hard drive.Some companies deliberately make exporting your data difficult because they want you to stick around.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like moving into an apartment and finding out at the end of the lease you can\u2019t take your furniture and your books with you,\u201d Mr. Fitzpatrick said.Evernote is a good example. It includes an \u201cExport notes\u201d feature, but it only lets you export notes into two formats that are compatible with just a few other note-taking apps. Microsoft\u2019s note-taking app OneNote, along with Apple\u2019s Notes app, can easily import Evernote records. But if your app of choice is something else, such as Google Keep, you will have to manually paste your notes in the new app.Flickr is also difficult to part ways with. Getting out your photos requires lots of manual labor: You have to download all the photos, which can take a significant amount of time if you have thousands of high-resolution images, and then upload them to a new photo service.When companies don\u2019t provide convenient tools to export your data, look elsewhere by doing a quick web search for solutions. There are plenty of people in the same boat as you, and chances are they have written scripts, or lightweight programs, to automatically pull out your data for you.If there is no convenient way to export your data, sometimes it doesn\u2019t hurt to just take out what is most important to you. Perhaps you don\u2019t need five-year-old notes from Evernote anymore, so you could just manually paste your latest memos and get a fresh start with a different app.On the bright side, you can learn a lot from a tough breakup with an app \u2014 which can be especially useful when looking for a replacement.The biggest lessons: Pick a tool that supports a wide array of formats instead of proprietary ones. And before you commit to a new app, make sure it is as easy to get out as it is to get in.Ditching Apple\u2019s Calendar app was fairly easy. All my calendar data was already stored online and Apple\u2019s app supports calendars from multiple online services including Google, Microsoft and Facebook. The key was finding an app that also supported those services but performed better.After testing several apps, I decided that Fantastical 2, a new app with a cleaner interface for getting a glance at calendar events, was the best one. Once Fantastical 2 was installed, I added my Google calendar accounts to load all my events into the app.Google said it updated Google Voice on Monday with photo sharing and group messaging. But that was too late to keep people like Mr. Fitzpatrick.\u201cA lot of it comes down to, How interested are you in change?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Work to Limit Mergers May Stop With Trump Administration", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A nascent effort by the Obama administration to limit corporate consolidation, begun after officials concluded that a lack of competition was hurting the American economy, appears to be coming to an abrupt end as the Trump administration takes charge.President-elect Donald J. Trump railed against media company mergers on the campaign trail, promising to block the proposed combination of AT&T and Time Warner, but conservatives and liberals alike say they see no evidence Mr. Trump will be worried about the continuing rise of megacompanies in other parts of the economy once he takes office.\u201cSo far the pattern seems to be a pretty traditional deregulatory agenda, which is at odds with the campaign but not at odds with the Republican Party,\u201d said K. Sabeel Rahman, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School who writes about antitrust issues. \u201cSo I\u2019m pretty skeptical that there will be an aggressive push on these issues.\u201dOn President Obama\u2019s watch, companies have combined at a frantic pace in recent years, although the dollar volume of mergers fell slightly in 2016 after reaching record heights in 2015.And some experts see evidence that less competition may be weighing on economic growth, letting companies hold down wages and reduce investment in innovation, a conclusion seconded by the Obama White House last year.\u201cConsumers and workers would benefit from additional policy actions by the government to promote competition,\u201d according to a report released by the White House in April.The new administration will inherit oversight of a number of deals in progress. The Justice Department is suing to prevent a pair of mergers uniting health insurers \u2014 Anthem with Cigna, and Aetna with Humana. The Federal Trade Commission, which also oversees competition, has taken a particular interest in hospital mergers.Also looming is the AT&T merger with Time Warner, which Mr. Trump promised to prevent.\u201cAs an example of the power structure I\u2019m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it\u2019s too much concentration of power,\u201d he said after the deal was announced in October.Mr. Trump has privately reiterated his opposition to the deal in recent weeks, but his objections are seen as case-specific, rooted in his tense relationship with CNN, rather than representative of any broader views about corporate combinations.Companies pursuing mergers may see an opportunity in reaching out to Mr. Trump directly. The cellular phone companies Sprint and T-Mobile flirted with a merger in 2014, but backed down when the Obama administration signaled concerns about further consolidation in the industry, which already is dominated by a few big players.A change in administration can affect individual cases. The George W. Bush administration, for example, quickly wrapped up the Clinton administration\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, and on lenient terms. Presidents can also exert illicit influence, as when President Richard M. Nixon scuttled a federal antitrust lawsuit against International Telephone and Telegraph, a major contributor to his campaign.For his part, Mr. Sessions said in response to a question at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that he had \u201cno hesitation to enforce antitrust laws.\u201d He added, \u201cThere will not be political influence in this process.\u201dIn one important respect, Mr. Trump has said that he is determined to reduce competition: He has repeatedly promised to reduce imports from foreign countries. Economists have long viewed free trade as one of the most important checks on the market power of domestic companies. It was the availability of Japanese and German cars, for example, that forced American car companies to pay attention to quality. Reduced foreign competition could help to increase the wages of American workers, but at the expense of higher prices and less innovation.The government\u2019s approach to antitrust enforcement shifted sharply in the early 1980s, with the adoption of economic tools to evaluate mergers. Instead of assuming bigger was bad, the government increasingly sought evidence that consumers would be harmed by higher prices. The result was an era of consolidation as the government basically gave corporations the benefit of the doubt.In its April report, the White House Council of Economic Advisers highlighted evidence that older and more established firms were increasingly profitable, while business creation was in decline, suggesting a dearth of competition.\u201cWe have a growing body of empirical evidence that suggests very strongly that there\u2019s a relationship between increased market concentration and various measures of economic inequality or declining economic dynamism,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. The culprit? \u201cA couple decades of lax and spotty enforcement,\u201d he said.\u201cThere is this big difference between the rhetoric at the top and the day-in, day-out practice in the trenches of antitrust,\u201d said Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University. \u201cEven though there may be some vaguely more pro-enforcement mind-set, a lot of mergers have been approved over the last eight years.\u201d\u201cIf we required particularized and quantified proof of consumer harm in every case, we would simply make it more difficult to stop harmful conduct,\u201d she said.But whatever might have come of that line of logic is now likely to be nipped in the bud. Alden Abbott, a longtime F.T.C. official and now a Heritage Foundation fellow, said he expected the Trump administration to affirm the status quo.\u201cGiven what happened in the election, any thought that a new head of the agency would try to come up with an enforcement policy less focused on economics and facts and more focused on notions of fairness, I think that\u2019s not very likely,\u201d he said.Two years later, Mr. Trump, then the owner of several casinos, was the defendant in an antitrust action. He paid a $750,000 civil penalty to settle charges that he had purchased stock in two rival casino operators without telling regulators.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Alexa Fits Into Amazon\u2019s Prime Directive", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyWhen \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation\u201d first aired in the 1980s, it envisioned a number of technological advances for humankind\u2019s future. Set in the 24th century, the show featured 3-D printers, visors that could provide artificial sight and a virtual reality simulator called the holodeck. But perhaps its most prescient creation was the supercomputer onboard the ship. The software \u2014 usually referred to only as \u201cComputer\u201d \u2014 could locate people, open doors and retrieve answers to complicated questions. Crew members spoke their requests, and an always-present helper responded within seconds.Amazon brought a version of that computer to life recently \u2014 albeit a few centuries earlier than \u201cStar Trek\u201d predicted. Last July, David Limp, a company executive who works on the product, said in an interview with Fortune that the idea of an all-knowing machine, with access to all the world\u2019s information, had captured his imagination since the first time he saw it on television. It took, he said, a team of 1,000 engineers to write its code, and when the device was finished, Amazon decided to call it Alexa, shorthand for Alexandria, as in the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt. It is designed to work primarily with a suite of wireless speakers, also made by Amazon, called Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.The company bills Alexa as a smart personal assistant, one that can play your favorite song or read you a book or recite a recipe as you cook. You can also make purchases through Amazon simply by asking. The possibilities are seemingly endless, because Alexa can learn new \u201cskills\u201d (as Amazon likes to call them) from third-party developers who integrate Alexa into their own products. And developers have leapt at the opportunity to do so: At the beginning of 2016, there were 135 skills designed to work with Alexa, but this year that number increased to more than 7,000. Alexa can now order you an Uber or a pizza, check your bank balance, control your TV, turn your lights on and off and even measure your car\u2019s carbon-dioxide emissions. \u201c\u2009\u2018Alexa, buy me coffee\u2019 is just a fraction of what it\u2019s going to be over time,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an internet analyst who covers Amazon for the equities firm Macquarie Securities. \u201cWhat can they improve with the voice activation? Some of that has yet to be seen.\u201dAlexa has already evolved from an experimental device to an irresistible household fixture \u2014 perhaps surprisingly, given Amazon\u2019s spotty track record with hardware. Kindle e-readers are popular, but the company\u2019s attempt at a smartphone flopped hard. Schachter told me that part of Alexa\u2019s success was luck, in that there were few other shiny consumer offerings on the market this holiday season and the price point was affordable. But something about the future-feel of this device, its ease and convenience, has captivated a mass audience, even the most privacy-conscious among us. Alexa is always listening, ready to be of service. (This has already backfired: When a newscaster relayed a story about a little girl using her Alexa to order a dollhouse, it triggered dozens of Alexas in the homes of people watching the broadcast to also try to order one.)Five years ago, few would have guessed that Amazon would already be ahead of the top tech companies vying to be leaders in home automation. But Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of the company, has been shaping this vision since the earliest days of Amazon. I recently revisited \u201cThe Everything Store,\u201d a 2013 book by Brad Stone about how Bezos transformed the start-up from an online bookstore into the e-commerce behemoth it is today. \u201cBezos\u2019 long-term goal is to sell everything, everywhere,\u201d Stone writes. \u201cHe will attempt to move faster, work his employees harder, make bolder bets and pursue both big inventions and small ones, all to achieve his grand vision for Amazon \u2014 that it be not just an everything store, but ultimately an everything company.\u201dThe fact that I live in New York, a city that thrives on accessibility, might explain why I was slow to grasp the appeal of Alexa. Here we have bodegas on every corner, most open 24 hours, in case you need to pick up a roll of toilet paper or a bottle of hot sauce in the middle of the night. But most Americans don\u2019t live with the luxury of that immediacy. I didn\u2019t really understand this until the holidays, when I went home to visit my mom in Virginia and we ran out of seltzer. Carbonated water is not an essential item. But in that moment, it would have been easier to quickly tell Alexa to place an order for us and forget about it until it arrived two or three days later, rather than try to remember to pick up a case of Poland Spring the next time someone made the 20-minute drive to the store. That\u2019s the entire enticing promise of Amazon and Alexa: a much more efficient and manageable life, one in which you can outsource mundane tasks while you do something more important, like spend time with your family.It\u2019s not hard to imagine that Alexa might be displaced as rivals introduce their own efforts. Facebook is working on an intelligent assistant, called Jarvis (named for the smart computer that helps Tony Stark, or Iron Man, navigate his surroundings), as is Microsoft. There are rumors that Apple is working on a major update for Siri. Google is currently Amazon\u2019s closest competitor. The company has spent decades organizing the world\u2019s information and learning about our habits and preferences in the process, so that it will one day know what we want even before we do. Search, then, will evolve away from the actual act of searching to the act of surfacing. The company is working on a version of artificial intelligence called Google Assistant to perfect that very ability.But while Google is working to anticipate your needs, Amazon is readying itself to be the only place you need to go to fulfill them. Thinking about Amazon\u2019s restraints \u2014 the company has never tried to introduce a social network or an email service, for example \u2014 you can understand something about the future Amazon seems to envision: A time when no screen is needed at all, just your voice.Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of CB Insights, a trend-forecasting start-up in New York, told me that Amazon has something that its competitors only dream of \u2014 consumer attention and trust. \u201cIn the last few years, Amazon has become the search engine for consumer products, instead of Google,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to buy something, and you already have an Amazon account, you\u2019re probably going to just buy it there. With Google, you still have to go to Amazon or Walmart.\u201d Amazon is investing in supply trailers, drones and fulfillment centers to develop its own postal service and delivery system. And it\u2019s still pushing its Dash buttons, those small pieces of hardware with one purpose: to order a single item from Amazon, like laundry detergent or dish soap. They seem unnecessary, until you consider them with all of Amazon\u2019s other efforts: It\u2019s not just an everything store, or even an everything company, but an everywhere (and anytime!) store.The various products that Amazon is planning to roll out \u2014 including Pantry and Fresh, its grocery service \u2014 can be easily baked into default Alexa services. Restaurants, the company\u2019s version of Seamless, already is. All this in turn brings in more money for Amazon. As Limp put it back in July: \u201cThe nice thing about the Amazon device business is that when we sell a device, generally people buy more bluejeans. And little black dresses. And shoes.\u201dThere\u2019s a theory that behavioral economists use to explain our consumption habits called \u201chyperbolic discounting,\u201d which is the tendency to choose short-term rewards over long-term gains. The \u201cmarshmallow test\u201d of the 1960s tested the ability of preschoolers to resist temptation \u2014 the titular marshmallow, within reach \u2014 with the promise that they would be rewarded with two if they waited. In the experiment\u2019s most popular interpretation, those who had self-control grew up to be much more successful than those who did not. It is one of the most formative studies in self-control and how people make decisions. Alexa is the ultimate marshmallow test, and most of us are failing. We are being conditioned, as a population, to never wait, to never delay our gratification, to accept thoughtless, constant consumption as the new norm. But how we think about consumption and willpower carry enormous implications for the environment and the culture of society as a whole. Think about that the next time you ask Alexa to order you another roll of toilet paper.An article on Jan. 29 about Alexa, Amazon\u2019s home assistant, misstated the total number of marshmallows offered to subjects of the \u201cmarshmallow test,\u201d which measured the ability of preschoolers to delay gratification. If the subjects could resist the temptation of a single marshmallow, they were rewarded with one more \u2014 not two more.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cyberwar for Sale", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "FeatureAfter a maker of surveillance software was hacked, its leaked documents shed light on a shadowy global industry that has turned email theft into a terrifying \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 political weapon. Supported byNow Lagunes was worried. Around 1 o\u2019clock, she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her. She reached him at a restaurant, where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies. \u201cI did not send you an email,\u201d he insisted. A consultant with the campaign \u2014 who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates \u2014 overheard the conversation. He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages: emails with vague subject lines, asking the recipient to review a document or click a link. The campaign, he realized, had been hacked.In the vote for party leader, Lagunes and her allies in Puebla \u2014 a two-hour drive southeast from Mexico City \u2014 were supporting the challenger, a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots. But the incumbent was backed by Puebla\u2019s powerful governor, Rafael Moreno Valle. One of Mexico\u2019s rising political stars, Moreno Valle is close to Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and has forged an alliance between PAN and Nieto\u2019s centrist Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI, long the dominant force in Mexican politics. Since winning the governorship in 2010, Moreno Valle\u2019s opponents say, his ambitions have grown, and he has resorted to increasingly harsh measures to keep Puebla state \u2014 including members of his own party \u2014 under control. \u201cIn the beginning, the governor was low-profile and respectful,\u201d Rafael Micalco, a former leader of PAN in Puebla state, told me. \u201cWhen he became governor, he transformed. Now he controls the party through threats.\u201dThis race to retain control of the party leadership in 2014 was a crucial test for the governor, who was rumored to be considering a run for Mexico\u2019s presidency in 2018. (This past September, Moreno Valle publicly announced his intent to run.) Clashes between the two camps were especially intense in Puebla, where backers of the challenger, Ernesto Cordero, claimed that the governor was using public money to support the incumbent, Gustavo Madero, though the governor\u2019s office has denied these charges. Shortly before the election, Madero\u2019s campaign manager said that Cordero\u2019s side was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the process. \u201cTheir strategy is clear from the outset,\u201d he said in an interview with a Mexican magazine. \u201c\u2009\u2018If I win, good. If not, I was cheated.\u2019\u2009\u201dAfter Lagunes\u2019s call on Election Day, her colleagues rushed from the restaurant back to their local headquarters, a hotel conference room that they had nicknamed \u201cthe bunker.\u201d All morning, they had been trying to reach their field network, a group of 40 Cordero canvassers who were working to get out the vote in Puebla state. But the field network seemed to have gone dark. Few of the canvassers were even answering their phones. Hackers, the team concluded, must have found the list of the canvassers\u2019 names and phone numbers \u2014 widely circulated by email within the campaign \u2014 and begun to intimidate them.\u201cThe day before,\u201d the consultant told me, the field network was \u201cmotivated and eager to do this work. After the hack, it was very hard to reach them. The few who did answer said that they had received phone calls saying that their lives were at stake. They were worried that if they went out, they or their families would get hurt.\u201dAccording to another worker on Cordero\u2019s campaign, who also requested anonymity, citing fear of reprisal, the message to the canvassers was simple and direct: \u201cWe know who you are. If you don\u2019t want any trouble, shut down your cellphone and stop your activity.\u201d The worker added: \u201cIt\u2019s an authoritarian regime.\u201dAnd so, like Lagunes, Podesta fell into a trap. The button appeared to lead to an official Google page, but it was in fact a meticulously personalized fake, with a domain address linked to a remote cluster of atolls in the South Pacific. The details were designed to trick Podesta into entering his password. This technique is known as \u201cspear phishing.\u201d It is an especially potent weapon against companies and political organizations because it needs to succeed only one time, against one target. After that, attackers can use the trusted identity of the first compromised account to more easily lure colleagues into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links. Not only will a working email password yield years of intraoffice chatter, invoices, credit-card bills and confidential memos; it can often be leveraged into control of other personal accounts \u2014 Twitter, Facebook, Amazon \u2014 and even access to company servers and internet domains.The White House, C.I.A. and F.B.I. have all claimed that, based on classified evidence, they can trace the hacks of Podesta\u2019s email account (and other hacks of people close to the Clinton campaign) back to the Russian government. But with the rise of private firms like Hacking Team, penetrating the email accounts of political opponents does not require the kind of money and expertise available to major powers. A subscription-based website called Insider Surveillance lists more than a dozen companies selling so-called ethical malware, including Milan-based Hacking Team and the German firms FinFisher and Trovicor. Compared with conventional arms, surveillance software is subject to few trade controls; a recent attempt by the United States to regulate it under a 41-country pact called the Wassenaar Arrangement failed. \u201cThe technology is morally neutral,\u201d says Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency. \u201cThe same program that you use to monitor your babysitter might be used by Bashar Assad or Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to keep track of whomever they don\u2019t like.\u201dHacking Team has fewer than 50 employees, but it has customers all over the world. According to internal documents, its espionage tool, which is called the Remote Control System, or R.C.S., can be licensed for as little as $200,000 a year \u2014 well within the budget of a provincial strongman. After it has been surreptitiously installed on a target\u2019s computer or phone, the Remote Control System can invisibly eavesdrop on everything: text messages, emails, phone and Skype calls, location data and so on. Whereas the N.S.A.\u2019s best-known programs grab data in transit from switching rooms and undersea cables, the R.C.S. acquires it at the source, right off a target\u2019s device, before it can be encrypted. It carries out an invisible, digitized equivalent of a Watergate-style break-in.The United States government is almost certainly the world\u2019s most formidable repository of hacking talent, but its most powerful cyberweapons are generally reserved for intelligence agencies and the military. This might explain why, according to company documents, at least two federal law-enforcement agencies have been Hacking Team clients: the F.B.I., beginning in 2011, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, beginning in 2012. The F.B.I. contract paid Hacking Team more than $700,000; the D.E.A. appears to have used the software to go after targets in Colombia.Documents show that the company has also sold its software to some of the world\u2019s most repressive governments. Some, like those of Honduras, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are Western allies. Other countries, like Uzbekistan and Turkey, have a more troubled relationship. A few are openly hostile to the West. Between 2012 and 2014, Hacking Team was paid nearly one million euros by the government of Sudan, a United States-designated state sponsor of terrorism. Even more notable, in light of recent events, is the three-year relationship that Hacking Team carried on with the F.S.B., one of Russia\u2019s main intelligence agencies. As with Puebla, Hacking Team used a middleman, a research agency called Kvant, to handle its sales to Russia. Between 2012 and 2014, the agency paid Hacking Team 451,000 euros to license the Remote Control System.Hacking Team claims that it draws the line at customers who commit \u201cgross human-rights abuses\u201d and that it sells exclusively to governments operating within the laws of their own countries. In at least one case, David Vincenzetti, Hacking Team\u2019s founder and chief executive, told a salesman to hold off on a potential Mexican client. \u201cWe sell to official, governmental LEAs\u201d \u2014 law-enforcement agencies \u2014 \u201cand security agencies ONLY,\u201d Vincenzetti wrote in an email. But at other times, a more casual attitude prevailed inside the company. \u201cIf one sells sandwiches to Sudan, he is not subject, as far as my knowledge goes, to the law,\u201d one Hacking Team lawyer wrote in an internal email. \u201cHacking Team should be treated like a sandwich vendor.\u201dWhen asked about its arrangements in various countries, the company responded that it \u201cdoes not comment on confidential business dealings.\u201d Its American spokesman, Eric Rabe, did tell me that neither Russia nor Sudan is a current Hacking Team customer. (The relationships, Rabe wrote, ended in 2014, Russia because \u201cthe Putin government evolved from one considered friendly to the West to a more hostile regime\u201d and Sudan \u201cbecause of concerns about the country\u2019s ability to use the system in accordance with the H.T. contract.\u201d) Separately, the company confirmed that the state of Puebla was, in fact, a former client.With the source code for the Remote Control System now public, the company and its clients had to stop using it temporarily. By the end of the year, though, Hacking Team had updated its product and was trying to rebuild its reputation. I was curious whether a company that profited from online breaches could recover from its own. Eric Rabe, the American spokesman, sounded eager to meet me for coffee in Philadelphia. A grandfather and former television-news anchor, he exudes square-jawed credibility. \u201cIf you disagree with someone on the internet,\u201d he said, of the Hacked Team files, with a wave of his hand, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to have a public-policy debate. Just go destroy them.\u201dA couple of months later, I went to Milan to visit Hacking Team\u2019s headquarters, a stately gray apartment building with boxes of limp flowers adorning a few of its sooty sills. Waiting to demonstrate the company\u2019s software were Rabe; Philippe Vinci, a company vice president; and Alessandro Scarafile, a young engineer. Scarafile had gathered a Dell desktop computer and three smartphones: iPhone, BlackBerry and Android. The screen from his own laptop, which represented the console of a client intelligence agency, was projected on the wall. Several icons represented the various streams of data that could potentially be acquired by gaining control of the target\u2019s computer: images from built-in cameras, sound from built-in mikes, screenshots, detailed records of applications opened and bitcoins transferred, a continuous log of location with latitude and longitude, and logs of address books, calendars, phone calls, Skype calls and passwords, as well as websites visited. A key logger recorded every key that was pressed. It was a lot to keep track of. Two other views, called \u201cline of events\u201d and \u201cline of actions,\u201d assembled the information into chronological order.Scarafile, who was playing both the customer and the target, or \u201cbad guy,\u201d turned on the Dell. Judging by the background on the desktop, a gothic scene framed by castlelike silhouettes, our target seemed to be planning a terrorist attack from Transylvania.Whatever the method of infection, the malicious code, known as an \u201cagent,\u201d then communicates with its masters anonymously, its dispatches routed through a series of dedicated servers scattered around the world. Even if the target gets suspicious and figures out that something is wrong, this chain of servers makes it nearly impossible for him to figure out exactly who is using Hacking Team\u2019s product to spy on him.For the demo, Scarafile opted for the third method, which he referred to as \u201ca bit of social engineering.\u201d Using the customer\u2019s computer, he sent the target an email with a Word file attached. Then he returned to the target\u2019s computer and double-clicked on it, just as Lagunes had clicked on the link in her inbox. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d he said, \u201cthis system is currently infected, or monitored, by the Remote Control System.\u201d It would remain so even if the suspect turned off his machine or logged out.On the timeline, the target appeared as a stubbly lout in an undershirt, named \u201cJimmy Page ... head of the terrorist cell.\u201d Using Jimmy Page\u2019s Dell, Scarafile logged into Page\u2019s Gmail, Facebook and Twitter. He opened up Skype, perused Page\u2019s criminal colleagues (Don Corleone, Harry Potter, Keyser Soze) and left one of them a voice mail message from Page\u2019s phone. Accessing a USB drive attached to the infected computer, Scarafile opened an encrypted file that turned out to contain an order to \u201ckill David Vincenzetti.\u201d R.C.S. captured it all, including periodic snapshots of Scarafile, as Page, at work.\u201cI don\u2019t like the words \u2018inject\u2019 and \u2018infect,\u2019\u2009\u201d Vinci, the vice president, said. \u201cR.C.S. is deploying the agent into the device of the target because you want to monitor some of his activities. Exactly the way that law enforcement is listening to some of your phone calls, right?\u201d\u201cI think the Iran deal is just terrible,\u201d Vincenzetti said, and then added, sarcastically, \u201cOh, it\u2019s such a very peaceful expansion. Very peaceful.\u201d\u201cThat is not an official company position,\u201d Rabe interjected.Vincenzetti, now 48, is a familiar type \u2014 a ferociously competitive, driven entrepreneur whose existence is organized around his work. He has a wife, who was born in Morocco, and no children. His small, heavy-lidded eyes can make him seem sleepily blas\u00e9. On the morning we met at Hacking Team\u2019s offices, he wore jeans, a navy-blue cardigan and a striped shirt, unbuttoned to midchest. He seemed more comfortable on his feet than sitting down. As we talked in a conference room, he periodically leapt to his feet and stalked around the table, considering in turn the espresso machine, the view from the window, a case of bottled water.\u201cIf I wanted to break into this room, how would I do it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere is a door, and there are two windows.\u201d He pressed his hands against the glass panes. \u201cThe perimeter is the first thing you must secure,\u201d he continued. Securing data was what he did earlier in his career. Now he had moved on. \u201cIf you cannot break into a bank, you cannot protect a bank. So when you are in security, really there is no difference between thinking offensively and defensively.\u201dIn the mid-1980s, Vincenzetti\u2019s parents, a salesman and a schoolteacher, bought him a Commodore 64, one of the earliest personal computers. He soon created a Pac-Man clone, a Tron lightcycle-style game and a text-based adventure game. As a computer-science student at the University of Milan in the \u201990s, he became fascinated by cryptography; he corresponded with programmers around the world about new cryptographic theories and wrote code for email encryption. In his senior year, he was appointed to administer the university\u2019s internal network, a post that was usually reserved for a graduate student. Vincenzetti remembers these early days as a time when \u201ceverything was free and no one was trying to harm you. We were wide open and accessible. All the best were called hackers, and I was a hacker.\u201dVincenzetti left university early and founded three companies, all of them focused on defensive cybersecurity. After he founded Hacking Team in 2003, he tried to sell his services to Italian police agencies but found them skeptical that Mafiosi and other high-level criminals would ever bother to encrypt their communications. In Italy, the police were also used to getting whatever they needed through wiretaps, arranged with varying degrees of formality through their contacts at telecommunications firms. But after the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which were coordinated via cellphones and the internet, police officers and intelligence agents not just in Italy but all across Europe became interested in contracting with offensive-hacking vendors, part of an emerging arms race over consumer-grade encryption. The growth of Skype made it easy for users to encrypt their communications, and the authorities were eager to pay for countermeasures like the Remote Control System. Singapore, Hacking Team\u2019s first non-European client, signed on in 2008. The company\u2019s Middle Eastern business took off in 2011, a boom that coincided with the beginning of the Arab Spring.All Hacking Team customers sign contracts agreeing to comply with local laws. The company says that it vets potential customers and studies reports from journalists and human-rights groups, looking for \u201cobjective evidence or credible concerns\u201d that its products are being abused. But when it comes to Hacking Team\u2019s own interactions with customers, leaked documents suggest that employees have sometimes turned a blind eye. In the case of the Puebla government and other Latin American customers, Hacking Team employees appeared to ignore warnings suggesting that the Remote Control System was being used to gather intelligence on the political opposition. On multiple occasions, customers emailed Hacking Team attachments with election-related content, including polling data, party registration forms and invitations addressed to and signed by elected officials. Rather than ask what these files had to do with fighting crime and drug trafficking, Hacking Team support-staff members simply emailed them back, as requested, with an embedded \u201cexploit,\u201d turning the document into a surveillance tool to be used against whomever it was sent on to. Asked about these cases, Rabe replied that customers \u201care not supposed to be using it for political purposes, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that an Italian computer programmer,\u201d i.e., a support technician, \u201cwould have seen these files and known what was going on. ... I think that\u2019s a stretch, that an Italian software guy could know that an individual is a dissident.\u201dShortly thereafter, R3D published three invoices from the Hacked Team cache showing that one state government \u2014 that of Jalisco, on the Pacific Coast \u2014 had paid the company nearly half a million euros for the Remote Control System. Soon other documents were found in the leak to implicate several more states, including Puebla, though most of the states denied ever using the software. (Jalisco later admitted to purchasing the system, which it claimed was for its prosecutor\u2019s office.) The story failed to get much traction in the Mexican press, except in Puebla, after R3D connected with Lado B, a small online-news collective there. The site\u2019s name translates to \u201cB Side,\u201d as in the back of a hit single \u2014 symbolizing its dedication to telling stories that would otherwise go untold.Lado B\u2019s editor, Ernesto Aroche, was not surprised that Puebla\u2019s government had been using the Remote Control System. In Moreno Valle\u2019s six years as governor there, he has spent lavishly on new surveillance systems, including multiple \u201csecurity arches,\u201d highway-spanning structures that scrutinize traffic with video cameras and X-rays, and whose cost had raised some questions in the local press. Beginning in 2013, Aroche began noticing solicitations on the Puebla-state website for hidden cameras and other spying equipment. When he filed a public-records request about them, the government\u2019s form response indicated that these orders had never been filled, but Aroche was skeptical, given the mounting evidence that Moreno Valle\u2019s administration had begun using its security apparatus for political purposes. There were periodic break-ins of homes belonging to dissident politicians and journalists, with the burglars sometimes taking little besides their victims\u2019 laptops. Politicians would answer calls from unknown numbers, only to hear their own taped conversations played back to them. Another journalist, Fernando Maldonado, received an unmarked envelope full of what were purportedly transcripts of 400 private phone calls made by Puebla politicians.As Aroche and R3D sifted through the Hacked Team file dump, they discovered that the files on Puebla had more detail than those dealing with Hacking Team\u2019s other Mexican accounts. The Puebla client often wrote emails asking for help with infecting a particular document with a malicious virus. Some of these came from an account \u2014 soporteuiamx@gmail.com \u2014 that also appears in many of Hacking Team\u2019s internal support tickets. One of those tickets documents a client\u2019s request for help in infecting an attachment: an invitation to attend an event for a Mexican political organization, signed by Violeta Lagunes and addressed to another party colleague opposed to the governor.Aroche interviewed politicians and journalists who were on the receiving end of the infected emails contained in the Hacked Team trove. According to a 2015 article that Lado B published in conjunction with a politics website, the Puebla group sent Hacking Team at least 47 requests to infect specific files that it would then forward on to their targets. Almost all of those files had to do with political issues. Going through the Hacked Team materials, Aroche found the name of a Puebla government employee who seemed to be working within the spying operation. \u201cBefore, we had been talking about ghosts,\u201d Aroche told me. \u201cNow, we could prove it. We started putting names on the actors.\u201dMore than a year later, there have been no political repercussions for the governor or his allies in Puebla. I met Aroche this fall at the Lado B offices, a small room facing a courtyard in a crumbling stone building from Puebla\u2019s colonial days. The only suggestion of Lado B\u2019s presence was a small sticker on the window. Inside, Aroche was thumbing through an envelope of documents that he had wrung out of the state government. Two redacted contracts signed by Puebla officials showed an arrangement between the state government and a company called Sym Servicios Integrales, which Aroche\u2019s reporting had identified as an intermediary for Hacking Team. The details of what had been purchased were redacted. \u201cThese contracts demonstrate that the Puebla government had a commercial relationship with this company,\u201d Aroche said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if they\u2019re a little bit stained \u2014 I dropped some coffee on them.\u201d (Sym Servicios Integrales says it \u201cnever sold H.T. technology to the state of Puebla.\u201d)In a brief written statement from Sagrario Conde Valerio, a spokeswoman, the government of Puebla denied allegations of spying and claimed that \u201cno relationship exists nor has ever existed between the government of Puebla and the company \u2018Hacking Team.\u2019\u2009\u201d The government declined to respond further to a list of questions.But a former official from Moreno Valle\u2019s administration claimed to me that more than $1 million was being diverted from the state budget each year to fund the political-espionage unit. Documents from the Hacked Team archive indicate that Hacking Team received an order from the government of Puebla for 415,000 euros in the spring of 2013, and that Hacking Team booked hotel rooms for three of its associates who traveled to Puebla in May of that year.Some of the R.C.S. training, I was told, took place in a green building on a residential street. When I visited the purported site this fall, lettering above the door said that the building was once a school. Now it had bars across the door and mirrored windows. Neighbors told me it had been abandoned for several months. \u201cPeople would come and go,\u201d one woman said. \u201cThey were very secretive. They would drop off equipment, take away equipment. Then one day, about a year ago, they came and took everything away and left.\u201d Another neighbor said that he often saw a state-police car parked in front of the house and a man with a limp entering and leaving \u2014 a former Mexican intelligence agent, according to someone who was present during the Hacking Team training.Mexico is Hacking Team\u2019s biggest export market, accounting for nearly six million euros in sales, according to leaked documents. Ostensibly, the Remote Control System is intended for fighting criminals and drug traffickers there. (\u201cThere have been reports that the software was used in the apprehension of Chapo Guzman,\u201d Rabe told me, referring to the Mexican drug lord. \u201cI can\u2019t confirm it.\u201d) The files indicate that at least seven other Mexican state governments were Hacking Team clients, but because they did not use email to the same extent as Puebla, their activities are harder to track. Multiple former Hacking Team employees told me that abuses of the software were not limited to Puebla. One former employee described having the system set up inside a mayor\u2019s office.Katitza Rodr\u00edguez, international-rights director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Mexican law allows for interception of communication, like the wiretapping of phone lines, but it does not grant precise legal authority to use new, powerful invasive tools like those created by Hacking Team. And she argues that it is much more dangerous in Mexico than in other Western countries, where checks and balances are stronger. \u201cThis is much more intrusive than the interception of a phone call,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are not only listening; they are taking over your laptop. Mexico needs to have a full debate in Congress about what legal safeguards are needed for this kind of surveillance or if the government should be using it at all.\u201dAmerican expansion by companies like Hacking Team may not face much resistance from the federal government, which is becoming more accepting of electronic surveillance as part of normal police work. Last year, the Justice Department successfully changed the rules of criminal procedure, making it easier for federal agents to hack into multiple computers with a single warrant. Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who tried to block the change, complained that it gives \u201cunlimited power for unlimited hacking.\u201d In a 2014 address, now referred to in cybersecurity circles as his \u201cGoing Dark\u201d speech, the F.B.I.\u2019s director, James Comey, argued that the encryption built into Apple products posed a threat to public safety \u2014 enabling not only terrorism but also drug trafficking, child abuse and hit-and-runs. Instead of \u201ca safe that can\u2019t be cracked,\u201d Comey wanted technology companies to lend him the combination. \u201cThe law hasn\u2019t kept pace with technology, and this disconnect has created a significant public-safety problem,\u201d Comey said. \u201cWe call it \u2018going dark.\u2019\u2009\u201dAs the United States government has argued for weaker protections around personal communications, American businesses have been spreading more powerful surveillance tools around the world. Many foreign law-enforcement agencies already buy electronic-surveillance products from SS8 \u2014 a company backed by the storied venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers \u2014 as well as from the Harris Corporation, a $13 billion company based in Florida and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. At least 25 American police departments have used Harris\u2019s Stingray device, which mimics cellphone towers and can intercept cellphone calls within 200 meters. All known sales of Stingrays to local law enforcement have been authorized by the F.B.I., which has since fought in court to keep those sales secret. In Baltimore alone, Stingrays have been used more than 4,000 times, in routine drug investigations. Much less is known about another Harris product, the advanced Hailstorm, which is also sold to local police departments. Hailstorm is reportedly capable of implanting malware that can take control of a targeted phone, much like Hacking Team\u2019s R.C.S.The Hacked Team documents that offer the most revealing view of the company\u2019s ethos happen to be the most public ones. For years, as often as two or three times a day, Vincenzetti sent mass emails to hundreds of his business contacts. The recipients included numerous members of the United States military and intelligence community, as well as government employees from the city of Cincinnati and the Internal Revenue Service. In these messages, Vincenzetti often addresses this audience collectively as \u201cgents.\u201d The news he cites is a reminder of how the geopolitical winds have been blowing in favor of Hacking Team and other self-described allies of law and order. In Vincenzetti\u2019s world, the system is always, as George Tenet famously said about pre-Sept. 11 intelligence, \u201cblinking red\u201d: the imploding Middle East; a restive, nuclear-armed Russia; battalions of ISIS-trained jihadis roaming around Europe with their encrypted thumb drives and dark-web expertise. Against this backdrop of ever-increasing danger, concerns about human rights are na\u00efve at best.Vincenzetti\u2019s emails vividly exploit this sense of danger and alarm. He writes about shadowy gangs of Iranian hackers using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag to inject malware into French laptops. He celebrates the conviction of Ross Ulbricht, a.k.a. the Dread Pirate Roberts, creator of the Silk Road website. After the arrests of two Uzbek men in Brooklyn for telling informants that they wanted to join up with ISIS, Vincenzetti writes of \u201ca very serious terrorist plot on American soil foiled.\u201dHe went on to tap out this sales pitch:The time has come for a technologically MORE SOPHISTICATED, and much more effective, internet supervision ... something capable to penetrate the core of the terrorists\u2019 HIDDEN forums. And such a (quite unique) technology EXISTS.The following day, he gave a few more hints:I am talking about a NEW technology capable of neutralizing their encryption-based protective layers in order to track them, identify them, locate them, chase them and finally bust them. Something operating on a massive scale. Something different. I am talking about a novel, superior, next-generation mass-surveillance technology.The tone of Vincenzetti\u2019s sales patter was strangely upbeat, especially considering his dire forecasts. It was almost as if he were in the business of selling microwave ovens or sandwiches, not tools through which the private lives of criminals (and whoever else) could be fully laid bare.Vincenzetti\u2019s unstated equation \u2014 privacy is secrecy, and secrecy is terrorism \u2014 is less controversial than it might appear. A supportive echo can be heard in many public statements from American officials, which Vincenzetti often cut and pasted into his mass emails. The former attorney general Eric Holder called for \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial tools that allow us to be pre-emptive.\u201d When Comey warned that \u201cencryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place,\u201d Vincenzetti forwarded it along approvingly, with the tagline: \u201cWe DO have an answer to many if not all of his concerns.\u201d And when, in May 2015, Comey warned of a \u201cthreat\u201d that had \u201cmorphed\u201d into \u201ca chaotic spider web,\u201d Vincenzetti sent word to his \u201cgents\u201d as well.One month later, an anonymous hack revealed Hacking Team\u2019s own invisible spider web, and one year later, during the run-up to Election Day, came the internal emails of the Democratic Party. By then it was clear that tools for digital burglary had spread well beyond the hands of regular police officers. Comey had argued for weaker safes; Vincenzetti was selling longer crowbars. They could be used to chase Jimmy Page, arrest Chapo Guzman, fight crime, smear a political opponent or just keep tabs on someone, anyone. To be hidden is to be a terrorist \u2014 this was the heart of his pitch. Any digital redoubt that could resist being pried open was a public risk and a private opportunity.An article on Jan. 8 about surveillance software erroneously included one company among those that sell so-called ethical malware. The Israeli company Nice no longer sells such software; it sold its intelligence division in May 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Emotion Over Pet Care Helps Explain Human Health Spending", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe New Health CareIn almost every year since the 1960s, health care spending has grown at least as fast as the overall economy, and often much faster. Health economists have long debated why.Strange as it may sound, how we care for our pets offers some answers.The supply of both physicians and of veterinarians has grown at a more rapid rate than overall employment. Since 1996, the number of physicians has grown by about 40 percent. The number of veterinarians is up 100 percent.\u201cThese commonalities made us think that something else may be behind the rapid growth in human health care spending,\u201d said Amy Finkelstein, an M.I.T. economist and one of the authors of a recent study on pet care.Which camp is right?The three economists pointed out that, in contrast with the market for human health care, there is much less government involvement in pet care.So the economists\u2019 focus turned to the commonalities. Human and pet health care are both provided by experts \u2014 doctors and veterinarians \u2014 who\u2019ve undergone lengthy and expensive training and occupational licensing. That expertise commands high salaries. It also gives them the authority to recommend treatments and tests, the need for which most consumers cannot independently judge.You trust your vet as you would trust your doctor to do what is best, especially when an emotional decision is being made. Both human and pet health care are accompanied by strong emotions, making it hard to rationally weigh the value of options. Moreover, the need for care, whether it is for a pet or a human, is difficult to predict and often urgent, again threatening our ability and willingness to shop for the best deals.\u201cIt makes you think that the emotional nature of the treatment decision may be important in explaining high and sometimes heroic end-of-life health care spending,\u201d Ms. Finkelstein said, \u201cwhether on your dog or on your mother.\u201dBut the point of health insurance \u2014 whether for humans or their pets \u2014 is to protect against the risk of catastrophically high costs, not to make money.Though you might reasonably avoid pet care insurance, you really can\u2019t do that with human health insurance. Human and pet health care may have some commonalities, but this isn\u2019t one of them.Advertisement"}
