{"Headline": "China Orders Registration of App Stores", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 In the clearest sign yet that China\u2019s government has begun a new push to solidify control over mobile apps, a regulator has ordered the registration of app stores across the country.\u201cMany apps have been found to spread illegal information, violate user rights or contain security risks,\u201d the post read. It said the purpose of the registration was to ensure that it is clear who takes responsibility if apps, or app stores, are found to engage in illegal practices.Beijing has begun pushing harder to enforce a law passed last year that barred apps from engaging in activities deemed to endanger national security or disrupt social order, terms that are often broadly applied to discussion of politically sensitive topics.While the Chinese authorities have long maintained tight controls over the internet, smartphone apps have presented new challenges.Because Google\u2019s store for apps using its Android operating system is blocked in China, a large number of third-party stores have arisen to take its place. Most of China\u2019s biggest app stores are controlled by its largest internet and smartphone companies, including Tencent, Baidu, Qihoo 360, Xiaomi and Alibaba.The profusion of third-party stores has led to multiple versions of apps and low security standards on the sites where they are commonly downloaded, according to analysts.Government monitoring of content and discussions can also be more difficult on mobile apps than on websites. Content that would be strictly blocked on the internet can often be found on Chinese apps, though the authorities have occasionally banned apps that hosted such content.As with many Chinese laws and government orders, the notice posted Friday is vague, but it does appear to place some responsibility for policing apps\u2019 activity on the app stores themselves.Chinese laws are often intentionally broad and open-ended to allow regulators discretion in enforcing them. For that reason, concrete steps like the registrations ordered Friday can provide the first indication of how laws will be carried out in practice.While the impact the order will have on China\u2019s mobile internet is not clear, it could ultimately lead to a culling of apps that store owners are uncomfortable with, including ones from foreign companies, which could be more difficult to identify or rein in.Still, it may take years for the government to exert control over all the app stores in the country. Carrying out such edicts is often a slow process; for example, efforts to ensure that online profiles are linked to the user\u2019s real name have been continuing for more than a decade.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hoping to Strike Gold Again, Silver Lake Leads Investment in Koubei", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byNow, Silver Lake is betting that an investment in an Alibaba affiliate could help it strike gold once more.Koubei is part of what is increasingly known as the online-to-offline sector, or O2O, meant to help attract customers of internet services to physical locations and services. As China\u2019s internet giants race to draw more and more consumers into their networks, they have sought to enlist local businesses in their quest.Alibaba had already backed another O2O business, Meituan, which was one of China\u2019s biggest sellers of movie tickets and restaurant reservations, but walked away last year and sold its stake. Meituan later allied itself with a top Alibaba rival, Tencent.Koubei, whose name roughly translates into \u201cword of mouth,\u201d was created as a joint venture in 2015 by Alibaba and the Ant Financial Services Group, the Alibaba-affiliated finance company that runs Alipay. The backing of those two companies has amply buoyed the young business in a fiercely competitive space.Perhaps more important, Koubei is closely tied to Alipay, giving businesses greater insight into customers who come in using Koubei. Knowing who those customers are and how often they have been patrons could in theory allow Koubei-affiliated businesses to offer highly targeted coupons or discounts.Koubei said it handled more than 15 million daily orders in 2016. Alibaba has disclosed that Koubei garnered some $7 billion in payment volume in the third quarter last year.\u201cThis is how Alibaba wants to get those people \u2014 the customers who go to restaurants or to local convenience stores \u2014 to transact and bring them more fully into the Alibaba ecosystem,\u201d Ken Hao, a Silver Lake managing partner and managing director, said in an interview.That tight integration with Alibaba made Koubei an interesting opportunity for Silver Lake. The American investment firm was an early supporter of Alibaba, putting $500 million into the company in 2011 and 2012. By the time Alibaba went public in the fall of 2014, the value of that stake had ballooned to $5.1 billion.By the time Koubei was ready to raise money, its chairman, Joseph Tsai \u2014 who is also Alibaba\u2019s vice chairman \u2014 reached out to investors who were considered friends of Alibaba. Besides Silver Lake, the consortium includes CDH Investments, Primavera Capital, Temasek, Yunfeng Capital and Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the sovereign wealth fund of Malaysia.\u201cOut of the more than 100 Chinese investment opportunities that have surfaced in recent years, Koubei was the special one that fit Silver Lake\u2019s criteria for size and risk-reward, and provided a great opportunity to work with the exceptional people at Alibaba again,\u201d Mr. Hao said.By bringing in outside money, Koubei will gain both additional capital to expand and some degree of independence. It could eventually be listed as a public company, much as Ant is expected to be.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yahoo Delays Its Sale to Verizon Until the Second Quarter", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo said on Monday that it now expected the sale of its core businesses to Verizon Communications to close no sooner than April, a delay from its earlier intention to conclude the deal in the first quarter.The delay drags out what has been a long goodbye for Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who was appointed nearly five years ago and failed to turn around the company, a long-fading web pioneer.\u201cWith our 2016 and Q4 financial results ahead of plan, and the continued stability in our user engagement trends, the opportunities ahead with Verizon look bright,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in a statement accompanying the quarter\u2019s financial results.The company said that about 90 percent of daily Yahoo users had changed their security settings or were unaffected by the breaches.The S.E.C. and Yahoo declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal article.A Verizon spokesman, Bob Varettoni, said the company was still evaluating the effect of the data breaches on its proposed purchase but declined to comment further.Jeff Vogel, managing director at Bulger Partners, a technology strategy and investment banking firm based in Boston, said Verizon needed to assess the direct costs of the breaches, such as potential legal penalties and compensation to customers, as well as any long-term tarnishing of Yahoo\u2019s brand.\u201cSeparate and apart from what the S.E.C. does, Verizon has some tough decisions,\u201d Mr. Vogel said. \u201cThey have to look very closely at the brand damage and expected deterioration in the parts of business affected by the breach.\u201dDespite all of the controversy, Yahoo\u2019s business is now starting to perk up. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.47 billion, up 15 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago. Net income was $162 million, compared with a loss of $4.4 billion in the previous year.The company\u2019s preferred benchmark \u2014 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \u2014 also improved, rising 51 percent, to $324 million.Yahoo noted that it had cut costs significantly over the past year, eliminating more than 2,100 jobs.For investors, the fate of Yahoo\u2019s core business has long been an afterthought, overshadowed by the company\u2019s 15 percent investment stake in Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce company, and its 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, a separate company controlled by SoftBank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jared Kushner, a Trump In-Law and Adviser, Chases a Chinese Deal", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byIt was a mutually auspicious moment.Mr. Wu and Mr. Kushner \u2014 who is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and is one of his closest advisers \u2014 were nearing agreement on a joint venture in Manhattan: the redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue, the fading crown jewel of the Kushner family real-estate empire. Anbang, which has close ties to the Chinese state, has seen its aggressive efforts to buy up hotels in the United States slowed amid concerns raised by Obama administration officials who review foreign investments for national security risk.Now, according to two people with knowledge of the get-together, Mr. Wu toasted Mr. Trump and declared his desire to meet the president-elect, whose ascension, he was sure, would be good for global business.The Anbang talks, which have not previously been reported, began roughly six months ago \u2014 \u201cWell before the president-elect\u2019s victory,\u201d Mr. Kushner\u2019s spokeswoman, Risa Heller, noted. That was, however, just as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. While the talks are far along, representatives for Mr. Kushner said some points remained unresolved. Ms. Heller declined to outline the financial terms under discussion.Mr. Kushner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has hired a leading Washington law firm, WilmerHale, to advise him on how to comply with federal ethics laws should he join the White House staff as an adviser to the president. The firm has concluded that one potential sticking point, a federal anti-nepotism law, is not applicable, though not all ethics experts agree. While the law prohibits federal officials from hiring relatives for agencies they lead, Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyers argue, among other things, that the White House is not an agency and is therefore exempt.As for conflicts of interest, Mr. Kushner would be required to make limited financial disclosures, which could give the public a clearer picture of his holdings. And, unlike Mr. Trump, who as president will be exempt from conflict-of-interest laws, he would have to recuse himself from decisions with a \u201cdirect and predictable effect\u201d on his financial interests.Jamie S. Gorelick, a WilmerHale partner who served in the Clinton administration, said that while plans were not final, Mr. Kushner was taking significant steps to extricate himself from the family business. \u201cMr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws, and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take,\u201d she said.He will resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, and though the law does not require it, she said he would divest \u201csubstantial assets.\u201d She did not name them, but Ms. Heller said they would include his stake in 666 Fifth Avenue.Just how meaningful that plan is remains to be seen. Mr. Kushner\u2019s representatives declined to detail his personal financial interest in Kushner Companies\u2019 properties, and they said he intended to keep his interest in other properties beyond 666 Fifth Avenue. He also has a stake, through a family investment vehicle, in a private equity firm run by his brother, Joshua, with far-flung investments of its own.Mr. Kushner, who turns 36 on Tuesday, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. Already he is involved in steering policy, making personnel choices and serving as the middleman between foreign leaders, the White House and the president-elect in ways that could affect his business, even as companies like Anbang see opportunity in entering into new ventures with the president-elect\u2019s son-in-law.Indeed, despite a lack of foreign policy experience, Mr. Kushner is emerging as an important figure at a crucial moment for some of America\u2019s most complicated diplomatic relationships. Such is his influence in the geopolitical realm that transition officials have told the Obama White House that foreign policy matters that need to be brought to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention should be relayed through his son-in-law, according to a person close to the transition and a government official with direct knowledge of the arrangement.Ethics experts said that while the conflict-of-interest law is narrowly drawn, Mr. Kushner\u2019s mix of roles leads inevitably to ethical questions.Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, said deals like the one with Anbang \u201cmight not be illegal under the conflict-of-interest rules, but raise a strong appearance that a foreign entity is using Mr. Kushner\u2019s business to try to influence U.S. policy.\u201dWithout knowing details of Mr. Kushner\u2019s holdings and divestiture plans, he said, the merits of his proposal are hard to assess. Even if he divests his stake in certain properties, Mr. Sanderson added, \u201cit strikes me as a half-measure\u201d that \u201cstill poses a real conflict-of-interest issue and would be a drag on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency and cause the American people to question Mr. Kushner\u2019s role in policy making.\u201dLike the president-elect, Mr. Kushner built on the fortune of a successful father.Jared, 23 at the time of his father\u2019s conviction, had recently graduated from Harvard. He was studying for an M.B.A. and law degree at New York University in 2006 when he bought The New York Observer, at the time an influential weekly newspaper known for its coverage of the city\u2019s elite and high-end real estate.It is unclear exactly when he assumed control of the family business. The company now says he became chief executive in 2008, but contemporaneous news accounts rarely describe him that way until 2012. Nevertheless, Mr. Kushner quickly became the company\u2019s public face as it expanded across the Hudson River into Manhattan, much as Mr. Trump had left Queens for the big city decades before.Charles Kushner was released from federal custody in August 2006. He immediately resumed a significant role in the business and remains heavily involved today. Still, it was with Jared as headliner that the company soon made its biggest play ever: $1.8 billion for the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue that would remain at the center of its story to this day. It was the highest price ever paid for a single office building in the United States \u2014 and more than three times what its seller had paid six years earlier.Everything was looking up, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t. Within a year after the deal, the overheated lending market seized up and Kushner Companies struggled to repay its considerable loans \u2014 and to hold on to 666 Fifth Avenue. To the rescue over the next few years came the Carlyle Group, a giant private equity firm; Vornado Realty Trust, then a co-owner of two of Mr. Trump\u2019s largest properties; and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men.In the end, Mr. Kushner\u2019s company survived, and he and Ms. Trump became fixtures on the international boldface-name circuit.In August, they were spotted with Wendi Deng, an ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch, on the 453-foot yacht Rising Sun, owned by the entertainment mogul David Geffen. Several weeks later, they were photographed watching the United States Open tennis finals with the art collector Dasha Zhukova, wife of the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, a member of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle.Since 2012, Kushner Companies has been on a buying spree. It has acquired at least 120 properties, mostly a mix of existing commercial and residential buildings in New York and New Jersey, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics, a research firm.Recent deals include the $340 million acquisition of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 headquarters in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, and $345 million for a nearby plot of undeveloped land. Mr. Kushner\u2019s company also bought several floors of the old New York Times building for $295 million in 2015 from Lev Leviev, an Israeli who is chairman of one of the largest real estate development companies in Russia.Increasingly, the company is branching out across the country \u2014 to Philadelphia; Baltimore; Toledo, Ohio; and Kansas City, Mo. In Chicago, it owns the building that houses the Midwest headquarters of AT&T. In all, the company owns more than 20,000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space.Beyond real estate, Mr. Kushner has moved into the Wall Street, health care and tech spaces.But the money behind many of Mr. Kushner\u2019s real-estate investments remains a mystery. While the company lists dozens of partners on its website, it does not disclose the individuals behind those companies.One of the newest Kushner projects \u2014 a Trump-branded luxury apartment tower that opened in November in Jersey City \u2014 got nearly a quarter of its financing, about $50 million, from Chinese investors who are not publicly identified.Then there are the Kushners\u2019 continuing negotiations with Anbang\u2019s Mr. Wu, one of the most politically connected men in China.In 2015, Mr. Kushner began pursuing a grand vision for 666 Fifth Avenue. The renowned architect Zaha Hadid was asked to come up with a design to resculpt the 40-story, 1950s-era aluminum-clad office building, adding apartments, a hotel and a mall and nearly tripling its height to 1,400 feet.But the plan needed money, and while Mr. Kushner had managed to hang on to his family\u2019s flagship building, it still had a lot of debt, with a $1.1 billion loan coming due in 2019, and a good portion of the commercial office space vacant.Anbang, which got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004, had become one of the most aggressive Chinese buyers of United States real estate, and had begun investing in hotels. But it had encountered problems of its own; its byzantine ownership structure had given rise to concern on Wall Street and in Washington.Anbang\u2019s structure has stoked such suspicion about its true ownership that some Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley, have opted not to advise the company on United States mergers and acquisitions because they cannot get the information needed to satisfy their \u201cknow your client\u201d guidelines.National security concerns have also complicated Anbang\u2019s efforts to acquire other properties in the United States.One deal, to buy the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, fell apart in October amid concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or state-connected companies. The Hotel del Coronado is near a naval base, and deals involving proximity to national security infrastructure typically receive heightened scrutiny. Anbang was, however, able to acquire the other hotels in the same collection.But Anbang was nothing if not savvy. Company officials had cultivated a relationship with Benjamin M. Lawsky, who had earlier led the financial services agency, from May 2011 to June 2015. It was Mr. Lawsky, by then a consultant, who introduced Anbang to Kushner Companies, according to people with knowledge of how the discussions came about. Mr. Lawsky declined to comment.Mr. Kushner led the negotiations, his spokeswoman, Ms. Heller, confirmed. Kushner Companies would disclose little else about the joint venture, except to say that Anbang would become one of the equity partners in the building\u2019s redevelopment if an agreement is finalized. Anbang declined to comment.It was just coincidence that Mr. Kushner\u2019s Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf with Mr. Wu took place the week after the election, Ms. Heller said, adding that it had been in the works for a while.By the time of the meeting, Mr. Kushner had decided to hand off certain business relationships, including the one with Anbang, to others at Kushner Companies, according to Ms. Heller, and it was for that reason that he invited his father and Laurent Morali, the president of Kushner Companies. She said he planned to sell his stake in 666 Fifth before the closing of any Anbang deal, but she declined to name the potential buyers or the price Mr. Kushner hoped to get.Ms. Heller stressed in her statement that the United States has \u201cnot found Anbang to be a state-owned enterprise\u201d \u2014 an important technical point, given that the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause prohibits the acceptance of payments and gifts from foreign governments.Should it consummate its deal with Anbang, she said, Kushner Companies will seek any necessary approvals from the federal government. She expressed confidence that any deal would pass muster with the foreign investment committee, citing the fact that it did not block the Chinese company from buying the Waldorf Astoria.Come Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated, that committee will be made up of his cabinet members, and the process is such that the president has the final say.On China, Mr. Trump has talked a tough game, accusing Beijing of currency manipulation and raising the possibility of a trade war. But whether that is only a negotiating tactic remains to be seen. The president-elect has his own financial entanglements with China: He owns a 30 percent stake in a partnership that owes roughly $950 million to a group of lenders that includes the Bank of China, and one of his biggest tenants at Trump Tower is another state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.With Anbang a magnet for controversy, Mr. Kushner has kept the negotiations under wraps. But a week after the Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf, Mr. Kushner\u2019s father and Mr. Wu met at the hotel for lunch. After the elder Mr. Kushner departed, Mr. Wu was clearly elated.\u201cI love you guys,\u201d he exclaimed in English to his remaining entourage, according to one person present.Nina Bernstein, Michael Forsythe, Megan Twohey, Leslie Picker and Charles V.

{"Headline": "What to Make of the \u2018Davos Class\u2019 in the Trump Era", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byDealBookDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has never been invited here. Neither has Nigel Farage, the British politician who led the Brexit campaign.The World Economic Forum \u2014 an annual gathering of global policy and business leaders, who come to debate the world\u2019s great challenges \u2014 gets underway here Monday night as the shifting political trends toward nationalism and against a sense of globalism are raising renewed questions about the relevance of the elites known as the \u201cDavos class.\u201d It is this group of so-called plutocrats that largely failed to anticipate \u2014 and may have even unconsciously generated \u2014 the seeping anti-establishment movement across the globe.Every January, a glittering array of the cognoscenti descend on the Alps: the tech-titan-turned-philanthropist Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft; the billionaire investor George Soros; Jack Ma, the founder of China\u2019s e-commerce giant, Alibaba; and \u2014 until recently \u2014 Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany. An assortment of Hollywood actors including Angelina Jolie, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon have made the pilgrimage over the years to promote their nonprofit work. And the conversations tend to be dominated by issues like inequality, climate change and the economic challenges facing developed and emerging countries.This year, the guest list includes names like President Xi Jinping of China; Vice President Joseph Biden; JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon; the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde; and former Vice President Al Gore.And yet missing from these high-minded conversations have been meaningful challengers or critics of the underlying theme that was seemingly stipulated from the birth of this event 46 years ago: Globalization has the potential to benefit everyone.\u201cTrump\u2019s election victory is a clear indication that the majority of people are not interested in a world government, but want to return to a classical, local democracy,\u201d John Mauldin, an economic researcher and author, recently wrote. \u201cStrange as it may seem to the Davos men, most people tend to love their \u2018patria,\u2019 the land of their fathers.\u201dDissenting voices like those of Mr. Trump and Mr. Farage have rarely been part of the discussion \u2014 though perhaps that will change. Theresa May, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, will attend this year, as will some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers.But the victories of Mr. Trump and the Brexit campaign can be viewed as a rebuke of \u201cDavos Man,\u201d a name that Samuel Huntington, the Harvard political scientist, gave attendees in 2004, describing them as \u201ctransnationalists\u201d who \u201chave little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite\u2019s global operations.\u201dThe middle class in the United States and Britain \u2014 and perhaps in France if Marine Le Pen, the far-right presidential candidate who has also never been invited to Davos, wins this spring \u2014 clearly haven\u2019t felt the benefits of the border-free world encouraged by multinational corporations that allows both immigration and commerce to take place without friction.\u201cThey have witnessed the rise of the Davos class, a hyper-connected network of banking and tech billionaires, elected leaders who are awfully cozy with those interests, and Hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous,\u201d Naomi Klein, a columnist for The Guardian, wrote in a searing analysis of the American election in November. She described the failure of \u201celite neoliberalism\u201d to address the economic challenges of the masses.\u201cSuccess,\u201d she wrote, continuing to describe the middle class, \u201cis a party to which they were not invited, and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness.\u201dThe Davos Man has either failed to properly articulate the benefits of open trade \u2014 or the reality of open trade is more complicated than previously imagined.In a nod to this new reality, the World Economic Forum has put together an index of what it calls inclusive growth and development, which measures 109 countries according to their progress on economic growth and reducing income inequality and breaks out subsets of those countries to compare with different data sets. According to the index, median income actually declined by 2.4 percent between 2008 and 2013 across the 26 advanced economies where data is available, which may help explain the shifting political winds.\u201cIt\u2019s our response to how capitalism has failed us \u2014 and how we need to fix it,\u201d said Adrian Monck, a member of the forum\u2019s executive committee.The United States ranked 23rd out of 30 advanced economies. In terms of wage and nonwage compensation, it ranked last; in social protection, it came in 25th. It also came in 25th on \u201cintermediation of business investment\u201d \u2014 in other words, the amount of money that goes into productive investments, such as research and development and infrastructure as opposed to share buybacks. (Norway ranked No. 1. Living standards there rose by 10.6 percent from 2008 to 2013 while the economy grew only 0.5 percent.)Mr. Monck defended the idea of a globalist approach. \u201cThe benefits of globalization are there to see, in jobs in China, India and many emerging markets,\u201d he said. \u201cBillions of people owe better lives to it.\u201dHe invoked Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum. \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t been listened to in Davos is persistent warnings from people like Klaus that the benefits need to be shared, and that you can\u2019t have winner-take-all capitalism,\u201d Mr. Monck said.Still, he acknowledged that the invitation list of insiders is by design.\u201cWe always want the most comprehensive political attendance in Davos, to help support public-private cooperation, which is what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat inevitably means current, serving political figures. There are politicians in office now \u2014 and coming to Davos \u2014 who reflect this emergent agenda that you\u2019ve seen in the U.S.\u201dFor example, he said, leaders from Poland, Finland, Portugal and even Switzerland \u2014 where the Swiss People\u2019s Party was an early example of the shift in the political landscape \u2014 will be on hand this week.A bevy of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers and members of his business council are expected to attend, including Anthony Scaramucci, who joined the president-elect\u2019s White House staff as an adviser and public liaison to government agencies and businesses. He will be joined by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman of the Blackstone Group and also of Mr. Trump\u2019s President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum.A few people who were once anti-establishment crusaders \u2014 like Ms. May of Britain \u2014 are now insiders. And, depending how the political winds shift, more people of her ideological ilk may join the Davos class in 2018.Many of today\u2019s policy makers and executives gathering here are expected to speak about the rise of populism and the need to adjust economic incentives. Hamdi Ulukaya, the chief executive of Chobani, the yogurt company, is expected to encourage business leaders to do more to address wealth building among employees; he provided shares in his company to every full-time employee, making many of them millionaires.The question, of course, is whether those discussions can ever get beyond the theoretical for a group that is seen by many middle-class voters as out of touch with the real economic challenges that people face. Conversations about income inequality, for example, have long had a tinge of class envy as opposed to a real appreciation for the basic jobs and wages that people are seeking.Still, with the word \u201cDavos\u201d being tossed around as an epithet, some politicians are staying away from the Alps this year. Ms. Merkel, for example, has passed on attending now for two years in a row, in the face of continued criticism among German voters that she is too much of a globalist.So why do so many policy makers and executives still covet an invitation? Because Davos remains the world\u2019s one-stop shop to meet leaders from all corners of the globe.

But if they want to cash out and buy a house, for example, they will pay the full tax bill. Some, like Steven T. Mnuchin, the nominee for Treasury secretary, may actually lose money on some of the assets they have to sell because their holdings are in illiquid assets, like private equity funds, that have to be offloaded at a discount.Of all the potential conflicts of interest that Mr. Trump and his cabinet picks may present, the tax treatment they receive in this instance is not one of them, Mr. Sorkin writes.\u201cWhat we are seeing now is, after the initial chaos of the Trump transition, that his nominees are now complying with the requirements of the law.\u201dIt is a rare feat for the F.B.I. \u2014 arresting an overseas corporate executive accused of wrongdoing.Mr. Schmidt played a central role in covering up Volkswagen\u2019s diesel emissions cheating, according to an affidavit from an F.B.I. officer that was unsealed on Monday.The case against him sheds more doubt on Volkswagen\u2019s assertions that top executives did not understand the full scale of wrongdoing at the company until September 2015. Mr. Schmidt briefed executives in detail months earlier, in July, according to the criminal complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan.VCA will still operate as a separate business unit under Mars Petcare, which already used VCA\u2019s lab services in its veterinary businesses. Talks about a deal began after Mars approached the company in November.Petcare, chocolate and Wrigley now contribute 90 percent of sales for Mars, and Petcare will become the largest business for the company, with VCA adding about $2 billion in revenue.Advertisement"}

In interviews in 2015 with The Times, Mr. Tashi said he did not support independence for Tibet.Defendants who go on trial in China are almost always convicted. In political cases like that of Mr. Tashi, orders are sent from senior officials to the court. If convicted, Mr. Tashi could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.Mr. Tashi\u2019s legal case has taken some unusual turns. The groups issuing statements are hoping that Mr. Tashi\u2019s case will not go to trial and say international pressure could be critical now.Amnesty said Mr. Tashi was a \u201cprisoner of conscience, detained solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression.\u201d\u201cTashi Wangchuk has joined the ranks of those prosecuted in China by simply calling for rights to be respected and the law to be upheld,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, the group\u2019s China director. \u201cCultural rights, which include the right to use one\u2019s own language, are protected under both the Chinese Constitution and international human rights law.\u201dA campaigns director with Students for a Free Tibet, based in New York, said Wednesday that the group planned to ask its members to publicly advocate for Mr. Tashi.Lawyers for Mr. Tashi were allowed to visit him briefly last year in a Qinghai detention center. Mr. Lin said Mr. Tashi was in good spirits, given the circumstances, and was writing up points to make in his defense during a trial. When interviewed by The Times in 2015, Mr. Tashi insisted repeatedly that his remarks be on the record and said he knew he could be imprisoned after publication of the video and articles, given the political sensibilities in China over Tibet.Mr. Tashi traveled to Beijing in 2015 to look for lawyers to help him file his lawsuit and to try to get China Central Television, the state network, and foreign journalists to document his efforts and the lack of robust Tibetan-language education in public schools in Tibetan regions.Mr. Tashi said he wanted to use Chinese laws to expand language education, and he praised President Xi Jinping for having \u201cpromoted a democratic and law-abiding country these last few years.\u201dTibetans living under Chinese rule often say they are concerned about the dwindling use of their language, especially among younger Tibetans. Tibetan teachers and students in Qinghai Province have held protests over language education in recent years.Advertisement"}

Trump is not the only person to announce plans to shut down a personal philanthropy, just the best known.This is the story of a man who made and kept that same promise.It was a race: Mr. Feeney was then 81, and Atlantic Philanthropies, a collection of private foundations he had started and funded, still had about $1.5 billion left. Flinging money out the window or writing checks willy-nilly was not Mr. Feeney\u2019s way.He had officially emptied his pockets, meeting his aspiration of \u201cgiving while living.\u201d Altogether, he had contributed $8 billion to his philanthropies, which have supported higher education, public health, human rights and scientific research.\u201cYou\u2019re always nervous handling so much money, but we seem to have worked it pretty well,\u201d Mr. Feeney, now 85, said last week in a phone interview.His remaining personal net worth is slightly more than $2 million. That\u2019s not quite broke, by any standard, but it is a modest amount for a man who controlled thousands of times as much wealth. He and his wife, Helga, now live in a rented apartment in San Francisco.\u201cYou can only wear one pair of pants at a time,\u201d Mr. Feeney has said.Beyond Mr. Feeney\u2019s reticence about blowing his own horn, \u201cit was also a way to leverage more donations \u2014 some other individual might contribute to get the naming rights,\u201d said Christopher G. Oechsli, the president and chief executive officer of Atlantic.Raised in Elizabeth, N.J., Mr. Feeney served as a radio operator in the Air Force and attended Cornell University on the G.I. Bill. In 1960, he and a partner set up a company that sold items like brandy and cigars to travelers in duty-free shops at airports. It became a booming success. Mr. Feeney has also been a shrewd investor in technology start-ups.In 1984, he secretly transferred all of his assets, including his 38.75 percent ownership of the duty-free business, to Atlantic Philanthropies. He grew the Atlantic pot with early investments in companies like Facebook, Priceline, E-Trade, Alibaba and Legent.A business dispute in 1997 forced disclosure of Mr. Feeney\u2019s funding for Atlantic.The two men are mirror images. For years, Mr. Trump lobbied hard to get onto lists of the wealthy, like the Forbes 400; Mr. Feeney has tried to stay off them. The Atlantic endowment came entirely from Mr. Feeney\u2019s money; much of the money that went into the Trump foundation in recent years was from others.One of Atlantic\u2019s projects was to propose reforms to the American health care system, which helped lay groundwork for the Affordable Care Act; another was advocacy for the end of the death penalty for juveniles. Mr. Trump has been on the other side of both of those issues, vowing to \u201cdismantle Obamacare on Day 1,\u201d and calling, in 1989, for the restoration of the death penalty after five teenagers were arrested in the rape of a jogger in Central Park. (They were convicted but later cleared of the charges.)Just as Mr. Trump was opening Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in the early 1980s, Mr. Feeney was a few blocks away in Makem\u2019s pub, thinking about the first big checks he would write for charity, on the condition that his identity not be disclosed. \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever meeting Trump,\u201d Mr. Feeney said last week.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For C.E.O.s, a New Concern: The Activist in Chief", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byDealBookFor years, chief executive officers lived in fear they would become a target of the activist investor Carl Icahn.Now, they live in dread of a different and somewhat more unexpected kind of activist: President Donald J. Trump.As corporate executives around the globe try to understand the implications of the Trump administration on their businesses, they seem to be having an almost bipolar reaction: a euphoric sense that regulations and taxes could soon be lowered \u2014 which would likely increase their profits and paychecks \u2014 yet a simultaneous anxiety that they could become a target of one of the president\u2019s Twitter tirades, which could undo their businesses or possibly their careers.Over the last two months, dozens of chief executives have made pilgrimages to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The ritual involves being photographed in the lobby in front of the gold elevators and having your name hastily tweeted by the throngs (journalistic and otherwise) involved in the spectator sport.For the moment, the action seems to have shifted to Washington. On Monday, a bevy of executives \u2014 Elon Musk of Tesla, Kevin Plank of Under Armour and Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical among them \u2014 arrived for a 9 a.m. meeting at the White House.This meeting and similar ones, according to more than a dozen executives who have attended them, are viewed by the executive class not only as an opportunity to help shape policy in their favor, but also, perhaps more important, as a defensive measure aimed at making \u201cfriends\u201d with the new president so as to avoid his wrath later.Make no mistake: Companies are making changes \u2014 or, at least, public announcements \u2014 aimed (in part or in whole) at appealing to or appeasing Mr. Trump. Amazon said it was hiring 100,000 new employees. Ford canceled plans to build a factory in Mexico and said it would create 700 jobs domestically.The story, which garnered headlines all over the world, was a clear sop to Mr. Trump: In many ways, Foxconn\u2019s statement was seen as a hedge against the possibility that the new president, who has threatened a trade war with China and criticized Apple for manufacturing iPhones abroad, might seek to put further pressure on its business.Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, visited Mr. Trump two weeks ago and announced plans to build an online platform that he pledged would create a million jobs in the Midwest for farmers and small businesses to export goods to China. The plan had been in the works before Mr. Trump was elected, but clearly it helped grease the skids with Mr. Trump, who took Mr. Ma to pose for pictures in the lobby of Trump Tower.Mr. Icahn, a friend and supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s, who was recently named a special adviser on regulation, said in a telephone interview, \u201cYou are correct in saying my relationships with companies is somewhat analogous\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s own relationships with the leaders of them.\u201cIf they are taking advantage of the system, they should be scared,\u201d Mr. Icahn said of corporations. \u201cRemember, many of the guys I went after deserved to be scared \u2014 but in many cases, I bought stock in companies with managements I liked, and I helped them get things done with recalcitrant boards.\u201d\u201cIt will be a bumpy road,\u201d Mr. Icahn said. \u201cBut in the long run he will do a great job with the country.\u201dWhile some executives may be focused on the optics of their businesses in relation to Mr. Trump, Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, the largest money manager in the world overseeing over $5 trillion \u2014 that\u2019s with a \u201ct\u201d \u2014 suggests that each company must rethink its strategy.\u201cWe believe that it is imperative that companies understand these changes and adapt their strategies as necessary,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote in a letter to the nation\u2019s top public company executives that he is in the process of sending out. \u201cNot just following a year like 2016, but as part of a constant process of understanding the landscape in which you operate.\u201d\u201cWe will be looking to see how your strategic framework reflects and recognizes the impact of the past year\u2019s changes in the global environment,\u201d Mr. Fink added. \u201cHow have these changes impacted your strategy and how do you plan to pivot, if necessary, in light of the new world in which you are operating?\u201dOne of the big issues that companies are likely to confront \u2014 and that Mr. Trump may confront for them if they aren\u2019t lucky \u2014 is how they might use repatriated cash if tax reforms are passed in Washington. Mr. Trump has made his presidency about creating jobs. Yet many chief executives have already said that if they are able to repatriate cash at a low tax rate, they will engage in stock buybacks and mergers and acquisitions. (In the 12 months ending in the third quarter of 2016, BlackRock pointed out that \u201cthe value of dividends and buybacks by S&P 500 companies exceeded those companies\u2019 operating profit.\u201d)Mr. Fink warned that he was watching, too. \u201cIf tax reform also includes some form of reduced taxation for repatriation of cash trapped overseas, BlackRock will be looking to companies\u2019 strategic frameworks for an explanation of whether they will bring cash back to the U.S. \u2014 and if so, how they plan to use it. Will it be used simply for more share buybacks? Or is it a part of a capital plan that appropriately balances returning capital to shareholders with prudently investing for future growth?\u201dBetween Mr. Trump and the investor class, chief executives may be cornered in their offices more than ever as they try to adjust to the new reality.Adam Grant, a professor of management and psychology at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said behavioral scientists had a term to describe the way chief executives were thinking about Mr. Trump: It is called an \u201cambivalent relationship.\u201dThat sounds about right.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about corporate bosses\u2019 efforts to appeal to President Trump, referred incorrectly to the manufacturing company Foxconn, which said it might spend $7 billion in the United States to build a factory. Foxconn is based in Taiwan, not China.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "SoftBank\u2019s $100 Billion Investment Fund Starts to Take Shape", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byMany business titans have made the trek to Trump Tower for a private audience with Donald J. Trump since he was elected president, but none have made a bigger splash than Masayoshi Son, the billionaire telecommunications entrepreneur.Yet bankers who are advising the SoftBank fund say that more than three-quarters of the fund\u2019s resources will be directed toward larger investments in private and public markets, rather than into start-ups.That could mean swooping in to grab a piece of an undervalued technology company trading on the stock exchange or doing a large-scale private equity deal.That\u2019s because investing in technology start-ups is usually constrained by the sector\u2019s ability to absorb large sums, with $1 billion generally considered the very upper limit. In the parlance of finance, money does not scale.These bankers say that the fund \u2014 which has $45 billion from Saudi Arabia, $25 billion from SoftBank and smaller contributions from Apple, Lawrence Ellison of Oracle and others \u2014 will also be looking at smaller venture capital forays in artificial intelligence, robotics and financial technology. But given the fund\u2019s size, the major bets will be on large companies.As the fund approaches its official start date later this month, a team of portfolio managers have emerged to get the investment process started. While Mr. Son will have the ultimate say, a small group of Deutsche Bank refugees \u2014 led by Rajeev Misra, one of Anshu Jain\u2019s most trusted (and unsung) deputies in the bank\u2019s glory years before the financial crisis \u2014 will take on a major role in putting this vast sum of money to work.To a degree, there is a bit of a start-up feel to the fund\u2019s investment team. With just weeks to go before the fund can start investing, the Deutsche Bank veterans \u2014 who will be supported by SoftBank analysts in San Francisco and Tokyo \u2014 are still settling into their new offices in London\u2019s exclusive Mayfair district.The team has already received a deluge of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, investor pitches and queries from bankers and lawyers \u2014 all looking to get a piece of the largest fund start in recent memory.Mr. Misra will be joined by Akshay Naheta, a former proprietary trader at Deutsche Bank and founder of Knight Assets, an activist investment firm based in London; and Saleh Romeih, another senior banker from Deutsche Bank.Working with Mr. Misra and his team will be a group of senior SoftBank deal makers who, over the years, have worked closely with Mr. Son as he has built up his portfolio of investments. They include Alok Sama, chief financial officer for SoftBank International; Ronald Fisher, a board member who has been deeply involved with SoftBank\u2019s Sprint stake; and Deep Nishar, a former top executive at Linkedin.Mr. Son, Mr. Misra and Mr. Fisher will be the key members of the investment committee. Bankers expect that the total investment staff will include about 100 people.From the outset, growth has been the common theme in regard to investment strategy.That means that when the SoftBank fund takes a company private, it will not be slashing thousands of jobs to claim efficiencies or to meet interest payments on the loans that backed the deal.Instead, buyouts will be largely cash, thus helping Mr. Son keep true to his vision \u2014 to say nothing of his promise to the president-elect \u2014 that SoftBank\u2019s investments will create thousands of jobs.And because the fund will not have to pay back investors for 12 years, it will be able to take a longer-term approach \u2014 for its private investments as well at its bets in the stock market, which are expected to follow an activist strategy.It is this combination of growth and adherence to the long view that has made Mr. Son, in effect, the Warren E. Buffett of technology investing.Said to be worth $17 billion, Mr. Son made his first entrepreneurial score (an electronic dictionary that he sold to Sharp Electronics) as a college student at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1970s. He returned to Japan in the 1980s and transformed SoftBank from a software distributor to a technology and telecommunications giant.Mr. Son would later found Yahoo Japan and take a large and early stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth. Through his holding company, he now controls large swaths of the telecommunications market in the United States and Japan.At a time in finance when the real measure of a leader has become the ability to attract large sums of money in a short period of time, Mr. Son\u2019s achievement is extraordinary.But the task of deploying such an amount will be a challenge.Which is where Mr. Misra comes in.As the head of Deutsche Bank\u2019s global credit trading during a time when SoftBank was hitting the market for loans, Mr. Misra came to know Mr. Son as a client.In mid 2008, Mr. Misra \u2014 who was also the ultimate boss of Greg Lippmann, the trader whose bets against the United States housing market became the subject of the book and movie, \u201cThe Big Short\u201d \u2014 left the bank.After stints at UBS and the Fortress Investment Group, the Indian-born Mr. Misra accepted an offer in 2014 from Mr. Son to bring his financial engineering skills to SoftBank.It was Mr. Misra, in fact, who came up with idea of having Sprint, SoftBank\u2019s debt-burdened wireless provider, reduce its punitive finance costs by issuing cheaper bonds that were secured by the company\u2019s access to spectrum airwaves.Sprint was able to issue more than $3 billion worth of these bonds, which, because they were secured, carried a much lower interest rate than the double-digit rates that the company had paid in the past.With a five-year deadline to invest the funds, Mr. Misra and his team of bankers will not be forced to chase every tech tip, or to jump desperately into the next investor round for an Uber, Airbnb or the hot online security play of the moment.Mr. Misra\u2019s team will take a broad view of technology, bankers say, focusing on how lightning-speed innovation is disrupting industries like media, telecommunications, health care and asset management.\u201cHe is superbly talented,\u201d Boaz Weinstein, a hedge fund executive who worked for Mr. Misra at Deutsche Bank, said of Mr. Misra\u2019s ability to reinvent himself on Wall Street. \u201cFirst it was credit derivatives and now it is technology. Those kinds of second acts are rare.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the trader who became the subject of the book and movie, \u201cThe Big Short.\u201d He is Greg Lippmann, not Lippman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China Seeks Bigger Role on World Stage, Xi Jinping Will Go to Davos World Economic Forum", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byBut it is unclear whether Mr. Xi, who rarely ventures beyond platitudes in discussing the strategies of the world\u2019s second largest economy, can take advantage of this time of transition when the rest of the world is gauging whether the United States is pulling back from global leadership.Mr. Xi may sense an opening during a historic inflection point. He plans to deliver a speech at Davos at a moment when the incoming United States president, Donald J. Trump, has suggested that the United States should withdraw from the traditional superpower role it has played since World War II, including its leadership of a global free trade agenda.In recent years, Davos had come to embody that American-led agenda \u2014 a gathering at an Alpine ski resort of some of the world\u2019s most powerful figures in the realms of politics, media and technology. Discussions each year have been set by Western leaders, not Asian ones.But events of the past year brought into sharp focus a rise in populist denunciations of globalization, free trade and inequality in some Western nations, including the United States, with Davos frequently mentioned by critics as a symbol of the root causes of their countries\u2019 ailments.China has benefited greatly from access to international trade markets since its entry in 2001 into the World Trade Organization, and it could now become the most vocal proponent of that system. Mr. Trump campaigned on opposition to the existing global trade system and has denounced China for competing unfairly against the United States.People\u2019s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, published an article Wednesday that said China could become the \u201ctorchbearer of the open trade system\u201d and boasted that Mr. Xi\u2019s visit \u201cwill boost the world\u2019s confidence in global governance.\u201dHis appearance is a logical step in his country\u2019s evolution into a globe-spanning superpower, a rapid transformation that has been marked by bold symbolic gestures and events in the past decade, including the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing under President Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessor.Premiers of China, including the current one, Li Keqiang, have attended Davos before, but the nation\u2019s president \u2014 and head of the Communist Party \u2014 has never been to the gathering.\u201cClearly it signals that Xi Jinping is now interested in writing both China and himself in a grander way on the global diplomatic horizon,\u201d said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cHe feels it\u2019s time to really come out. Behind that probably is an assumption and wishful thinking that the U.S. is in disarray, Europe is feckless, and so on.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll be received almost as the number one citizen at Davos,\u201d Mr. Schell added.Mr. Xi plans to attend Davos on Jan. 17, during a state visit to Switzerland from Jan. 15 to 18, said Lu Kang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. Mr. Xi is expected to speak at the opening session of the forum, which runs from Jan. 17 to 20.Strong anti-globalization sentiments erupted last year in the movement in Britain that culminated in the popular vote by British citizens to leave the European Union. But it was Mr. Trump\u2019s election in November that was the apotheosis of the move in the West toward isolationism, and meetings and conversations at Davos \u2014 whose theme this year is \u201cresponsive and responsible leadership\u201d \u2014 will take place in the shadow of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises and rhetoric.Victor Shih, a scholar of China\u2019s political economy at the University of California, San Diego, said there are actually some global agenda matters on which China\u2019s influence \u201cmight have peaked in the medium term.\u201dHe pointed to China\u2019s push in recent years to have the renminbi counted as an international currency. That has been undermined in the past year by efforts of the Chinese central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, to withdraw large quantities of offshore renminbi from circulation. The bank has been doing that in order to try to prop up the value of the renminbi and limit capital flight from China, including the transfer of money to Hong Kong by wealthy Chinese.\u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China continues to claim that renminbi internationalization is important, and of course, at Davos, President Xi may continue to pay verbal homage to that agenda because it would be an important sign of China\u2019s ascendance on the world stage,\u201d Mr. Shih said. \u201cYet, in the past year, we have seen renminbi deposits outside of mainland China decline by hundreds of billions of renminbi.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In Mr. Zhang\u2019s business, every second counts.\u201cYou have to hand it directly to the person,\u201d said Mr. Zhang, one of the legions of package couriers in Beijing who help power China\u2019s online shopping boom. He spoke as he blitzed through a surgical wing, medical storeroom and patient ward delivering parcels small and large, soft and square, to doctors and nurses in an effort to ensure the right person gets the right package.\u201cOtherwise,\u201d Mr. Zhang said, \u201cyou may get fined.\u201dThe Chinese e-commerce industry has been built on the backs of couriers \u2014 called kuaidi, or express delivery, in China \u2014 like Mr. Zhang. They number 1.2 million, by one survey, and online retailers like Alibaba use them to zip packages to customers by scooter or three-wheeled electric cart. Across China, the world\u2019s largest market for package delivery, a courier shouting \u201ckuaidi!\u201d through a door or a phone signals your package has arrived.But for the couriers \u2014 who are largely unskilled workers from China\u2019s interior \u2014 the work can be low-paying and difficult. It is coming under scrutiny from labor activists and legal experts who say many couriers face punishing hours and harsh working conditions.Nearly one-quarter of them work more than 12 hours a day, seven days a week, according to the survey, which covered 40,000 couriers and was conducted by Beijing Jiaotong University and Alibaba\u2019s research and logistics arms. A majority work more than eight hours a day each day of the week.Couriers, meanwhile, complain about fines. Some delivery companies penalize them if they do not deliver all the morning\u2019s packages by 2 p.m. Poor penmanship, damage to a package or customer complaints can also result in fines, which can add up to a week\u2019s pay.\u201cI\u2019m here to make money,\u201d said Mr. Zhang, a 28-year-old former coal miner from Shanxi Province who is saving money to build a home, widely seen in the countryside as indispensable in attracting a wife. \u201cIf I\u2019m not diligent now, I\u2019m going to regret it. I\u2019m almost 30 and still single.\u201dChina hopes to move away from manufacturing and seeks to build a more service-oriented economy driven by accountants, lawyers and other professionals. Yet for migrant workers at the bottom of the pay scale, service work can mean conditions not unlike those in China\u2019s factories, where lax enforcement has long led to excessive overtime and unsafe conditions.Those companies run nationwide distribution networks but rely on smaller companies for last-mile delivery \u2014 and there the relationships can become murky. Those smaller companies, which are franchisees of the big delivery companies, sign up drivers as employees or contractors. Some of those drivers subcontract their work to other drivers.Those arrangements often result in couriers who drive under the name of a big delivery company but whose hours and terms are only loosely managed, experts say. For example, many drivers lack workers\u2019 compensation benefits or insurance in case of accidents, said Jin Yingjie, a professor specializing in labor law at the China University of Political Science and Law.Delivery companies \u201cshould work to bring the industry into the confines of the labor law,\u201d she said.\u201cThe delivery companies are pushing drivers to the point of taking collective action,\u201d Mr. Elmer said.In December, a weeklong strike brought deliveries by one package company partly owned by Alibaba, YTO Express, to a halt in Baoji, a city in Shaanxi Province.\u201cWhere\u2019s our October pay?\u201d one of the deliverymen told a local TV station. \u201cThere needs to be someone in charge handling this. There\u2019s nobody.\u201dA spokeswoman for YTO Express said the strike was caused by a franchisee who did not promptly calculate fees or properly communicate with couriers.\u201cAlibaba is a leader in big data technology,\u201d an Alibaba spokesman said in a statement. \u201cTaking advantage of that strength, we are committed to helping the logistics industry improve its efficiency and the working conditions for couriers and other industry participants.\u201dMost couriers make about $300 to $600 a month, according to the Jiaotong study \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the wages of China\u2019s migrant factory workers. They can deliver 150 packages on a weekday, drivers said, sometimes helped by making mass deliveries to office buildings.Couriers generally make about 15 cents per package delivered, according to drivers and reports in the state news media, though they can make more by picking up outgoing packages from customers or through other tasks.The work initially appealed to many as package volume boomed. But their pay per package has barely budged in recent years as competition intensified and more drivers entered the market. About 40 percent of couriers quit within a year, according to the Jiaotong study.\u201cMost deliverymen are like me,\u201d said Lu Yong, who quit in December. \u201cThey work for three months and realize it\u2019s no good.\u201dMr. Lu, 29, of Henan Province, spent years assembling electronics in the southern province of Guangdong before going to work for a ZTO Express franchisee in Beijing. \u201cThe factories lack the same freedom as delivery, but it\u2019s not cold like here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every month you get four days of rest, too.\u201dMr. Lu\u2019s November pay slip showed that he was paid $382 on 4,291 packages delivered, after fines and other expenses including his uniform. He says he pays for maintenance on his cart, which bears ZTO\u2019s logo, including new tires, replacement batteries and new brakes. He also said he never signed a labor contract.James Guo, the chief financial officer of ZTO Express, said that it required its franchisees to comply with local laws but that \u201cit\u2019s not up to us to manage or control the compensation of our deliverymen.\u201dSome thrive. Li Pengbo, 21, from Henan Province, drives for Best Express, another large delivery company in which Alibaba owns a stake. He dominates the area he subcontracted from a Best Express franchisee, he said, and earns about $2,000 a month.\u201cSince the sixth day of the last Chinese New Year until now I haven\u2019t rested, not a single day,\u201d Mr. Li said, describing an 11-month stretch. \u201cI work from 6:30 in the morning until 11 or 12 p.m. at night.\u201d\u201cMy family is poor. This bitterness is nothing compared to what they\u2019ve gone through,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman for Best Express said its franchisees were required to follow labor laws.Franchisees say they have borne the brunt of declining delivery prices. \u201cIf we can turn a profit eight months of the year, that\u2019s not bad,\u201d said Wang Lin, a franchisee in Beijing for another delivery company, STO Express.Ms. Wang said her franchise does not pay for driver benefits because the drivers are contractors, not employees.\u201cFrankly it\u2019s not a very good job,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely tiring, the salary is not high, and the responsibility and risks are great.

{"Headline": "MoneyGram Deal May Test Trump\u2019s View on Chinese Investment", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe first test of the Trump administration\u2019s stance on Chinese investment is approaching: Ant Financial\u2019s $880 million acquisition of the United States payment processor MoneyGram.The company has moved into many other areas of Chinese finance, even running an app that allows a small investor to buy bonds online with one click. (More on that later.) With rocket-like growth, Ant Financial recently took in venture capital valuing the company to $60 billion \u2014 nearly as much as the market value of American Express. Ant Financial is aiming for an initial public offering, possibly later this year.The company has global ambitions and recently bought the mobile wallet company Paytm in India, but it is now aiming for the United States with its agreement to buy MoneyGram. The reason for the acquisition is breadth. MoneyGram has been slow to go online, but it has more than 350,000 partners and locations in 200 countries. And as new online entrants like Venmo arise, the market is ripe for disruption.MoneyGram is thus an aging service in need of a shine, a fact reflected in the small 11.5 percent premium to the stock market price that Ant Financial is paying. MoneyGram is also dwarfed by the No. 1 money transfer service, Western Union. But Ant Financial\u2019s acquisition is about leveraging MoneyGram\u2019s ground presence to service the 100 million-plus Chinese who travel abroad every year and use the company.The idea is pretty simple. Plug those travelers into Ant\u2019s huge network and MoneyGram instantly has an enormous digital presence. At the same time, Ant achieves global reach \u2014 and entry into the United States \u2014 for less than $1 billion.The deal sets up an interesting test for the new administration.President Trump has repeatedly accused Beijing of devaluing its currency to put the United States at a disadvantage, but his administration has not yet honored his promise to name China a currency manipulator.The question is whether heated political talk will translate into actions that affect all Chinese investment in the United States. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump said he would block Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group\u2019s acquisition of the Chicago Stock Exchange even though it was a small deal for an exchange that has little of the market in trading.If Mr. Trump wants to deal with Chinese investment and the Ant Financial deal, he has the existing apparatus. The MoneyGram acquisition will be reviewed under the Exon-Florio Amendment. Exon-Florio is the touchstone law that lets the president block foreign acquisitions that threaten national security.Under the law, the president has delegated his review ability to a group representing nine agencies \u2014 the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. The MoneyGram deal will be reviewed by Cfius.In Ant\u2019s case, the company is not affiliated with the military. The Chinese government, however, is represented among its largest shareholders, including China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, a large state-owned bank and a social security fund.So how will Washington look at this acquisition? In a basic sense, the threat to national security is tangential \u2014 this is a payment service with many competitors. Yet MoneyGram is part of the backbone of domestic and international wire transfer.Still, these approvals are likely to come, leaving Cfius as the big hurdle. The Trump administration may come to view the case as a way to show it is opposed to Chinese investment in the United States.The matter may also provide a test case for the reach of banks and payments services. Ant Financial has been rattled by the fallout in China over the default of the telephone maker Cosun on $166 million in bonds that were sold to retail investors on Ant\u2019s financial marketplace.The default shows how quickly finance in China has grown and spread to small investors. It also highlights that new products and new technologies in finance can sometimes arise with a lack of consumer protections. Ant Financial may bring innovative practices to the United States, but some officials in the administration may be wary of the change that could result.So far, Ant Financial has gotten off on the right foot with the new administration. Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s founder, who controls Ant Financial, met with Mr. Trump in January, before the inauguration.\u201cIt was a great meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump said after the meeting. \u201cJack and I are going to do some great things.\u201dDespite those friendly words, Mr. Trump the deal maker may try to seek some concession from Ant Financial as a condition for approval (putting aside the legal questions of such requests). Or the administration could decide that Ant Financial and Mr. Ma are not where they want to take a larger stand against China.The stark alternatives are dizzying in their implications, like many things coming out of Washington.So watch this deal, as the administration\u2019s actions will say a lot about the tone on investment in the United States for years to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With MoneyGram, China\u2019s Ant Financial Gets an American Base", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsJack Ma\u2019s Ant Financial has gotten itself an American colony. The $880 million purchase of the remittances firm MoneyGram in a deal announced on Thursday looks like a counterintuitive bet in a de-globalizing world for the Alibaba founder\u2019s financial services arm. International payments are a tough business. But MoneyGram gives Ant a base with connections to many developing markets.Ant piggybacked off the growth of Alibaba, whose Alipay unit received commissions for each transaction it processed over the companies\u2019 marketplaces. In turn, its payments and financial services division helped the Chinese firm expand its e-commerce business. Alipay\u2019s immense popularity at home has allowed it to accumulate 450 million customers.While Ant has wished to expand internationally, complying with differing regulatory regimes and establishing relationships with all the entities in various nations\u2019 payments chains is a complex process. So it initially limited itself to following Chinese tourists around the world, giving them an option to pay at merchants with Alipay. The company is now steadily scaling up its ambitions as it edges toward an initial public offering.Buying MoneyGram helps on a few fronts. The transfer business is less regulated, and it gives Ant a toehold in the developed American market. MoneyGram specializes in sending money from immigrants back to their home countries. Ant has been moving into developing economies as well, having recently made big investments in India and Thailand. Linking MoneyGram with these operations will be a natural step.Remittances have grown in tandem with emigration. Between 2005 and 2015, the global volume of such payments through so-called formal channels grew to $582 billion from $283 billion, according to research by Aite. MoneyGram and the larger Western Union dominate this market. However, digital upstarts like Azimo and PayPal\u2019s Xoom are taking share, with cheaper and more convenient options. That may explain why Ant had to pay only about 12.5 times expected 2017 earnings for its purchase.Ant hopes its digital expertise will help it fend off these challengers. Dealing with regulators is another matter. The United States has steadily increased regulation of the transfer market over the last two decades. Western Union agreed just last week to pay a $586 million fine after admitting to aiding and abetting wire fraud. Ant\u2019s future public owners had better hope Mr. Ma\u2019s recent visit to Trump Tower gave the Chinese billionaire some assurance that the vise is finished tightening.Advertisement"}

In the halls of the Davos Congress Center, where many of the meetings this week are taking place, investors have tried to make sense of the political upheaval.The world order has been upended. As the United States retreats from the promise of free trade, China is taking up the mantle. The stark shift leaves investors trying to assess the new risk and opportunities in the global economy.\u201cThis is the first time there is absolutely no consensus,\u201d said William F. Browder, a co-founder of Hermitage Capital Management who has been coming to Davos for 21 years. \u201cEveryone is looking into the abyss.\u201dThe religion of the global elite \u2014 free trade and open markets \u2014 is under attack, and there has been a lot of hand-wringing over what Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund has declared a \u201cmiddle-class crisis.\u201dBut while all attendees in Davos have a view on the state of the world, there is little agreement on how to deal with it.The biggest concern? Finding a way to make the people who are driving populist movements feel like they are part of the global economic pie that Davos participants have created and largely own.In a Twitter post from the Swiss resort, Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a political-research firm, offered his advice: \u201cElites won\u2019t be able to manage populism until they stop seeing it as a threat and start seeing it as a symptom.\u201dIf that is the case, Davos has, so far, made little progress.\u201cI want to be loud and clear: Populism scares me,\u201d Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, said during a panel on how to fix the middle-class crisis. \u201cThe No. 1 issue economically as a market participant is how populism manifests itself over the next year or two.\u201d But Mr. Dalio offered little by way of a solution, beyond opining on the positive aspects of loosening regulation and lowering taxes.On the subject of rising populism, Mr. Dalio, who runs the $150 billion investment firm Bridgewater Associates, added: \u201cIt\u2019s an anti-Davos way of operating.\u201dJack Ma, the founder of Alibaba in China, offered his view of the problem in the United States. Americans, he said, \u201cdo not distribute the money properly.\u201dIf there was one thing that Davos attendees agreed on last year, it was that Donald J. Trump would not win the United States presidential election.And so this year, with Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday coinciding with the end of the World Economic Forum, every conversation has drifted to one question: What will the Trump presidency look like, and what will it mean for business?To many American financiers who once opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, the prospect of fewer regulations and a blank slate with a new leader has assuaged some of the fear about uncertainties. At the forum, some attendees have been thrust into a role of interpreting the president-elect to a befuddled global elite.\u201cHe\u2019s not necessarily communicating in a way that the people in this community would love,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund regular at Davos and onetime critic of Mr. Trump who is now set to join the administration as a public liaison and adviser. \u201cBut he is communicating very, very effectively to a very large group of the population in Europe and the U.S. that are feeling a common struggle right now.\u201dMr. Scaramucci promised that Mr. Trump had \u201cthe utmost respect for Angela Merkel,\u201d the German chancellor who was the subject of an attack by the president-elect this week; that he was in fact a champion of free trade; and that he wanted to have a \u201cphenomenal relationship with the Chinese,\u201d despite his fiery anti-China language.Soon after his appearance on a panel, Mr. Scaramucci was on a plane heading to Washington to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. But his words still resonated, mainly because they were being broadcast on a giant screen behind a coffee bar where World Economic Forum participants congregated between meetings.One Davos regular, the billionaire investor Paul Singer, did not attend this year. Mr. Singer, a vociferous critic of Mr. Trump for most of the election campaign, was instead making his way to Washington for the inauguration, having recently donated $1 million to the event.One major investor has not changed his views about Mr. Trump, however.George Soros, the investor and philanthropist who has called Mr. Trump \u201ca con man,\u201d hosted a dinner on Thursday evening in Davos, during which he said that Mr. Trump \u201cwould be a dictator if he could get away with it.\u201d This was unlikely to happen, he added, because of strong democratic institutions in the United States.For those who have been puzzled over market euphoria since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Soros put it this way: \u201cMarkets see Trump dismantling regulations and reducing taxes \u2014 and that has been their dream.\u201dBut Mr. Soros, who became known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, added that he was convinced that Mr. Trump would fail. \u201cI don\u2019t think the markets are going to do very well,\u201d he said.When President Xi Jinping addressed the Davos forum, becoming the first Chinese head of state to do so, his message was clear: China is ready for the world stage. He championed free trade and open markets, setting the tone for the week.On the sidelines, the country\u2019s business leaders echoed that sentiment.Among the delegation that arrived in Davos with Mr. Xi were some of China\u2019s biggest business leaders including Mr. Ma, Wang Jianlin of Dalian Wanda, and top executives from Baidu, Huawei Technologies and China Telecom. Through the week, they have been meeting with investors and talking deals with erstwhile partners.With Mr. Xi\u2019s help, China has fashioned itself here as a new leader of the free-market world.\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if it was President Xi or Ronald Reagan,\u201d joked Thomas W. Farley, president of the New York Stock Exchange. At a lunch with Mr. Ma of Alibaba, Mr. Xi was quoting Abraham Lincoln, Mr. Ma told a small group of participants on Wednesday.It was a message somewhat at odds with the roots of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party. And back in Washington, Wilbur Ross, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, did not mince words, calling China \u201cthe most protectionist\u201d major economy, setting the stage for a possible trade war.But in Davos, there was a sense that change in the economic order was afoot.Alicia B\u00e1rcena Ibarra, who heads the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, told a small group that China could soon overtake the United States when it comes to importance in Latin America.She described how on the same day last year that Mr. Trump told the world he would not sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Xi arrived for a summit meeting in Chile.\u201cSo can you imagine the impact when he came talking about free trade as he did this morning?\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Xi\u2019s address on Tuesday in Davos. \u201cChina now is the second-most important trade partner of Latin America after the U.S.\u201d\u201cMaybe this is going to change,\u201d she added. \u201cVery soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time. We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague.In fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague. A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at \u2014 at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game. One report now suggested apparently it\u2019s another Michael Cohen. For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful.With that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today, but I\u2019m even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again.(APPLAUSE)Now, the president-elect\u2019s leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive. But as the chairman of the transition effort, I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring. To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet.Nineteen of the 21 cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a \u2014 it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward. Perhaps that\u2019s why there\u2019s been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration.You know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be. But with freedom comes responsibility. And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it.(APPLAUSE)But today, we\u2019ll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again. And we\u2019ll hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today.So, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the president-elect of the United States of America, Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis. I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it\u2019s good to be with you.But I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years \u2014 a couple in particular \u2014 and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station.So, I just want to compliment many of the people in the room. I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that. But I will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional \u2014 so incredibly professional, that I\u2019ve just gone up a notch as to what I think of you. OK?All right. We\u2019ve had some great news over the last couple of weeks. I\u2019ve been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country. A lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies \u2014 big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest.You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they\u2019re going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant.I appreciate that from Ford. I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler. I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be. I think a lot of people will be following. I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back.We\u2019ve got to get our drug industry back. Our drug industry has been disastrous. They\u2019re leaving left and right. They supply our drugs, but they don\u2019t make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they\u2019re getting away with murder.Pharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there\u2019s very little bidding on drugs. We\u2019re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don\u2019t bid properly and we\u2019re going to start bidding and we\u2019re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.And we\u2019re going to do that with a lot of other industries. I\u2019m very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the F-35, you\u2019ve been reading about it. And it\u2019s way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget. I don\u2019t like that. And the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic. I\u2019ve really gotten to know them well. And we\u2019re going to do some big things on the F-35 program, and perhaps the F-18 program. And we\u2019re going to get those costs way down and we\u2019re going to get the plane to be even better. And we\u2019re going to have some competition and it\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing.So, we\u2019ve been very, very much involved, and other things. We had Jack Ma, we had so many incredible people coming here. There are no \u2014 they\u2019re going to do tremendous things \u2014 tremendous things in this country. And they\u2019re very excited.And I will say, if the election didn\u2019t turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here. They would not be in my office. They would not be in anybody else\u2019s office. They\u2019d be building and doing things in other countries. So, there\u2019s a great spirit going on right now. A spirit that many people have told me they\u2019ve never seen before, ever.We\u2019re going to create jobs. I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. And I mean that, I really \u2014 I\u2019m going to work very hard on that. We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we\u2019re going to do a real job. And I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve done.And we haven\u2019t even gotten there yet. I look very much forward to the inauguration. It\u2019s going to be a beautiful event. We have great talent, tremendous talent. And we have the \u2014 all of the bands \u2014 or most of the bands are from the different \u2014 from the different segments of the military. And I\u2019ve heard some of these bands over the years, they\u2019re incredible.We\u2019re going to have a very, very elegant day. The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special; very beautiful. And I think we\u2019re going to have massive crowds because we have a movement.And we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they\u2019re gonna have a lot of security. They\u2019re going to have a lot of good news for their veterans.And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we\u2019ll do a news release in a little while. Tell you about David, he\u2019s fantastic \u2014 he\u2019s fantastic. He will do a truly great job.One of the commitments I made is that we\u2019re gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans. Our veterans have been treated horribly. They\u2019re waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they can\u2019t see a doctor. By the time they get to the doctor, they\u2019re terminal. Not gonna happen, it\u2019s not gonna happen.So, David is going to do a fantastic job. We\u2019re going to be talking to a few people also to help David. And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more than we have. And we\u2019re gonna set up a \u2014 a group.These are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line. And they\u2019re going to get together with their great doctors \u2014 Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved.Ike Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business. And we\u2019re gonna straighten out the V.A. for our veterans. I\u2019ve been promising that for a long time and it\u2019s something I feel very, very strongly.So, you\u2019ll get the information on David. And I think you\u2019ll be very impressed with the job he does. We looked long and hard. We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good. But we had a lot of talent. And we think this election will be something that will, with time \u2014 with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good \u2018cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly.OK, questions? Yes, John (ph)?A couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we\u2019re looking for further clarification on.And if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States?And \u2014 but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. And I will say, again, I think it\u2019s a disgrace that information would be let out.I saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting. It\u2019s all fake news. It\u2019s phony stuff. It didn\u2019t happen. And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. It was a group of opponents that got together \u2014 sick people \u2014 and they put that crap together.So, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. It should have never been \u2014 number one, shouldn\u2019t have even entered paper. But it should have never have been released. But I read what was released and I think it\u2019s a disgrace. I think it\u2019s an absolute disgrace.As far as hacking, I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. And I \u2014 I can say that you know when \u2014 when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China.We had \u2014 we had much hacking going on. And one of the things we\u2019re gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we\u2019ve assembled. You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world \u2014 they were never in the same room together as a group. And we\u2019re gonna put those minds together and we\u2019re going to form a defense.And I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense.And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through.We have to do that for our country. It\u2019s very important.(CROSSTALK)Now, somebody would say, \u201cOh, of course he\u2019s gonna say that.\u201dI respected the fact that he said that.And I \u2014 I\u2019ll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would\u2019ve released it; they would\u2019ve been glad to release it.I think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would\u2019ve released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her. I mean what he said about her was horrible.If somebody said about me, what Podesta said about Hillary, I was the boss, I would\u2019ve fired him immediately or that person. Because what he said about her was horrible.But remember this: We talk about the hacking and hacking\u2019s bad and it shouldn\u2019t be done. But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking.That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn\u2019t report it? That\u2019s a horrible thing. That\u2019s a horrible thing.Can you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate \u2014 it would\u2019ve been the biggest story in the history of stories. And they would\u2019ve said immediately, \u201cYou have to get out of the race.\u201d Nobody even talked about it. It\u2019s a very terrible thing.Yeah?(CROSSTALK)On that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election.Do you accept that part of the finding? And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place?If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That\u2019s called an asset, not a liability.Now, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m gonna get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t. And if I don\u2019t, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Give me a break.OK?(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)When I leave our country, I\u2019m a very high-profile person, would you say?I am extremely careful. I\u2019m surrounded by bodyguards. I\u2019m surrounded by people.And I always tell them \u2014 anywhere, but I always tell them if I\u2019m leaving this country, \u201cBe very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you\u2019re gonna probably have cameras.\u201d I\u2019m not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.And number one, \u201cI hope you\u2019re gonna be good anyway. But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places. Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can\u2019t see them and you won\u2019t know. You better be careful, or you\u2019ll be watching yourself on nightly television.\u201dI tell this to people all the time.I was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well \u2014 Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well.And I told many people, \u201cBe careful, because you don\u2019t wanna see yourself on television. Cameras all over the place.\u201dAnd again, not just Russia, all over.Does anyone really believe that story?I\u2019m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)Based on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified? Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise? And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it?As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. I have assets that are \u2014 and now people have found out how big the company is, I have very little debt \u2014 I have very low debt. But I have no loans with Russia at all.And I thought that was important to put out. I certified that. So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don\u2019t want to because I think that would be a conflict. So I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals.Now, I have to say one other thing. Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Damack, a friend of mine, great guy. And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai \u2014 a number of deals and I turned it down.I didn\u2019t have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I\u2019m president, which is \u2014 I didn\u2019t know about that until about three months ago, but it\u2019s a nice thing to have. But I don\u2019t want to take advantage of something. I have something that others don\u2019t have, Vice President Pence also has it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll need it, I have a feeling he\u2019s not going to need it.But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president. It was many, many years old, this is for presidents. Because they don\u2019t want presidents getting \u2014 I understand they don\u2019t want presidents getting tangled up in minutia; they want a president to run the country. So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time.I don\u2019t like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one to be able to do that. You can\u2019t do that in any other capacity. But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company \u2014 the country. I\u2019d do a very good job, but I don\u2019t want to do that.Now, all of these papers that you see here \u2014 yes, go ahead.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)And what I\u2019m going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company. They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They\u2019re not going to discuss it with me. Again, I don\u2019t have to do this. They\u2019re not going to discuss it with me. And with that, I\u2019m going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she\u2019s going to go \u2014 these papers are just some of the many documents that I\u2019ve signed turning over complete and total control to my sons.(CROSSTALK)He\u2019s asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he\u2019s taking. As you know, the business empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president. But at that time, no one was so concerned.President-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people\u2019s business and not his own. To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company.He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.Even so, President-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests. He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit. He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law.Critical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him. He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H.W. Bush\u2019s Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center.Mr. Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan. He\u2019s here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump organization.I\u2019m gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking. First, President-elect Trump\u2019s investments and business assets commonly known as the \u2014 as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th. Here is just some of the paperwork that\u2019s taking care of those actions.Second, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump.Further, at the president-elect\u2019s direction, the trust agreement provides \u2014 that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team. The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns.President-elect Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency. President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities.Further, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization. As she and Jared move their family to D.C., Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools.The president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments. As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets. Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics.Second, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with. Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods. Things like Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust.Through instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect trust \u2014 President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric.DILLON: The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump\u2019s presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process.The president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. Because any new deal could \u2014 and I emphasize could \u2014 be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues.The ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts. Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval.To further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization, President-elect Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights. Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole. There will be no separate business by business accounting.Another step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization; the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency.He has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to President-elect Trump\u2019s role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency.In sum, all of these actions \u2014 complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights \u2014 will sever President-elect Trump\u2019s presidency from the Trump Organization.Some have asked questions. Why not divest? Why not just sell everything? Form of blind trust. And I\u2019d like to turn to addressing some of those questions now.Selling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest. In fact, it would exacerbate them. The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization\u2019s assets. If President-elect Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency.Further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect. And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn\u2019t even feasible.Some people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children. This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated. And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now.Some people have suggested that the Trump \u2014 that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company. Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter. It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization.Some people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses. President Trump can\u2019t unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized.DILLON: Further, it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization. The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets. And this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective. It creates a complete separation from President-elect Trump \u2014 it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new deal.I\u2019m going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. That\u2019s a word I think we\u2019ve all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before.And we\u2019re gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.Emoluments comes from the Constitution. The Constitution says \u201cofficials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office.\u201dThe so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder.No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument.But since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm\u2019s-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn\u2019t even aware of.These people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It\u2019s not an emolument.The Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here. But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires.So, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit.In sum, I and president-elect\u2019s (sic) other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we\u2019ve outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family.We believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elect\u2019s desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure.The American people were well \u2014 well aware of President-elect Trump\u2019s business empire and financial interests when they voted. Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.President-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)What is your response to your critics that say not only you, but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest?And do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your \u2014 your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration...(CROSSTALK)I watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general. And he was brilliant. And what people don\u2019t know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama. And he was brilliant yesterday.So, I really think that they are \u2014 I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together. And we\u2019ve been hearing that from so many people. People are so happy.You know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil. When there was a find, he would get it. When they needed something, he would be there.A friend of mine who\u2019s very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm \u2014 big supporter \u2014 he said there\u2019s nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson.And that\u2019s what we want. That\u2019s what I want to bring to government.I want to bring the greatest people into government, because we\u2019re way behind. We don\u2019t make good deals any more. I say it all the time in speeches. We don\u2019t make good deals anymore; we make bad deals. Our trade deals are a disaster.TRUMP: We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis \u2014 hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody. We don\u2019t make good deals anymore.So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they\u2019re smart. And that\u2019s what I\u2019d put, I\u2019m very proud of the Cabinet, I think they\u2019re doing very well.It\u2019s very interesting how it\u2019s going, but it\u2019s \u2014 I think they\u2019re doing very, very well.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)They can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you. In some cases, they guide you incorrectly. In most cases, you realize what\u2019s happened, it\u2019s imploding as we sit.Some states have over a hundred percent increase and \u201917 and I said this two years ago, \u201917 is going to be the bad year. It\u2019s going to be catastrophic. Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the people.We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare. We don\u2019t wanna own it, we don\u2019t wanna own it politically. They own it right now.So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in \u201917 and believe me, we\u2019d get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time. We\u2019re going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary\u2019s approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan.It\u2019ll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour.So we\u2019re gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff. And we\u2019re gonna get a health bill passed, we\u2019re gonna get health care taken care of in this country. You have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can\u2019t even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high.Obamacare is the Democrats problem. We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them. We\u2019re doing them a tremendous service by doing it. We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service.So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we\u2019ll be filing a plan. And it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times. And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare.We\u2019re going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)And then my follow-up question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts?And they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us, a lot. But those were \u2014 that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it\u2019s always tough when they\u2019re building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement.TRUMP: So I wanna thank United Technologies. But we\u2019ve been meeting with a lot of companies. But what really is happening, is the word is now out, that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason, it\u2019s not going to happen that way anymore.You want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you\u2019re going to build that plant in Mexico and you\u2019re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you\u2019re making, and you\u2019re going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border \u2014 not a weak border like it is \u2014 we don\u2019t even have a border. It\u2019s an open sieve.But you\u2019re going to sell through a very strong border \u2014 not going to happen. You\u2019re going to pay a very large border tax. So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina. You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan.You can do anywhere \u2014 you\u2019ve got a lot of states at play; a lot of competition. So it\u2019s not like, oh, gee, I\u2019m taking the competition away. You\u2019ve got a lot of places you can move. And I don\u2019t care, as along as it\u2019s within the United States, the borders of the United States.There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. And you\u2019d have millions more workers right now in the United States that are \u2014 96 million really wanting a job and they can\u2019t get. You know that story. The real number \u2014 that\u2019s the real number.So, that\u2019s the way it is. OK. Go ahead.And on the Supreme Court, what\u2019s your timeline? You said a while ago you were down to four. Have you conducted those interviews yet? What\u2019s your timeline for nominating?And on the border fence, it now appears clear U.S. taxpayers will have to pay for it up front. What is your plan to...(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)On the fence \u2014 it\u2019s not a fence. It\u2019s a wall. You just misreported it. We\u2019re going to build a wall. I could wait about a year-and-a-half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office, but I don\u2019t want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin.I don\u2019t feel like waiting a year or a year-and-a-half. We\u2019re going to start building. Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment \u2014 probably less likely that it\u2019s a payment. But it will happen.So, remember this, OK? I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy. I would then say, who is going to pay for the wall? And people would all scream out \u2014 25,000, 30,000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had. You know that. You don\u2019t like to report that, but that\u2019s OK.OK, now he agrees. Finally, he agrees.But I say who is going to pay for the wall? And they will scream out, \u201cMexico.\u201dNow, reports went out last week \u2014 oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement. What\u2019s the difference? I want to get the wall started. I don\u2019t want to wait a year-and-a-half until I make my deal with Mexico. And we probably will have a deal sooner than that.And by the way, Mexico has been so nice, so nice. I respect the government of Mexico. I respect the people of Mexico. I love the people of Mexico. I have many people from Mexico working for me. They\u2019re phenomenal people.The government of Mexico is terrific. I don\u2019t blame them for what\u2019s happened. I don\u2019t blame them for taking advantage of the United States. I wish our politicians were so smart. Mexico has taken advantage of the United States. I don\u2019t blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of Mexico. What I say is we shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore.So, in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed. OK?Supreme Court judge. So, as you know, I have a list of 20. I\u2019ve gone through them. We\u2019ve met with numerous candidates. They\u2019re outstanding in every case. They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society. Jim DeMint was also very much involved, and his group, which is fantastic, and he\u2019s a fantastic guy.TRUMP: So between Leo and Jim DeMint and some senators and some congresspeople, we have a great group of people. I\u2019ll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the United States Supreme Court, a replacement for the great, great Justice Scalia. That will be probably within two weeks of the 20th. So within about two weeks, probably the second week. I consider the first day because we\u2019ll also be doing some \u2014 some pretty good signings and I think what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll wait until Monday.That will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday, because on Friday, people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration, and then Saturday, as you know, we\u2019re having a big church service and lots of good things are happening. So our first day \u2014 and you\u2019ll all be invited to the signings, but we\u2019ll be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday, and then also the next week. And you\u2019re all invited.But on the Supreme Court, I\u2019ll be making that decision, and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in. I think it\u2019s one of the reasons I got elected. I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court, so I think it was a very, very big decision as to why I was elected.As far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they\u2019re going to suffer the consequences. They already are. And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up \u2014 and by the way, we just found out I was coming down. Michael Cohen \u2014 I was being \u2014 Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer. He\u2019s a good lawyer in my firm. It was just reported that it wasn\u2019t this Michael Cohen they we\u2019re talking about. So all night long it\u2019s Michael Cohen.I said, \u201cI want to see your passport.\u201d He brings his passport to my office. I say, hey, wait a minute. He didn\u2019t leave the country. He wasn\u2019t out of the country. They had Michael Cohen of the Trump Organization was in Prague. It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen. It\u2019s a disgrace what took place. It\u2019s a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen.(APPLAUSE)Go ahead. Go ahead. You\u2019ve been waiting.As far as we understand it, the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news, as you describe it. If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up, that any of it is true, will you consider your position...You know, I\u2019ve been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they\u2019re talking about people that go and say all sorts of things. But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news more so than anybody. I could name them, but I won\u2019t bother, but you have a few sitting right in front of us. They\u2019re very, very dishonest people, but I think it\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have to live with.TRUMP: I guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back. When it happens to somebody that doesn\u2019t have this \u2014 doesn\u2019t have that kind of a megaphone, they can\u2019t speak back. It\u2019s a very sad thing. I\u2019ve seen people destroyed. I\u2019ve seen people absolutely destroyed. And I think it\u2019s very unfair. So, all I can ask for is honest reporters.Yes?(CROSSTALK)I want them to cover this situation. I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly \u2014 because we\u2019re hacked by everybody \u2014 you know, the United States, our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst, it\u2019s number 17, in terms of protection.If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries \u2014 they put this in the category of an industry \u2014 the United States is last in terms of protecting, let\u2019s say, hacking defense. Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National Committee.That\u2019s why we weren\u2019t hacked. By the way, we were told that they were trying to hack us, but they weren\u2019t able to hack. And I think I get some credit because I told Reince, and Reince did a phenomenal job, but I said I want strong hacking defense.The Democratic National Committee didn\u2019t do that. Maybe that\u2019s why the country runs so badly that way. But I will tell you \u2014 wait \u2014 wait \u2014 wait, let me finish. Within 90 days, we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomena \u2014 fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybody.That includes Russia and China and everybody \u2014 everybody. OK.(CROSSTALK)I\u2019ll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody\u2019s leaking it out. So, there\u2019s \u2014 maybe it\u2019s my office. Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people. Maybe it\u2019s them. And what I did is I said I won\u2019t tell anybody. I\u2019m going to have a meeting and I won\u2019t tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence.And what happened is I had my meeting. Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn\u2019t know \u2014 I didn\u2019t tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.So, I don\u2019t want that \u2014 I don\u2019t want that. It\u2019s very unfair to the country. It\u2019s very unfair to our country; what\u2019s happened. That report should have never \u2014 first of all, it shouldn\u2019t have been printed because it\u2019s not worth the paper it\u2019s written on. And I thank the New York Times for saying that.I thank a lot of different people for saying that. But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK.(CROSSTALK)We have to work something out, but it\u2019s not just Russia. Take a look at what\u2019s happened. You don\u2019t report it the same way; 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China. And that\u2019s because we have no defense. That\u2019s because we\u2019re run by people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.TRUMP: Russia will have far greater respect for our country when I\u2019m leading it and I believe and I hope \u2014 maybe it won\u2019t happen, it\u2019s possible. But I won\u2019t be giving (ph) a little reset button like Hillary. Here, press this piece of plastic. A guy looked at her like what is she doing? There\u2019s no reset button. We\u2019re either going to get along or we\u2019re not. I hope we get along, but if we don\u2019t, that\u2019s possible too.But Russia and other countries \u2014 and other countries, including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress, total. Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations.I want to thank everybody. So this is all \u2014 just so you understand, these papers \u2014 because I\u2019m not sure that was explained properly. But these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I hope at the end of eight years, I\u2019ll come back and say, oh, you did a good job. Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I\u2019ll say, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201dGood-bye, everybody. Good-bye.ENDAdvertisement"}

Mr. Trump made job creation central to his campaign, but many chief executives want to use repatriated cash to do stock buybacks and make deals instead.As well as wanting to shape policy in their favor, some of the executives see their visits as a defensive measure \u2014 to avoid the president\u2019s wrath later.Drug companies already face clear opposition from Mr. Trump, who has said they were \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201dIt has been a long goodbye for Marissa Mayer, the company\u2019s chief executive, and it looks like it could get longer.Two disclosures about thefts of sensitive data did not prevent its business from improving slightly at the ending last year.

{"Headline": "How Davos Brings the Global Elite Together", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byHeads of state, captains of industry, prominent academics, philanthropists and a retinue of journalists, celebrities and hangers-on will descend Tuesday on Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum.For most of the year, Davos is a resort town high in the Swiss Alps with a population of just 11,000. But for two weeks each January, the town\u2019s population swells to 30,000 as the global elite meet for a series of meetings and discussions about \u201centrepreneurship in the global public interest,\u201d in what could be described as world\u2019s most expensive networking event.Beyond the events on the conference\u2019s official calendar are an even more exclusive series of parties, dinners and outings.Founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a German economics professor, the European Economic Forum began as a conference for European business leaders to discuss catching up with American management processes. Two years later, the conference had shifted its focus to global economic and social issues, and the first political leaders were invited to attend.In 1987 the organization was renamed the World Economic Forum, and its annual conference was well enough known to be referred to simply as Davos. The conference has been the site of several historic meetings, including two in 1989: the first ministerial-level meeting between North and South Korea, and another between the leaders of East and West Germany.As the prestige of the conference grew, more politicians, thought leaders and celebrities began attending the event.More than 2,500 people will attend this year\u2019s conference from 90 different countries. Most of the participants are corporate executives, but more than two dozen heads of state and government are expected to attend.Theresa May, the prime minister of Britain, and Xi Jinping, president of China, are attending the conference for the first time this year. Mr. Xi is the first Chinese president to attend the event.But even world leaders are often seen craning their heads for a glimpse at the boldfaced names in attendance. The singer Shakira and the actor Forest Whitaker are to receive awards this year. Expected attendees include Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook; the actor and activist Matt Damon; the Formula One driver Nico Rosberg; and Jack Ma, the Chinese billionaire and founder of Alibaba.Though gender equality is often discussed at the forum, just 17 percent of last year\u2019s participants were women, according to the forum.All of those dignitaries need security. During the conference, Davos transforms into a veritable fortress. Roadblocks restrict traffic on the city\u2019s main streets and checkpoints spring up outside each venue. At the Congress Center, where the main panels take place, and at each hotel that hosts parties and talks, attendees pass metal detectors, armed guards and beneath the watchful eyes of sharpshooters.In the past, the conference was targeted by protesters associated with the anticapitalist Occupy movement. In 2013, members of the Ukrainian activist group Femen were arrested after a topless demonstration.The Swiss government estimated it will spend 8 million Swiss francs, about $8 million, on security, but said that number could increase if there were a credible threat to the conference.\u201cSwitzerland is still not regarded as a priority target for jihadist terrorists,\u201d the Federal Council said on its website. \u201cOn the other hand, even on Swiss soil, the interests of states participating in the military coalition against the so-called Islamic State face an increased threat.\u201dThe annual meeting runs on a tiered system of colored badges denoting just how important one is, or is not. White badges are for attendees able to attend any official event and make full use of the forum\u2019s facilities. Orange badges are reserved for the 500 journalists who cover the forum, but are not allowed at some parties. Other badges, like purple ones, denote technical or support staff and limit their holders to a few areas.If that system were not complicated enough, local hotels like the Belvedere and the InterContinental often sell their own badges to the bankers and consultants who descend upon Davos \u2014 but not the forum itself \u2014 to strike deals and chat up clients. These souls camp out at the hotels, renting rooms for business meetings by day and soiree hopping at night.Most of the events center on talking. But beyond lectures and panel discussions, the agenda also features more esoteric attractions. One notable event is a simulation of a refugee\u2019s experience, where Davos attendees crawl on their hands and knees and pretend to flee from advancing armies.It is one of the most popular events every year.The theme of this year\u2019s conference is \u201cResponsive and Responsible Leadership.\u201d But attendees like to play as hard as they work.There are several official cocktail receptions, but the action really lies in a galaxy of events hosted by corporations. Some are small, intimate dinners that feature the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio and Bono.Others are dazzling affairs: JPMorgan Chase, for example, has previously taken over the Kirchner Museum Davos for drinks with its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister.Google\u2019s annual party at the InterContinental Hotel has become the hottest ticket in town. The investor Anthony Scaramucci, now an adviser to Donald J. Trump, for years has hosted a reception at the famed Hotel Europe featuring a sometimes eye-popping list of high-end Champagne and Bordeaux red wine.A more recent up-and-comer is hosted by Salesforce.com, a business software maker, whose chief, Marc Benioff, is one of the forum\u2019s most ardent boosters. Last year\u2019s Salesforce party included Mr. Benioff flying in scores of fresh flower leis and a band from Hawaii, as Eric Schmidt of Google and other tech notables danced in a corner.Several years ago, Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame, hosted an over-the-top gathering that featured stuffed animal heads shooting laser beams out of their eyes. And the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska has thrown opulent gatherings at a nearby villa where the Champagne flowed freelyFor a nightcap, the Davos crowd traditionally retires to the Tonic Bar at Hotel Europe, sipping cocktails while the forum fixture Barry Colson leads the crowd in Billy Joel singalongs.Michael J. de la Merced reported from San Francisco, and Russell Goldman from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Era of Trump, China\u2019s President Champions Economic Globalization", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 In a world troubled by grave uncertainties over the basics governing trade, security and the mission to limit climate change, President Xi Jinping of China on Tuesday portrayed his nation as a responsible global citizen dedicated to furthering international integration.That a leader of the People\u2019s Republic of China can stake a claim to the mantle of leadership in the realm of free trade speaks to the unforeseen, even surreal alteration of the global order in recent months.\u201cPursuing protectionism is just like locking oneself in a dark room,\u201d the Chinese president declared. \u201cWhile wind and rain may be kept outside, so are light and air. No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war.\u201dIn myriad ways, Mr. Xi is a strikingly ill-fitting steward of openness and connectivity.Under his direction, China\u2019s Communist Party has clamped down severely on civil society, tightening restrictions on the internet and jailing scores of lawyers focused on using the country\u2019s own laws to defend the rights of aggrieved people. He has projected China\u2019s navy into contested waters in the South China and East China Seas.Throughout his speech, Mr. Xi carefully used the phrase \u201ceconomic globalization,\u201d while avoiding unqualified \u201cglobalization,\u201d reflecting China\u2019s spurning of an open internet, universal human rights and free elections.But the populist ferment refashioning the global order has made previously unthinkable roles possible. In the United States, the supposed citadel of free market enterprise, a wealthy real estate magnate has captured the White House on the strength of his appeal as a supposed champion of blue-collar workers. Here in Davos, where technology executives fret about the plight of sub-Saharan Africa while drinking champagne paid for by investment banks, the chairman of the Communist Party of China \u2014 an institution that rules in the name of peasant-led revolution \u2014 draped himself in the banner of globalization.None of these details were featured in Mr. Xi\u2019s highly choreographed appearance at the gathering that has become a rite of passage into the ranks of the global elite.For Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, the participation of China\u2019s president amounted to a public relations coup because it was the first time a Chinese head of state had attended. Mr. Schwab obliged with his trademark soft treatment. He asked no questions, solicited none from the audience, and delivered an introductory address so laudatory that it provoked winces among some in the audience.\u201cIn a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility, the international community is looking to China to continue its responsive and responsible leadership in providing all of us with confidence and stability,\u201d Mr. Schwab said.That Mr. Xi chose this year to make his debut underscores China\u2019s attempt to improve its international standing just as much of the world appears in turmoil.The United States is about to inaugurate as president someone who has questioned the relevance of powerful institutions that have anchored the world order for decades, from NATO to the World Trade Organization. Britain is pursuing a fraught divorce from the European Union, dealing a blow to those who have advanced regional integration as a solution to economic and security problems.The growing electoral strength of populist, anti-European Union parties in France, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany has intensified fears that the union may not endure.These developments have yielded a gnawing sense that a complex world is suddenly short of adult supervision. Mr. Xi devoted his speech to trying to fill that vacuum, casting China as a trustworthy power in which serious-minded people are taking considered action to address consequential challenges \u2014 from climate change to a weak global economy.\u201cThis appears to be a time of uncertainty in the United States, in the U.K.,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent venture capitalist in Beijing who invests in emerging Chinese companies. \u201cThe world needs strong leaders to give the world confidence.\u201dIn keeping with the traditions of speeches delivered by senior Chinese officials, Mr. Xi\u2019s address was long on platitudes, tortured metaphors and literary references, while nearly bereft of policy pronouncements.Yet, in totality, it delivered a striking message: In an era in which the United States and Britain are consumed with recriminations over the strains of globalization, China will continue to tether its fortunes to world trade.\u201cChina has no intention to boost its trade competitiveness by devaluing the RMB,\u201d Mr. Xi said.In another implicit rebuke of Mr. Trump, the Chinese president argued forcefully for follow-through on the 2015 Paris climate accord. Mr. Trump has threatened to renounce the deal while naming to his cabinet several people who question the basic scientific consensus on climate change.\u201cThe Paris agreement was hard won,\u201c Mr. Xi said. \u201cAll signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it, as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations.\u201dMr. Xi was accompanied by an enormous delegation of Chinese officials and business executives who reveled in a moment on the world stage, posing for photos as they awaited the president\u2019s arrival.In conversations on the sidelines, many expressed concerns about the threats of tariffs from the incoming Trump administration, fearing the consequences of a potential trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. But most assumed tough rhetoric would eventually give way to the realities of shared commercial interests.China relies on access to the United States, the largest consumer market on earth, as the landing place for its exports. The United States depends upon China for a vast range of finished goods.Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant, said he assumed cooler heads would find a way to avoid trade hostilities.\u201cI don\u2019t think it will happen,\u201d he said of the hostilities. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a disaster if it does.\u201dBut on Tuesday, as he waited for the Chinese president to deliver his address, Mr. Fu, who recently retired from another major Chinese energy company but retains a party post, expressed confidence that Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump would forge common ground.\u201cEventually, they will cooperate to get more benefits,\u201d Mr. Fu said. \u201cAt the beginning, Trump will say something very harsh. He will try to do something punishing. But this is a double-edged sword. Once he\u2019s in the White House, he will see things differently.\u201dMichael Forsythe contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Nominates Wall Street Lawyer to Head S.E.C.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byThe Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles, nor is he well known in corporate America. He is the insider\u2019s insider \u2014 a deal maker.As such, his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. In contrast, the agency\u2019s two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds.Mr. Clayton, known as Jay, has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms. His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities.He had a front-row seat to the financial crisis, advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings, including the biggest ever, the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013.Still, such recusals are not unusual. Laura S. Unger, a former commissioner and acting chairwoman, said that during her tenure, she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission. She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission\u2019s ethics officer.\u201cAn ethics officer at the S.E.C. knows all of your intimate details, and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts,\u201d she noted.Mr. Trump, who met with Mr. Clayton on Dec. 22, said in a statement that the lawyer \u201cwill ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.\u201dMr. Clayton is expected to face scrutiny on his confirmation as a Sullivan & Cromwell colleague, H. Rodgin Cohen, did in 2009. Mr. Cohen, the dean of Wall Street lawyers, withdrew his name from consideration for a senior Treasury role amid an outcry over his deep involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how an attorney who spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump\u2019s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from \u2018getting away with murder,\u2019\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said. \u201cI look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from financial institutions the S.E.C. oversees and work to prevent another financial crisis.\u201dRequests to speak with Mr. Clayton at Sullivan & Cromwell were not answered.A number of fellow deal lawyers said they were glad that the 50-year-old practitioner could be at the helm of the S.E.C.\u201cHe\u2019s a very smart, pragmatic guy who has real deal experience and has seen this stuff firsthand,\u201d said Richard Truesdell, a head of Davis Polk\u2019s global capital markets group, who has worked with Mr. Clayton on several deals. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of buzz today, and I have yet to talk to anyone who isn\u2019t pleasantly surprised by the choice.\u201dThe role of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors and enable companies to raise capital through the public markets in a way that fosters economic growth.The latter is a key tenet of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plan, with the aim that companies can use the excess capital to create jobs.Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the S.E.C. appointed by President George W. Bush, said Mr. Clayton was a \u201chigh-quality appointment.\u201d\u201cIt is especially logical with respect to the agency\u2019s obligation to promote capital formation, a subject with which the incoming administration is appropriately concerned,\u201d said Mr. Pitt in an email. \u201cMr. Clayton\u2019s background is very impressive \u2014 both for the depth of his experience, and for the quality of his efforts.\u201dMr. Clayton went to the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cambridge for separate bachelor\u2019s degrees and then obtained his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.Mr. Clayton donated to Mitt Romney and Mr. Obama in previous presidential elections and to Jeb Bush\u2019s primary campaign in 2015, according to public records.Those who know Mr. Clayton describe him as the roll-up-his-sleeves type, a doer who is often in the shadows of the better known Mr. Cohen at Sullivan & Cromwell.\u201cWhen I think about the position, the guy has a really deep understanding of the capital markets and financial regulatory matters, so he checks those boxes,\u201d said Brad Whitman, vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, who has worked with Mr. Clayton over many years. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great appreciation for what drives business and growth.\u201dReporting was contributed by Matthew Goldstein, Ben Protess, Alexandra Stevenson and Michael J. de la Merced.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba Looks to Bricks and Mortar With Bid for Mall Operator in China", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Alibaba is pushing further into the very sector that it helped to disrupt with a $2.6 billion bid for Intime Retail, a department store and mall operator in China.Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce behemoth, already owned 28 percent of Intime, which is listed in Hong Kong, and made an offer with Shen Guo Jun, the founder of the department store chain, to take the company private.The buyers have offered 10 Hong Kong dollars, or about $1.29, per Intime share, a 42 percent premium over its closing price on Dec. 28, when trading of its stock was suspended. The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, would give Alibaba a controlling stake of about 74 percent.The takeover of Intime is part of a strategy that makes Alibaba a rarity among major global e-commerce companies \u2014 it has spent billions buying up pieces of the very retail sector it disrupted.Alibaba has also bucked the trend among its peers with logistics. Unlike Amazon and JD.com, its Chinese rival, Alibaba has shied away from owning its own inventory or trying to build out logistics.That Alibaba begins the year with a major acquisition shows that the company has no intention of slowing its merger binge. Even as some have wondered how the company can digest and manage the myriad strategic investments and acquisitions it has made in recent years, it seems set to continue buying where it sees opportunities.\u201cWe don\u2019t divide the world into real or virtual economies, only the old and new,\u201d Daniel Zhang, the Alibaba chief executive, said in the news release. \u201cThose who cling on to the old ways of retailing will be disrupted, and brick-and-mortar businesses will be able to create value for consumers if they are integrated with the power of mobile reach, real-time consumer insights, and technology capability to improve operating efficiency.\u201dShares in Intime rose 35 percent on Tuesday, the first full day they were allowed to trade after the suspension.Advertisement"}
