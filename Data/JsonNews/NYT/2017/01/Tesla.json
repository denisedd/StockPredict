{"Headline": "Looking for Sales, Watch Brands Extend Warranties", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported bySome watch brands, searching in a down market for ways to attract new buyers and retain the ones they already have, are improving their warranties.After all, what better way to assert confidence in your product?Traditionally, watch warranties are good for two to three years after purchase, covering manufacturer defects affecting the performance of the movement and the watch\u2019s reliability in timekeeping. Normal use and damage caused by the wearer usually are excluded.Rolex, long known for the reliability of its products, has led the way in strengthening warranties. The brand announced in 2015 that all Rolexes purchased through official retailers would be covered for five years, rather than just two. And the warranty is attached to the watch, not the owner, so resales won\u2019t affect the guarantee.A Rolex representative said the extension was intended to demonstrate the brand\u2019s \u201cconfidence in the quality of its products\u201d and its commitment to customers.For other brands, however, changing the fine print is taking a back seat to reshaping the after-sale interaction with clients.HYT announced last year that warranties on all new watches were extended to five years (from three years) and that repairs would be handled through its new Complete Experience department.The idea came to Mr. Dourde when he heard about the experience of a Tesla car owner who had called in for emergency repair.\u201cTesla\u2019s service people made a house call, were able to repair the car on the spot and turned the experience into a brilliant marketing coup for Tesla,\u201d Mr. Dourde said. \u201cWe in the watch industry need to look for new benchmarks on how to deal with clients.\u201dSimilar house calls and invitations to visit the HYT factory in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland, where the brand makes its hydromechanical watches, are now part of a customer\u2019s post-sale benefits.\u201cRecently, we picked up one client\u2019s watch at home,\u201d Mr. Dourde said. \u201cHe wanted to see how repairs would be done, so we invited him to the manufacturer, where he spent a full day and discovered our microfluidic technology at work.\u201d\u201cDropping off a watch for repair can become a hospitality experience,\u201d Mr. Dourde said. \u201cOf course there is a cost to us, but we view it as a marketing expenditure. It is a dimension of our business we are looking to expand strategically, because our clients are our best ambassadors. \u201d\u201cA watch is easier to sell or buy if it has a warranty,\u201d said Charris Yadigaroglou, a representative of MB&F. \u201cThe new warranty was primarily a way for us to support the secondary market for our watches.\u201dThe offer applied to all MB&F timepieces, so even those purchased at auction were included. \u201cA healthy secondary market ultimately helps our brand,\u201d Mr. Yadigaroglou said. \u201cWe do not view auctions as taking away from sales of new watches. We are telling all MB&F watch owners that we stand behind them.\u201dWorking with auction houses, MB&F also provides free repairs. \u201cThese services cost money and tie up manpower, but they are worthwhile because they protect the value of our watches,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are an unconventional brand with an exotic product. We must do a little more.\u201d\u201cTwo years ago, a client was looking to buy one of my watches in auction but had reservations,\u201d Mr. Journe said in an interview. \u201cHe suggested that I buy it in auction and he buy it from me.\u201d Now the company buys and fully restores some limited-edition watches, offering them for resale with statements of provenance, new boxes and three-year warranties.\u201cClients sometimes fear that a watch in auction would be in poor condition,\u201d Mr. Journe said. \u201cBut they would not hesitate to buy the same watch from me with warranty attached.\u201dIt is still unclear how many brands will embrace warranty extensions, but several experts believe such action is part of the industry\u2019s growth.\u201cTimes have changed and we must be more creative with what have generally been negative client experiences,\u201d said Mr. Dourde of HYT. \u201cBeyond the product itself, we must bring modernity into the watchmaking economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Sustainable Travel Is Headed in 2017", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byPURSUITS | SUSTAINABLE TOURISMThere were nearly 1.2 billion international travelers in 2015, up from 674 million in 2000, according to the United Nations. The latest figure represents nearly one out of seven people in the world and is expected to grow to 1.8 billion people by 2030.According to the U.N.W.T.O., sustainable tourism has three guiding principles for hotels, tour operators, airlines and cruises (as well as destinations and tourists): environmentally friendly practices like minimizing the use of plastic; protecting natural and cultural heritage (think rain forests and historic sites); and supporting local communities by employing local staff, buying local products and engaging in charity work.Granted, these aren\u2019t novel ideas, but they are ever-evolving. Here is a snapshot of where sustainable travel stands today and what\u2019s in store for it in the coming year.Cruise lines have lagged behind hotels and airlines when it comes to sustainable travel, Mr. Durband said, but lately that\u2019s changed, with several cruise companies stepping up their efforts.Also, said Rob Zeiger, a Royal Caribbean spokesman, by the end of 2020, its fleet of 44 ships will use seafood only from fisheries and farms certified as sustainable and won\u2019t serve overfished species like swordfish. And most of the ships being built for the line will be powered entirely by natural gas and generate electricity through fuel cells, which produce minimal air pollution.JetBlue made news last year with its purchase of 330,000 million gallons of biofuel \u2014 fuel that is made from organic matter including agricultural products and significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. It will start using it in 2019. \u201cOur initial commitment is to use the fuel in New York City-area airports, and we plan to use it in all of our aircraft,\u201d Sophia Mendelsohn, JetBlue\u2019s head of sustainability, said.According to Ms. Honey of Crest, \u201cThere are a growing number of tour operators today that are committed to running socially and environmentally responsible trips.\u201dEfforts by hotels to go green have been fairly modest: reusing towels and sheets and installing low-flow shower heads, for example. But a growing number of properties are making sustainability their main attraction. \u201cWhen it came to hotels, sustainability was once associated with eco-resorts or African safari camps, where they\u2019ve been working to protect local wildlife for years,\u201d Albert Herrera, the senior vice president of Global Product Partnerships for Virtuoso, said. \u201cBut today, it\u2019s become the defining element of both trendy urban properties and stylish beach resorts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Answer to Tesla Is Hopeful Entrant to Global Car Market", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byWheelsBEIJING \u2014 On a windswept lot near Beijing\u2019s main airport, Lu Qun talks up the electric sports car he hopes will transform him into China\u2019s Elon Musk.\u201cThis is a real performance car,\u201d the entrepreneur boasted of his sleek, gray-and-black Qiantu K50. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. You can feel the quality. You\u2019ll love driving this car.\u201dFor Mr. Lu, 48, the roadster is his best chance to make it big. After a lifetime of obscurity creating vehicles for other companies, the bespectacled engineer is betting that the rise of electric cars will propel his company \u2014 and his country \u2014 into the automotive spotlight.\u201cTraditional auto manufacturers are constrained by their old models,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can see things with fresh eyes.\u201dAcross China, government officials, corporate executives, private investors and newcomers like Mr. Lu are in a headlong rush to develop a domestic electric car industry. The country\u2019s goal, like Mr. Lu\u2019s, is to capitalize on the transition to electric to turbocharge the country\u2019s lagging automobile sector to become a major competitor to the United States, Japan and Germany.That has been a goal of China\u2019s industrial planners for decades, as the government has lavished resources on building homegrown automakers and discriminated against foreign players.But so far, that effort has failed.Local manufacturers have lacked the brands, technology and managerial heft to outmaneuver their established rivals, either at home or abroad. Chinese consumers have preferred more reliable Buicks, Volkswagens and Toyotas to the often substandard offerings from domestic manufacturers, while little-known Chinese models have struggled to gain traction overseas.Electric vehicles could offer a second chance \u2014 one China\u2019s policy makers do not intend to miss.This time, China\u2019s carmakers may be better positioned. Since electric vehicles are a relatively new business for all players, Chinese manufacturers and international rivals are largely starting from the same point.\u201cThere is a smaller gap between where China is today and the rest of the world\u201d in electric cars, said Bill Russo, managing director at Gao Feng Advisory, a Shanghai consultancy, and a former Chrysler executive. \u201cThere is room for newer start-up companies to dream big in China.\u201dMr. Lu is one of those dreamers.Fascinated by cars since he was a boy, he studied automotive engineering at Beijing\u2019s prestigious Tsinghua University. Upon graduating in 1990, he joined the research and development team at the China-based joint venture of Jeep, then a division of Chrysler.During his time there, which included two years in Detroit, Mr. Lu came to feel such overseas operations had limited prospects in China \u2014 the ventures\u2019 partners would try to balance their interests, and so were slow to develop strategies and make decisions.So in 2003, he and nine colleagues started CH-Auto Technology Corporation as a specialty research and design shop for the local car industry. Since then, the firm has designed vehicles for some of China\u2019s biggest automakers.Mr. Lu decided to start manufacturing his own vehicles because of the shift to electric. Since producing electric cars requires new parts and technologies, he believed a small entrant could better compete with these new vehicles than traditional automakers.\u201cElectric vehicles won\u2019t just replace cars with conventional engines, but they will bring a huge change to the entire car industry,\u201d Mr. Lu said. \u201cWe wanted to be part of this revolution.\u201dThe result is the K50. Designed at his research center, the two-seater has a light, carbon fiber exterior and a console stuffed with touch screens. Rows of batteries propel the roadster to a top speed of about 120 miles per hour and carry it as far as 200 miles on a single charge.No longer content to watch others produce his designs, Mr. Lu is currently constructing a $300 million factory in Suzhou, a city near Shanghai, to manufacture 50,000 cars a year. In all, he expects to invest as much as $1.4 billion into his venture over five years.He did not specify what the car would sell for, but Mr. Lu intends to price the K50 at the top of the market when it goes on sale this year.That sets CH-Auto on a collision course with the industry\u2019s flagship: Tesla.Elon Musk\u2019s company already has an edge. While Mr. Lu is building his business from scratch, Tesla has been established in China since 2013. CH-Auto will have to persuade wealthy customers to plunk down a large sum on an unfamiliar brand \u2014 Qiantu \u2014 over Mr. Musk\u2019s recognizable models.Mr. Lu nevertheless remains confident. He argues the sporty K50 will appeal to a more leisure-oriented driver than Tesla\u2019s cars. As a logo, the company has chosen the dragonfly, because its managers believe the speedy, nimble insect has similar attributes to his electric car. To market it, Mr. Lu is considering opening showrooms in major Chinese cities, backed by a platform to sell online.Elon Musk \u201cis someone I can learn from,\u201d he said. \u201cTesla has huge symbolic significance because it is the first company to make people believe a business model solely around electric vehicles is possible.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cwe are not looking to create the Chinese Tesla.\u201dWhen it comes to competing with Tesla, Mr. Lu can count on ample help from the Chinese government.To bring down costs and spur demand, the state has unleashed a torrent of cash. It has offered subsidies to manufacturers and tax breaks for buyers, and plowed investments into charging stations to make electric cars more practical.In all, UBS Securities estimates that the government spent $13 billion promoting electric vehicles in 2015 alone. So far, Mr. Lu has financed the K50 through loans and injections of fresh capital, but says he \u201cwon\u2019t refuse\u201d government subsidies if they become available.Some analysts fear the state\u2019s largess could prove as much bane as boon.China may be recreating the waste and excess in electric cars that has plagued other state-targeted sectors, like steel and renewable energy, without spurring the technological innovation the economy needs to compete. And even though China\u2019s car market is the world\u2019s biggest, it is still unlikely to absorb all of the electric vehicle projects underway today.\u201cThey are fueling overcapacity, with a lot of wasted money, and I\u2019m doubtful that in the end you\u2019ll have a successful electric car industry,\u201d says Crystal Chang, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley who studies China\u2019s auto industry policies.Significant sums have already been squandered. In September, the Finance Ministry fined five companies for defrauding the government of $150 million by fabricating sales of electric vehicles to obtain more subsidies, and several companies have failed to make an impression.Mr. Lu is certain, however, that the K50 stands out in a crowded field. The car has already gotten some advance buzz; a review on one popular Chinese website praised its design as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cavant-garde\u201d and its body as \u201cvery muscular.\u201d\u201cA big advantage they have is their knowledge of what it takes to build a quality vehicle,\u201d said Jack Perkowski, managing partner of the Beijing-based consulting firm JFP Holdings and a veteran of China\u2019s car sector. \u201cThey have a better chance than many others because of that.\u201dMr. Lu is counting on it.\u201cThere are a lot of electric vehicle companies and hot projects attracting a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cNot every company and not every car will be successful.\u201dEmily Feng contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Department Stores, Once Anchors at Malls, Become Millstones", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byFor decades, a corner spot at the mall was a sure path to success for big American department stores like Macy\u2019s. Not anymore.Those stores have been outmaneuvered by online retailers like Amazon and discount retailers like T. J. Maxx. And now the pace of change is accelerating, transforming the retail industry faster than expected.The results? A rude awakening for some of the country\u2019s biggest retailers. And for malls, a reshaping that, in many ways, mirrors a growing economic divide.These changes are \u201chappening at a tremendous speed,\u201d said Bernard Sosnick, a retail analyst at Madison Global Partners.\u201cIt\u2019s putting pressure on all stores, best and worst, but the worst just don\u2019t have a place in retailing anymore as sales decrease,\u201d Mr. Sosnick said. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to sacrifice them, shutter them, to help the others survive and stabilize sales.\u201dThe exits highlight the growing dichotomy between America\u2019s highest-end shopping centers, the type with Tesla dealerships and Apple stores, and those on the lower end of the spectrum, which are struggling to fill space and attract national brands. The stores being closed by Sears are not profitable. And Macy\u2019s chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren, said many of the stores it was closing were \u201cno longer robust shopping destinations.\u201dGreen Street Advisors, which tracks the mall industry, said in a report last year that more department store closures \u201cshould ultimately result in a larger number of malls becoming irrelevant retail destinations.\u201dEven among more successful malls, it is clear that department stores are far less important than they once were as they attract fewer customers.While mall owners once relied on four or five department stores to serve as so-called anchor tenants, offering them cheap rent in exchange for reliable foot traffic, they may now simply need one or two department stores and otherwise seek anchors in off-price chains like T. J. Maxx, restaurants and movie theaters, Green Street Advisors said.\u201cTen or 15 years ago, if a department store left a mall, it was really a problem for the developer,\u201d Les Wexner, the longtime chief executive of L Brands, which owns Victoria\u2019s Secret, told analysts and investors in November. \u201cNow, many of the developers are trying to buy back the space from the department stores because they\u2019re an economic detriment and they can recycle that space.\u201dThe business of department stores has been attacked from all sides in recent years. Online, consumers can purchase directly from brands or on Amazon, which has invested heavily in fashion.Offline, the chains have had to contend with discount retailers like TJX, the owner of T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and Home Goods, which compete hard on price and brand names, as well as fast-fashion sellers like H&M and outlet centers. Department stores also face competition from beauty chains like Sephora and Ulta.\u201cEveryone is carving away at different parts of the business,\u201d said Liz Dunn, the chief executive of Talmage Advisors, a retail consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that these retailers that have this rent advantage can\u2019t seem to make it worth it.\u201dNowhere is this shift more evident than in apparel. Two years ago, annual sales at TJX eclipsed those of Macy\u2019s for the first time, as the company drew consumers to its relatively smaller stores with a treasure-hunt-like experience and brand-name discounts. TJX posted $29 billion in sales for the year that ended Jan. 31, 2015, while Macy\u2019s revenue was $28 billion, a gap that has widened since then.Some of the money Macy\u2019s will save with its closures and job cuts will be diverted to its own version of T. J. Maxx, called Macy\u2019s Backstage, an effort akin to off-price chains like Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off 5th. Macy\u2019s, which operated 22 of the Backstage stores at the end of October, said it will open 50 more in the next two years. Many will be within current Macy\u2019s locations.Still, the stores remain exposed to changing conditions. The real estate industry ranks malls with letter grades like report cards, assigning \u201cA++\u201d to the highest-end locations that make nearly $1,000 in sales per square feet and a \u201cC\u201d to those that generate one-third or less of that and are at risk of closing. Sears, Macy\u2019s and J. C. Penney, the biggest mall anchors, are also the most exposed to C malls, according to Green Street Advisors.\u201cThe recognition now is that you can\u2019t have this long dragging tail and you\u2019ve got to cut it off right now so you can concentrate on the best stores,\u201d Mr. Sosnick said. \u201cThese are the retailers that went into the earliest shopping malls, and so have stores in malls that have been degraded tremendously over time, and that\u2019s what you see being closed today.\u201dBy the time Macy\u2019s finishes closing its stores, it will have shuttered nearly 200 locations since 2010. Today, it has 730 stores. At the end of October, J. C. Penney had 1,014 stores, 90 fewer than five years ago, while Sears, which also owns Kmart, had 676 full-line stores with its name, a 192-location drop in the same period.\u201cBrick-and-mortar is not necessarily dead, but you need fewer stores to achieve the same amount of sales volume,\u201d Ms. Dunn said. \u201cA lot of retailers need to shrink their store base, and that is tied to everything that\u2019s happened with digital and changing shopping patterns.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Germany Learn to Understand Trumpish?", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 The best anyone can say about German-American relations these days is that, for the time being, they are dangerously lost in translation. Last week Donald J. Trump gave an interview to the German tabloid Bild, and people here are still trying to figure out what he meant. We are used to American leaders speaking plainly, and intentionally, to international audiences; Mr. Trump was speaking, well, Trumpish.Take, for example, his reply when asked if there was anything typically German about him: \u201cI like order.\u201d So do we. But his other comments were anything but well ordered. He said he had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Chancellor Angela Merkel, and he regarded her refugee policy as a \u201ccatastrophic mistake.\u201d He thinks NATO is both \u201cobsolete\u201d and \u201cvery important.\u201d He claimed to be a friend of free trade who wants to impose a tax of 35 percent on German cars imported into the United States.The only thing he was halfway orderly about was the European Union: Mr. Trump called Brexit a \u201cgreat thing\u201d and somewhat cheerfully predicted that other countries might leave the union, too.When Ms. Merkel heard this, she shrugged. Europe\u2019s fate is \u201cin our own hands,\u201d she said. She made clear that she would wait to meet Mr. Trump as president before drawing any conclusions about where America was headed. Keep calm and argue on: This just might be the right approach with a president whose powers are inversely proportional to his knowledge of the world.But if Ms. Merkel is confident, many of us are still unsure how to deal with Mr. Trump. On one hand, he might offer a corrective to the operational blindness of European elites when it comes to globalization \u2014 or \u201ccosmopolitan overstretch,\u201d as the Dutch sociologist Ruud Koopmans calls it. Inasmuch as Mr. Trump\u2019s coarseness has a refreshing effect on public debates in America, that can already be felt in debates here, too. The classic Shakespearean fools were early Trumpish-speakers, summing up the absurdities of the main actors for the groundlings.Maybe. But on the other hand, Mr. Trump\u2019s witlessness will cause major damage if he doesn\u2019t learn his lead role quickly. Just as the new president doesn\u2019t know how many member states NATO has, he obviously has little clue about the anxiety his loose talk generates in Central and Eastern Europe. He uses the same words when talking to European journalists as he does speaking at Ohio campaign rallies: an admirable quality to some; a sign of deep ignorance to others.That the same words can mean different things to different people \u2014 especially in different countries, with different cultures \u2014 is part of Diplomacy 101, and something people expect from even novice politicians.While \u201cobsolete,\u201d for instance, can mean as little as \u201coutdated\u201d in America, in Germany it means \u201coutright superfluous,\u201d or \u201cno longer necessary.\u201d Did Mr. Trump really want to say this about NATO? If he has a problem with the unfair burden sharing within the alliance and its performance against the Islamic State, that\u2019s something we can talk about. But if he doesn\u2019t fully understand the value of the free West that NATO safeguards, and if he considers granting President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia an authoritarian sphere of influence, that\u2019s something requiring a completely different response.Of course, we also hear from his supporters that Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t always mean what he says, that his very specific utterances about NATO or Russia are to be taken with an enormous grain of salt. But deliberately calling into question the postwar order is a step not to be taken lightly. If we have misread Trumpish here, the new president should be so kind as to set us straight.Perhaps even more worrisome to us, in the short term, are his comments on trade. Does Mr. Trump really want a trade war with Germany? His threat to impose punitive tariffs on car imports if manufacturers, like Germany\u2019s BMW, build plants in Mexico rather than in the United States has raised alarm among German businesses.Sure, it\u2019s true that Germany enjoys an enormous trade surplus with the United States, especially in the auto industry. While Germany sent cars and car parts worth $45 billion last year to the United States, American companies exported just $15 billion of the same kind of products to Germany. But Germany is a stickler for trade rules; this is not an instance of someone trying to cheat the system \u2014 which is why previous presidents have largely left us out of the trade debate.If Mr. Trump wants to hinder emerging export giants like Tesla, he should impose his tariffs, and the German government will respond in kind. Such a move by Mr. Trump would be all the more counterproductive since BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen already invest heavily in American manufacturing; hurt or scare off those companies, and you hurt American workers too.Is this something we should really be worried about? Will Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers rein him in? Will the office tame him? Does he even mean, or know, what he\u2019s saying?In the end, the German who must figure that out is Ms. Merkel. She is in an unenviable position. Just when she thought she had contained one narcissistic leader whose ambitions exceeded his wisdom, to her east, she faces another in the west. Russian she speaks. Trumpish she still needs to learn.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Gives the California Power Grid a Battery Boost", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byJust off a freeway in Southern California, 396 refrigerator-size stacks of Tesla batteries, encased in white metal, have been hastily erected with a new mission: to suck up electricity from the grid during the day and feed it back into the system as needed, especially in the evening.The installation, capable of powering roughly 15,000 homes over four hours, is part of an emergency response to projected energy shortages stemming from a huge leak at a natural gas storage facility.The project, which officially came online Monday but began operating at the end of last year, is an important and surprising demonstration of how utilities can use enormous collections of batteries in place of conventional power plants.It is also an indication of how rapidly Tesla is moving to transform itself from a maker of luxury electric cars into a multifaceted clean-energy company.\u201cI had relatively limited expectations for the battery industry in advance of 2020,\u201d said Michael J. Picker, president of the California Public Utilities Commission. \u201cI thought that it would not really accelerate and begin to penetrate the electric grid or the transportation world for a while to come. Once again, technology is clearly moving faster than we can regulate.\u201dManufactured, shipped, installed and readied for operation in roughly three months, the batteries are connected to distribution circuits at Southern California Edison\u2019s Mira Loma substation in an industrial section of Ontario, Calif., about 40 miles east of Los Angeles.Tesla has developed or won contracts for similar installations elsewhere in California, and in a handful of other American states and overseas. And although the company had imported some components, it now makes and puts together all of the major parts of each battery assemblage, called the Powerpack, at its Gigafactory outside Sparks, Nev.\u201cEssentially, we can go and pour a slab and install the basic wiring, but each one of our Powerpacks is quite self-contained,\u201d said J. B. Straubel, Tesla\u2019s chief technical officer.All of the batteries, cooling and safety systems, and other equipment are inside the casings, ready to load onto delivery trucks. \u201cOur vehicle work lays a lot of the architectural foundation for this,\u201d Mr. Straubel said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we\u2019re starting from scratch.\u201dThe Mira Loma project came together quickly in part because California\u2019s utilities already had several battery storage projects in the works, some involving Tesla. As the state has aggressively pursued the use of renewable energy sources, especially solar, to combat climate change, the traditional patterns of supply and demand have been upended.California is on track to have an overabundance of energy during the day, when its many solar panels are producing energy, but that supply drops sharply as the sun sets, precisely when demand rises, with residents heading home to use appliances and, increasingly, to charge cars.The state\u2019s aging nuclear plants have been closed or are being phased out, putting even more pressure on utilities to find other ways to feed the grid. Storage is a natural solution, utility executives say, helping to smooth variations in the power flow from rooftop customers and when solar falls off and conventional plants have not yet filled the gap.Ronald O. Nichols, president of Southern California Edison, said the utility was looking for more ways to use that energy, instead of curtailing solar production, \u201cwhich makes no greenhouse-gas-reduction sense.\u201d By 2024, the California system is expected to have far too much energy for at least a few hours each day, he said, adding, \u201cWe want to find a way to use that energy productively, and battery storage is certainly a piece of that.\u201dThe utility\u2019s need for storage was amplified after the sudden closing of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in 2013. To fill that gap \u2014 and fulfill a state mandate to add storage to its energy portfolio \u2014 the utility awarded several contracts for battery storage.Although battery storage is still costly, its price can be comparable to that of the natural gas plants known as peakers, which can ramp up and down quickly to handle spikes in demand, utility executives say. Neither they nor Tesla executives would disclose the price of the project, but it was particularly appealing because Southern California is constrained by geography and strict environmental regulations in building power plants.Given the cost of land and the air quality requirements that limit the number of hours plants can operate, Mr. Nichols of Southern California Edison said, building natural gas plants can be expensive.Batteries are more flexible and do not require the same infrastructure, including water and fuel supply conduits, as conventional generators, avoiding the need for long environmental reviews and permitting processes.As a result, energy analysts say, battery installations are likely to become more common, whether to vary the number of power supply options to enhance reliability or as part of a move away from fossil fuels to meet climate and other environmental goals.As an early adopter of renewable technologies, particularly solar, California has been willing to pay high prices and has in turn helped lower them for other markets, said Swami Venkataraman, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service who analyzes the utility sector. He cited parallels in how the state was approaching storage.\u201cCalifornia is looking to the future, where this would start a cycle where storage becomes cheaper all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the long run, they would have less need \u2014 and maybe no need \u2014 for new natural gas generation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(It was trading this week at about $255.)\u201cWhen you look at the businesses Tesla is in, you see many areas of overlapping interest\u201d with the Trump administration, Mr. Jonas told me. \u201cTo the extent the new administration prioritizes the creation of valuable, innovative high tech and manufacturing jobs, Tesla stands at the epicenter of that.\u201dShares in pure solar energy companies haven\u2019t fared as well, but even they have now regained nearly all the ground they lost immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.Solar investors \u201caren\u2019t nearly as negative as they were the day after the election,\u201d said Andrew Hughes, an alternative energy analyst for Credit Suisse.And Mr. Musk was with a group of manufacturing executives at a White House meeting this week at which, according to a participant, he broached the subject of a carbon tax. Surprisingly, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t reject it out of hand.Mr. Jonas said that the \u201cstrategic relationship between Tesla leadership and the new administration is an important development\u201d in his decision to upgrade Tesla stock.\u201cThat Trump would be relying on Musk as an adviser has come as quite a surprise to many people,\u201d Mr. Jonas said.A major fear of investors in solar power was that a Trump administration would end the federal subsidies so reviled by fossil fuel proponents. While that remains a concern, the most recent jobs data suggests that the subsidies have led to a surge in new well-paid jobs, exactly what the president has advocated.\u201cThe jobs data is a compelling argument in favor of the tax credits,\u201d Mr. Hughes said.He noted that federal solar subsidies were set to expire anyway in a few years, a result of rare bipartisan cooperation in Congress. Mr. Musk has stressed that solar energy is close to reaching a scale where federal subsidies will no longer be needed.And Tesla is also expanding rapidly. Tesla employs 25,000 workers in the United States and could easily double that as it ramps up production for its new Model 3 and expands its Gigafactory, a lithium ion battery manufacturing operation in Nevada. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of multiplier you put on that, but it\u2019s a significant boost to the economy,\u201d Mr. Jonas said.Federal subsidies for electric vehicles will also end once a manufacturer hits 200,000 vehicles, a level Tesla may soon reach.Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk appear to have other areas of overlapping interest as well. Mr. Musk has broached the subject of the nation\u2019s aging electricity transmission grid in conversations with Mr. Trump, according to an insider with knowledge of the discussions.Mr. Musk has advocated a so-called smart grid and has said that eventually Tesla will offer grid services, such as batteries that can be added to the grid and paired with solar and wind farms. This is the kind of high-impact infrastructure project that Mr. Trump has supported.And Tesla\u2019s success could help fend off Chinese efforts to compete or even dominate in what could be an important piece of the car industry\u2019s future.But the ultimate bond between the two may simply be that they both like to think big.It\u2019s still early in the Trump administration, and some (or all) of this may turn out to be wishful thinking by fans of Mr. Musk, Tesla investors, environmentalists and hopeful space colonists.\u201cI want to believe that Trump won\u2019t kill solar,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty. The big question: Will he take away the tax credits?\u201dStill, there\u2019s a growing sense that Mr. Trump and Tesla can not only coexist, but even thrive together. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be anti-electric to be pro-fossil fuel,\u201d Mr. Jonas said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Ambivalence Toward Trump Turns to Anger", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Friday morning, Silicon Valley was largely ambivalent about President Trump. The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration.By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination.In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades.Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the 10th-richest man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He good-naturedly obliged.The tech companies\u2019 reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did.That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump\u2019s order proclaimed that \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d and would be suspended indefinitely.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said that his great-grandparents had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam.Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was \u201cnot the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201d Mr. Musk was born in South Africa.Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, \u201cthere was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is.\u201dBeyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world.\u201cAlmost every company\u2019s products \u2014 Google, Apple, Airbnb \u2014 has a global customer base,\u201d Mr. Levie said. \u201cThese policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors.\u201dBy early last week, the companies sensed trouble.Murtadha al-Tameemi, 24, an Iraqi-born software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out.\u201cIt may be my na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how politics and industries interact, but I don\u2019t interpret the tech community\u2019s opposition to the president as a political stance,\u201d Mr. Tameemi said. \u201cIt seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them.\u201dThe larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was \u201cconcerned.\u201d Apple said, \u201cIt is not a policy we support.\u201d Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards\u201d and said it would create \u201ccollateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dIt was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. \u201cIt feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,\u201d said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One.Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists.Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media.Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory team.That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day.In an email to employees on Saturday titled \u201cStanding up for what\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday.As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers \u2014 largely immigrants \u2014 began a one-hour work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order.Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen.\u201cAfter the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,\u201d Mr. Altman said. \u201cNow they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come.\u201dMr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p.m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump May Not Like Alternative Energy, but Investors Should", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersGIVEN what President-elect Donald J. Trump has said about his energy strategy \u2014 he favors coal and wants to end federal subsidies to the clean energy industry \u2014 does it still make sense to invest in wind, solar and other alternative sources of power?The answer is an emphatic yes, according to investment advisers, who say clean energy companies will continue to thrive during a Trump administration, regardless of what the president says or does. The sector has become as much about getting returns on investments and catching the next technological boom as it is about reducing greenhouse gases and helping the environment.And clean energy is creating jobs in every state, not just the ones that have oil or gas in the ground. Even the most politically conservative states, like Kansas and Iowa, are leaders in wind power and are likely to continue investing in it.\u201cNo longer is there a trade-off between what you believe in and what you can make money off of,\u201d said Nancy Pfund, a founder and managing partner of DBL Partners, which made early investments in SolarCity and Tesla.She predicts that investors \u201care going to redouble their efforts to migrate their portfolios to a 21st-century energy economy.\u201d Even without subsidies, she said, alternative energy sources will be well positioned to compete with coal and other carbon spewers.\u201cIt really has to do with the cost of wind, solar and electric cars compared to where we were 12 years ago,\u201d Ms. Pfund said.But the challenge for all investors during the Trump administration and beyond will be to make sure that passions for change and innovation, or anger at environmental policies that favor fossil fuels, do not cloud sound investment analysis.\u201cRecently, people have taken the green mandate and said, \u2018You need to invest in the future,\u2019\u201d said Chat Reynders, the chief executive and chairman of Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, a $1.3 billion asset-management firm. \u201cPeople have chased some investments that weren\u2019t timely or were not quality investments in order to participate.\u201dFor example, back in the 1970s, some investors were eager to back manufacturers of solar panels. But what was then a cutting-edge technology with high barriers to entry is now a commodity, with prices dropping as more manufacturers enter the market. This is good for the consumer, but not great for investors in the panel makers.\u201cYou can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle when it comes to the economics driving solar, wind and battery storage,\u201d said Thomas Van Dyck, managing director in the SRI Wealth Management Group at RBC Wealth Management.\u201cThe economics are such that in California, wind and solar are the cheapest form of power you can put in place,\u201d Mr. Van Dyck said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a long-term investor, you need to look at these long-term trends.\u201dDespite the economic forces lining up behind clean energy, investors and analysts caution that people interested in investing in this area should be prepared for a rough ride in the short term.\u201cIf you\u2019re a long-term investor and looking out five to 10 years, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Mr. Van Dyck said. \u201cIt\u2019s like looking at Intel or Microsoft in the 1990s \u2014 they had some cyclical issues, but look at them today.\u201dR. Paul Herman, the chief executive of HIP Investor, an investment rater and portfolio manager, said investors looking for broad guidance should keep three things in mind. They should look for companies that are trying to save money and reduce risk through clean energy. This is the Walmart example.They should monitor their investments in fossil-fuel producers closely, lest their stocks plummet again as renewable energy gets cheaper and the value of their reserves diminishes. And those with a longer-term investment horizon and a higher tolerance for risk should look for companies focused on energy innovations.The last is the holy grail. Ms. Pfund\u2019s firm, DBL Partners, had great success investing in Tesla and SolarCity, but she said she was not looking to mimic those investments today.\u201cThe last thing I\u2019m going to do is keep investing in the same old, same old,\u201d she said. \u201cThe venture-backed electric car company was a smart investment 10 years ago, but today it\u2019s things like storage \u2014 the batteries in a Tesla or stationary storage \u2014 that are going to play a huge role in the electric grid of the future.\u201dWith storage, the energy created by the sun and wind can be used on demand \u2014 or on cloudy, calm days.Mr. Reynders said he was steering clear of solar panels but liked companies that install the panels. He also said he thought the Trump administration would be good for alternative-energy investment, though not as its cheerleader. If the administration follows through on Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to cut clean-energy subsidies, it could force a shakeout in the industry and prompt investors to pay closer attention to company fundamentals.For investors with a greater appetite for risk, there are certainly longer-term energy investments. One is graphene, a superthin, incredibly strong material that can be used as a conductor. Its promise is for batteries of the future, and probably much more.William Page, portfolio manager for global environmental opportunities strategy at Essex Investment Management, said he saw the potential in investing in graphene but was avoiding it for now.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to invest in a technology that might work in the lab today but it\u2019s not something that is a viable investment today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want something that is profitable today.\u201dLike Mr. Reynders, Mr. Page thinks that companies that install solar panels are a good investment. He also likes LED lighting installation \u2014 not the exactly the sexiest clean energy investment, but one that is environmentally sound and profitable today.At the opposite end of the risk spectrum, Matthew Weatherley-White, co-founder and managing director at the Caprock Group, said people could make alternative energy investments in themselves, as it were.\u201cSay you have $10,000,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to invest in a solar panel company or in a solar array for your house?\u201dOf course, it depends on whether you are a city or country dweller. \u201cIn Idaho, where I live, there\u2019s 6 percent internal rate of return for a solar array, so you get paid back in 18 years,\u201d Mr. Weatherley-White said. \u201cThat might not blow the socks off as an investment, but it\u2019s pretty predictable.\u201dIn places like California, where state policies favor solar power, that rate of return could be three to four times what it is in Idaho, he said. Still, it comes down to a question every investor should ask: \u201cWhere am I going to invest for a positive financial return and an environmental impact?\u201dAnd in the United States, it is the states rather than the federal government that may wield the greatest influence over the clean-energy sector. \u201cWhile the Trump victory for some was disturbing or took the wind out of their sails,\u201d Ms. Pfund said, \u201cthe federal government can only do so much.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump.As corporate executives around the globe try to understand the implications of the Trump administration on their businesses, they seem to be having an almost bipolar reaction: a euphoric sense that regulations and taxes could soon be lowered \u2014 which would likely increase their profits and paychecks \u2014 yet a simultaneous anxiety that they could become a target of one of the president\u2019s Twitter tirades, which could undo their businesses or possibly their careers.Over the last two months, dozens of chief executives have made pilgrimages to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The ritual involves being photographed in the lobby in front of the gold elevators and having your name hastily tweeted by the throngs (journalistic and otherwise) involved in the spectator sport.For the moment, the action seems to have shifted to Washington. On Monday, a bevy of executives \u2014 Elon Musk of Tesla, Kevin Plank of Under Armour and Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical among them \u2014 arrived for a 9 a.m. meeting at the White House.This meeting and similar ones, according to more than a dozen executives who have attended them, are viewed by the executive class not only as an opportunity to help shape policy in their favor, but also, perhaps more important, as a defensive measure aimed at making \u201cfriends\u201d with the new president so as to avoid his wrath later.Make no mistake: Companies are making changes \u2014 or, at least, public announcements \u2014 aimed (in part or in whole) at appealing to or appeasing Mr. Trump. Amazon said it was hiring 100,000 new employees. Ford canceled plans to build a factory in Mexico and said it would create 700 jobs domestically.The story, which garnered headlines all over the world, was a clear sop to Mr. Trump: In many ways, Foxconn\u2019s statement was seen as a hedge against the possibility that the new president, who has threatened a trade war with China and criticized Apple for manufacturing iPhones abroad, might seek to put further pressure on its business.Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, visited Mr. Trump two weeks ago and announced plans to build an online platform that he pledged would create a million jobs in the Midwest for farmers and small businesses to export goods to China. The plan had been in the works before Mr. Trump was elected, but clearly it helped grease the skids with Mr. Trump, who took Mr. Ma to pose for pictures in the lobby of Trump Tower.Mr. Icahn, a friend and supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s, who was recently named a special adviser on regulation, said in a telephone interview, \u201cYou are correct in saying my relationships with companies is somewhat analogous\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s own relationships with the leaders of them.\u201cIf they are taking advantage of the system, they should be scared,\u201d Mr. Icahn said of corporations. \u201cRemember, many of the guys I went after deserved to be scared \u2014 but in many cases, I bought stock in companies with managements I liked, and I helped them get things done with recalcitrant boards.\u201d\u201cIt will be a bumpy road,\u201d Mr. Icahn said. \u201cBut in the long run he will do a great job with the country.\u201dWhile some executives may be focused on the optics of their businesses in relation to Mr. Trump, Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, the largest money manager in the world overseeing over $5 trillion \u2014 that\u2019s with a \u201ct\u201d \u2014 suggests that each company must rethink its strategy.\u201cWe believe that it is imperative that companies understand these changes and adapt their strategies as necessary,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote in a letter to the nation\u2019s top public company executives that he is in the process of sending out. \u201cNot just following a year like 2016, but as part of a constant process of understanding the landscape in which you operate.\u201d\u201cWe will be looking to see how your strategic framework reflects and recognizes the impact of the past year\u2019s changes in the global environment,\u201d Mr. Fink added. \u201cHow have these changes impacted your strategy and how do you plan to pivot, if necessary, in light of the new world in which you are operating?\u201dOne of the big issues that companies are likely to confront \u2014 and that Mr. Trump may confront for them if they aren\u2019t lucky \u2014 is how they might use repatriated cash if tax reforms are passed in Washington. Mr. Trump has made his presidency about creating jobs. Yet many chief executives have already said that if they are able to repatriate cash at a low tax rate, they will engage in stock buybacks and mergers and acquisitions. (In the 12 months ending in the third quarter of 2016, BlackRock pointed out that \u201cthe value of dividends and buybacks by S&P 500 companies exceeded those companies\u2019 operating profit.\u201d)Mr. Fink warned that he was watching, too. \u201cIf tax reform also includes some form of reduced taxation for repatriation of cash trapped overseas, BlackRock will be looking to companies\u2019 strategic frameworks for an explanation of whether they will bring cash back to the U.S. \u2014 and if so, how they plan to use it. Will it be used simply for more share buybacks? Or is it a part of a capital plan that appropriately balances returning capital to shareholders with prudently investing for future growth?\u201dBetween Mr. Trump and the investor class, chief executives may be cornered in their offices more than ever as they try to adjust to the new reality.Adam Grant, a professor of management and psychology at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said behavioral scientists had a term to describe the way chief executives were thinking about Mr. Trump: It is called an \u201cambivalent relationship.\u201dThat sounds about right.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about corporate bosses\u2019 efforts to appeal to President Trump, referred incorrectly to the manufacturing company Foxconn, which said it might spend $7 billion in the United States to build a factory. Foxconn is based in Taiwan, not China.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Big Test for Big Batteries", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byEnergy regulators needed a quick fix.But rather than sticking with gas, they turned to a technology more closely associated with flashlights: batteries. They freed up the utilities to start installing batteries \u2014 and lots of them.It is a solution that\u2019s audacious and risky. The idea is that the batteries can store electricity during daylight hours (when the state\u2019s many solar panels are flooding the grid with power), then release it as demand peaks (early evening, when people get home). In effect, the rechargeable batteries are like an on-demand power plant, and, in theory, able to replace an actual plant.Utilities have been studying batteries nationwide. But none have moved ahead with the gusto of those in Southern California.This idea has far-reaching potential. But the challenge of storing electricity has vexed engineers, researchers, policy makers and entrepreneurs for centuries. Even as countless technologies have raced ahead, batteries haven\u2019t yet fulfilled their promise.And the most powerful new designs come with their own risks, such as fire or explosion if poorly made or maintained. It\u2019s the same problem that forced Samsung to recall 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in September because of fire risk.After racing for months, engineers here in California have brought three energy-storage sites close to completion to begin serving the Southern California electric grid within the next month. They are made up of thousands of oversize versions of the lithium-ion batteries now widely used in smartphones, laptop computers and other digital devices.One of the installations, at a San Diego Gas & Electric operations center surrounded by industrial parks in Escondido, Calif., 30 miles north of San Diego, will be the largest of its kind in the world, developers say. It represents the most crucial test yet of an energy-storage technology that many experts see as fundamental to a clean-energy future.Here, about 130 miles southeast of Aliso Canyon, the site of the immense gas leak in 2015 \u2014 the global-warming equivalent of operating about 1.7 million cars over the course of a year \u2014 19,000 battery modules the size of a kitchen drawer are being wired together in racks. They will operate out of two dozen beige, 640-square-foot trailers.Made by Samsung, the batteries are meant to store enough energy to serve as a backup in cases of fuel shortages. They are also designed to absorb low-cost energy, particularly solar power, during the day and feed it back to the grid after dusk. They in effect can fill in for the decades-old gas-fired plants that might lack the fuel to fully operate because of the disastrous leak.AES is installing a smaller array for the electric utility in El Cajon, a suburb east of San Diego. And separately Tesla, the company perhaps better known for its electric cars, has built an array for a different utility on the grid, Southern California Edison, near Chino, Calif.The stakes are high for both energy storage companies. If their projects struggle or fail, it could jeopardize not only the stability of Southern California\u2019s grid but also interest in the technology over all.After a smaller, but pioneering battery project at a wind farm on Oahu in Hawaii went up in flames in 2012, investment in battery storage all but dried up for a few years. That installation, which used 12,000 lead-acid batteries to help even out fluctuations in the power flow, caught fire three times in its first 18 months of operation. The storage developer, Xtreme, eventually went bankrupt. The wind farm turned to a different technology to smooth its output.\u201cThe moment one fails,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said of the big bet on batteries, \u201cthey won\u2019t build any more.\u201dAs soon as AES\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Gluski, learned last June that San Diego Gas & Electric had awarded AES the big battery contract, he leapt out of his chair and interrupted a meeting in his board room at the company\u2019s headquarters in Arlington, Va. As employees watched in astonishment, he barreled down two flights of stairs, grabbed a mallet and, with a ceremonial flourish, banged a gong that one of his executives kept on hand for big news.Mr. Gluski had not had much occasion to celebrate since he had taken the AES reins five years earlier. The company was struggling with debt and trying to coax profits from far-flung fossil-fuel projects around the developing world that are buffeted by instability in politics, currency and commodity prices.His first steps included an austerity program in which he gave up many of his own executive perks: No more country-club membership. No more corporate Audi A8, with driver. But the more far-reaching part of his plan would be AES\u2019s battery division, which was then fledgling. The unit had roots in two midlevel executives who had been speculating about a Jetsons-like future over beers.He and Mr. Zahurancik bounced the idea off some AES colleagues, who said it was at least theoretically feasible. So the two continued their bull sessions but decided that stationary battery arrays may make more sense than relying on electric cars.At the time, lithium-based batteries, the standard in consumer products, were widely in use in the transportation and power tool industries, but no one had paired them with the technology necessary to serve the power grid.Earlier grid-scale experiments with lead-acid and other types of batteries worked only for a year or two before conking out. A different technology, \u201cflow batteries,\u201d which use chemicals dissolved in liquids in tanks, were considered even more experimental.But lithium packs more energy per weight than other metals, offering the promise of greater energy density and longevity. The trick would be to figure out how to harness all that power, which creates heat, while avoiding the fires such batteries have caused in any number of vehicles and gadgets, including Teslas, HP computers, hoverboards and, most recently, Samsung Galaxy Note 7s.The two hit upon a design and persuaded executives to begin a pilot project in 2008. That eventually led to the first commercial lithium-ion battery on a grid. Mr. Zahurancik, who owns the gong, is now president of AES Energy Storage. Mr. Shelton is now the company\u2019s vice president and chief technology officer.AES does not actually make its batteries but buys them, along with other equipment, from manufacturers like Samsung, LG Chem and Panasonic. It designs and assembles the arrays, stacking the boxy batteries into racks inside locker-like containers.In Escondido, where local radio stations still carry public service announcements about the natural-gas shortage, the AES battery packs are being installed at a critical spot on the regional electrical grid: the place where the giant wires from power plants and wind and solar arrays connect to the network of local wires.The batteries are intended to relieve the pressure on the system. Mainly, they will serve as a kind of sponge, soaking up excess or low-cost solar energy during the day and then squeezing it back into the grid in the evening, when demand surges as the sun sets. There is enough capacity in the containers full of batteries to power about 20,000 homes for four hours.The idea is that they help the utility lessen its dependence on the type of natural gas plants known as \u201cpeakers,\u201d which can turn on and off quickly to meet sudden peaks of demand but are generally used only for short periods and at great expense. And peakers, by burning fossil fuel, are also at odds with California\u2019s green-energy goals.The project is also being watched closely by advocates for renewable energy. The reason: If utility-scale battery installations work as designed, they would help wind or solar generators to act more like conventional power plants by working steadily even when the sun isn\u2019t shining or the wind isn\u2019t blowing.\u201cEnergy storage is really the tool to do renewables integration for a utility infrastructure company like us,\u201d said Josh Gerber, advanced technology integration manager of SDG&E, as workers smoothed the thigh-high concrete pads that support the containers at the Escondido site. \u201cWithout it, you have more risk that the variability of renewables is going to cause reliability problems.\u201dUnder the contract, AES is responsible for making sure the batteries perform for 10 years, after which SDG&E will take over. One potential downside is that if the batteries are fully charged and discharged each day, they could degrade more quickly.The executives involved expressed confidence in the design and reliability, despite Samsung\u2019s recent smartphone problems. Not only are these batteries a different configuration than the smartphone units, executives said, but the larger footprint allows for the inclusion of sophisticated monitoring as well as industrial safety and cooling and ventilation equipment.The project, along with the smaller array AES has installed in El Cajon, could provide the proof-of-concept leap Mr. Gluski has been striving for.AES has a deal for an even bigger installation in a $1 billion project in Long Beach with Southern California Edison that is not part of the Aliso Canyon remediation effort; it is projected to go online by the end of 2020. The electric company plans to use batteries as part of a plan to replace an aging gas plant along the San Gabriel River.Long term, Mr. Gluski plans to shift the company\u2019s power-generation portfolio \u2014 still heavily based on coal and natural gas \u2014 toward more renewable energy. He sees the storage systems as vital components in turning solar and wind energy into a dominant power source in the parts of Latin America, Asia and Africa where AES is active.Whatever progress it has made, AES still has its share of problems, with $20 billion in debt and a stock price less than one-fifth the value that it had at the start of the century. It faces wary, if not outright skeptical, treatment by Wall Street utility analysts and energy experts, who say the technology AES is peddling on such a large scale in California remains untested and financially risky.\u201cThe problem comes if there is a hiccup with the battery storage business in California,\u201d said Charles Fishman, a utilities analyst at Morningstar. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the deep-pocket parent that can push money to it and keep it out of trouble.\u201dDespite all the battery activity in California, executives around the utility industry remain cautious. \u201cThe reason we don\u2019t have widespread batteries on our system is because it is not cost-effective for us,\u201d said Alice Jackson, vice president for strategic revenue initiatives at Xcel, a giant electricity and gas utility serving eight Western and Midwestern states.Xcel has been testing batteries about as long as AES, but almost exclusively in small pilots. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say we don\u2019t have long-range experience with this technology to say that it is perfect, or a nirvana,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ll observe as California goes through its experience.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s latest experiment with batteries is but the latest bout in the state\u2019s long struggle to match its energy needs with its environmental sensibilities.In the early 2000s, after market deregulation and Enron\u2019s notorious manipulation of gas supplies led to blackouts and financial instability among the power companies, state officials decided to lessen reliance on natural gas by encouraging the development of wind and solar.Under Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was governor until 2011, officials pushed through a raft of overlapping regulations that created a boom in renewables, especially solar. But that upended the traditional patterns of supply and demand, making the overall energy system technically and economically difficult to manage.Batteries were the logical solution. But the technology wasn\u2019t fully developed and was still too expensive. In order for companies to make the necessary investments, they needed a signal that there would be a big enough market for their products.So in 2010, the state approved one of the first energy-storage mandates, ultimately requiring utilities to install some form of storage equipment in their territories. That set off a flurry of new investment and innovation and, after the sudden closure of the San Onofre nuclear plant on the coast in northwest San Diego County in 2012 when a steam generator tube sprung a leak, new contracts for battery installations.Now it\u2019s showtime, and the pressure to succeed is high all around. For AES, it could signify an important step for a long-troubled conventional-energy relic that is seeking to revitalize itself as a powerhouse in battery storage and other advanced technologies.For clean-energy advocates \u2014 including residents of the Porter Ranch section of Los Angeles, so picture-perfect that Steven Spielberg chose it as the setting for the 1982 movie \u201cE.T.,\u201d but where many still complain of the rashes, headaches and other debilitating symptoms that drove thousands from their homes during the leak \u2014 it could be a powerful weapon in the fight to keep the gas depot closed.But the pressure may be highest for the Southern California utilities, their reputations still blackened by waves of forced electricity cuts that followed the Enron debacle. No one wants to contemplate a repeat of that chapter, when blackouts affected factories and even some hospitals.\u201cWhen the power goes out, people die,\u201d said Ms. Kennedy, the former state official. \u201cFailure is not an option here on any level.\u201dAn article last Sunday about efforts by Southern California utilities to use big batteries as power sources misidentified the city in Virginia that is the headquarters for AES, which installs storage systems. It is Arlington, not Alexandria. The article also misstated the status of an installation of batteries near Chino, Calif., for the utility Southern California Edison. It has been built by Tesla; it is not being built. In addition, an accompanying picture caption omitted part of the surname of a resident in the area of the Aliso Canyon storage facility, where a gas leak occurred in 2015. He is George Chang, not Gorman-Chang.Diane Cardwell reported from Escondido, Calif., and Clifford Krauss from Arlington, Va.Advertisement"}

The incumbent, Eric M. Garcetti, who is seeking a second term, is on track to win, so the attention is turning more to those initiatives.\u201cYes on H!,\u201d Mark Ridley-Thomas, a member of the county Board of Supervisors, yelled at a rally Monday, urging voters to support a county-wide quarter-cent sales tax to pay for services for homeless people. This is no small thing. This vote follows a separate sales tax measure overwhelmingly approved by Los Angeles city voters just last November, for $1.2 billion in housing for homeless people.\u201cPeople are taxing themselves to pay for something that they consider a problem, but that may not immediately advance their own interests,\u201d said Raphael J. Sonenshein, the executive of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University-Los Angeles. \u201cPeople just feel it\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s astonishing.\u201dThe other high-profile measure is Measure S, imposing a two-year moratorium on certain types of high-density construction. The measure reflects frustration among many Los Angeles homeowners over the march of big construction projects sweeping the city, in what many see as evidence of the large number of deep-pocketed developers with friends in City Hall.Count Mr. Garcetti as one of the opponents. He used his stage at a well-attended Measure H rally here to urge voters not to support the development measure, which he described as economically crippling. \u201cVote no on Measure S!\u201d he said.The good news, depending on how you look at it, is that this is the last time Los Angeles will have one of these afterthought spring election. Voters here approved a measure in 2015 to move all elections to November.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)There has been a notable dichotomy between the happy, peppy picture that has been way out in front during the whole race, \u201cLa La Land,\u201d and the political exasperation that has been boiling behind the scenes in Hollywood.

{"Headline": "Daily Report: Elon Musk\u2019s Unlikely Bond With Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byBitsIt\u2019s O.K. to feel a little confused about the direction the new administration in Washington is taking. And that is before you consider the case of Elon Musk and Tesla.And yet shares of the carmaker Tesla, which has absorbed solar power company SolarCity, are going up. Analysts are even raising their estimates of how high they could go.Moreover, Mr. Musk has been a guest at two meetings of business leaders with Mr. Trump. What gives?Maybe these strange bedfellows aren\u2019t so strange.Primarily, Tesla is both futuristic in its technology and traditional as an operation. Unlike big software outfits, it employs a lot of people with a relatively normal range of skills inside its factories. Tesla has 25,000 workers, our article notes, and could double that if it increases production in its battery factory. The factory is in Nevada, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s battleground states in the last election.Mr. Musk, who likes big and bold visions, has discussed ways to rebuild the United States energy grid, too. That would be another huge project requiring traditional workers.And while Mr. Musk has taken $2 billion in subsidies, he needs them less now. Tesla will soon make 200,000 vehicles, which will trigger an end to his federal subsidies.That means Mr. Trump could take credit for ending subsidies out of favor with his constituents, and Mr. Musk could prosper.Then, too, Mr. Musk is himself a brash and successful billionaire, something attractive to the president. At a recent business meeting, he pressed Mr. Trump for a tax on carbon fuels, something the president did not dismiss out of hand.That is almost a mark of a big business coming into its own: when you stop asking the government for handouts, and instead press it to hurt your competitor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Self-Driving System Cleared in Deadly Crash", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe regulators warned, however, that advanced driver-assistance systems like the one in Tesla\u2019s cars could be relied on to react properly in only some situations that arise on roadways. And the officials said that all automakers needed to be clear about how the systems should be used. Almost all major automakers are pursuing similar technology.Tesla\u2019s self-driving software, known as Autopilot, has proved adept at preventing Tesla cars from rear-ending other vehicles, but situations involving crossing traffic \u2014 as was the case in the crash that regulators investigated \u2014 \u201care beyond the performance capabilities of the system,\u201d Mr. Thomas said.\u201cAutopilot requires full driver engagement at all times,\u201d he said.First introduced in October 2015, Autopilot uses radar and cameras to scan the road for obstacles and other vehicles, and can brake, accelerate and even pass other vehicles automatically. It tracks lines on highways to stay within lanes.The investigation was set off by the accident that killed Joshua Brown, a 40-year-old from Ohio. His 2015 Tesla Model S was operating under its Autopilot system on a state highway in Florida when it crashed into a tractor-trailer that was crossing the road in front of his car.Tesla has said its camera failed to recognize the white truck against a bright sky. But the agency essentially found that Mr. Brown was not paying attention to the road. It determined he set his car\u2019s cruise control at 74 miles per hour about two minutes before the crash, and should have had at least seven seconds to notice the truck before crashing into it.Neither Autopilot nor Mr. Brown hit the brakes. The agency said that although Autopilot did not prevent the accident, the system performed as it was designed and intended, and therefore did not have a defect.A second federal agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, is also investigating the crash to determine its causes, but has not yet reached a conclusion.The highway agency\u2019s inquiry, which focused only on whether there was a defect in the Autopilot system, looked at the Florida crash as well as \u201cdozens,\u201d as Mr. Thomas said, of other incidents involving Autopilot, including a Pennsylvania crash that left the driver and a passenger injured.The investigation was an early test of how regulators would handle automated driving systems. The agency could have ordered Tesla to issue a recall and disable Autopilot until any defect was fixed. The agency also has the power to fine automakers if they fail to take action promptly. Fines and mandated recalls are rare, however.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.In its final report, the agency said it \u201cdid not identify any defects in the design or performance\u201d of Autopilot, or \u201cany incidents in which the systems did not perform as designed.\u201d The agency also noted that the frequency of crashes involving Tesla models declined by about 40 percent after the company introduced Autopilot.Telsa welcomed the findings.\u201cWe appreciate the thoroughness of N.H.T.S.A.\u2019s report and its conclusion,\u201d the company said in a statement.Tesla has faced calls from critics to rename Autopilot; they argue the current moniker suggests drivers can cede most tasks to the car\u2019s computers and sensors. Last year, Mercedes-Benz pulled an ad for its driver-assistance system after complaints that it overstated the technology\u2019s capabilities.\u201cCarmakers have to be clear on what the driver\u2019s responsibility is,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader.com. \u201cNo car buyer should think there are fully automated vehicles on the market.\u201dTesla has the ability to wirelessly beam software updates to its cars, and it released a major update to Autopilot in September. The new version relies more on radar to identify other vehicles and potential obstacles, and to decide when to steer to avoid a problem or apply the brakes. Mr. Musk has said this might have prevented the May crash, although it runs counter to the widely held view that radar, while highly accurate in measuring distance, is less precise in determining the shape and size of objects.Under certain conditions, the older version of Autopilot could allow drivers to go several minutes without putting their hands on the steering wheel. Safety advocates complained that drivers could be lulled into a false sense of security.Mr. Brown posted videos on the internet showing himself riding in Autopilot mode. \u201cThe car\u2019s doing it all itself,\u201d he said in one, smiling as he took his hands from the wheel.While the update addressed some concerns that the agency had about Autopilot, Mr. Thomas said automakers could not rely on software updates to fix safety issues and avoid recalls.\u201cIf there is a defect identified, it\u2019s not enough to do a software update,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cA recall still has to be issued.\u201dAutopilot was the only system of its kind when it was introduced. But many other automakers are catching up. Mercedes\u2019s advanced driver-assistance system, which is now available in the new 2017 E-Class sedan, is similar to Autopilot but requires drivers to have their hands on the wheel more frequently.General Motors and Audi are rolling out systems of their own later this year that have some capabilities that Autopilot lacks. Both of those companies use radar, cameras and lidar, a kind of radar based on lasers, to scan roadways. The G.M. and Audi systems will also monitor a driver\u2019s eyes to determine if he or she is paying attention to the road.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frantic Phoning Among C.E.O.s: How to Address Trump Ban?", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byDealBookThe phone calls flew back and forth among the nation\u2019s top chief executives over the weekend, all asking the same questions: \u201cWhat are you going to say publicly about Trump\u2019s executive order? And what can we say about it without becoming his next punching bag?\u201dWelcome to the new reality for corporate America.Last fall, John Chipman, the director-general and chief executive of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, advanced the notion that in our globalized world, \u201cevery company needs a foreign policy.\u201d Now, our largest companies also have to think about having a domestic policy \u2014 and possibly a moral policy, too.For corporate executives, the decision about whether to speak out against a policy from Mr. Trump so early in his administration has clearly been nerve-racking.The reaction from major American companies to President Trump\u2019s order has ranged from silence to outrage.While it may appear as though a tidal wave of executives has come forward to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order over immigration during the last 48 hours, each did so with a different flavor and tone \u2014 and most didn\u2019t go public until some of their rivals and peers did first, as they sought safety in numbers.Much of the early criticism came from the West Coast: Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook weighed in first, and then Tim Cook of Apple as well as Howard Schultz of Starbucks, who pledged to hire 10,000 refugees.But other big firms, including those on Wall Street and in the consumer-goods sector, took much longer to respond \u2014 if at all \u2014 because of worries about blowback from regulators and customers.And for good reason: Mr. Schultz\u2019s comments prompted calls for a boycott from Trump supporters who started the hashtag #boycottStarbucks on Twitter. But there was a counterpunch. For every tweet about plans to boycott, someone else tweeted something like this: \u201cThere is a #boycottStarbucks going around because they\u2019re pledging to hire refugees, you know what that means? Time to get some Starbucks.\u201dCoca-Cola didn\u2019t say anything until late Monday, when the chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said the company opposed the travel ban. Many other large companies have so far remained silent on the issue. Among them are Blackstone Group, Disney, General Motors and Pepsico.And while the criticism (although limited) was real, few took shots directly at Mr. Trump, for fear of retribution. The harshest comment from a C.E.O. of a large, public company appeared to come from Reed Hastings of Netflix, who directly named the president: \u201cTrump\u2019s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all.\u201d(It\u2019s easy to surmise that Netflix could soon be on the losing end of Mr. Trump\u2019s possible plan to upend net-neutrality laws.)But most top executives took a more circuitous route. The wording was purposely dripping with politeness: \u201cThis executive order is one we do not support,\u201d became the language almost universally adopted by C.E.O.s.Of course, the business community, up until this past weekend, has largely cheered many of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to lower taxes, remove regulations and invest in infrastructure.Several dozen chief executives have found their ways onto a variety of councils to meet with Mr. Trump and advise him on business issues, making it even thornier to criticize him in public.By all accounts, people close to Mr. Musk say he was upset about Mr. Trump\u2019s order, but offered a somewhat tepid rebuke on Twitter: \u201cThe blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201dHe quickly found himself as the target of criticism from fans who wanted him to go further. \u201cExpected a much more forceful condemnation from someone like Elon,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.A lot of the discussion among C.E.O.s, which they shared with me anonymously for fear of retribution for even discussing the subject, said that in the Venn diagram they made about how to deal with public issues like this, they came back to the word \u201ctrade-off.\u201dWhat\u2019s the best alternative? One executive explained that he could offer a morally righteous argument that would feel good in the moment and probably cause a series of cheering \u2014 and booing \u2014 from his various constituents, while potentially losing whatever influence he might have on the president to guide him to make sensible policy in other areas. Or he could offer a Milquetoast response that appeased his employees and nodded at the issue without upsetting his relationship with the president.Given that Mr. Musk has been willing to bring up contentious subjects with Mr. Trump in the past \u2014 like introducing a carbon tax \u2014 perhaps making the point in person will do more than doing so in an email or on Twitter.Whatever the case, the first shots between the business world and the White House have been fired. And more are likely to come.\u201cThere\u2019s some strange mythology that when you go public you can\u2019t speak up,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve heard from plenty of investors appreciating our stance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Economic Vows May Be Harder to Hit After a Slow 2016", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump\u2019s target for economic growth just got a little more distant.But however solid, the recovery under President Barack Obama never reached exuberance. It is the second longest recovery in American history but the first in the postwar era in which growth for a full year did not hit 3 percent.Mr. Trump made that data point a focus of his campaign, citing factories that closed during the recession but never reopened and workers who gave up looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force. And economists, even if they disagree with his policy prescriptions, acknowledge that many areas have been left behind.While Friday\u2019s report will provide more support for Mr. Trump\u2019s argument, the lackluster pace of economic growth may also complicate the new administration\u2019s plans. Indeed, some of the headwinds in 2016 \u2014 like a widening trade deficit and cautious spending by businesses \u2014 could persist into 2017 and beyond.In 2016, personal consumption \u2014 which accounts for a majority of economic activity \u2014 slowed from 2014 and 2015. In addition, the sharp plunge in oil prices over the same period prompted steep cuts in energy production and exploration, contributing to a drop in business investment.All of this underscores why analysts say that Mr. Trump\u2019s growth rate target of 4 percent is audacious at best and fanciful at worst, especially given broader factors like an aging population and the growth rate of 2 percent or so that has prevailed since the recovery began in 2009.\u201cIt would defy gravity,\u201d Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago, said. Four percent growth would require big gains in the size of the work force and productivity, but neither is in the offing, Ms. Swonk said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s simple math.\u201dAt the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it is ready to raise interest rates a few times this year, and a faster expansion would only accelerate the Fed\u2019s plan to tighten monetary policy to head off inflation.Whatever the growth trajectory is in 2017, Fed officials will have a tricky time navigating the political and economic currents under Mr. Trump. Not only did he criticize the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, during the campaign, but his assessment of the current economy is more downbeat than the Fed\u2019s.One week into the Trump administration, there are many other economic wild cards for policy makers and private forecasters to contemplate, including the impact of congressional efforts to reshape the corporate tax code, trade tensions with Mexico and China, and the proposed repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.Tax cuts could open the way for new spending and investment. But more expensive imports from Mexico could be painful for many consumers, for example, while a trade war with China would hurt American companies like Apple, General Electric and Caterpillar.What is more, although the Commerce Department report focused on the last three full months of Mr. Obama\u2019s second term, anemic economic activity could add to the revenue shortfall the federal government will most likely face from the personal and corporate tax cuts Mr. Trump has discussed.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see how we would get to 4 percent growth given the current structure of the economy, especially demographics and productivity growth,\u201d said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. \u201cThat would be true no matter who is the president.\u201dThe retirement of the baby boomers will limit the size of the labor force, he said, while productivity gains from technology are not expected to accelerate from the current level, as they did with the adoption of the internet or mobile phones in the 1990s.Weak growth does strengthen arguments for a federal program to fortify the nation\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 an approach Mr. Trump has advocated that could provide an economic stimulus.Since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November, many economists have been raising their projected growth rates for the latter half of 2017 and for 2018.That is not necessarily because they feel Mr. Trump\u2019s policies will prove beneficial in the long run. Instead, it is because the tax cuts and infrastructure investments he has called for could bolster the economy in the short term.Mr. Faucher lifted his growth forecast to 2.4 percent in 2017 and 2.7 percent in 2018. Previously, he expected output to expand by 2.25 percent in each year.\u201cTax cuts and infrastructure spending represent a much more expansionary fiscal policy than we\u2019ve had in some time,\u201d he said.But Mr. Faucher cautioned that increasing the federal deficit, which stood at $587 billion in 2016, by hundreds of billions more in the coming years could increase interest rates, which were already moving higher.Rates, including mortgage rates for home buyers, are already up more than half a percentage point since the election, on expectations of more borrowing and faster growth.But in economics, as in life, everything cuts both ways. The rise in interest rates has also strengthened the dollar relative to other currencies.While that has been good news for American tourists, a stronger currency is bad news for American exporters, with imports becoming cheaper while the price of American-made products abroad rises.The prospect of a stronger dollar also makes it more difficult to achieve another of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic goals: a revival of the American manufacturing sector. Manufacturers are more dependent on foreign sales than many other businesses, but a rising dollar makes their products less competitive overseas.The dollar is rising on expectations of faster growth in the United States and because of the jump in domestic interest rates, which make American financial assets like bonds more appealing to global investors than lower-yielding debt in Europe and Asia.\u201cMr. Trump can\u2019t control the dollar, and that will be a big factor this year,\u201d Mr. Faucher said. \u201cTrade is likely to be a drag on growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
