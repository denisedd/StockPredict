Every year reform bills are offered; every year they die. Senate Republicans and Assembly Democrats are part of this game, but Mr. Cuomo bears much of the blame for not showing the tenacity, creativity and commitment to get this done. With another subdued call for reform in 2017, he has set himself up to fail again.It\u2019s not just on the environment that Mr. Cuomo seems to be establishing himself as a Trump antithesis. His new proposals for more college tuition assistance and for early voting and automatic voter registration, along with policies to help unauthorized immigrant college students, should, if enacted, go a long way to bolstering Mr. Cuomo\u2019s image as the progressive governor who gets things done. But where the money is coming from, and whether the Legislature will go along, are the perennial questions.Most of the ideas in the Cuomo book have evident merit; who could oppose revitalizing Kennedy International Airport, bringing ride sharing to upstate New York, defeating cyberattacks and opioid addiction, or replacing the aging I-81 viaduct in Syracuse? Not us. The trick for Albany watchers, as always, is discerning between the easy lifts and the hard ones, between what is real and what Mr. Cuomo is merely asking us to imagine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Collapse of Dewey & LeBoeuf, Round 2", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byThe events leading up to the collapse of Dewey & LeBoeuf, once one of New York\u2019s most prominent law firms, are about to be relived for a second time in a Manhattan state courtroom.Prosecutors will again try to secure convictions of two former Dewey executives \u2014 Stephen DiCarmine and Joel Sanders \u2014 nearly 15 months after a state judge declared a mistrial in an earlier criminal case and almost five years since the law firm filed for bankruptcy.So much time has passed between the two trials that Zachary Warren, who was a low-level employee at Dewey, had the criminal charges against him dismissed this month under the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement. A third defendant in that first trial \u2014 Steven H. Davis, the firm\u2019s former chairman \u2014 is already one year into a five-year deferred prosecution deal.Yet prosecutors working for Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, remain undaunted and continue to argue that Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders were architects of a huge accounting scheme that enabled Dewey to defraud its lenders and creditors during much of the financial crisis.Jury selection began Monday in New York State Supreme Court, and prosecutors have suggested that the second trial may not be much shorter than the earlier proceeding, which stretched out over five months. It ended with jurors unable to reach a unanimous verdict after 21 days of deliberations.Some jurors from the first trial said the length of the proceedings and the number of charges \u2014 over 100 counts against the three defendants \u2014 had made it difficult to reach a unanimous verdict.This time around, prosecutors are expected to introduce much of the same evidence and call the same witnesses. But at least jurors will have to consider fewer charges against Mr. DiCarmine, Dewey\u2019s former executive director, and Mr. Sanders, the firm\u2019s former chief financial officer.The case against both men \u2014 announced with much fanfare by Mr. Vance in March 2014 \u2014 has been whittled back to just two felony counts and a misdemeanor. The trial judge, Robert M. Stolz, tossed out the most serious grand larceny charges against the two defendants in February.The jury in the first trial acquitted the men on a number of lower-level charges before deadlocking on the remaining counts. Prosecutors subsequently dismissed some charges on their own.But even with the pared-back case, Mr. DiCarmine, 60, and Mr. Sanders, 58, could face up to four years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge \u2014 a securities fraud count.Lawyers for both men, on the eve of jury selection, somewhat predictably argued with the prosecution\u2019s continued pursuit of criminal charges against their clients. Andrew J. Frisch, the lawyer for Mr. Sanders, said prosecutors had become fixated on holding someone to account for the collapse of Dewey and \u201cjust won\u2019t let go.\u201d Rita Glavin, the lawyer for Mr. DiCarmine, expressed a similar frustration and said the decision to hold a second trial was \u201ca tragedy and injustice.\u201dThe second trial is taking place with much less attention than the first, which was closely watched by the New York legal community. The prosecution of the former Dewey executives was one of the first watershed white-collar cases brought by Mr. Vance, whose office has a mixed record in high-profile trials.The criminal proceedings have put a hold on a parallel lawsuit that the Securities and Exchange Commission filed against Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders, which contends that the two men and others at Dewey misled investors in a bond offering that Dewey used to fund its operations.The new trial is likely to feature testimony again from several former employees of Dewey\u2019s accounting department who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in the early stage of the investigation. And once again the star witness for the prosecution is expected to be Frank Canellas, the firm\u2019s former finance director.Mr. Canellas testified about conversations he had with Mr. Sanders in late 2008, including a dinner at a Manhattan restaurant, about ways to jigger the firm\u2019s financial books. But Mr. Canellas also testified that he had never directly told Mr. DiCarmine or Mr. Davis of any improper accounting maneuvers being used at the firm.As part of his cooperation agreement, Mr. Canellas pleaded guilty to a felony charge of grand larceny and prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence of two to six years in prison. But in October, prosecutors allowed Mr. Canellas to renegotiate and enter a new plea to a charge of scheme to defraud, a much lower felony count, and they agreed to cut in half the recommended time in prison.Mr. Vance\u2019s office has argued that the revised plea deal was only fair in light of Justice Stolz\u2019s decision after the trial to dismiss the larceny counts against Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders. In a court filing, prosecutors said, \u201cWe allowed Mr. Canellas to withdraw his previous plea and replead to a crime that factually fit his conduct.\u201dLawyers for Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders had argued that they should be allowed to question Mr. Canellas about his revised plea during cross-examination. Justice Stolz on Monday agreed with the defendants\u2019 motion.Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders, who did not testify at the first trial, are not expected to take the stand this time, either.Mr. Davis, who did not testify at the earlier proceeding, is unlikely to be called as a witness by either side. He is living in London, outside the court\u2019s jurisdiction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In America\u2019s Heartland, Discussing Climate Change Without Saying \u2018Climate Change\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byGLEN ELDER, Kan. \u2014 Doug Palen, a fourth-generation grain farmer on Kansas\u2019 wind-swept plains, is in the business of understanding the climate. Since 2012, he has choked through the harshest drought to hit the Great Plains in a century, punctuated by freakish snowstorms and suffocating gales of dust. His planting season starts earlier in the spring and pushes deeper into winter.To adapt, he has embraced an environmentally conscious way of farming that guards against soil erosion and conserves precious water. He can talk for hours about carbon sequestration \u2014 the trapping of global-warming-causing gases in plant life and in the soil \u2014 or the science of the beneficial microbes that enrich his land.In short, he is a climate change realist. Just don\u2019t expect him to utter the words \u201cclimate change.\u201d\u201cIf politicians want to exhaust themselves debating the climate, that\u2019s their choice,\u201d Mr. Palen said, walking through fields of freshly planted winter wheat. \u201cI have a farm to run.\u201dHere in north-central Kansas, America\u2019s breadbasket and conservative heartland, the economic realities of agriculture make climate change a critical business issue. At the same time, politics and social pressure make frank discussion complicated. This is wheat country, and Donald J. Trump country, and though the weather is acting up, the conservative orthodoxy maintains that the science isn\u2019t settled.So while climate change is part of daily conversation, it gets disguised as something else.Mr. Palen \u2014 he plays his politics close to his vest but allows that he didn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton \u2014 and others here in Glen Elder and across the state illustrate the delicate dance.Farmers like him focus on practical issues like erosion or dwindling aquifers. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t get the rainfall, it\u2019s tough times,\u201d he said.Regional politicians and business leaders speak of pursuing jobs that clean energy may create, rather than pressing the need to rein in carbon emissions. A science teacher at a community college \u2014 whose deeply religious students sometimes express doubts about the trustworthiness of science that contradicts biblical teachings \u2014 speaks to his class about the positives of scientific discovery (electricity) in order to ease into more contentious subjects (global warming).And an editor for a closely followed agriculture magazine, Successful Farming, recently made a controversial move, drawing a flurry of angry letters: He broke with longstanding policy to address climate change head-on.\u201cSome readers thanked us,\u201d the editor Gil Gullickson said. \u201cBut some wondered whether we\u2019d been hijacked by avid environmentalists.\u201dMuch of that consensus has broken down, in no small part because of a well-financed push by fossil-fuel interests, together with influential Republican allies, to attack well-established research on topics like global warming and push back on environmental regulation. That push began in earnest during the George W. Bush administration as attempts to undercut the Clean Air Act, and since then, the divide has widened.The fact that the climate-change discourse has also become dominated by liberals has alienated some conservatives, including Mr. Palen. Many people here in particular resent how, in the polarized political landscape of recent years, conservative Americans have been painted as hostile to the environment.Still, \u201cit would be a huge mistake to think people voting for Trump were voting against the environment,\u201d Ms. Horn said. If Trump follows an aggressive anti-environment agenda, she said, \u201cthere will be a big backlash in the heartland.\u201dIn many ways, Mr. Palen sees himself as the ultimate conservationist. His great-grandfather, the son of an immigrant from Luxembourg, was the first to farm in this stretch of north-central Kansas.Mr. Palen grew up on the farm, took it over in his 20s, and looked to make his mark. In college, he learned of a farming technique called \u201cno till,\u201d which is intended to more closely mimic the natural prairie ecosystem, and was intrigued by its promise to protect his family fields from Kansas\u2019 relentless winds and sudden downpours. The idea behind no-till farming, he now explains to anyone who will listen, is that plowing the soil destroys its natural structure, causing it to lose its precious moisture and nutrients. That makes it vulnerable to erosion.Mr. Palen\u2019s fields aren\u2019t tilled. There are no neat furrows. The residue of plants from previous plantings still carpets the earth, offering a layer of protection, and his fields are never bare even after harvest. He alternates wheat and other crops with what he describes as a cocktail of grasses and leafy plants, like grain sorghum, sunflowers and alfalfa, a gesture toward the diversity of the wild prairie. \u201cThey say there\u2019s more organisms in a handful of soil than people on the planet,\u201d Mr. Palen said, making his way through a field between plantings. He stooped his tall frame down, dug up a clump of earth, and rolled it between his fingers. He is soft-spoken, yet when he talks of the earth, his excitement is obvious.\u201cSee how it\u2019s firm and holds together?\u201d he said. \u201cSee how it doesn\u2019t break down into goo?\u201dDespite his conservationist streak, Mr. Palen has no affinity for environmentalists. He feels vilified, he says, for his continued use of chemical herbicides and pesticides. (Some organic farmers control weeds by tilling the soil, which Mr. Palen argues causes more ecological harm.) And he remains suspicious of any expansion of government regulations that ignore realities of rural America.\u201cWe want to be left alone,\u201d Mr. Palen said. He singled out the Clean Water Rule, an E.P.A. regulation designed to protect streams and other waterways, as regulatory overreach. Washington types wanted to dictate what he could do with every creek, every puddle, on his farm, he said, putting impossible burdens on farmers.And most of them had probably never spent any time on a farm, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones working to protect the environment. We\u2019re the ones whose lives are tied to the earth.\u201dSince a particularly contentious debate in class \u2014 a student threw a book bag at him, he said \u2014 Mr. Priesendorf has taken a step back to focus on the everyday positives of science. \u201cI ask: \u2018Do you like the light bulb? Do you like electricity?\u2019 That\u2019s science,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I ease into more contentious topics, like climate change.\u201dAnd conservatives have been pushing back against classroom standards adopted by the state of Kansas that treat evolution and climate change as scientific concepts. Last year, the United States Supreme Court declined to review a nonprofit group\u2019s lawsuit that claimed that those standards promote atheism.But now, under a Trump administration, Mr. Priesendorf felt science itself was under fire. \u201cIf even your government starts telling your country that scientists are lying to you, it\u2019ll be even tougher for science teachers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to focus on keeping my students\u2019 minds open to the possibility that the science is correct.\u201dAnnie Kuether, a Democrat and clean-energy advocate in the Republican-controlled Statehouse and a member of the State Utilities Committee, has for years pushed for more renewable energy. One obstacle, though, is that the committee\u2019s chairman does not believe in climate change.A St. Louis native who landed in Topeka as a young bride four decades ago, Ms. Kuether is used to working alongside adversaries. Her county voted for Mr. Trump, along with all but two counties in the state.\u201cI remember being horrified,\u201d Ms. Kuether said.Still, over the years, she has forged powerful business alliances by focusing, in her arguments, on jobs and the economy. She has also found increasing support from farmers and landowners who count on wind turbines and solar panels they host on their property for income.\u201cJust like grain, cattle, airplanes, wind\u2019s another valuable resource Kansas can export,\u201d he said, referring to Kansas\u2019 sizable agricultural industry, as well as the Cessna Aircraft Company, which is based in Wichita, Kan. \u201cKansas has a lot of pragmatic folks here, and we recognize benefits.\u201dKansas\u2019 dwindling water sources have been another issue that Ms. Kuether has found strikes a nerve among voters here, whatever their beliefs on climate change. That has helped to build some support for measures to save the state\u2019s shrinking aquifers, a lifeline for communities in western Kansas, though not yet any decisive action.In fact, her focus on the practical is a big part of what has kept getting her elected, she said, in a State Legislature where she is outnumbered by Republican lawmakers, two to one. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that families have always been concerned about water \u2014 whether they\u2019re Democratic, Republican or independent,\u201d she said.Mr. Gullickson of Successful Farming, who usually writes about topics like pigweed, gypsum and runoff, has started to push the envelope on debates over climate change. An 11-year veteran of the magazine, where he is the crops technology editor, Mr. Gullickson said he had long been on the fence about climate change. But that began changing five years ago, when he attended a workshop where a University of Kentucky professor gave a convincing argument, backed by data.\u201cI started looking at the evidence, at the data and what farmers were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear: The weather has become more extreme these days. And I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve never heard of any successful business publication that stayed in business by withholding information.\u2019\u201dSo for the first time in the storied magazine\u2019s 115-year-old history, a cover story squarely addressed the science of climate change. The October 2014 piece was published under the headline, \u201c@#$*% Weather!\u201d\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking: Climate change is just some figment of Al Gore\u2019s imagination adopted by liberal tree-huggers who want to tank the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Gullickson wrote.\u201cStill, think back over some rough weather you\u2019ve endured in recent years and ask yourself these questions,\u201d he continued. \u201cAre springs getting wetter? Are droughts increasing in severity? Are rainstorms increasing in intensity?\u201d The clear answer, he said: \u201cYes.\u201dMr. Gullickson said that he and his editor had held lengthy discussions leading up to the article\u2019s publication. His editor in chief, Dave Kurns, was supportive, he said, but also warned that the piece could generate backlash.Mr. Kurns spoke candidly over concerns of a backlash in an editor\u2019s note that led the issue. When he became the magazine\u2019s editor two years earlier, he said, he had been warned, \u201cNever use the words \u2018climate change.\u2019\u201d\u201cI was told: \u2018Readers hate that phrase. Just talk about the weather,\u2019\u201d he wrote.The response to the magazine\u2019s take on the issues has been split.\u201cWhen you start quoting \u2018climate scientists\u2019 and the United Nations,\u201d wrote in one reader, Bill Clinger, a farmer based in Harpster, Ohio, \u201cyou are as nutty as Al Gore.\u201d Measures to control emissions, he said, \u201care just seductive names for socialist programs intended to micromanage people and businesses.\u201dMr. Gullickson said some readers thanked him. \u201cFinally, a farming magazine comes to terms with what is going on with the weather,\u201d wrote Paul Jereczek of Dodge, Wis.Reached by phone, Mr. Jereczek, who runs a dairy farm, expressed exasperation at people\u2019s inability to speak openly. \u201cThe phrase has become so politicized, it\u2019s just hard to talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we talk about everything else. Even round here, protecting soil is such a hot topic right now. But we talk about the soil, saving fertilizer, that sort of thing.\u201dKnown for its shock of yellow hair and bright orange cheeks, the lesser prairie-chicken once roamed the Great Plains. Today, though, the grouse is under threat \u2014 its populations reduced to isolated pockets in western Kansas, Colorado and the Texas-New Mexico border as its habitat succumbs to climate-induced drought, farming, drilling and other human activity.The group has been petitioning the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The bird found itself taken off the list after a lawsuit in 2014 backed by the oil and gas industry, which argues that any protective measures would mean added costs for energy developers.Mr. Salvo has found that to gain allies it doesn\u2019t always help to start with the role climate change plays in harming the bird\u2019s habitat. Instead, his movement has tried to find common ground, highlighting the historical heritage of the lesser prairie-chicken. In the \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d novels, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote about eating prairie-chicken mush.Mr. Salvo also stresses how grouse-friendly practices can be good for farming, too, backing a federal program that provides financial aid to private landowners who adopt those practices. Leaving corn stubble standing after harvest gives the birds food and places to hide, for example, while also helping farmers protect the soil.\u201cSometimes, to gain allies, it helps to focus on issues of common concern, to support local economic development as well as species conservation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps everybody come to the table.\u201dAnd yes, Mr. Palen says, he is on board with saving the lesser prairie-chicken. \u201cI often think of ways I can protect their habitat,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoy wildlife.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "J.S.G. Boggs, Artist, Dies at 62; He Made Money. Literally.", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported bySitting in a Chicago diner in 1984, the artist Stephen Boggs began doodling on a paper napkin as he consumed a coffee and a doughnut. He started with the numeral 1, then transformed it into the image of a dollar bill.His waitress, impressed, offered to buy it. Mr. Boggs refused, but presented it in payment for his 90-cent tab. The waitress handed him 10 cents in change.An idea was born.For the next three decades, Mr. Boggs, better known by his artistic signature, J. S. G. Boggs, kept money on his mind. Extending the logic of the diner transaction, he painstakingly reproduced British pounds, Swiss francs and American dollars, with quirky deviations.On American currency, for example, he might use the signature \u201cJ. S. G. Boggs, Secret of the Treasury,\u201d or inscribe \u201cKunstbank of Bohemia\u201d on a $5,000 bill, or append the motto \u201cIn Fun We Trust.\u201d At first he created the notes one by one, a time-consuming process. Later he ran off limited-edition prints.He presented his currency to merchants as payment for goods and services. If the bills were accepted, he asked for a receipt and, when appropriate, change. He noted the details of each transaction on the backs of his \u201cBoggs bills,\u201d which were blank, and sold the receipts to collectors. It was up to them to track down the merchant \u2014 for a fee, Mr. Boggs would assist \u2014 and negotiate purchase of the note.Mr. Boggs never sold his bills. He only spent them.The assembled elements were, in the opinion of Mr. Boggs and his admirers, artworks, exhibited as such in galleries around the world and included in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington.\u201cI create images that say things and ask things,\u201d Mr. Boggs said in the 2013 Discovery Channel documentary \u201cSecret Life of Money.\u201d \u201cI take them out into the real world and try to spend them, not as counterfeits, but as works of art that ask us about the nature of money.\u201dLaw enforcement agencies in several countries took a different view. They regarded Mr. Boggs as a forger. They expressed this opinion, on several occasions, by seizing the notes or putting Mr. Boggs on trial.\u201cThey said I was a counterfeiter,\u201d an indignant Mr. Boggs told The Associated Press in 1992, when agents in the counterfeiting division of the Secret Service raided his apartment near Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where he was an artist in residence, and took possession of more than 100 of his artworks. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the difference between art and crime.\u201dThe Tampa police discovered Mr. Boggs\u2019s body on Sunday in a motel near the Tampa airport. He was 62. Robert Salmon, manager of operations for the Hillsborough County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, said the cause of death had not been determined.He was born Stephen Litzner in Woodbury, N.J., on Jan. 16, 1955. (He later added the names James and George.) His mother, the former Marlene Dietrich Hildebrandt, divorced his father when Stephen was an infant, and nothing is known about him.She joined a carnival, performed as \u201cMargo, Queen of the Jungle,\u201d and in 1961 married a Tampa businessman, Jim Boggs, with whom she ran the Brahman Lounge, a bar and package store. She later wrote a neighborhood column for The Tampa Tribune, reporting on the doings in Brandon, the Tampa suburb where she lived.Mr. Boggs attended Brandon High School but was expelled in his junior year. \u201cI was accused of starting a riot in the auditorium, but it was somebody else who threw the book at the principal,\u201d he told the journalist Lawrence Weschler, who wrote a profile of Mr. Boggs for The New Yorker in 1988 that evolved into a book, \u201cBoggs: A Comedy of Values,\u201d published in 1999.He took courses at Miami University in Ohio, Hillsborough Community College in Tampa and Columbia University, pursuing, vaguely, a career in accountancy. In the late 1970s, he decided to study art and moved to London.He enrolled in the Camden Arts Center there and began producing conceptual paintings \u2014 some consisting of repeated versions of his signature, others filled with elaborately embellished numbers.After his fateful visit to Chicago, for the International Art Exposition at Navy Pier, he returned to London and pursued the money trail with little success until he exhibited \u201cPined Newt,\u201d an oversize pound note, at the International Contemporary Art Fair in London in 1986. It sold for 1,500 times its face value and attracted the attention of Rudy Demenga, a Swiss art dealer, who invited him to Art Basel.The Swiss turned out to be ideal customers. Wherever he went, Mr. Boggs found that his handcrafted bank notes, executed with a fine pen on expensive paper, were, so to speak, legal tender. He began dining in fine restaurants and moved into a five-star hotel.\u201cAll money is art,\u201d Mr. Boggs told The Orlando Sentinel in 1997. \u201cIf you look at a dollar, it\u2019s portraiture, it\u2019s landscape art, it\u2019s abstract designs.\u201cI think people need to think more about money. If they did, they\u2019d think more about what they do to make it and what they do with it once it is made.\u201dThe British were less accommodating. As he was preparing to exhibit four bank notes at the Young Unknowns Gallery in London in 1986, three constables raided the gallery and hauled Mr. Boggs off to jail. He was charged with four counts of violating the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act.The civil-rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson mounted a successful defense. Mr. Boggs paid him in Boggs notes. In his book \u201cThe Justice Game\u201d (1998), Mr. Robertson wrote that the Bank of England, in response to the Boggs case, added a copyright notice to its paper currency.Three years later, Mr. Boggs was arrested in Sydney, Australia. This time the judge dismissed the case and awarded him $20,000 in damages.While in residence at Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Boggs planned to photocopy $1 million in Boggs bills and release them into the local economy, relying on others to keep them in circulation.\u201cI\u2019ve been spending this money for eight years,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much. I wanted to share the experience.\u201dSecret Service agents made it clear to local merchants that anyone using the bills as currency would face prosecution, and the grand experiment ended.Mr. Boggs filed suit to regain possession of his notes \u2014 he had lost more than 1,300 artworks in raids between 1990 and 1992 \u2014 and to win legal recognition of his work as art. In 1993, Federal District Judge Royce Lamberth dismissed the suit.\u201cThis court accepts Mr. Boggs\u2019s belief that money is valued, in part, because of our trust in political institutions,\u201d Judge Lamberth wrote in his ruling. \u201cTo that end, these political institutions should be given the means by which to establish and maintain the value of United States currency.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt is often said that \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words.\u2019 Unfortunately, Mr. Boggs\u2019s works are often worth a thousand dollars.\u201d Further appeals were unavailing.\u201cIt\u2019s all an act of faith,\u201d Mr. Boggs told Mr. Weschler for his New Yorker profile. \u201cNobody knows what a dollar is, what the word means, what holds the thing up, what it stands in for. And that\u2019s what my work is about. Look at these things, I try to say. They\u2019re beautiful. But what the hell are they? What do they do? How do they do it?\u201dOver the years, Mr. Boggs, who leaves no immediate survivors, traded his bills for goods and services, from candy bars to motorcycles, whose worth he estimated at several million dollars.In the mid-1990s, when Worth magazine asked him to design a note using the Treasury Department\u2019s new guidelines, Mr. Boggs produced a $100 bill with the image of Harriet Tubman as a young girl, anticipating by 20 years the announcement that Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson as the new face of the $20 bill. In 2001, he ran off a series of 100,000 plastic Sacagawea dollars, stamped with his own mint marks and paid for with a $5,000 Boggs bill.Speaking to ARTnews after Mr. Boggs\u2019s death, Mr. Weschler said, \u201cHe was just short of being a con man, but no more than anyone in the art world, or for that matter in the world of finance \u2014 which, of course, was his whole point.\u201dAn obituary on Sunday about the artist J.S.G. Boggs misidentified a 2013 Discovery Channel documentary in which he appeared. It is \u201cSecret Life of Money\u201d \u2014 not \u201cMoney Man,\u201d which is a 1992 documentary about Mr. Boggs directed by Philip Haas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pe\u00f1a Nieto Faces Unrest in Mexico as Gas Prices Climb and Trump Ascends", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Amid nationwide marches, highway blockades and looting stemming from widespread outrage over an increase in gas prices, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico went on national television to appeal for understanding.With international oil prices rising and Mexico dependent on gasoline imports, he argued in the speech on Thursday, the government had no alternative but to raise prices at the pump. \u201cHere I ask you,\u201d he said, gesturing at the camera, \u201cwhat would you have done?\u201dIt did not take long for him to get an answer, as social media erupted with suggestions and disgust.Combat corruption and impunity. Eliminate gasoline vouchers for elected officials. Collect more taxes from multinational corporations. Cut the salaries and benefits of high-level government officials. Sell the presidential plane. Reduce the first lady\u2019s wardrobe spending. Resign.It was a tough week for the president, who seems to be trapped in a slow, downward spiral of unpopularity, with two more years left in his term and Mexico reeling from myriad problems including rampant corruption, resurgent homicide rates, a thriving drug trafficking industry, a sluggish economy and a plummeting peso.The few voices of support for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2014 in political circles and among news commentators \u2014 have been drowned out by his detractors, and no more so than in the past week, when discontent over the gas price increase boiled over into protests and looting, setting off clashes with security forces that left several dead around the country.The unrest comes as Mexico braces for the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has threatened to introduce far more restrictive immigration and trade policies, including canceling the North American Free Trade Agreement, increasing deportations and building a wall on the southern border of the United States.Concern in Mexico about Mr. Trump\u2019s planned tack on trade has been so great that he has been able to move the markets on the basis of his Twitter posts.Mexico\u2019s Economy Ministry issued a brief statement in response saying the government \u201crejects any attempt to influence investment decisions by companies based on fear or threats.\u201dBut in general the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration seems to be struggling to figure out how to respond to Mr. Trump. Mexicans have been clamoring for a full-throated, chest-out defense of their country and sovereignty against Mr. Trump\u2019s threats, but many say they have yet to hear it.Confidence in Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto is so low \u2014 approval ratings have sunk below 25 percent \u2014 that he appears to be struggling to sell anything to the public, most recently the gas price increase last week.\u201cSuch a low level of popularity reduces his capacity to gather support or his margin for action to reactivate the economy,\u201d said Ignacio Marv\u00e1n, a political analyst at CIDE, a Mexico City university.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s efforts have been handicapped, analysts say, by a seeming disconnect from the public mood.The government looked unprepared for the violent responses to the price increases, which took effect on New Year\u2019s Day, when most officials were on vacation. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto himself was in the middle of a golfing trip. And as bloody unrest swept across the country, the president kept silent, finally making a public statement on the issue on Wednesday.The administration\u2019s detached response to the upheaval contributed to the impression of a president out of touch with the population, analysts said, and gave a sense of a leadership that is adrift, blindsided by events.The gas price increases of about 20 percent are part of a broad overhaul that ends the state\u2019s monopoly over the energy industry. The government has long controlled and subsidized gasoline prices, but by the end of the year it will allow gas prices to fluctuate according to the market, a move intended to attract foreign investment to compete with the state oil company, Pemex.The government has argued that ending fuel subsidies will help the country avoid spending cuts to social programs, and that the subsidies have disproportionately benefited wealthier Mexicans who own cars. But many fear that higher gasoline prices will increase costs for food and public transportation, hitting the pocketbooks of even the poorest Mexicans.Though Mexico\u2019s opposition parties are now condemning the price increase, most of them voted for it as part of the budget approved in October. But Mexico imports more than half of its gasoline from the United States, and Mr. Trump\u2019s election sent the peso to a historic low, raising the price of imported gasoline in pesos greater than anybody expected.Analysts said the government could have forestalled the fallout by designing measures that would have softened the blow for poorer Mexicans, or by creating subsidies for truck drivers or owners of older vehicles.\u201cThey didn\u2019t think about it,\u201d said Vidal Romero, a political analyst at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cThere is no compensation for citizens.\u201dIgnited by the gas price increase, but fueled by broader discontent with the government and uncertainty about the country\u2019s direction, citizens took to the streets, staging marches throughout the country and blocking key highways.Criminals also used the cover of the protests to break into stores and malls to strip shelves bare of home appliances, electronics, food and toys.By last weekend, hundreds of stores had been looted around the country and more than 1,000 people detained, the authorities said, and at least six people had been killed in clashes between looters and the police.The administration has rejected calls to rescind the price increase, and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party traded accusations with opposition groups about responsibility for fomenting the disorder.With Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s credibility so diminished, it will be impossible for the president to accomplish much before the 2018 presidential election, analysts said. He is not eligible to run again.The contrast with the early days of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidency is remarkable. When he took office four years ago, his sharp political instincts helped push a bold reform agenda through Congress with support from the opposition. The reforms included the opening of the traditionally closed energy sector to foreign investment, an exceptional political accomplishment given the Mexican public\u2019s view of the oil industry as a bedrock of the national patrimony.But now those instincts appear to have been eroded by scandal and mismanagement, and perhaps by an insulation from emotions on the street.\u201cHe has lost his feeling for politics,\u201d Mr. Romero said.The president\u2019s perceived weaknesses and his low approval ratings have opened up space for opposition groups and cast the future of his party\u2019s influence into doubt. Even the Institutional Revolutionary Party\u2019s longstanding dominance in the president\u2019s home state, the populous State of Mexico surrounding Mexico City, has been thrown into question, with the state\u2019s governorship up for grabs this summer.Perhaps the biggest political beneficiary of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s declining popularity has been the populist politician Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City, who is leading in polls of potential candidates for the 2018 presidential contest. With each misstep of the president, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador seems to become even more popular; some political observers refer to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto as Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201ccampaign manager.\u201dThe looting and criminal unrest across the country had subsided by the weekend, but protests continued, with thousands taking to the streets in largely peaceful marches.\u201cWe don\u2019t want this corrupt country any more,\u201d said Alicia Rios, 32, a receptionist who joined thousands of protesters for a march through downtown Mexico City on Saturday. \u201cThe legislators get 10,000 pesos in gasoline vouchers when the people can\u2019t afford to fill up their tanks.\u201dShe added, \u201cIf gasoline goes up, everything goes up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Each will have 60 to 90 seconds to offer a reading or lead a prayer.\u201cSome inaugurations have had just one, others have had two or three covering different religions, but this is a record,\u201d Mr. Bendat said.Here are those who are scheduled to participate:Cardinal Dolan has been the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York since 2009. His participation in the inauguration has been controversial in part because he has criticized Mr. Trump.Last week on his radio show, the cardinal said he was \u201chonored\u201d to be invited to take part in the inauguration and said he would have done the same thing had Hillary Clinton won the election.\u201cIt\u2019s not the person, it\u2019s the office, right?\u201d he said. \u201cI pray with prisoners. That doesn\u2019t mean I approve of what they\u2019ve done.\u201dMr. Rodriguez is the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, an organization that says it represents roughly 100 million Hispanic evangelicals in the United States and Latin America. In a statement, he said that he saw participating in the inauguration as \u201cnot just a patriotic honor\u201d but \u201cas a sacred duty.\u201dMr. Rodriguez has walked a tightrope in the past, defending Mr. Trump against accusations of racism (he called them \u201chyperbole from the liberal media\u201d) but also speaking up for undocumented immigrants, many of whom attend evangelical churches.\u201cYour sacrificial offering will be a seed for blessings for the remainder of the year,\u201d Pastor White wrote. \u201cAccording to Ezekiel 44, when you present your First Fruits offering, it will cause a blessing to rest upon your house!\u201dRabbi Hier is the founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization named after the 20th-century Nazi hunter and Holocaust survivor.Critics have called for him to drop out of the inauguration, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s support among white nationalist groups, but the rabbi said participating in the ceremony was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d for him.\u201cThere are 364 days a year for politics, for the two sides to pile on each other. Three hundred sixty-four days of that is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce every four years, the president of United States deserves a pass from both sides from political bickering; otherwise, we weaken our democracy.\u201dRabbi Hier will be the first Jewish religious leader to take part in an inaugural ceremony since 1985, he said, a fact that weighed in his decision to attend.\u201cIf a rabbi turned this down and said no?\u201d he said, \u201cIt would be a tremendous backlash. Many people would say \u2018look at how ungrateful the Jewish community is.\u2019\u201dMr. Graham is the son of Billy Graham, a pioneering televangelist and longtime spiritual adviser to American presidents from both parties.He has continued much of his father\u2019s work.

This year, they came out to every state capitol to pray for this election and for the future of America. Prayer groups were started. Families prayed. Churches prayed. Then Christians went to the polls, and God showed up.Bishop Jackson runs Great Faith Ministries International and Impact Television Network, which describes itself as the only Christian network founded and operated by African-Americans.Bishop Jackson hosted Mr. Trump at his Detroit church and interviewed him on his network last September, a decision which drew criticism from other African-American spiritual leaders because of the president-elect\u2019s comments about minorities.\u201cIt\u2019s not about being a Judas to my people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not an endorsement.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s First Week: Misfires, Crossed Wires, and a Satisfied Smile", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 If other new occupants of the White House wanted to be judged by their first 100 days in office, President Trump seems intent to be judged by his first 100 hours. No president in modern times, if ever, has started with such a flurry of initiatives on so many fronts in such short order.The action-oriented approach reflected a businessman\u2019s idea of how government should work: Issue orders and get it done. But while the rapid-fire succession of directives on health care, trade, abortion, the environment, immigration, national security, housing and other areas cheered Americans who want Mr. Trump to shake up Washington, it also revealed a sometimes unruly process that may or may not achieve the goals he has outlined.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump boasted he had no government experience and, in his first week in the White House, it sometimes showed. Orders were signed without feedback from the agencies they would affect. Policy ideas were floated and then retracted within hours. Meetings and public events were scheduled and then canceled. Advisers to the president made decisions without telling one another. The president called for an investigation looking at voters registered in more than one state, unaware that it would include his chief strategist, press secretary, treasury secretary, daughter and son-in-law.And Congress often appeared to be an afterthought.Whatever the stumbles, Mr. Trump expressed satisfaction with the debut of his presidency and the White House released a list of accomplishments under the headline, \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s First Week of Action.\u201d The bottom-line message to the American public was that politics as usual was over, and the new president was energetically remaking the country for the better.\u201cBig, big progress,\u201d he said in an interview earlier in the week. \u201cWe have tremendous support, but I\u2019m not doing it for the support.\u201dThomas Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump who led his inaugural committee, said the president\u2019s accomplishments have been \u201cmeteoric.\u201d \u201cHe has done exactly what he has said he would do,\u201d Mr. Barrack said. \u201cHe has delivered results at a faster pace than any president in history.\u201dHe added that Mr. Trump has little help as his team still gets assembled. \u201cHe has simultaneously assumed responsibility for a monstrous governmental regime with only a small group of outsiders from his transition team to guide him,\u201d Mr. Barrack said.Even so, some of his aides were concerned, dissecting and analyzing how some of the roughest moments took place and trying to establish who knew what. One aide, who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that by week\u2019s end, there was an acknowledgment of a \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d unless they began to be more candid with each other.Such a group would have as many as a dozen strategists, and could help to centralize policy-making on some topics by Mr. Bannon and Mr. Kushner. Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, who knows Washington well and who works in conjunction with the two, is likely to run more of the day-to-day operations of the West Wing, according to one person involved in the planning.Nearly every new president has a learning curve and it can take time to establish a process that carefully vets proposals, considers counterarguments and limits unintended consequences. But the curve seems especially steep for Mr. Trump, who like his closest aides \u2014 Mr. Bannon, Mr. Priebus, Mr. Kushner and Kellyanne Conway \u2014 has never served in government at a high level.To get off to a powerful start, Mr. Trump chose speed over process. A case in point came last Tuesday, when a flurry of emails was received by National Security Council staff members, at least five between 8:35 and 8:45 a.m., according to administration officials.Each email carried a different draft directive for Mr. Trump to sign, dealing with consequential changes like stiffening the treatment of terrorism detainees, abrogating multinational treaties, curbing financing for international organizations, barring visitors from certain Muslim-majority countries, and building a wall along the border with Mexico.None of the agencies with expertise in such areas had reviewed the orders, and the N.S.C. staff was told to read them and provide feedback by 10 a.m. that morning \u2014 barely an hour later.Policy making has been ad hoc. In the interview, Mr. Trump recalled that during a meeting with union leaders the day before the Keystone decision, he learned that not all of the steel that would be used to build the pipeline would be made in America.\u201cI said, \u2018Wait a minute, they ship it in China?\u2019\u201d he recalled. As a result, the next day he signed a directive ordering the Commerce Department to come up with a plan to ensure that pipelines are built with American steel.Competing for attention with Mr. Trump\u2019s substantive policy moves was a chaotic array of sideshows like fights over the size of his inaugural crowd and his false claim that illegal voters cost him the popular vote. His press secretary, Sean Spicer, suggested to reporters on Thursday that the border wall would be paid for by a 20 percent tax on imports, then told reporters hours later that it was just an idea, not the plan.Similarly, Mr. Trump scheduled a meeting with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, then signed his order starting the border wall on the same day Mexican officials were in Washington arranging the get-together, only to have Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto cancel the meeting. Mr. Trump tried damage control on Friday with a phone call with the Mexican leader, which Mr. Kushner helped arrange.Mr. Trump has historically run his business, and his campaign, with a high level of intentional chaos. But the White House is trying to change course in so many areas while still struggling to fill out its team. According to former and current law enforcement officials, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had only vetted about 30 people for White House positions, other staff jobs and nominees that need to be confirmed by the United States Senate, a fraction of the 1,000 it eventually vetted for Mr. Obama\u2019s first-term team.The officials said they were still waiting for more names. Even those who have been named have not all progressed through the Senate process. A confirmation hearing for Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, Andrew F. Puzder, has been postponed three times because he has not submitted his paperwork.Within the White House, overlapping power centers that have viewed each other with suspicion are working to move past discord from the transition, according to officials. Communication is compartmented among different factions. Mr. Priebus weeks ago began his own outreach to business leaders even as Mr. Kushner was already personally emailing some of them.Mr. Kushner has emerged as the most important figure in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House besides the president. He has told several people that all things on nearly every topic \u201crun through me,\u201d according to two people with direct knowledge. He had previously sought to limit Ms. Conway\u2019s influence, according to insiders, although she consistently has Mr. Trump\u2019s ear.The internal sway of Mr. Bannon, a former chairman of the conservative news and opinion website Breitbart, has grown with the advance of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda this week, much of which he helped shape. Mr. Priebus is still struggling to master the building. He has not always been kept abreast of what is taking place, and Mr. Spicer\u2019s troubles have been seen as potential strikes against Mr. Priebus, who brought him in from the Republican National Committee.One draft order, for instance, would create a committee of cabinet secretaries to review all of the numerous multinational treaties to which the United States is a party, and recommend whether Mr. Trump should abrogate any. An explanatory preamble argues that such treaties are \u201cused to force countries to adhere to often radical agendas.\u201dAs justification, it pointed to two United Nations treaties about children\u2019s rights and ending discrimination against women, stating they have been interpreted as prohibiting spanking and Mother\u2019s Day \u2014 echoing concerns raised by cultural conservatives.John B. Bellinger III, the legal adviser at the State Department under President George W. Bush, said the \u201cpremise of this whole executive order seems to be misplaced.\u201d For one thing, he said, the N.S.C. \u201cprincipals committee\u201d already exists to convene cabinet secretaries. For another, the spanking and Mother\u2019s Day arguments were \u201csilly\u201d interpretations and not binding. Plus the United States has not ratified those two treaties anyway.\u201cIf these had been signed in their current form,\u201d he said of the draft orders, \u201cthey would have made the White House appear ill-informed. But hopefully they would have been subject to more careful interagency review.\u201dTom Malinowski, the former top human rights diplomat under Mr. Obama, said the draft order, which was eventually delayed, read like the \u201cembarrassing\u201d product of \u201ca very enthusiastic undergraduate who writes a paper without having done the reading.\u201dSeveral former officials said they took heart from the recent hiring of John Eisenberg, a former partner at the Kirkland and Ellis law firm, as legal adviser to the N.S.C. Mr. Eisenberg worked at the Justice Department during Mr. Bush\u2019s second term, and helped put the president\u2019s surveillance programs on a stronger legal footing.\u201cHe will look at stuff and he won\u2019t be rushed or be bullied,\u201d said Matt Olsen, who worked with Mr. Eisenberg at the Justice Department. \u201cI think that is a good indication that he will bring some discipline to a flurry of poorly conceived ideas.\u201dComplaints about process from Washington veterans, of course, may not be high on the worry list for a president who came to town castigating its denizens and practices. Mr. Trump has relished his role as a disrupter and, for now at least, feels a certain momentum.In television appearances on Friday, Ms. Conway said that Mr. Trump arrived in Washington as a non-politician and so it was easy for him to deliver on his campaign promises.\u201cHigh-energy, high-impact POTUS,\u201d she wrote on Twitter later on Friday, using the acronym for president of the United States. \u201cWashington still adjusting.\u201dSo is the president.Max Fisher contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Banks Lose Bid to Halt Crisis-Era Lawsuits", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byThe banks, including Wells Fargo, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, had asked the justices to review an appeals court ruling that regulators filed their claims against the banks in a timely manner, despite a 1930s securities law that gave them only three years to do so. The claims were related to billions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities that banks packaged and sold to other institutions before the financial crisis in 2008.On Monday, the court rejected the banks\u2019 petition, returning the case to the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed and hope the court decides to review this important legal issue in a later case,\u201d Robert J. Giuffra Jr., of Sullivan & Cromwell and the lead lawyer for the banks, said.The petition at issue involved Colonial Bank of Montgomery, Ala., which failed in 2009 in one of the largest financial company collapses in American history.In August 2012, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation sued the banks that issued or underwrote the $300 million in mortgage-backed securities that Colonial bought in 2007 that contributed to its failure. Regulators said the disclosures on the securities contained false information or misrepresented the health of the underlying mortgages.The government has said the lawsuit was filed on time under a 1980s law known as the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, which gives the F.D.I.C., when acting as receiver, additional time to bring claims to court by overriding statutes of limitations set forth elsewhere.The banks argued that the F.D.I.C and regulators overseeing credit unions and mortgages that are subject to nearly identical provisions had not applied the law properly. They contended that so-called extender provisions did not apply to the Securities Act of 1933, which imposes a stricter three-year deadline from when a security is offered or sold to the public.A spokesman for the F.D.I.C. declined to comment on the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the banks\u2019 petition, which was issued with a flurry of other rulings.Lawyers for the banks have estimated that damages related to about $37.5 billion in securities are at stake in at least a dozen pending suits stemming from the financial crisis. They have argued that the suits should be barred based on the Securities Act deadline. The cases were brought by the F.D.I.C., the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration.A Federal District Court judge sided with the banks in the Colonial Bank case in 2014, but a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan backed the government\u2019s stand in a 2-to-1 vote in May. The Supreme Court has denied similar petitions from the banks twice before.The court\u2019s latest decision will probably end efforts to end the pending cases with one \u201ckiller shot,\u201d said Donald Hawthorne, of Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider, who has followed the litigation.\u201cWhat\u2019s happened when these cases have gone forward with a motivated party is that there\u2019s been a pattern of very substantial settlements, and the few cases that have gone to trial have been successful for the plaintiff,\u201d he said. \u201cThe banks are now going to have to face up to the reality of a significant liability.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Health Secretary Pick\u2019s Longtime Foes: Big Government and Insurance Companies", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byROSWELL, Ga. \u2014 It was 1 in the morning, and the orthopedic surgeon on call was preparing to operate on a woman whose foot had been shattered in a car wreck, after hours of tending to other patients. The woman\u2019s husband, Jeff Anderson, asked him, \u201cAre you too tired to do this?\u201d\u201cHe looked me straight in the eye \u2014 very quiet guy \u2014 and said, \u2018I was born to do this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Anderson recalled.The surgeon that night more than 20 years ago was Representative Tom Price of Georgia, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, the cabinet official who will lead the new administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.Since then, the assuredness that defined Mr. Price as a surgeon has carried into his political career. He has always listened politely to other viewpoints but never swerved from his policy mission to protect his former profession from what he views as heavy-handed government intrusion.Many who knew Mr. Price as a doctor here in Atlanta\u2019s affluent northern suburbs praise his commitment to his patients. But his legislative record shows that over eight years in the Georgia Senate and 12 years in Congress, he has advocated at least as much for physician groups and health care companies \u2014 seeking to limit damages in malpractice cases, for instance, and voting against legislation that would have required the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries.Mr. Price has routinely argued that patients are the driving force behind his efforts. Still, his positions have often coincided with the financial interests of groups whose donations have helped advance his political career.Doctors themselves are sharply divided over his nomination, and some are particularly galled by Mr. Price\u2019s enmity for the Affordable Care Act and opposition to abortion rights. Some of his positions even clash with those of Mr. Trump, who wants to pressure pharmaceutical companies on drug prices, for example, and has pledged to largely leave Medicare alone.Last year, Mr. Price bought stock in a company that makes orthopedic implants shortly before introducing legislation that could have protected the company, Zimmer Biomet, from financial losses due to a new federal regulation. The regulation sought to rein in spending on joint replacements for Medicare patients; Mr. Price\u2019s legislation would have delayed its implementation. After he introduced it, Zimmer\u2019s political action committee contributed to his re-election campaign; the string of events was first reported Monday by CNN.Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said Mr. Price \u201chad no knowledge or input into the purchase\u201d of the Zimmer stock, which he said was made by a broker. Asked why Mr. Price had not directed his broker to avoid buying health-related stocks while he wrote and voted on health legislation, Mr. Blando said, \u201cWe know that other members of Congress, including Democrats, have holdings in health care stocks and vote on health-related legislation.\u201dIn a letter to an ethics lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services last week Mr. Price said he would divest himself of holdings in 43 health-related and other stocks to avoid conflicts of interest. Noting that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an \u201cexhaustive review\u201d of Mr. Price\u2019s financial holdings, Mr. Blando said last week that Mr. Price \u201ctakes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously.\u201dAlthough not among the billionaires whom Mr. Trump has tapped for his cabinet, Mr. Price has profited from medicine, both as a doctor and as an active investor in health care-related companies including Aetna, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Zimmer Biomet, which makes artificial joints and other medical devices. He has an estimated net worth of $13.6 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with assets that include real estate. He has also been an effective fund-raiser: Even in his first run for office in 1996, his war chest of $173,000, much of which came from doctors and medical companies, led his poorly financed Democratic opponent to call him \u201cDr. Dollar.\u201dMr. Price, who declined to be interviewed, was engaged in a number of pitched partisan battles even before coming to Washington in 2005. In the Georgia Legislature, he voted against a new state flag that minimized the Confederate battle cross and supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. In Congress, he has taken stances seen as antithetical to public health, opposing regulating tobacco as a drug and favoring legislation that would make it easier to sell bullets that can pierce armor.He has also written a fairly detailed plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act. It would repeal the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and provide tax credits to help with the cost of coverage based on age instead of income, with older people getting higher credits.Mr. Price grew up in Dearborn, Mich., the son and grandson of doctors who heavily influenced his career choice. He has publicly recalled making house calls with his grandfather, who practiced medicine into his 90s. After medical school at the University of Michigan, he moved to Georgia, completing his residency at Emory and setting up practice in Roswell, a relatively affluent, conservative suburb of Atlanta.In the 1990s, his practice, Compass Orthopedics, was among seven in the Atlanta area that merged into a large group that became known as Resurgens Orthopaedics. It became the largest orthopedic practice in Georgia, and now has 100 doctors and 1,000 employees spread over 21 locations.Dr. Steven B. Wertheim, another founding partner of Resurgens, said one goal of the consolidation was to gain bargaining power with insurance companies and to provide M.R.I.s, physical therapy and even certain outpatient operations in-house rather than referring patients to other providers or operating at hospitals. More leverage with insurers often allows doctors to extract higher rates.\u201cHis overall gist was, \u2018Look, if all we did was practice good medicine, we\u2019d be broke by tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Dr. Wertheim said of Mr. Price. \u201cHe understood the need to run a business.\u201dAs a physician, Mr. Price was constantly frustrated by having to seek insurance companies\u2019 approval for his patients to get an expensive diagnostic test or physical therapy \u2014 a common complaint among specialists. Similarly, he resented when federal health regulators intervened in something he and his partners thought they were already doing well, like using electronic medical records.\u201cThose are the things that drove him crazy,\u201d Dr. Wertheim said.His resentment of government intervention in medicine drove Mr. Price to become involved in the Medical Association of Georgia early in his career, and his work there led him to run for office in 1995, when the House seat in his district opened up. But by 2002, as his legislative duties increased, he traded his suburban practice for a job at Grady Memorial Hospital, a vast, chaotic, aging complex, just a few blocks from the State Capitol.For the next two years, Mr. Price was the medical director of Grady\u2019s orthopedic clinic, seeing a vastly different population than the well-off, privately insured patients he was used to. Most of Grady\u2019s patients are poor and black, and many lack any form of insurance. Long waits for care are the norm, and trauma, including gunshot wounds, is a big part of the caseload.\u201cHe called me and asked if there was a position,\u201d said Dr. James R. Roberson, the chairman of the orthopedics department at Emory University School of Medicine, whose residents train at Grady. \u201cHe needed some flexibility \u2014 that was most of his impetus to want to return to Grady, because he was really very interested in pursuing a political career.\u201dDr. Roberson said that Mr. Price played a \u201cunique role\u201d at the clinic, training residents and overseeing patient care but also seeking to address inefficiencies \u2014 long wait times, for example \u2014 and representing the clinic at hospital administrative meetings. Although he saw patients, he did not perform surgery or need to be on call at night \u2014 an unusual arrangement, Dr. Roberson said.In the Legislature, Mr. Price spent his first six years in the powerless minority, although he quickly rose to the position of minority whip.His fortunes changed in 2003, after Sonny Perdue became the first Republican governor since Reconstruction and persuaded enough Democrats to switch parties to put the Senate into Republican hands.As the majority leader, Mr. Price\u2019s intimate knowledge of procedural rules and maneuvers, gleaned from assiduous research, helped advance his party\u2019s agenda.In the state Legislature, he was the leader who delivered bad news, the no-nonsense tactician to some of his Southern-born colleagues\u2019 more backslapping style. His sense of humor, when he used it, was dry. Colleagues often wondered if he slept.\u201cHe\u2019s a machine,\u201d said Russell K. Paul, a Republican who served in the State Senate with Mr. Price.During his two years in the majority, Mr. Price\u2019s top priority was curbing the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance, which he said was forcing hospitals and nursing homes to close and forcing doctors to limit which procedures they performed.\u201cHe was very bright, articulate, and smart enough to be able to see the different sides,\u201d said Tom Bordeaux, a former Democratic state lawmaker and trial lawyer who negotiated with Mr. Price over a package of bills Mr. Price introduced to limit doctors\u2019 liability in malpractice cases. \u201cBut he was just totally unwilling. He was very gracious and he was completely inflexible.\u201dUltimately, Mr. Price failed to persuade even his Republican colleagues to accept a provision that would have capped pain-and-suffering damages for malpractice victims at $250,000.Mr. Paul, now the mayor of Sandy Springs, Ga., said Mr. Price had become more partisan during his last few years in the Legislature, when the Republicans saw an opportunity to tip the balance of power in their favor for the first time since Reconstruction.\u201cThere was not a lot of bipartisan collegiality when it came to trying to control the government in Georgia,\u201d Mr. Paul said, \u201cand that environment was the crucible that began to turn Tom into a hardened political warrior.\u201dMr. Price has also supported proposals to overhaul Medicare \u2014 potentially putting him at odds with his new boss, Mr. Trump, who has pledged not to \u201ctouch\u201d the program. Speaking to a student group at the University of Michigan in 2015, Mr. Price expressed concern that Mr. Trump would not listen to others, including Congress, if elected.Katie Thomas contributed reporting from Chicago, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now That Trump Is President, How Will TV Respond?", "Date": "2017-01-22", "News": "Supported byPASADENA, Calif. \u2014 Scripted television got bigger and richer during the Obama years. What will happen to it in the Trump era?Television executives, producers and writers have been grappling with that question in the wake of President Donald J. Trump\u2019s election.Some argue that the bitter campaign and the heated political rhetoric after Mr. Trump\u2019s election could mean a TV landscape with a lot more escapist fare; others said that they have overhauled their shows to address a new world order head-on.And there is some thinking that the election of Mr. Trump, a former reality star, could inspire more larger-than-life characters.\u201cWe have to acknowledge that the sea change has happened,\u201d David Nevins, Showtime\u2019s chief executive, said in a recent interview. \u201cTrump likes to call it \u2018the movement.\u2019 I\u2019m aware of the movement. All of the effects and shocks and aftershocks of the movement will inevitably have an effect.\u201dHere are some ways in which leaders in the television industry believe the election of Mr. Trump will affect what people see:At a time of falling ratings and maximum distraction, networks are trying to draw audiences however they can find them, and executives are in no mood to alienate viewers sympathetic to President Trump. (The networks\u2019 parent companies have even less of an appetite to turn off Republican lawmakers.)Will that create a chilling effect?\u201cIt might have been harder to make \u2018Empire,\u2019\u201d he continued, referring to the dawn of the Trump era. \u201cTo get someone to say: \u2018O.K., we are going to do a mainstream television show that is a nighttime soap opera that\u2019s going to cost real money and it\u2019s 90 percent African-Americans. And, by the way, they\u2019re going to sing.\u2019 People who make those decisions? Those might be harder choices.\u201dAdi Hasak, the creator and an executive producer of \u201cShades of Blue\u201d and \u201cEyewitness,\u201d said: \u201cI feel there will be a push and pull between broadcasters and creators. The former will look to produce blue-sky shows that celebrate America and trumpet values while many of the latter will want to push shows with strong female protagonists, L.G.B.T.Q. characters and anything else\u201d that will anger the Trump administration. \u201cWill broadcasters be willing to air these kinds of shows?\u201dNot anymore. Mr. King estimated Mr. Trump\u2019s election changed about 75 percent of the plans for the show. \u201cIt affects the world on every level,\u201d he said.Or as Ms. King put it: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing as many cases that would just be, say, a typical crime-of-the-week-type case. We\u2019re not doing, here\u2019s just a murder. Things seem to be more politically freighted now.\u201dMs. Baranski\u2019s character works at a primarily black law firm, where many of the lawyers are looking at the incoming administration with \u201ctrepidation,\u201d Ms. King said.\u201cWe\u2019re not policy makers, but we can look at some of the results of what policies are being enacted and show how they affect the people the audiences have grown to care about,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd hopefully in making the political personal you can create more space for empathy and understanding and compassion in general.\u201d\u201cBefore the election we were like, \u2018It\u2019s so crazy, this can\u2019t get crazier,\u2019\u201d Ms. Noxon said. \u201cAnd now cut to: crazier. The work has to reflect that.\u201dDana Walden, a chief executive and a chairman of the Fox Television Group, said there was one clear lesson from the election: The country loves a big character.Ms. Walden referred to examples from past Fox shows like Jack Bauer in \u201c24,\u201d Al Bundy in \u201cMarried With Children\u201d and Simon Cowell on \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d when discussing how a compelling \u2014 and often divisive \u2014 personality can spell ratings gold.\u201cIn a very cluttered marketplace where people are highly distracted, we\u2019ve seen the value in a big personality who demands your attention and just forces people to pay attention to him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a time to be doing quiet, small storytelling. I don\u2019t think that survives right now.\u201dOne reliable way to avoid a political third rail? Run away from it.For ABC executives, the election was a reminder of just how big the country is, said Patrick Moran, the president of ABC\u2019s TV studio. Since last summer, he said, ABC has been rolling out a development strategy targeting dramas that are a \u201clittle bit lighter, a little bit brighter\u201d and \u201cnot catering just to the coasts.\u201d He pointed to comic dramas like \u201cUgly Betty\u201d and \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d as future models.But if there\u2019s a prevailing mission at ABC, Channing Dungey, the president of ABC Entertainment, put it this way: \u201cAt a point where there\u2019s a lot of turmoil in the world around us, part of what we want to do is be able to relax, to enjoy, to laugh, to feel.\u201dMr. Nevins, the Showtime executive, echoed that he would be looking at escapist fare but that he also wanted \u201cmore hard-hitting dramas\u201d and documentaries that had something to say about the current political moment.\u201cI try to make our programming and what we buy reflect the world that we live in,\u201d Mr. Nevins said.John Landgraf, FX\u2019s chief executive, cautioned that few changes would be immediate.\u201cTheir job is to sift and digest and think and feel and progress the idea of where narrative comedy and narrative drama go,\u201d he said, contrasting TV writers with the news media. \u201cThat\u2019s a longer process.\u201dHoward Gordon, the co-creator of \u201cHomeland\u201d and a producer of \u201c24\u201d and Fox\u2019s coming \u201c24: Legacy,\u201d said that it took years to dream up Carrie Mathison, the main character in \u201cHomeland,\u201d which had its premiere in 2011.\u201cCarrie Mathison was a character who was really working through the trauma of 9/11 a decade after 9/11,\u201d he said. \u201cThat story couldn\u2019t have been told in 2004. It had to be told after Iraq, and the massive reaction or overreaction to the trauma of 9/11.\u201dBut what of Jack Bauer, the main character in \u201c24,\u201d whose freewheeling ways in catching terrorists \u2014 and dabbling with torture techniques \u2014 was on the air shortly after Sept. 11?\u201cJack Bauer was a reflexive response to an acute trauma,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we can say Donald Trump\u2019s election is an acute trauma yet. He\u2019s merely been elected.\u201dBut Mr. Landgraf and Mr. Gordon both said that if Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency leads to any dramatic upheaval, TV writers will be ready.\u201cWe have to see what this disruption is going to mean,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cIf you want to be a pessimist and your worst fears are realized and the degradation of these institutions really happens \u2014 if the press is utterly undermined, for instance \u2014 it\u2019ll be incumbent on artists to dramatize that. If it does, there will be, I promise you, a lot of art and a lot of storytelling that responds to this.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of Dana Walden of the Fox Television Group. She is a chief executive and a chairman, not a co-president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel as the Lights Go Out", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The bizarre burst of diplomatic activity on Israel-Palestine in the waning days of the Obama administration has been tantamount to an admission that, on this subject, things only get said too late and when they no longer mean anything. The rest of the time political cowardice in the form of silence prevails.Trump\u2019s thirst for the \u201cultimate deal\u201d in the Holy Land could not be more far-fetched, however much his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, hones his skills with Henry Kissinger. There\u2019s nobody and nothing to work with after a half-century of moral corrosion and progressive estrangement.Speaking of Kushner, I was told he refused to meet with a senior French diplomat after a demand from Trump Tower that the Paris conference be canceled was ignored. Get used to my-way-or-the-highway diplomacy with team Trump.U.N. resolution 2334 infuriated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who called it \u201cshameful.\u201d He seemed surprised that ignoring Obama\u2019s veto of an earlier settlements resolution in 2011 would have consequences. Obama ran out of patience because, despite his forbearance, Israel went right on planning housing for tens of thousands more settlers while absorbing \u201cmore than one half of our entire global foreign military financing,\u201d in Kerry\u2019s words. Gratitude is not Netanyahu\u2019s forte.There was little new in the resolution, given America\u2019s consistent opposition to settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, over several decades. In fact, the twinning of criticism of Israel with condemnation under international law of \u201cincitement\u201d \u2014 a reference to persistent Palestinian practice \u2014 was among the fresher elements. Still, the language was sharp. The resolution called on states to distinguish \u201cin their relevant dealings\u201d between Israel and \u201cthe territories occupied since 1967\u201d; and it declared that \u201cThe cessation of all Israeli settlement activities is essential for salvaging the two-state solution.\u201dIt\u2019s ugly, but then ugliness is having its day.Kerry finally set out the terms of a two-state peace: secure borders based on the 1967 lines with agreed land swaps; a state for the Jewish people and a state for the Palestinian people where the rights of all citizens (Arabs in Israel, Jews in an eventual Palestine) are upheld; a just solution for Palestinian refugees including compensation and acknowledgment of suffering but without changing \u201cthe fundamental character of Israel\u201d \u2014 so only very limited return to Israel proper; Jerusalem as \u201cthe capital of the two states;\u201d a demilitarized Palestinian state, a full end to the occupation after an agreed transition, and elaborate Israeli security guarantees; an end to the conflict and all outstanding claims along with broader peace for Israel with all its Arab neighbors and a regional security partnership.Why was this unremarkable formula unsayable for so long? Because cowardice inhabits Washington, Jerusalem and Ramallah: This little diplomatic flurry has been obscene. Kerry was honorable; Obama lacked courage. Netanyahu dismissed the \u201clast twitches of yesterday\u2019s world.\u201d It is a measure of where we are that tomorrow\u2019s may well be worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daughter of Key Figure in South Korean Scandal Is Detained in Denmark", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byThe suspect, Chung Yoo-ra \u2014 the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, the longtime confidante of Ms. Park who is at the center of the scandal \u2014 has been living in hiding in Europe, ignoring repeated calls from South Korean investigators to return home to face criminal charges.But Ms. Chung, 20, has been elusive. Last month, a special prosecutor asked the authorities in Germany, where Ms. Chung, a former member of South Korea\u2019s national equestrian team, had been training, to detain and extradite her. South Korean officials had also asked Interpol to look for her and threatened to invalidate her passport.Ms. Chung was holed up with her infant son, a nanny and two male guardians in a house in the northern Danish city of Aalborg when the local authorities found her on Sunday night, said the South Korean news channel JTBC, which was at the scene when she was apprehended. It said its reporters first alerted the authorities to her whereabouts.\u201cWe will request her emergency extradition, working with the special prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d Lee Chul-sung, the chief of the National Police Agency, said at a news conference in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Monday.The Danish police said on Monday that they had arrested Ms. Chung after receiving a tip from a South Korean journalist Sunday afternoon and confirmation from the international law enforcement agency Interpol that an international warrant for her arrest had been registered last Tuesday.Ms. Chung confirmed that she was aware that the South Korean authorities wanted to question her, the police said, and added that she was in Denmark for horse racing.The police said that Ms. Chung had not been charged with a crime in Denmark, although prosecutors said they had asked the court to keep Ms. Chung in custody while the question of possible extradition was clarified. South Korea and Denmark have an extradition treaty.Ms. Chung was accused of illegally enrolling in Ewha Womans University in Seoul in 2015, using her mother\u2019s political connections to force the elite school to accept her despite poor qualifications. An inquiry by the Education Ministry revealed that the school had admitted her at the expense of other candidates with better credentials. Her enrollment was revoked in November.Ms. Chung has become a lightning rod for public anger as lurid accusations have emerged about her lifestyle. The accusations of illegal enrollment against her have been particularly inflammatory in South Korea, where students cram for years to prepare for intensely competitive college entrance exams. Ewha students were the first to take to the streets to protest the Choi family\u2019s reported influence peddling.After Ms. Chung lost a gold medal to a rival in a domestic equestrian competition in 2013, her family was accused of using its connections to open a government audit of the local equestrian association.Two officials at the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism who looked into the scandal lost their jobs for not siding with Ms. Chung\u2019s family, a former culture minister said. Ms. Park called the officials \u201cbad men,\u201d according to the former minister, Yoo Jin-ryong.Ms. Chung\u2019s family also used its influence to get Ewha to give her good grades even though she hardly attended classes, Education Ministry officials said.On Tuesday, the special prosecutor asked a court to issue an arrest warrant for an Ewha professor who was accused of ordering his teaching assistants to complete assignments for Ms. Chung.\u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing but your parents to blame for your lack of resources,\u201d Ms. Chung wrote in a Facebook post in 2014. The post was shared widely in South Korea, where widening economic inequality has fueled increasing public anger.Dan Bilefsky contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Americans Come Together", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported bySportingBut the demolition of this repository of youthful memories should not have surprised me. For decades, roller skating rinks have fought for their survival, and over the past five years, participation in roller skating is down about 4 percent, according to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association.Nostalgia can be a tricky, fickle bedfellow, but there did seem to be the threat of the loss of a sense of shared, cordial space, particularly in communities that were physically spread out. As Robert Putnam noted in his 2000 book \u201cBowling Alone\u201d \u2014 before the smartphone and social media era \u2014 our bridge clubs, civic groups, square dances and the like have long been a melting iceberg. Skate World felt like a giant chunk falling off.Skate World, sandwiched between Interstate 5 and the backside of Gateway Mall, carved out an unlikely sanctuary in the hearts of locals as a place for birthday parties, school field trips and other childhood loitering. It bore an ominous sign at entry, creating a crucial air of mystery and danger: \u201cSkate at Your Own Risk.\u201dThat was the motto our family lived by. We had a couple of roller-related hospital trips, one on Skate World\u2019s floors: My mother fell while sailing across its floors and broke her arm shortly after I was born, a testament to the bizarre stoicism of her desire to chase her trip to the maternity ward with a few laps. We weren\u2019t a graceful people, but Skate World welcomed us nonetheless, and politely asked if we\u2019d like to add wrist guards to our skate rentals.Many a crush was nursed within those carpeted walls, where kitschy pop and disco songs were requested one-by-one on steady rotation, the smell of stale nachos and body odor permeated the air, and beige skates were rented out with questionable aromas of their own. I was an ambidextrous child, and the symmetry of roller skating was a welcome respite from my awkwardness with physical activities that involved a ball or a racket.For a small fee, paid in loose change and crumpled dollar bills, carnations could be dedicated to those circulating on the baby blue floor, eliciting a round of giggles or groans. Chewing gum and \u201cfoul language\u201d were supposedly banned; I can now come clean about dropping obscenity bombs in a rebellious preadolescent fervor and sneaking in Bubble Yum on multiple occasions. In a mud hole of constant drizzle, skating was a welcome activity for cooped-up children and their exhausted parents, a more kid-friendly bowling alley. As a community gathering spot, the rink felt less classist than a shopping mall but less intimidating than a church, and much less soggy than a park.It was perfect.I also found myself wondering about the consequences of a beloved shared space closing its doors in this era of great disconnection. Some communities are formed through schools, churches, workplaces. But much of how we learn about one another as a society comes from physically being together in places like skating rinks. Today, we\u2019re more likely to sext than skate, to troll online than to twirl on a floor, to rant on Twitter than dedicate carnations to one another. Social media has created a digital latticework, but it has also, for some, created abusive commenters, silos and validation rather than curiosity.As a Skate World kid, I don\u2019t think I could have told you, nor did I care, about the political leanings of my classmates or their families. We were bound by something different from the angry Facebook stream we grew up to inhabit: a genuine interest in spending time together.I haven\u2019t skated in years and am fairly certain my neon-pink Rollerblades were liquidated several garage sales ago. I\u2019ve often wondered if the trade-off for growing up in the relative newness and freshness of the West Coast was befuddlement when it comes to historical preservation. We don\u2019t have many old things, and we don\u2019t really know what to do with the few that are around when our default response is to compost or field burn.On a recent visit home, I asked my 15-year-old nephew if he had been to Skate World in the last couple of years. He shrugged, then told me about the latest video game he was into. Not a scientific sample, but a hard moment to shake.But later in the year, I got a great surprise: Skate World would be saved.Dave and Debbie Berg of Puyallup, Wash., secured financing to purchase it from the Sacramento-based trusts that had controlled it. They plan to keep it open.\u201cIt\u2019s good for the community,\u201d Debbie Berg told me. For Berg, the purchase was personal. She worked at the rink from 1978 to 1998, she told me, and has been an impassioned skater since she was 13. \u201cEveryone has fun here. It\u2019s been here for 40 years. I think Bill Cook, who designed it, always wanted to keep it open as a rink. It was his baby.\u201dBerg said that operating one of the state\u2019s few skating rinks isn\u2019t always easy. Payroll costs are going up, and she will probably have to raise the admission fee to accommodate those staffing costs and renovations.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to change it a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cJust little tweaks here or there.\u201dThe twists and turns at Skate World have made me wonder if today I am still a small-town skater, a New York City elitist, or maybe something in between.I\u2019m still figuring that out. But the next time I\u2019m in town, I know that I\u2019ll be grateful for the opportunity to lace up some skates.For now, at least, it isn\u2019t the end of the world after all.Mary Pilon, the author of \u201cThe Monopolists\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cThe Kevin Show,\u201d previously covered sports at The New York Times and business at The Wall Street Journal.Advertisement"}

During her tenure, the university branch\u2019s first on-campus housing was built; its schools of communication, computer science and engineering were established; and its enrollment increased. She retired in 1990.Dr. Cobb arrived in Fullerton after being considered for the presidency of Hunter College, in Manhattan, in 1979 in a contentious atmosphere. She was dean of Douglass College at Rutgers at the time and would have been Hunter\u2019s first black president had she been appointed to succeed Jacqueline G. Wexler, who was retiring after nearly a decade as the college\u2019s president.Initially, the CUNY trustees were also considering Robert S. Hirschfield, chairman of Hunter\u2019s political science department, for the post.Robert J. Kibbee, the CUNY chancellor, recommended Dr. Cobb, but faculty members, students and alumni preferred Dr. Hirschfield, a popular figure on campus. Unable to choose between the two, and with classes resuming, the trustees in September appointed an acting president.They also began to consider other candidates, including Donna E. Shalala, the assistant United States housing secretary, and Clyde H. Wingfield, executive vice president of the University of Miami.In December 1979, the board chose Dr. Shalala, though students and faculty members said she lacked academic experience. The New York Times later reported that political figures, including former Mayor Robert F. Wagner, had intervened on her behalf.The decision rankled Dr. Cobb, and she eventually went to California.Once at Fullerton, she pushed for greater inclusion of minorities and women in science, technology, engineering and math and helped increase minority enrollment.Jewel Isadora Plummer was born in Chicago on Jan. 17, 1924.

{"Headline": "Taxpayers Will Defend Trump in Suit Charging Constitutional Violations", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byFirst 100 Days Briefing\u25a0 The federal taxpayer will be defending President Trump in a lawsuit filed against his business ownership.\u25a0 Mr. Trump\u2019s new hotel in Washington lost money in its opening months.\u25a0 Two major donors to the Trump election effort will get plum ambassadorships.But while Mr. Trump said on Monday that the case was \u201cwithout merit,\u201d a Justice Department spokeswoman, Nicole Navas, declined to comment on it, saying only, \u201cThe department is reviewing the complaint and will respond as appropriate.\u201dBut the lawsuit, filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal government corruption watchdog, contends that the clause bars such transactions, too, and that donating profits does not solve the problem. It wants the judge to stop Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses from accepting such payments.It is not clear that Judge Abrams will resolve the dispute over the clause\u2019s meaning. First, she must decide whether the group has suffered enough injury to bring a court challenge.But several scholars on Monday noted that Congress had enacted a statute that made it easier to challenge housing discrimination, but not emoluments clause violations.The Trump International Hotel in Washington took in far less revenue in its first two months than it had projected in estimates it had provided to the General Services Administration, which owns the building, meaning that the hotel lost more than $1.1 million in September and October, according to a letter that House Democrats released on Monday.The revenue totals, and estimates of expected revenue, were released as the four House Democrats pressed the General Services Administration to explain how it would respond to the apparent breach that has taken place in the lease Mr. Trump has with the agency, given that it contains a clause that appears to prohibit federal elected officials from benefiting from the lease.The Trump Hotel, which opened in September, had estimated that it would generate $6.4 million in revenue in its first two months, but it collected just $4.1 million, according to the letter, citing information that Mr. Trump\u2019s company provided to the agency as part of the lease agreement.This chart shows the ownership arrangement behind the company the Trump family set up to control the Trump International Hotel in Washington. A letter that House Democrats sent on Monday also details how revenues at the hotel in its first two months were lower than had been projected.The hotel had expected about $397,000 in income through the end of October \u2014 revenue minus expenses \u2014 but actually had $1.16 million in losses.These losses came as the hotel was just opening, a challenging time for any new hotel. And revenues have clearly surged after Mr. Trump was elected and in the time around the inauguration.The House Democrats, led by Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked the General Services Administration to explain what action, if any, it plans to take regarding the hotel lease, given the provision that appears to bar a federal elected official from holding it. The agency has so far made no public statement on how it will respond to this apparent breach.The Democrats also released a chart showing the corporate ownership arrangement behind the Trump Post Office LLC, the corporate entity set up by the Trump family to run the hotel. It shows that Mr. Trump, at least at the time he submitted the filing to the General Services Administration, controlled 76 percent of the company, while three of his children each had about 7.5 percent.A representative from the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Trump is expected to nominate two private equity executives and major campaign fund-raisers to the plum diplomatic posts of Italy and Japan.Lewis M. Eisenberg has been chosen to be ambassador to Italy, and William F. Hagerty IV will be nominated to become ambassador to Japan, according to senior White House advisers.Mr. Eisenberg began his career at Goldman Sachs and then co-founded Granite Capital International Group. He was the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks and has long served in top positions in Republican fund-raising circles. He led a joint fund-raising effort by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee and served on Mr. Trump\u2019s Presidential Inaugural Committee.Mr. Hagerty served as an economic adviser during the administration of President George Bush and then built a career in private equity. He was Mitt Romney\u2019s national finance chairman in 2008 and supported former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida in the presidential campaign until Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. He later became director of appointments for the Trump transition team. Early in his career, Mr. Hagerty lived in Japan for three years.Sean Spicer, the new White House press secretary, opened his first full daily briefing with a quick joke about his lack of popularity among the press corps and a break with precedent: The first questions went to friendly outlets, not the wire services.After a very contentious exchange with reporters over the weekend, which drew angry condemnation on social media, Mr. Spicer noted that he had sent an email to Josh Earnest, his Democratic predecessor, who had been voted the most popular press secretary among reporters.\u201cHe can rest easy. His title is secure, at least for the next few days,\u201d Mr. Spicer joked.Mr. Spicer largely ignored the longstanding precedent of calling on the wire services, network reporters and major news organizations. Instead, he called on The New York Post first, then the Christian Broadcasting Network.Mr. Trump issued a fresh tax warning to corporate America on Monday morning, promising that his administration would introduce a \u201csubstantial\u201d border tax that would make it expensive for businesses to move factories outside the country.\u201cA company that wants to fire all of its people in the United States and build some factory someplace else, then thinks that product is going to just flow across the border into the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201dHow such a tax would work is in question. Would a company like General Motors that already has a plant in Mexico be hit by the tax, or would it affect only companies that move operations overseas once the law passes? What about Apple, which has contracts with manufacturers in China but doesn\u2019t manufacture there itself?Mr. Trump, who plans to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, rejected the notion that he was anti-trade, but insisted that his first priority as president is to put American workers first on such deals.\u201cWhat we want is fair trade\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to treat countries fairly, but they have to treat us fairly.\u201dTrying to ease concerns among American business executives about a border tax, Mr. Trump said that the solution was easy: Stay in the United States.\u201cIf you stay here, there\u2019s no tax,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you have to do is stay.\u201dJulia Hahn, a young writer for the website Breitbart, is expected to join the White House as an aide working with her former boss, Mr. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist.Ms. Hahn\u2019s exact title and duties are unclear, although one White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly because Ms. Hahn has not yet been formally hired, said that there were a number of junior-level positions open and she would slide into one.But Ms. Hahn wrote several Breitbart articles savaging House Speaker Paul D. Ryan over his past support for comprehensive immigration reform and his criticism of Mr. Trump during the campaign.During the transition period, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Bannon, who was the chairman of Breitbart, are said to have begun to develop a relationship. And aides to Mr. Ryan came away from a meeting on tax reform with Mr. Bannon and other senior advisers to the president describing Mr. Bannon as the only one with a nuanced understanding of policy.Ms. Hahn would represent an expansion of Mr. Bannon\u2019s growing sway within the White House, as he aligns with the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, to develop a governing philosophy for the new administration.In the 2016 election cycle, Sheldon Adelson, the megadonor and casino magnate, was the nearly $125 million man.Mr. Adelson had a prime seat at Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing in on the West Front of the Capitol last week. And at a dinner honoring Vice President Mike Pence, the president singled out Mr. Adelson in the crowd. He mocked him for having been late to donate but also said that the total amount he gave to \u201csuper PACs\u201d was roughly $125 million.Two people close to Mr. Adelson described that figure as accurate. Mr. Trump, in his remarks, went on to criticize super PACs and to describe them as vehicles for consultants to get rich. Mr. Adelson is said to have donated through several vehicles, including to groups supporting congressional Republicans.Still, Mr. Adelson\u2019s largess was consequential to Mr. Trump during the campaign. He was one of the earliest donors to support Mr. Trump, a fellow casino developer, once it became clear he would be the nominee.During difficult stretches toward the end Mr. Trump\u2019s race, when Mr. Adelson was pushed to donate more cash, he expressed concern about doing so unless Mr. Trump gave more of his own money to the campaign, according to two people briefed on those discussions.Mr. Adelson\u2019s singular focus is the safety of Israel, and one of his concerns is that the administration follow through with a vow to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem.Before his rise to Mr. Trump\u2019s White House, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, was known around Washington as the somewhat beleaguered communications chief at the Republican National Committee, and before that, a spokesman around Republican quarters of the House.But his brushes with the news media \u2014 and ensuing raw feelings \u2014 go further back than that, to his school days at Connecticut College, where he was a student government senator and his relationship with The College Voice was, shall we say, not terribly cordial. He may have even coined the meme \u201cSad!\u201dIt started in April 1993, when The College Voice\u2019s \u201cThis Week in Assembly\u201d column detailed an amendment to ensure that an antismoking regulation would not affect existing rules for the creation of smoking and nonsmoking rooms for exams, sponsored by one \u201cSean Sphincter.\u201dThat May, The College Voice allowed that Mr. Spicer was \u201cunintentionally misidentified\u201d and that the paper \u201cregrets the error.\u201d\u201cWhile those involved claimed that this was a copy joke that went unnoticed, I believe that it was a malicious and intentional attack. For a paper which claims to be run by \u2018professional\u2019 standards, I find it a bit sad that this type of reporting is explained as a simple part of production.\u201dThe White House press secretary\u2019s emphatic insistence that 1.5 million people attended Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration has become quite the national punch line.The Dallas Stars got into the act:So did this guy:Even Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors and former pro player, was having fun with it.Mr. Trump announced that he will nominate former Representative Heather Wilson as secretary of the Air Force, making her the first graduate of the Air Force Academy to serve in the role.Ms. Wilson, a Republican, represented New Mexico in the House from 1998 to 2009 but lost two races for the Senate. Since 2013, she has served as president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Her name had been floated for other administration positions, including director of national intelligence.The new president is still on Twitter, naturally, but he apparently hasn\u2019t decided where his followers are to look.On his old @realDonaldTrump feed on Monday morning, he offered up a little bit of news for the day ahead.The @POTUS account, intermittently used by President Barack Obama and usually a tad dull, has become a propaganda arm of the Trump White House, with exaltations, quotations and photographs \u2014 and a profile pic of the new president that is pure Trump.The White House did move the president\u2019s initial @realDonaldTrump post on Monday morning to the official account, 23 minutes later. Perhaps his advisers can nudge him away from a personal account that technically he shouldn\u2019t be using, according to the same rules that he cited when he blasted Hillary Clinton for her personal email server.A longer look at his daily schedule is here:Separately, Mr. Trump\u2019s not-so-loyal opposition is pushing #MuteMonday, encouraging people to unfollow @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS, find a new leader to follow and share their choice.The bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate are scheduled to go to the White House on Monday for what is billed as a casual reception with Mr. Trump.At the inaugural luncheon after Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in on Friday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, spent a good 15 minutes yakking with Mr. Trump, apparently to express displeasure with the president\u2019s cabinet nominees, in particular Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the nominee to be secretary of health and human services.The session will be the president\u2019s first extended opportunity to look for common ground with Democrats, who have denounced his messages and policy priorities, including his executive order on Saturday to pave the way for weakening the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.He will also have a chance to discuss potential bipartisan initiatives, including his $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan.Mr. Trump has high hopes for his relationship with Capitol Hill. He declared on Friday, just minutes after being sworn in, that \u201cwe all want the same thing,\u201d regardless of political party, and, \u201cwe\u2019re going to get along.\u201dMonday\u2019s late-afternoon gathering will be a first test.Mr. Schumer is slated to be at the Monday meeting with Senators Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican; Mr. Ryan; and Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, and Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the minority whip.Notably, Mr. Trump is set to meet alone with Mr. Ryan afterward.Nominees are likely to be only one of the topics.Mr. Tillerson appears likely to win Senate confirmation, close relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and all. But senators are still wary of the Russia connections.Mr. Schumer and Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, are introducing legislation that would require a congressional vote to lift the sanctions that were imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and proxy war in that former Soviet state.The two senators will emphasize that the legislation will also cover sanctions imposed just weeks ago by Mr. Obama after intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had interfered with the 2016 election in hopes of helping elect Mr. Trump. The measure, modeled after a law that required a congressional vote on the Iran nuclear deal, is expected to have bipartisan support, as that legislation did.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Pick on Trade Could Put China in a Difficult Spot", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 As a top trade official, he limited the Japanese cars and steel coming into the United States. He halted talks with China on a deal that would encourage investment between the two countries. And he tried to give American exporters an edge with special tax breaks.It is a philosophy that he developed in the 1980s as a deputy United States trade representative and fine-tuned in the decades-long career that followed as the main trade lawyer for the American steel industry. Now he appears ready to train that focus sharply on China.\u201cIt seems clear that the U.S. manufacturing crisis is related to our trade with China,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said in testimony to a congressional commission in 2010.Over the years, Mr. Lighthizer has consistently taken the position that foreign countries are subsidizing their exporters while quietly but systematically blocking imports to protect jobs in their own countries. His answer is to pursue a long list of trade measures limiting America\u2019s imports \u2014 even if those actions may be barely permissible, if at all, under World Trade Organization rules.\u201cTo attack a problem as large as our trade deficit with China, U.S. officials must be prepared, at a minimum, to consider very aggressive positions at the W.T.O.,\u201d he said.We annotated testimony that Robert Lighthizer gave to Congress in 2010 about China, the W.T.O. and trade with the United States.The timing is bad for China.The Chinese economy is slowing despite vast amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus. Big manufacturers in most industries are struggling with overcapacity, pushing them to sell goods overseas at cut-rate, even money-losing prices, just to cover their operating costs. Mr. Lighthizer has argued for years that the United States should keep out goods made with government subsidies or sold below the full cost of making them.\u201cTrump naming him makes me worry the U.S. will carry out more rigid measures on trade and investment,\u201d said Wei Jianguo, a former vice minister of commerce.Exports are important for China. It consistently sells $4 worth of goods to the United States for each $1 of imports. That mismatch has produced a bilateral trade surplus for China equal to about 3 percent of the country\u2019s entire economy, creating tens of millions of jobs.The benefits to China from that surplus have been increasing rapidly in the past few years. Many exporters have stopped importing components and switched to increasingly capable local suppliers for everything from high-quality steel to advanced computer chips. Multinationals have moved entire supply chains to China, and transferred the technology to run them.If Mr. Trump goes even further in that direction, Mr. Lighthizer will bring a long background in such actions.When he was in the Reagan administration, Mr. Lighthizer was the deputy United States trade representative overseeing industrial policy in old-economy industries like cars and steel. Since then, Mr. Lighthizer has mainly been filing anti-subsidy and anti-dumping trade cases against imports on behalf of the American steel industry.\u201cHe\u2019s the best negotiator I\u2019ve ever worked with on policies involving trade or tax policy,\u201d said Timothy Regan, Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s chief of staff in the Reagan administration and now the senior vice president of global government affairs at Corning.Mr. Lighthizer led successful efforts in the 1980s to force Japan to accept curbs on exports of cars and steel to the United States. Both were bold moves, particularly given that President Reagan at times espoused free trade. But when the W.T.O. was created the next decade, member nations agreed, with a few exceptions, to renounce imposing such export limits on other countries.The auto industry could be ripe for action again. China is an enormous exporter of auto parts to the United States. Under President Obama, trade tensions over automotive trade have already risen, and the Obama administration has won two W.T.O. cases. The cases forced China to abandon certain anti-dumping and anti-subsidy taxes on American autos and to dismantle a few, fairly narrow subsidies.\u201cHe was squarely in the trade talks with Japan,\u201d said He Weiwen, a former commerce ministry official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, an influential Beijing research group, \u201cso maybe Donald Trump wants him to do something similar on China.\u201dThe intersection of tax and trade is a specialty of Mr. Lighthizer, who was an architect of a Reagan administration initiative to cut corporate taxes for exporters. He was previously chief of staff at the Senate Finance Committee, overseeing tax policy.In the Reagan administration, he pushed the limits of what is permissible under international trade rules. His plan allowed many American exporters to reduce their taxes by setting up overseas companies to manage their foreign sales. But the W.T.O. eventually torpedoed the effort after a challenge by the European Union in the late 1990s.Republicans now appear to be taking a similar \u2014 albeit more ambitious \u2014 tack. They are exploring how to raise corporate taxes for importers and use the extra revenue to reduce taxes for all other companies.China, as the biggest exporter to the United States, would face a major blow. But it would also affect American retailers, electronics companies and other multinationals that depend on supplies from anywhere overseas.A big obstacle for Republicans is whether the W.T.O. would declare such a tax to be a trade barrier. China and Europe effectively penalize imports by imposing a type of national sales tax, an approach the W.T.O. has approved. It is a steep 17 percent in China.But House Republicans, leery of imposing any new national taxes, want to change existing corporate tax laws instead. W.T.O. rules discourage, although they do not necessarily prohibit, modifying corporate taxes in ways that penalize imports.The W.T.O. review process, though, is lengthy. So Mr. Lighthizer and Congress could well go ahead with the tax plan, lightening the tax burden for American manufacturers as well as inflicting plenty of damage on China and the global supply chain.And the W.T.O.\u2019s response \u2014 if it found the plan invalid \u2014 would not have much heft. Mostly, the global trade group could authorize Beijing to impose trade restrictions on the United States\u2019 much smaller exports to China.That prospect does not scare Mr. Lighthizer very much, as he made clear in his 2010 testimony.\u201cW.T.O. commitments are not religious obligations,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said, and violations \u201care not subject to coercion by some W.T.O. police force.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

J.: Made in America,\u201d has found himself in dazzling company of late, thanks to the tremendous response to his documentary, which millions have seen.\u201cIf you think you\u2019re watching a film, it\u2019s a film,\u201d Mr. Meyers said. \u201cNo one\u2019s watching \u2018Dance Moms\u2019 going, \u2018Is this a movie?\u2019\u201dIn one sense, a big one, the point is moot, because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences deemed \u201cO. J.\u201d eligible. The film landed the newspaper review and theatrical release required under the academy\u2019s rules, which also demand four daily screenings. But \u201cO. J.,\u201d because of its length, was given the O.K. to screen twice a day instead.\u201cIt is not unprecedented for the academy to make special accommodations for films with long running times,\u201d a spokeswoman for the organization wrote in an email.And while the Bagger isn\u2019t putting \u201cO. J.\u201d on trial here, there is also the matter of intent.\u201cI told Connor from the start that I wouldn\u2019t make a mini-series,\u201d Mr. Edelman said. \u201cThe only reason I took this on was the challenge of making an epic film.\u201dThe result, culled from 800 hours of footage and 72 interviews, is a 7 hour 47 minute opus that wowed at its 2016 premiere at Sundance. The filmmaker Michael Moore, in an interview with the Bagger, called the work \u201cepic\u201d and \u201cbrilliant,\u201d and very much a film. He also noted that a few years ago, he successfully pushed for tighter academy rules to ensure that documentaries had proper theatrical releases.\u201cWe wanted to make sure that the system was not abused by TV networks to cop an extra gold statue,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that that\u2019s what was going on here. I don\u2019t think they begin their mornings at ESPN with: \u2018How do we get Oscars gold? I know \u2014 we need a nine-hour movie! That\u2019s it!\u2019\u201dAnother question about \u201cO. J.\u201d is whether it\u2019s fair for a work presented as a mini-series to be granted Oscar contention, and what precedent that might set. However, the film was broadcast all in one day, once, with commercials, on ESPN.Very long films have gained Oscar attention before. \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d which is more than seven hours, won best foreign-language film in 1969. \u201cLittle Dorrit,\u201d at about six hours, landed two nominations in 1989, apparently a year of great patience, for it was also when \u201cHotel Terminus,\u201d a four-and-a-half-hour film about Klaus Barbie, took home the Oscar for best documentary feature. Among the most famous Oscar snubs is Claude Lanzmann\u2019s 10-hour 1985 documentary, \u201cShoah,\u201d which didn\u2019t land a nomination.It\u2019s hard to say if any ill feelings toward Mr. Edelman\u2019s \u201cO. J.\u201d are really a thing or the product of sour grapes or whisper campaigns, which documentaries \u2014 especially those leading the race \u2014 are not immune to. \u201cI can guarantee you there is no one on that shortlist who didn\u2019t wish they\u2019d made it,\u201d said John Battsek, executive producer of the Oscar-winning nonfiction \u201cSearching for Sugar Man.\u201dMr. Kenner was evasive about whether he saw \u201cO. J.\u201d as movie or mini, but said stretching the boundaries of documentaries was a good thing: \u201cThe fact is it did qualify, and to judge it on its merits, it was a totally superior piece of work.\u201dAnd Ms. Johnson said she unequivocally saw it as a great film.\u201cA film finds its length, and if a film can earn its presence, that is what matters,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cMany subjects demand much more time than we give them to actually succeed. The directorial vision of Ezra was to understand that there is so much ignored context in the story of O. J., that the time was really needed.\u201dOf course, Mr. Edelman would much rather talk about the film itself, and the issues in it. By revealing, among other things, the ugly history between the Los Angeles Police Department and African-Americans, the documentary provided context for why Mr. Simpson\u2019s acquittal unleashed such joy among some African-Americans.\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I never understood why African-Americans responded the way they did to the verdict; now I get it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Edelman said. \u201cFor people to come away with a new perspective and a newfound understanding that they lacked before, that\u2019s not even a compliment.

But if that were not enough, she also gets an annual stipend of up to 50,000 Canadian dollars \u2014 nearly $40,000 \u2014 from her party, financed by political contributions.Personal enrichment from the handouts of wealthy donors, some of whom have paid tens of thousands of dollars to meet with her at private party fund-raisers? No conflict of interest here, according to a pair of rulings last year by the province\u2019s conflict-of-interest commissioner \u2014 whose son works for Ms. Clark.\u201cWhat it says to people is money talks and votes don\u2019t,\u201d said Dermod Travis, the executive director of IntegrityBC, a nonpartisan political watchdog group based in Victoria, the provincial capital. \u201cWhen anyone anywhere in the world can donate as much as they want to the system, you have an even bigger threat to the system.\u201dMuch of what is considered business as usual in British Columbia is illegal elsewhere in Canada. The federal government bars unions, corporations and foreigners from donating to candidates for federal office, and donations by individual citizens are limited to 1,525 Canadian dollars, about $1,150, a year. Those limits were imposed after a fund-raising scandal in the 1990s.British Columbia is not the only province to refuse to impose such tight limits, but democracy advocates say the large amounts of money flowing there are a particular cause for concern.Ms. Clark\u2019s office declined to answer specific questions about her conduct and her relationship with the conflict-of-interest commissioner and his son. Instead, British Columbia\u2019s minister of justice, Suzanne Anton, who is also its attorney general, sent a statement saying that the province\u2019s standards \u201cshould give the public confidence in the electoral system.\u201dIn an email, the B.C. Liberal Party said its leader\u2019s stipend was a longstanding tradition that previous conflict-of-interest commissioners had found acceptable.\u201cIn practice, it means that if you\u2019re part of a coterie of high-net-worth donors, your private interests get priority over what\u2019s best for the province,\u201d Mr. Eby said.In a telephone interview, Mr. Fraser rejected accusations of bias over his son\u2019s job. \u201cThe issue, I guess, is, should people\u2019s children and their career aspirations trump other considerations,\u201d he said. He added that his 2012 recusal was a special case, because his son had been in business with the premier\u2019s ex-husband.Mr. Fraser\u2019s lawyers have tried to get the case dismissed by arguing that the commissioner\u2019s opinions are immune to judicial review.Advertisement"}

Unlike the 120,000 students who had gone before them, this group had no overt need for aquatic-survival training. They all worked safely on land. What they wanted to learn was how to be leaders and to work as a team.In teaching survival skills to those who might have occasion to use them, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen residual effects along the way: improved morale, self-esteem, capabilities people didn\u2019t know they had,\u201d said Maria C. Hanna, the president of Survival Systems USA. Until recently, she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve never stopped long enough to say, \u2018You know, this is something that can appeal to a market in a different way, using the tools from aviation to help people develop themselves.\u2019 \u201dNow, Ms. Hanna is hoping to market her company\u2019s services as a team-building activity. This was the second time Survival Systems had given the new class. Since the curriculum is still being tweaked, it was offered at no cost in return for students\u2019 feedback, but soon the six-hour, one-day experience will retail for about $950 per person, a price comparable with the company\u2019s other one-day programs.The building\u2019s crown jewel is a Modular Egress Training Simulator, a plastic and metal craft that can be arranged to resemble the cockpit of almost any helicopter or small plane on the market. A purpose-built crane lifts it up and lowers it into the pool. Other equipment in the cavernous space can replicate the downwash from rescue helicopters, and generate rain, darkness, 120-mile-per-hour winds, smoke and fire.During a preliminary tour, Ms. Woods saw the simulator for the first time. \u201cI looked at it and I realized it would start filling up,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a lifeguard, I surf, so I shouldn\u2019t be scared of this but personally, water deaths are my least favorite deaths.\u201d In high school, Ms. Woods read Sebastian Junger\u2019s \u201cPerfect Storm,\u201d about the sinking of a fishing boat, and, ever since she\u2019s retained a visceral image of drowning.The instructor talked to the class about teamwork, leadership goals and safety procedures for the activities ahead. After a lunch of pizza, the students walked eagerly to the pool deck. Everyone wore flight suits, water shoes and helmets. It was dark and foggy. AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck\u201d blared and a disco ball lit the room. \u201cAll we need is a roller rink,\u201d one of the personal trainers joked.Now, the classmates jumped without hesitation from a 14-foot platform into the pool. Life vests inflated, they were given the duration of Celine Dion\u2019s \u201cMy Heart Will Go On\u201d to find a way to stay warm while floating. It turned out to be: Assume a carpet formation, arms linked, legs under the arms of the two people across from you.Taylor Cintron, 19, an economics major at UConn, was put in charge of the next task, boarding an inflated life raft. Before the last person was on, \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d started playing. Wind and water blasted the raft. Ms. Cintron yelled orders over the squall. Everyone got aboard and, after some scrambling, the life raft\u2019s tent-like roof was closed against the rain.The pop music was supposed to ease anxiety. It appeared to be working. \u201cI\u2019m less scared than I thought I was,\u201d Ms. Cintron said during a break. \u201cI hate touching people,\u201d she said, but \u201cthis is O.K., I trust everyone that I\u2019m with. It\u2019s not touching for no reason.\u201dFinally, each person was strapped into the simulator, submerged and flipped. In this exercise there are three rounds. First: You reach for the window frame, undo your seatbelt, pull yourself out and swim to the surface. Second: Add a closed window to the puzzle. (You\u2019d do the same in a submerged car, only you might need to break the window.) Third: Pretend your window is stuck and, by holding onto the seats and the console, cross to the adjacent window.An instructor is poised behind the participants the entire time, ready to whisk them to the surface if anything goes wrong. Though no one has drowned during the training, the primordial fear remains.\u201cLast time I took my staff here, two or three backed out,\u201d said Greg Drab, 40, the owner of Advantage Personal Training of Mystic, Conn., which had sent the four trainers to the class. \u201cAfter the second exercise, a couple people had hit their threshold.\u201dIf Mr. Drab had been paying retail, this would be more expensive than the $50 ropes course he\u2019d done with employees in the past, but even at $950, he said it would be worth it. \u201cYou get to see how people handle stressful situations,\u201d Mr. Drab said. \u201cThis unifies the team.\u201dEveryone in that Saturday\u2019s class escaped the simulator successfully, but it took Ms. Woods longer than she would have liked. Standing by the pool, still dripping, she said she felt \u201ca little more at ease with my whole fear. I know as long as you follow the procedures there\u2019s nothing to worry about. In every situation there\u2019s a moment of panic and you have to squash it.\u201dMr. Rosenberg said he distinguishes \u201cteam-bonding\u201d activities from those with \u201cdeep learning or cultural transformation\u201d as their goal. In a team-bonding experience, he said, like the Survival Systems\u2019 class, participants \u201covercome self-imposed limitations\u201d and learn trust, communication and leadership, but they don\u2019t re-enact and critique workplace dynamics as they would in the more interpersonal \u201cdeep-learning\u201d exercises. Team Builders Plus offers both.Mr. Rosenberg said survival-skills classes appeal to some more than others. \u201cThere are specific types of groups that like high-risk activities,\u201d he said, citing lawyers and people in sales, public relations or marketing. Those in social work, nursing, finance or engineering, he said, might not be as keen to face the fear of drowning.\u201cI would think this is a very millennial experience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t appeal to everyone, but for the people who match that demographic, they\u2019re going to have a blast.\u201dLearn the strategies that chief executives have developed to help you go beyond the polished r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and scripted answers to hire more creative and effective members for your team.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article described incorrectly the type of exercise being performed.

She has long been an outspoken foe of abortion, and she could become the first sitting White House official to address the annual march in person, though both Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have been invited.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible gesture for pro-life Americans,\u201d said Marilyn Musgrave, a Republican former congresswoman from Colorado, now the top lobbyist for Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group here. Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said of Ms. Conway: \u201cShe\u2019s one of us.\u201dThis will be the 44th year of the march, which organizers say is typically attended by tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists. The annual event, often held on Jan. 22 but pushed back to Jan. 27 this year because of the inaugural, marks the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision establishing a national right to abortion.Neither Ms. Conway nor Trump transition officials responded to requests for comment on Wednesday. But Jeanne Mancini, the March for Life president, hinted in an interview Wednesday that Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence, or both, might attend.\u201cStay tuned,\u201d she said.No president or vice president has attended the march, though Ronald Reagan sent a video in 1988, and George W. Bush addressed marchers from the East Room of the White House in 2008.\u201cI don\u2019t think it can be underestimated how significant her presence on the Trump campaign was in terms of motivating and mobilizing the pro-life vote,\u201d said Charmaine Yoest, a longtime anti-abortion advocate here, in an interview.\u201cIt\u2019s a great time to be pro-life,\u201d Ms. Musgrave said.Ms. Conway will not be the only speaker. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, archbishop of New York, is also scheduled to attend, as is Benjamin Watson, a tight end for the Baltimore Ravens, Karyme Lozano, a Mexican TV star and Abby Johnson, a former clinic director at Planned Parenthood who later became an anti-abortion activist.But, short of Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence, Ms. Conway is the march\u2019s biggest \u201cget.\u201d She is a well-known figure here in Washington who tends to arouse the ire of liberal women who consider themselves feminists \u2014 and has been caricatured on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 which is one reason anti-abortion women like Ms. Yoest find her both sympathetic and effective.At the time, Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, was promising a \u201cpro-life presidency.\u201d But in 1994, while running for Senate, he said he thought abortion should be \u201csafe and legal,\u201d and in 2002, as a candidate for governor, he had sought the backing of abortion rights advocates.

He added that the institute was seeking to build the islands in what would be a nautical version of a special economic zone and that it would showcase innovations in solar power, sustainable aquaculture and ocean-based wind farms.But the project also appears to show how the acceleration of climate change has prompted technology entrepreneurs to devise innovative solutions to climate-related problems like rising sea levels.\u201cThe oceans are the most ignored part of the planet, so I\u2019m excited by the possibilities which will emerge when you get some of Silicon Valley\u2019s more adventurous souls focusing on the sustainable use of our coastal and marine areas,\u201d Lelei LeLaulu, a development entrepreneur from Samoa who specializes in the Pacific Islands and advises the International Finance Corporation on sustainable business, said in an email from French Polynesia.But the project has critics in French Polynesia and beyond.Mr. Hencken said that he expected the project to eventually include dozens of artificial islands and that similar projects could someday be built in other atoll nations or coastal areas threatened by rising sea levels. He added that the cost of housing would decrease as the so-called island platforms became cheaper to manufacture.\u201cI certainly don\u2019t think this is a project that is exclusively for the wealthy,\u201d he said, adding that his background was in social justice activism.But experts familiar with climate change and the South Pacific said they doubted the project would be feasible on a wide scale in a region with some of the world\u2019s poorest countries. They also wondered whether the money could be better spent on education or health care.\u201cThere is a tendency for very technologically focused solutions to the challenges in the Pacific without any real input from the Pacific Islanders themselves,\u201d he added.But he said the project reflected a cruel reality: The developed world is both responsible for climate change and better able to cope with it.The French Polynesia project would effectively be a \u201ccruise ship,\u201d Professor Donner said. \u201cMeanwhile, the other actual islands in the Pacific are stuck with the impacts of climate change.\u201dMr. Hencken disputed that assessment, saying it was unfair to compare his initiative with traditional aid projects.\u201cWe\u2019re not taking French Polynesia\u2019s money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re investing our own money with the hopes of making a direct and indirect benefit to our host.\u201dThe French Foreign Ministry did not respond to an emailed request for comment on the Seasteading Institute\u2019s plan.In an interview with The New York Times last year, Kiribati\u2019s president at the time, Anote Tong, said he had commissioned experts from the government of the United Arab Emirates to study the feasibility of artificially raising Kiribati\u2019s islands as a climate adaptation strategy. But he declined to provide specifics, and subsequent attempts to reach officials in Kiribati and the United Arab Emirates for details were unsuccessful.Mr. Olthuis said that the technical challenges of artificial island construction could be resolved and that he hoped the French Polynesia project would succeed. But it was still an open question, he added, what the ultimate goal or scale of such projects should be.\u201cWhat do we want to save? How much money do we want to spend on it, and what does it bring for those people?\u201d he said. \u201cWith billions, you can save 300,000 people.

{"Headline": "Samsung Heir Faces Arrest on Charges of Bribing South Korea\u2019s President", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The sprawling investigation into President Park Geun-hye of South Korea took a dramatic turn on Monday with word that prosecutors were seeking the arrest of the de facto head of Samsung, one of the world\u2019s largest conglomerates, on charges that he bribed the president and her secretive confidante.Mr. Lee is accused of instructing Samsung subsidiaries to make payments totaling 43 billion won ($36 million) to the family of Ms. Park\u2019s confidante, Choi Soon-sil, and to two foundations that Ms. Choi controlled, in exchange for help from Ms. Park in facilitating a father-to-son transfer of ownership control of Samsung.The special prosecutor, Park Young-soo, said that the money represented bribes from Samsung, and that Mr. Lee embezzled some of the money from his companies. Mr. Park said he had asked a Seoul court to issue an arrest warrant for Mr. Lee; it usually takes a few days for a court to decide whether to grant such a warrant.\u201cWe have enough evidence to establish President Park and Choi Soon-sil as co-conspirators sharing profits\u201d in the bribery scheme, Lee Kyu-chul, a spokesman of the special prosecutor, said during a news briefing on Monday.If Mr. Lee is arrested, it will be a milestone in South Korea\u2019s efforts to fight corruption involving the country\u2019s powerful family-controlled conglomerates, known as chaebol. It could also disrupt Mr. Lee\u2019s efforts to inherit management control of Samsung, whose tentacles in consumer electronics, shipbuilding and a range of other industries reach throughout South Korea\u2019s economy.Although Samsung has often been investigated on corruption allegations, neither Mr. Lee nor his father has spent time in jail. The elder Mr. Lee was convicted of bribery in 1996, and of tax evasion and breach of trust in 2009, but in each case, he was not arrested, and his prison terms were suspended. Each time, his criminal record was later erased in presidential pardons, and he soon returned to Samsung\u2019s leadership.The South Korean government and the judiciary have been similarly lenient toward other business tycoons convicted of white-collar crimes, deepening public mistrust of the justice system and raising doubts among foreign investors who want tighter corporate governance in South Korea.Corruption scandals in the chaebol often stem from maneuvers to transfer wealth control from one generation of the dominant family to the next, and the trouble at Samsung is no exception.The special prosecutor said that Mr. Moon acted on behalf of Ms. Park.The national pension fund\u2019s support was crucial for the merger, which analysts said helped Mr. Lee inherit control of Samsung from his father. Elliott Management, an American activist hedge fund, and other investors in Samsung had campaigned to block the merger, saying that it wronged minority shareholders by grossly undervaluing the shares of one of the two Samsung companies, Samsung C&T.Samsung issued a statement on Monday denying that it paid bribes or made \u201cimproper requests related to the merger of Samsung affiliates or the leadership transition.\u201dAllegations that Ms. Park helped Ms. Choi extort millions in bribes from Samsung and other companies are at the heart of the corruption scandal that led to the impeachment vote. Ms. Park\u2019s powers have been suspended while the Constitutional Court decides whether to end her presidency.Mr. Lee testified at a National Assembly hearing last month that he was not involved in the decision by Samsung to make the payments. He also said that they were not voluntary donations, suggesting that the company was a victim of extortion, not a participant in bribery.But the special prosecutor\u2019s team accused Mr. Lee on Monday of perjuring himself during the parliamentary hearing. The prosecutors said they had evidence that Mr. Lee personally ordered the payments after receiving a request from Ms. Park.Some conservative South Koreans, as well as some pro-business newspaper editorials, have warned that an arrest of Mr. Lee could hurt the national economy by disrupting Samsung\u2019s management. Lee Kyu-chul, the special prosecutor\u2019s spokesman, responded, \u201cWe determined that establishing justice is far more important.\u201dDespite the case\u2019s high profile, its impact on Samsung\u2019s day-to-day operations will probably be subdued at first, according to analysts. Samsung Electronics, which makes microchips, screens and smartphones, is run by professional managers who are used to operating on their own without Mr. Lee\u2019s direct involvement.Still, Mark Newman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, a research and brokerage firm, said that Mr. Lee\u2019s legal issues could ultimately slow down larger strategic decisions at Samsung.\u201cBig things, like restructuring or a new big multibillion-dollar investment, things like that might be tricky for him to get to,\u201d he said.He likened the company\u2019s clout to that of large, organized special interests in Washington.\u201cIn the U.S., there are a lot of powerful lobbies, like the gun lobby, but in Korea the equivalent is the Samsung lobby or the Hyundai lobby,\u201d Mr. Newman said. \u201cThey\u2019re very powerful, but they\u2019re being found out.\u201dPaul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

(For the most recent quiz, Finra surveyed a representative sample of more than 27,000 Americans nationwide from June through October 2015. The margin of error was estimated at 0.5 percent.)And we are not talking advanced calculus here. A representative question? \u201cSuppose you have $100 in a saving account earning 2 percent interest a year. After five years, how much would you have? More than $102? Exactly $102? Less than $102?\u201d To get it right, you don\u2019t have to know how much money you would have, just that it would be more than $102.Also, on a personal level, I know personal finance education works. Of my four children, only our daughter took a personal finance course. She did it in college to satisfy her math requirement, and she is far better with money than her equally smart brothers.Given how strongly I feel about this, I am delighted by the new finance book \u201cMake Your Kid a Money Genius (Even if You\u2019re Not)\u201d by Beth Kobliner (Simon & Schuster, $19.95). It\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction. Ms. Kobliner, a former staff writer for Money who wrote \u201cGet a Financial Life,\u201d aimed at millennials, has produced another engaging book.It helps that she shares personal stories, like this: \u201cWhen my son was in preschool and we had a playdate with twins who lived nearby, I was impressed that they knew the difference between a penny, a nickel, a dime and a quarter. And I felt sort of embarrassed \u2014 me, the money writer \u2014 that I hadn\u2019t taught my little guy.\u201dHer tone is supportive throughout. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a perfect investor to be a good investor,\u201d she writes. And: \u201cUnderstand your own financial baggage and leave it behind.\u201dThe book\u2019s organizing principle is just fine. Ms. Kobliner selects a topic (what to tell your children about debt, for example) and suggests age-appropriate advice.When they are in preschool, she says, help them understand that credit cards are not a magic wand. \u201cBuying stuff costs money whether you use cash\u201d or charge it, she writes.By the time they are in middle or high school, it\u2019s time to go much deeper: Explain the high interest rates that credit cards charge and why it is imperative to pay off your balance each month.But I have two reservations.First, the book seems padded. I am not sure it needed separate chapters on insurance, the need to work hard and \u201cgiving back.\u201d Together, the three take up more than 20 percent of the book.Second, some of the advice seems off base or vague.For example, in talking about the importance of delayed gratification, Ms. Kobliner writes, \u201cTeaching your kid to focus on the long-term payoff doesn\u2019t take nearly as much effort as it sounds.\u201d To which I can only respond, \u201cHave you ever taken a 5-year-old down a supermarket\u2019s cereal aisle?\u201dAdvice like, \u201cInvest a little \u2014 but not too much \u2014 in bonds\u201d is not specific enough. How much is too much?Ms. Kobliner gives lots of good prescriptions: Diversify; don\u2019t trust stock tips; use index funds. But while rules of thumb are helpful, my children always learned better when the examples were vivid and they knew the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the answer.Like when discussing why you want to invest in mutual funds with low fees, she writes: \u201cSay you put $1,000 into a fund with an expense ratio of 1.5 percent, and at the same time you put another into a fund charging just 0.2 percent. If they both earn 7 percent a year, after 30 years, the first fund would have accumulated $4,984, and the second would have $7,197.\u201dThat\u2019s fine. But the numbers are rather small and the conclusion is not memorable. So instead, I wish she had written something like this: \u201cAs you may expect, fees and expenses vary from fund to fund. A fund with high costs must perform better than a low-cost fund to generate the same returns for you. Even small differences in fees can translate into large differences in returns over time. For example, if you invested $10,000 in a fund that produced a 10 percent annual return before expenses and had annual operating expenses of 1.5 percent, then after 20 years you would have roughly $49,725. But if the fund had expenses of only 0.5 percent, then you would end up with $60,858.\u201dYet Ms. Kobliner\u2019s new book is worth reading. It\u2019s a good base for building financial literacy. Simply helping children learn personal finance basics will benefit them in the long term. Living within their means and saving for retirement as early as possible will give them a running start.And if the book makes you stop periodically to reconsider your own spending and saving habits, or helps you find a good answer when your child asks about money, that\u2019s good, too. Ms. Kobliner\u2019s book won\u2019t make anyone a financial genius. But it may lay a solid foundation.Advertisement"}

Seared into our consciousness is the man who battled Southern segregation.We see him standing before hundreds of thousands of followers in the nation\u2019s capital in 1963, proclaiming his dream for racial harmony. We see him marching, arms locked with fellow protesters, through the battleground of Alabama in 1965.But on the 50th anniversary of his death, it is worth noting how his message and his priorities had evolved by the time he was shot on that balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis in 1968. Dr. King was confronting many challenges that remain with us today.He was battling racism in the North then, not just in the South. He was pushing the government to address poverty, income inequality, structural racism and segregation in cities like Boston and Chicago. He was also calling for an end to a war that was draining the national treasury of funds needed to finance a progressive domestic agenda.This may not be the Dr. King that many remember. Yet, his words resonate powerfully \u2013 and, perhaps, uncomfortably \u2013 today in a country that remains deeply divided on issues of race and class._________2. Protesting Injustice in Our WorldDo you have to be disobedient if you want justice? How would your students answer?\u2026 We returned to King\u2019s letter, in which he draws a distinction between just and unjust laws. They didn\u2019t know about this King, I found, the one who fought the law. In their view, the civil rights movement was embodied in King the Christlike leader, who stands for peace, love and brotherhood.I told the students that King went to jail a lot for peace, love and brotherhood.We talked about Baltimore, where the police had just killed Freddie Gray and street protests were swelling to an uprising. My students were skeptical of headlines and commentary that called for nonviolent protest. One of the students noted that the police were violent, too, and they were placing people in mortal danger just to protect some buildings from being damaged.\u201cA building is not more valuable than a person,\u201d she said. Most of the others nodded in agreement. More began to speak. The rote discussion was becoming impassioned, cacophonous:\u201cBut there\u2019s a difference between rioting and peaceful protest. \u2026\u201d\u201cAre we saying property is more valuable than a human being?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s like saying to protest is unlawful. \u2026\u201d\u201cWhat does \u2018peaceful\u2019 even mean?\u201dThe Republican Party will soon control the presidency, Congress, most governorships and state legislatures; in all probability, there will be a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Given Donald J. Trump\u2019s approval of advisers from the white nationalist far right, following his vitriolic attacks on the policies of the Obama administration, Democrats, independents and even some Republicans are bracing for assaults on \u2014 everything.\u2026 Protests can change policies, however \u2014 and often have. In other countries and throughout American history, ordinary citizens banding together have triumphed over governments, even when a single party holds sweeping control. Many of those protests used resources that the opposition to President-elect Trump enjoys today. They can learn from how those victories were won.In this season of political polarization, it is tempting to hope that we can unite in celebration of Dr. King. But celebrators ought to know whom they are honoring. Dr. King died for striking garbage workers and beseeched his government to protect the vulnerable. He had a message for those who would target immigrants or wall off America from the world. In a 1967 speech, he declared: \u201cOur loyalties must become ecumenical rather than national.\u201d Instead of policing their borders, nations should \u201cdevelop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole.\u201dThe alternative was unacceptable. \u201cHistory is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path of hate.\u201d To honor Dr. King is to follow a different path.Have your students read any or all of these pieces and discuss the role of protest in America in the past and today. What lessons might movements of the past offer us now? How?_________3. A Day of ServiceThe Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service, signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994, challenges Americans to make the holiday into a day of active volunteer service to honor Dr. King._________4. \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019Invite your students to watch Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Why is it still so powerful over 50 years later?_________5. Songs in CelebrationLet us turn our thoughts today to Martin Luther Kingand recognize that there are ties between us, all men and women living on the Earth.Ties of hope and love, sister and brotherhood, that we are bound togetherin our desire to see the world become a place in which our children can grow free and strong.We are bound together by the task that stands before us and the road that lies ahead.We are bound and we are bound.______________________________________________________________Video | March on Washington 2013 Speeches_______________________________Times Topics | Martin Luther King, Jr._______________________________From the Library of CongressHonoring Our History Through Artwork: MLK Jr. in Primary Sources Looking Behind the March on Washington: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Civil Rights Movement and Labor in Primary Sources Teaching Selma: A Civil Rights Struggle Captured in Primary SourcesFrom around the webDay of National Service \u2014 MLKDAY.govThe Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social ChangeThe Constitution Center: The Story of Martin Luther King Jr. Day \u2014 A Legacy of Service MLK Jr. National Historic Site, Georgia.

Ms. Ley also said that the Finance Department would review her travel records.Ms. Ley\u2019s district is in the south of New South Wales, and she owns a home there, in the city of Albury. The property she purchased while on ministerial business in Brisbane, Queensland, was bought for nearly $600,000 in May 2015. It is an apartment on the northern reaches of the Gold Coast and has ocean views.Ms. Ley said that it was a snap decision to buy the property, one she is unlikely to live in, and she apologized for an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d in charging taxpayers for the trip, which cost the public almost $3,000.The news comes as property prices are rising in many parts of Australia and young people are struggling to afford homes. Kristina Keneally, a former leader of the state of New South Wales, said on Twitter that while a bag of candy might qualify as an unexpected purchase, an investment property would not.The apartment was sold in 2002 for about $330,000 and was worth more than $600,000 four years later. Tourism, a lower Australian dollar and interest from foreign buyers have kept the Gold Coast property market buoyant, said Pete Wargent, a property analyst with AllenWargent Property Buyers.Ms. Ley said she was confident she had not broken rules on the use of taxpayer funds. She said attending an auction to buy the property was not the reason for the trip to Queensland, where she had made an announcement about new medicines available to treat breast cancer and met with patients in Brisbane and on the Gold Coast.\u201cI have spoken to the prime minister, and this claim does not meet the high standards he expects of ministers,\u201d she said, referring to the claim she submitted for expenses on the trip. \u201cI apologize for the error of judgment.\u201dMs. Ley said that she would repay two other claims for accommodation on the Gold Coast. Expenses incurred for a flight from the Gold Coast to Canberra, Australia\u2019s capital, will also be reviewed.Australia\u2019s Parliament is on summer recess until Feb. 7. Mr. Turnbull is expected to come under pressure to review his cabinet soon after lawmakers return. He narrowly won a July election, holding the government with a one-seat majority in the lower house, and has struggled to gain traction with policy proposals.His treasurer, Scott Morrison, delivered a midyear budget in December that was widely embraced. But broader issues, including tax policy and a vote for a plebiscite on gay marriage, have either moved slowly or been voted down, leading to the government\u2019s poor polling among voters.The government also faced criticism before Christmas over letters sent to welfare recipients who may have been inadvertently overpaid. The letters, automatically generated by Australia\u2019s Taxation Office, sometimes overstated the debt owed or were sent to people who owed no money.\u201cHe has trouble getting policy through his own party,\u201d said Mr. Wanna, the political analyst. He added that a culture of entitlement and a view that \u201cquite a few politicians are mean\u201d would not engender them to voters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pressure Builds for Modi to Overhaul Indian Campaign Finance", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byThe lack of transparency in Indian election financing is well known, but the report by the nonprofit, the Association for Democratic Reforms, quantifies it for the first time.Many experts say they believe that Mr. Modi\u2019s cash ban, or demonetization, will have little impact in the long term in reducing undisclosed money unless he pushes through other key changes, including ones to campaign finance.\u201cDemonetization is like a spring cleaning exercise,\u201d said Jagdeep Chhokar, a founding member of the association. \u201cFrom the next day, the muck starts collecting again. It may have cleaned out some black money, but nothing is done so far to slow down the generation of black money.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s given the first big shock to the system, but he would need a set of reforms, including campaign finance, if he wants to take this logistically to the next level,\u201d said Harsh Pant, head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation, a nonprofit in New Delhi.But Mr. Pant said Mr. Modi would take on a campaign finance overhaul only if he emerged strengthened from coming state elections, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s largest state.\u201cIf the U.P. election goes poorly for the B.J.P., Modi\u2019s political capital goes down,\u201d Mr. Pant said. \u201cBut if he wins, that gives him the mandate to carry forward the struggle against black money.\u201dThe Association for Democratic Reforms released its report just days before the start of elections on Feb. 4 in several states, including Uttar Pradesh.Mr. Chhokar said the report had been prepared by comparing the income tax reports of India\u2019s political parties with the contributions they reported to the Election Commission of India. This revealed that the parties together reported collecting 113 billion rupees, nearly $1.7 billion, but disclosed the sources of only 31 percent of the money to the Election Commission. Indian law does not require reporting the sources of contributions under 20,000 rupees, or about $300.From 2004 to 2015, 83 percent of the 33 billion rupees in total income reported by the Indian National Congress party came from undisclosed sources. Sixty-five percent of the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s income of about 21 billion rupees came from undisclosed sources in the same time period.Mr. Chhokar said the reported income, although substantial, represented only \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d of money spent on elections. The parties often do not report cash taken in or spent, he said.Forcing parties to disclose the source of smaller contributions would require parliamentary approval.An article in some editions on Jan. 26 about a report by a New Delhi nonprofit organization on the lack of transparency in India\u2019s political financing misstated, at one point, the percentage of contributions to the country\u2019s political parties in which the source was disclosed to the Election Commission. As noted correctly elsewhere in the article, it was 31 percent, not 69 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modi\u2019s Cash Ban Brings Pain, but Corruption-Weary India Grits Its Teeth", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire.But despite those concerns, as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do, for the moment, at least, Mr. Modi\u2019s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena.Even as the poorest Indians have struggled, many have continued to voice support for the prime minister\u2019s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money, known as \u201cblack money,\u201d flowing through the country\u2019s economy, in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr. Modi, analysts say, has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government.\u201cEven though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family, I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country,\u201d said Hem Raj Chechi, 39, a taxi driver in New Delhi, the capital, who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced.Mr. Chechi has not been able to pay his children\u2019s school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months. But, he said, \u201cWe need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me.\u201dMr. Modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in New Delhi, bring jobs and fight corruption. Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption, widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless.Declaring war on corruption, Mr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that 500 and 1,000 rupee bills, worth about $8 and $15, would be banned the next morning.With the currency ban, Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side. He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the long-term good.That frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many Americans to vote for President-elect Donald J. Trump last year, said Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University who is a native of India.\u201cTrump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system,\u201d Mr. Prasad said in an interview. \u201cModi, in the same way, did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can\u2019t tackle deep-rooted problems like corruption. We needed big and painful changes, really disruptive ones.\u201dMr. Modi appeared on television on New Year\u2019s Eve to tell Indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation.He compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, a battle of good versus evil. \u201cToday Mahatma Gandhi is not among us, but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate,\u201d Mr. Modi said, using the honorific for Gandhi.\u201cAs we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha,\u201d he said, referring to Gandhi\u2019s nonviolent resistance movement, \u201clet us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness.\u201dMr. Modi was presiding over one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes, which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit crazy,\u201d said Geng Xiao, a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cWhen I first read the news, I couldn\u2019t even figure out if it was true.\u201dThe government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency \u2014 more than 250,000 rupees, or about $3,670, could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it. Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless.Whether Mr. Modi\u2019s far-reaching move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate. Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy.But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption, even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones.And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it, which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term, economists say. People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard, their diets and livelihoods severely affected.Many in India see Mr. Modi, who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified goods-and-services tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines, as living up to his promise to be a reformer of India\u2019s ossified and bureaucratic economy.But in the process, he has placed the Indian economy and his political future at risk. Many economists believe that the Indian economy will take at least a short-term hit because of a dire shortage of cash, and that the future impact is uncertain. If the effects are prolonged, the public support for Modi could wane.\u201cIf this move damages the economy, he\u2019s in for a rough ride,\u201d said Harsh Pant, the head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank.Mr. Xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial, the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out. \u201cYou need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing,\u201d he said.Mr. Modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014, defeating the government, led by the Indian National Congress party, that had ruled for most of the country\u2019s post-independent life, on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption.\u201cIn 2014, he had presented himself as the big disrupter,\u201d Mr. Pant said. \u201cHe was the precursor to what\u2019s happening in the West.\u201dMr. Modi was then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, where he had a reputation for tearing away the country\u2019s red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand.But during his first two years after winning national election, Mr. Modi, whose party did not control the upper house of Parliament, struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul.Mr. Modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get Parliament to clear the way for the simplified goods-and-services tax.He cast the opposition as \u201cpeople who don\u2019t want change, who don\u2019t want reform,\u201d Mr. Pant said, forcing them in August to support the changes.But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable. Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place, the currency shortage remains acute, leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings, many providers said.Nagender Tiwari, 42, a rickshaw driver in East Delhi, said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1,000 rupees, or about $15, that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result, his family, which includes two children in 11th grade, has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home, he said.He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption, noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes.\u201cSo if bribery is not stopped, how can black money be stopped?\u201d he asked.Raj Kumar Bindal, 65, a paper trader in New Delhi, said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before.\u201cWe can\u2019t shift to a cashless mode overnight,\u201d he said.Surjit Bhalla, a New Delhi-based economic adviser for the Observatory Group in New York, said he believed Mr. Modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months, possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax.India needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat, Mr. Bhalla said. In the United States, for every $100 collected in income tax, an estimated $20 owed is not paid, he added. In India, for that same $100 in taxes paid, $200 more is owed, he said.Collectively, the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform India, Mr. Pant and others said.But doing so depends on Mr. Modi\u2019s continuing to command the political narrative of the country, as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban.\u201cSo far, he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him,\u201d Mr. Pant said. \u201cHe thinks he can continue to do it, but we really don\u2019t know. There are so many unknowns.\u201dHari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rockefeller Foundation Picks Rajiv J. Shah, a Trustee, as President", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byHe got the job. On Thursday, the Rockefeller Foundation, one of the country\u2019s largest and most influential philanthropies, will name Mr. Shah to succeed Judith Rodin, who has been president for 12 years.The appointment will make Mr. Shah one of the most powerful forces in charitable giving, overseeing a foundation that donates roughly $200 million each year and corrals governments, companies and organizations to contribute money and resources in tandem.Mr. Shah, 43, will be the first Indian-American to lead the Rockefeller Foundation, which has gained stature in recent years through some prominent projects but has sometimes been criticized as being more interested in its publicity than its grantees.Founded in 1913 by the oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, the foundation says it has given away the equivalent of more than $17 billion in today\u2019s dollars. Its first grant was to the American Red Cross, and it went on to play pivotal roles in establishing the field of public health, creating vaccines for yellow fever and malaria, and bringing agricultural advances to the developing world.These efforts have struck critics as public relations stunts more than meaningful agents of change. And Ms. Rodin has drawn fire for spending too much time with corporate partners and not enough time with the recipients of grants.Much of the foundation\u2019s work concerns improving health and well-being in Africa, aiding economic development in impoverished areas and developing strategies to combat climate change.It was these diverse causes that attracted Mr. Shah to the job. With advanced degrees in medicine and health finance from the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Shah worked at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for nearly a decade, rising to be director for agricultural development.In those roles, Mr. Shah said, he came to understand the power of public-private partnerships, a strategy that Ms. Rodin has embraced at the Rockefeller Foundation.\u201cI\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible when people come together,\u201d he said in an interview this week. \u201cWe were able to save tens of thousands, if not millions, of lives.\u201dMs. Rodin was not involved in the search for her successor but has known Mr. Shah for years. They worked together on an agricultural project when he was at the Gates Foundation, and he joined the Rockefeller Foundation board in 2015.\u201cHe\u2019s a marvel,\u201d Ms. Rodin said in an interview this week. \u201cHe\u2019s very strategic and very innovative. He shows an interpersonal dexterity that is well beyond his years.\u201dMs. Rodin said she believed that Mr. Shah was a good fit for the job thanks in part to his time at U.S.A.I.D., which required that he forge alliances with a vast array of governments, organizations and companies.\u201cOne of the things we tried to emphasize during my time at Rockefeller was broadening the scope of partnerships,\u201d Ms. Rodin said. \u201cWe see in Raj someone who has the capacity to take advantage of this, and has the capacity to be a great partner.\u201dRichard Parsons, the chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation board, said Mr. Shah was the unanimous choice of the search committee after a competitive process that considered hundreds of candidates.\u201cRaj is the perfect guy to come in after her,\u201d Mr. Parsons said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s a performer. You put him up in front of a group and people come away impressed. Now, he\u2019s got a platform.\u201dMr. Shah said he was committed to the broad themes of resilience and inclusive economies.But he said he would look for opportunities to address schisms in the American electorate in this divisive political moment.\u201cIt is a different time today than it was 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live in a more fractured world.\u201dThe Rockefeller Foundation is viewed by some has having a liberal bent. During Ms. Rodin\u2019s tenure, the foundation donated money to the Clinton Foundation.Mr. Shah is close with President Obama but said he maintained good relations with Republicans in the House and Senate and believed that the foundation\u2019s core mission had bipartisan appeal.\u201cIt\u2019s widely acknowledged that tackling hunger and ensuring health around the globe are in our own national interest,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cI have always been passionate about delivering social justice results at a massive scale.\u201dHe will now have a $200 million a year to try to deliver those results.An earlier version of this article misidentified an entity that led a push to divest stock holdings from fossil fuel companies. That entity is the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, not the Rockefeller Foundation.An article on Thursday about the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s naming Rajiv Shah as its new president, using information from the organization, erroneously attributed a distinction to him. At age 43, Mr. Shah is one of the youngest people to lead the foundation, not the youngest. (At least two of his predecessors were younger.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Massad Resigns as Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Timothy G. Massad, the top United States derivatives regulator, said on Tuesday that he would step down as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when Donald J. Trump becomes president on Jan. 20.Mr. Massad is the latest Obama administration financial supervisor to announce a departure. Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees investor protection and financial markets, said in November that she planned to leave when the Obama administration ends.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission also have unfilled seats, which will give the Trump administration a large role in shaping the oversight of financial markets.\u201cThere\u2019s this unprecedented amount of power that the president will have to set the course at these two agencies, given the number of vacancies,\u201d said Thaya Brook Knight, associate director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute.Mr. Massad has been chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission since June 2014. Earlier, he had been a senior Treasury Department official under President Obama and had overseen the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the bank bailout. Before entering government service, he was a partner at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission indicated on Tuesday that Mr. Massad would stay as a commissioner for \u201ca few weeks\u201d after resigning as chairman to close his office. His term was scheduled to end in April.\u201cI came to the C.F.T.C. with a number of priorities, and I am proud we have made significant progress in every area,\u201d Mr. Massad said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe have largely finished implementing the regulatory framework for swaps, and have concentrated on the areas posing the greatest risk to the financial system.\u201dBut the agency did not complete at least one closely watched rule governing the trading of commodities. It proposed what was known as the position limits rule last month for the third time since 2011. The commissioners \u201cdid not wish to adopt a rule that the C.F.T.C. would choose not to implement or defend in the future,\u201d the agency said Tuesday in the news release.The 700-person agency has also struggled at times, as a result of what its supporters have said is a chronic lack of financing. The trading commission\u2019s $250 million budget is under congressional control.\u201cWhile our progress has been significant, the agency does not have the resources necessary to adequately oversee these markets in the way that the public deserves,\u201d Mr. Massad told a Senate panel in April.The five-member commission has two vacancies, and Mr. Massad\u2019s departure will leave it with just two members: Sharon Y. Bowen, a securities lawyer named to fill an empty Democratic seat in 2014, and J. Christopher Giancarlo, the lone Republican on the panel. (The five-member Securities and Exchange Commission has just three commissioners including the departing chairwoman.)\u201cChairman Massad inherited an agency still dealing with the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, and his tireless work helped bring confidence back to the markets,\u201d Ms. Bowen said in a statement.Mr. Giancarlo is expected to lead the agency, at least in the interim. Mr. Trump has not yet indicated his choice for the job.In the meantime, Mr. Giancarlo may shift the agency\u2019s agenda as chairman. He has criticized how certain swaps rules were carried out and has argued that agency is \u201cstuck in a 20th-century time warp,\u201d unable to keep pace with financial technology innovations.Mr. Giancarlo has also said that rules put in place after the crisis contributed to a reduction in market liquidity, or the ability to quickly make trades, and he has argued that the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of regulators led by the Treasury secretary, has not studied the issue closely enough. The leader of the C.F.T.C. is a voting member on the council.Advertisement"}

After a lifetime of obscurity creating vehicles for other companies, the bespectacled engineer is betting that the rise of electric cars will propel his company \u2014 and his country \u2014 into the automotive spotlight.\u201cTraditional auto manufacturers are constrained by their old models,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can see things with fresh eyes.\u201dAcross China, government officials, corporate executives, private investors and newcomers like Mr. Lu are in a headlong rush to develop a domestic electric car industry. The country\u2019s goal, like Mr. Lu\u2019s, is to capitalize on the transition to electric to turbocharge the country\u2019s lagging automobile sector to become a major competitor to the United States, Japan and Germany.That has been a goal of China\u2019s industrial planners for decades, as the government has lavished resources on building homegrown automakers and discriminated against foreign players.But so far, that effort has failed.Local manufacturers have lacked the brands, technology and managerial heft to outmaneuver their established rivals, either at home or abroad. Chinese consumers have preferred more reliable Buicks, Volkswagens and Toyotas to the often substandard offerings from domestic manufacturers, while little-known Chinese models have struggled to gain traction overseas.Electric vehicles could offer a second chance \u2014 one China\u2019s policy makers do not intend to miss.This time, China\u2019s carmakers may be better positioned. Since electric vehicles are a relatively new business for all players, Chinese manufacturers and international rivals are largely starting from the same point.\u201cThere is a smaller gap between where China is today and the rest of the world\u201d in electric cars, said Bill Russo, managing director at Gao Feng Advisory, a Shanghai consultancy, and a former Chrysler executive. \u201cThere is room for newer start-up companies to dream big in China.\u201dMr. Lu is one of those dreamers.Fascinated by cars since he was a boy, he studied automotive engineering at Beijing\u2019s prestigious Tsinghua University. Upon graduating in 1990, he joined the research and development team at the China-based joint venture of Jeep, then a division of Chrysler.During his time there, which included two years in Detroit, Mr. Lu came to feel such overseas operations had limited prospects in China \u2014 the ventures\u2019 partners would try to balance their interests, and so were slow to develop strategies and make decisions.So in 2003, he and nine colleagues started CH-Auto Technology Corporation as a specialty research and design shop for the local car industry. Since then, the firm has designed vehicles for some of China\u2019s biggest automakers.Mr. Lu decided to start manufacturing his own vehicles because of the shift to electric. Since producing electric cars requires new parts and technologies, he believed a small entrant could better compete with these new vehicles than traditional automakers.\u201cElectric vehicles won\u2019t just replace cars with conventional engines, but they will bring a huge change to the entire car industry,\u201d Mr. Lu said. \u201cWe wanted to be part of this revolution.\u201dThe result is the K50. Designed at his research center, the two-seater has a light, carbon fiber exterior and a console stuffed with touch screens. Rows of batteries propel the roadster to a top speed of about 120 miles per hour and carry it as far as 200 miles on a single charge.No longer content to watch others produce his designs, Mr. Lu is currently constructing a $300 million factory in Suzhou, a city near Shanghai, to manufacture 50,000 cars a year. In all, he expects to invest as much as $1.4 billion into his venture over five years.He did not specify what the car would sell for, but Mr. Lu intends to price the K50 at the top of the market when it goes on sale this year.That sets CH-Auto on a collision course with the industry\u2019s flagship: Tesla.Elon Musk\u2019s company already has an edge. While Mr. Lu is building his business from scratch, Tesla has been established in China since 2013. CH-Auto will have to persuade wealthy customers to plunk down a large sum on an unfamiliar brand \u2014 Qiantu \u2014 over Mr. Musk\u2019s recognizable models.Mr. Lu nevertheless remains confident. He argues the sporty K50 will appeal to a more leisure-oriented driver than Tesla\u2019s cars. As a logo, the company has chosen the dragonfly, because its managers believe the speedy, nimble insect has similar attributes to his electric car. To market it, Mr. Lu is considering opening showrooms in major Chinese cities, backed by a platform to sell online.Elon Musk \u201cis someone I can learn from,\u201d he said. \u201cTesla has huge symbolic significance because it is the first company to make people believe a business model solely around electric vehicles is possible.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cwe are not looking to create the Chinese Tesla.\u201dWhen it comes to competing with Tesla, Mr. Lu can count on ample help from the Chinese government.To bring down costs and spur demand, the state has unleashed a torrent of cash. It has offered subsidies to manufacturers and tax breaks for buyers, and plowed investments into charging stations to make electric cars more practical.In all, UBS Securities estimates that the government spent $13 billion promoting electric vehicles in 2015 alone. So far, Mr. Lu has financed the K50 through loans and injections of fresh capital, but says he \u201cwon\u2019t refuse\u201d government subsidies if they become available.Some analysts fear the state\u2019s largess could prove as much bane as boon.China may be recreating the waste and excess in electric cars that has plagued other state-targeted sectors, like steel and renewable energy, without spurring the technological innovation the economy needs to compete. And even though China\u2019s car market is the world\u2019s biggest, it is still unlikely to absorb all of the electric vehicle projects underway today.\u201cThey are fueling overcapacity, with a lot of wasted money, and I\u2019m doubtful that in the end you\u2019ll have a successful electric car industry,\u201d says Crystal Chang, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley who studies China\u2019s auto industry policies.Significant sums have already been squandered. In September, the Finance Ministry fined five companies for defrauding the government of $150 million by fabricating sales of electric vehicles to obtain more subsidies, and several companies have failed to make an impression.Mr. Lu is certain, however, that the K50 stands out in a crowded field. The car has already gotten some advance buzz; a review on one popular Chinese website praised its design as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cavant-garde\u201d and its body as \u201cvery muscular.\u201d\u201cA big advantage they have is their knowledge of what it takes to build a quality vehicle,\u201d said Jack Perkowski, managing partner of the Beijing-based consulting firm JFP Holdings and a veteran of China\u2019s car sector. \u201cThey have a better chance than many others because of that.\u201dMr. Lu is counting on it.\u201cThere are a lot of electric vehicle companies and hot projects attracting a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cNot every company and not every car will be successful.\u201dEmily Feng contributed research.Advertisement"}

As she entered the ballroom, cameras flashed around her like fireflies in a summer meadow.As a rising member of the city\u2019s philanthropic class, Mrs. Shafiroff has been gaining prominence lately for her fund-raising prowess as well as her proficiency in getting media attention. But her outsize presence on the gala circuit has also attracted a certain amount of society side-eye, causing some to question whether her primary motive is philanthropy or publicity.Mrs. Shafiroff, 62, estimates that she and her husband, Martin D. Shafiroff, a former Lehman Brothers managing director, contribute nearly $1 million every year to charities, and solicit an additional $800,000 from their wealthy peers. As a measure of her social standing, she sits on the board of seven well-connected charities, including the French Heritage Society.Even in the era of a social media celebrities, those are impressive numbers.Mrs. Shafiroff exemplifies a new breed of hands-on philanthropist, one who isn\u2019t necessarily born with the right family name, or introduced through debutante balls, or nurtured through the ranks of junior benefit committees. Instead, she is what her husband calls a working socialite, who regards the philanthropy circuit as a profession and is a master of promoting her own image alongside the charities she supports.Some might regard that \u2014 or her collection of 80 elaborate evening gowns and many more cocktail dresses and lunch looks \u2014 as overkill. But Mrs. Shafiroff prefers to see it all in historical context.\u201cBrooke Astor had a publicist,\u201d she said.On a recent Sunday afternoon at her handsome four-bedroom apartment on Park Avenue, Mrs. Shafiroff wore black Christian Louboutin platform pumps, a gold Verdura crisscross cuff paired with a diamond-studded gold Buccellati ring and a Victorian-print silk dress from the current season of Coach 1941.The apartment, in a coveted Park Avenue co-op where one unit is on the market for $17.5 million, is decorated in a European style common among older finance millionaires, with oil paintings by artists including the 16th-century Dutch master Bernard van Orley hanging over flock wallpaper.He admiringly recounted his wife\u2019s moxie in soliciting donations from other wealthy New Yorkers. \u201cI\u2019ve seen calls where people were screaming at her,\u201d he said. \u201cScreaming: \u2018How dare you call? How dare you ask for a gift?\u2019\u201dMrs. Shafiroff exhaled sharply, like a small dog that had been hugged too hard, and interjected, \u201cWell, not quite.\u201d\u201cJean gets in trouble,\u201d her husband said.\u201cI don\u2019t get into trouble,\u201d she said, in protest.\u201cYes, she gets in trouble,\u201d he said.While husband and wife may spin it differently, there is no question that Mrs. Shafiroff is a fearsomely effective fund-raiser. She has ramrod posture and diction to match, cultivations that emphasize a steely conversational focus on herself and her causes. But she came by her grit honestly: raised middle class in Hicksville, N.Y., the daughter of a schoolteacher and a stay-at-home mother.She caught the philanthropy bug as a brownie-baking fund-raiser for her daughters\u2019 schools, Dalton and Columbia Grammar and Preparatory, honing the talents that have made her an influencer on the charity circuit.Among them is the quid-pro-quo diplomacy that comes with being honored at a gala. Honorees are ostensibly recognized for their leadership, but in practice, it often means that one has either donated money or, just as important, will attract other donors.\u201cYou have to guarantee a certain contribution to the organization,\u201d said Mrs. Cuomo, the society editor. \u201cThere\u2019s also a sense of vanity. You know you\u2019re going to be celebrated and looked at, and you have to be willing. And Jean, because she likes that level of admiration, it really works to the benefit of the organization that she\u2019s supporting.\u201d\u201cShe not only gives financially and helps us raise money, but she also rolls up her sleeves and gives her time,\u201d said Elsie McCabe Thompson, the society\u2019s president.These credentials come with other perks. As a ball-gowned gatekeeper in the charity circuit, Mrs. Shafiroff helps select who is honored, and prospective candidates beat a path to her Park Avenue door.During that visit, there was some unplanned excitement. A dog belonging to one of the Shafiroffs\u2019 daughters bit Ms. Kennedy\u2019s finger, drawing blood and requiring a tetanus shot.Mrs. Shafiroff sees publicity as a tool for advancing her causes.\u201cMost charities want to list names,\u201d she said. \u201cNames bring in names. So, if you\u2019re a good leader and you think your name can bring in funding, you lend your name and you don\u2019t mind being a bit of an attraction.\u201dBut for every Cinderella, there will be jealous stepsisters, and Mrs. Shafiroff\u2019s fondness for posing in ball gowns has led some to question whether her appetite for publicity is within the bounds of good taste.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people in society who snipe about Jean,\u201d said Emily Smith, the editor of Page Six. \u201cThey think that she could be out just to get attention.\u201dMs. Smith said she sometimes balks under the sheer volume of solicitations that come from Mrs. Shafiroff\u2019s many publicity handlers. \u201cWhat is ridiculous and sometimes quite annoying is that we will get pitched by every one of them,\u201d she said.She added, \u201cIf we fail to mention her, her publicists will complain, and I get the impression that she probably complained heavily to them.\u201dHer publicists, of course, frame things differently.\u201cShe only needs one press agent,\u201d Mr. Hay said. \u201cBut for special events, if it makes her feel that she\u2019s extending her reach by hiring other press agents, as far as I\u2019m concerned, she can hire dozens of them.\u201dAt the French Heritage Society gala, Mrs. Shafiroff was in her element, hosting a table of friends and dependents including Ms. McCabe, the NYC Mission Society president; Mr. de Souza, the fashion designer; Mr. Hay; and Lady Liliana Cavendish.There were speeches, a salmon pastrami starter followed by chicken breast, and excitement when a party crasher was thrown out by security for trying to steal an armload of the event\u2019s gift bags \u2014 a spectacle captured by Lady Liliana on her smartphone.Mr. McMullan, the photographer, stopped to take Mrs. Shafiroff\u2019s picture, prompting two tablemates to take out their cellphones and also start snapping images.Mrs. Shafiroff angled her swan neck and smiled. \u201cHow embarrassing,\u201d she murmured of the attention. \u201cI\u2019m a very fortunate person and I have an obligation to give back.

{"Headline": "After One-Child Policy, Outrage at China\u2019s Offer to Remove IUDs", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 A few months after Lu Qiumei gave birth to her daughter in 2012, local officials visited her home and told her that she was required to be fitted with an intrauterine device.For more than three decades, this was national policy in China. The IUD was the government\u2019s most important tool for limiting couples to one child, and almost all new mothers were required to get one.Ms. Lu, a former advertising executive, considered the demand invasive, insulting and potentially harmful to her health. Still, like hundreds of millions of Chinese women before her, she made an appointment with a state gynecologist and had one put in.While IUDs elsewhere can often be removed with the tug of their strings in a doctor\u2019s office, surgery is usually needed in China because most devices here are designed or altered to be more difficult to extract, some with shortened strings and others with no strings at all.But many Chinese women have chafed at the thought of the government\u2019s getting involved, yet again, in their private lives. And for many mothers, the offer has come too late for them to consider having a second child.\u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of someone injuring you and then mending the wound,\u201d said Zhang Xintian, 25, who watched her mother go into surgery two years ago in the eastern province of Zhejiang to remove the IUD she had worn for more than two decades.In China, women often have the same IUD from soon after childbirth until menopause; while popular IUDs in the United States are typically deemed effective for up to 10 years, those used in China offer birth control for much longer.China began demanding that women be fitted with an intrauterine device after they had one child, and sterilized after they had two, in the early 1980s. Those who refused risked that their children would be denied access to public schools and health insurance. Civil servants and state employees who refused lost their jobs.From 1980 to 2014, according to official statistics, 324 million Chinese women were fitted with IUDs. And 107 million underwent tubal ligations or, as is commonly said, got their \u201ctubes tied.\u201d Local officials were evaluated by their ability to meet targets, leading some to order that the procedures \u2014 as well as abortions \u2014 be performed by force on women who resisted.To that end, an official said at a recent news conference that 18 million women would be eligible for the free removal of IUDs in the next three years so they could bear a second child.\u201cOur country provides support in terms of law, finance and service systems to ensure citizens\u2019 access to the free removal of IUDs,\u201d said the official, Song Li of the National Health and Family Planning Commission\u2019s department of women and children.But the head-spinning reversal, the paternalistic attitude, the failure to accept any culpability \u2014 for some, it was too much. Within hours of the news conference, the internet was fuming with indignation.The mass implantation of IUDs amounted to \u201cinvoluntary, forced acts of mutilation,\u201d Han Haoyue, a popular columnist, wrote in a post shared nearly 3,000 times on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter. \u201cAnd now, to say they are offering free removal as a service to these tens of millions of women \u2014 repeatedly broadcasting this on state television as a kind of state benefit \u2014 they have no shame, second to none.\u201dAccording to gynecologists in China, IUDs used for Chinese women were meant to be left indefinitely, with surgery necessary to take them out.Dr. Gloria Korta, a gynecologist at Winchester Physician Associates in Massachusetts, who toured Chinese hospitals as part of a cultural exchange in 2001, said that while there was a risk of infection from having an IUD implanted for many years, it was small.Ai Xiaoming, 63, a prominent documentary filmmaker, said many women, herself included, had never been advised of potential complications and the need for regular checkups after getting an IUD. She had to have a hysterectomy when surgery to remove her IUD was botched.\u201cIn the eyes of the government, women are labor units,\u201d Ms. Ai said. \u201cWhen the country needs you to give birth, you have to do so. And when they don\u2019t need you to give birth, you don\u2019t.\u201dEven before the end of the one-child policy, the government allowed some women to remove their IUDs if they complained of medical complications. Others, including Ms. Zhang\u2019s mother, did it without permission, paying sympathetic doctors to remove them.But Wang Feng, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies the one-child policy, said the government appeared to be preparing to remove IUDs on a larger scale.\u201cThey were anticipating the numbers, how many operations need to be done, as if this is another government program,\u201d he said.Cao Cuihua, 35, a restaurant owner in the central province of Anhui and the mother of a 9-year-old boy, said she did not plan to remove her IUD because she and her husband could not afford more children.\u201cI did think about having a second child, but my economic circumstances don\u2019t allow it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis national policy to have two children has come a bit too late.\u201dYi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies China\u2019s demographics, said half of all Chinese women eligible to have a second child were 40 or older.\u201cMost people have already lost the ability to give birth,\u201d Dr. Yi said by email. \u201cThe willingness to have children is already very low, so the Chinese government\u2019s offer of free surgeries will be of no avail. It will have little effect on the birthrate.\u201dMao Qun\u2019an, a spokesman for China\u2019s family planning commission, defended the offer to remove IUDs and said the government would also cover the costs of surgery to reverse tubal ligations and vasectomies. (Such procedures are more complicated, and critics say most Chinese hospitals are not equipped for them.)Dr. Dalice Marriott, a gynecologist at Beijing United Family Hospital, said a woman who had an IUD for a long time ran the risk of \u201chaving it embedded in the uterine wall.\u201d \u201cThat makes it much more difficult to remove,\u201d Dr. Marriott said, adding that the surgery could result in bleeding, infection and injury to the uterus.Asked about the public outcry over the government\u2019s offer to remove IUDs, Mr. Mao replied, \u201cWe did not deliberately emphasize that it\u2019s a government benefit.\u201dLi Yinhe, a prominent Chinese scholar of sex and the family, defended the government\u2019s approach, arguing that population control measures were \u201cnot targeted against women\u2019s rights.\u201d\u201cIf the state doesn\u2019t engage in this, then it\u2019s not only a disadvantage for men, it also hurts the interests of women,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen giving up their reproductive rights is a sacrifice that is made for the whole Chinese society.\u201dBut many women want the government to acknowledge that its original policy was wrong. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done to women is inhumane,\u201d said Xu Dali, 35, a mother of two sons in Linyi. \u201cWhy did the government force every women then to have an IUD? At that time, why did it not consider the physical harm that has been inflicted on every woman?\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed reporting. Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}

Indira left Mexico for the United States at age 6 with her parents and two younger sisters. Her mother cleaned houses when she wasn\u2019t caring for the children \u2014 there would eventually be seven of them \u2014 and her father worked in construction, and there was no money for after-school lessons or soccer clubs, let alone traveling. \u201cI\u2019d hear about trips and experiences of my white friends, and I remember thinking: I\u2019ll never go to the beach or Disney World for spring break,\u201d Indira says. Her parents told her that education was all that mattered, and she had to spend all her free time inside, reading and writing. \u201cI tell my children this country is a blessing to all the people living here,\u201d her mother told me. \u201cIf you have the opportunity to be good, it\u2019s very important to take it.\u201d Indira took this advice to heart. By the time she was in fifth grade, her reading skills had improved so much that she tested into the top reading group. By middle school, she consistently got A\u2019s, which qualified her for a celebratory school trip every time report cards came out. \u201cThey rewarded us by taking us skating or bowling,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like I was so smart, just getting the chance to go out for the whole school day with friends. That\u2019s when I said: \u2018I can make it.\u2019\u2009\u201dIndira began to throw herself into everything. At recess, she played soccer and basketball, competing so fiercely that everyone took notice. Boys usually picked other boys for their teams, and white kids tended to favor other white kids. But everyone started picking Indira. In middle school, she was on the track team, running long-distance races. Her coach was stunned by her determination. In meets, even when she won her event, she scolded herself unless she broke her previous record. After practices ended, she would keep running. \u201cI wanted to think,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d stay after practice and run and run and run.\u201dIndira remembers understanding vaguely that it wasn\u2019t just poverty that set her and her family apart. Her parents had been doctors in Mexico. She admired pictures in their dresser drawer of the two of them in their 20s standing together, tall and proud in their white coats \u2014 before they all fled the violence of drug gangs who were then taking over their home state, Guerrero. When she asked her parents why they were no longer doctors, they explained it was because they were not American citizens. It didn\u2019t make sense to Indira. Why would her father have shed that beautiful crisp white coat for the fraying pants and shirts he now wore?Soon after Indira turned 13, in 2011, she was riding home from track practice with her mother when another car sideswiped the family\u2019s Ford Expedition. The other driver, who was at fault, insisted on calling the police, according to Indira and a lawyer who assisted the family. Indira pleaded not to involve the police, explaining that her mother did not have a driver\u2019s license because she was not an American citizen. (In Georgia and most other states, undocumented immigrants cannot obtain driver\u2019s licenses.) But the driver said she needed a police report to get insurance to cover the damage to her car.A police officer arrived and asked for Indira\u2019s mother\u2019s license. When she said she did not have one \u2014 a state crime \u2014 she was told to get out of the car. Indira got out, too. She remembers two of her younger siblings sleeping in the back, one in a booster seat, one in a car seat. Two elders from the church they attended arrived to ask for mercy. She has seven children, they told the officer. He responded that he was simply enforcing the law. Indira\u2019s mother turned to her and began to cry. \u201cIndira, I don\u2019t know what is going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to take me.\u201d Indira remembers remaining strangely calm. \u201cWhen she was being handcuffed, I said: \u2018Mom, everything is going to be O.K.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cThat woke me up,\u201d Indira says. \u201cUntil then, I thought the world was happy.\u201d In fact, she now realized, it was only American citizens who seemed truly happy. \u201cIt must feel pretty good, I guess, to not have to worry about whether your family could be taken away any day.\u201dShe was distressed to discover that Georgia barred undocumented immigrants from attending its top public universities and charged them out-of-state tuition at all others \u2014 triple the rate for citizen residents. She then turned to researching financial aid and learned that Congress barred her from accessing federal Pell grants, loans, scholarships and work-study jobs \u2014 the most common forms of assistance for low-income students. At first, she greeted this as just another set of obstacles to surmount, but as time went on, she began to despair. She would retreat to the classroom of her science teacher, Teresa Leach, who had become her mentor, in need of encouragement. \u201cThere were a couple of times when I just cried to her because I was tired,\u201d she said. \u201cI questioned myself if it was all worth the effort.\u201d All the while, Indira told me, she held onto her religious conviction that God had a plan, and that she must respect it.At a college fair attended by representatives of numerous Georgia colleges, she asked admissions officers what kind of help was available for undocumented students. No one had any to offer her. She switched her focus to private colleges and was admitted to Atlanta\u2019s Agnes Scott, which she says awarded her $20,000 annually in financial aid, less than half of what she needed. She researched full-ride private scholarships and found two for undocumented students, but she was selected for neither. She was awarded seven small scholarships, which totaled $10,000, enough to go to a nearby public commuter college for only one semester at the out-of-state tuition rate.Last May, Indira attended her graduation ceremony at Gainesville High School, but she had nowhere to go next. In every picture from that day, she wears a wide smile, but she was in pain inside, particularly when she caught a glimpse of her mother in the crowd, looking distraught. Unable to bring herself to celebrate with friends, she went home to be with her family.Days later, a friend told her about a philanthropic organization called TheDream.US, which was offering undocumented students full four-year scholarships to Delaware State University or Eastern Connecticut State University. The application was demanding, and only 76 students would be chosen. She poured herself into the essays, spending hours composing them alongside an English teacher, Cindy Lloyd. She applied to Delaware State, a historically black college in Dover, five hours closer to home than Eastern Connecticut. In late June, she received an email from TheDream.US. \u201cI saw \u2018Congratulations,\u2019\u2009\u201d she remembers, \u201cand I read no more.\u201dIn late August, Indira made the 11-hour drive with her parents from Gainesville to Delaware State in unusual silence. She was thinking hard about each of her six younger siblings, wondering how they would fare without her. Over breakfast at a Cracker Barrel in South Carolina, when her mother pressed her about how she was feeling, she talked only of her concerns about not being at home to help everyone. When she arrived on campus \u2014 a flat expanse of grassy courtyards and buildings amid strip malls, auto dealers and chain restaurants just beyond Dover\u2019s historic capital area \u2014 she found 33 other \u201copportunity scholars,\u201d just as worried and hopeful as she was. All of them were assigned to a dorm about a quarter of a mile from the D.S.U. campus, a former Sheraton hotel acquired a few years earlier by the university as part of an expansion. They bonded instantly, traveling as a posse from classes to the library to the cafeteria, often ending up together late at night in the dorm lobby or in a lounge that had been a large hotel suite on the second floor.While most of the students are 18 or 19, typical for college freshmen, some have worked for years in hopes of one day saving enough for college. Olivia Bekale, who is 27 and grew up in Baton Rouge, arrived in Louisiana from Gabon as a child. She graduated from high school in 2008 with a 3.9 G.P.A. from the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, a prestigious state-supported boarding school for top achievers. Unable to afford college, she cycled from one low-wage position to the next \u2014 server at the Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant; retail sales consultant for Sprint; customer-service agent for Marriott; pharmacy tech for Walgreens. Olivia, who had wanted to be a doctor since an aunt died of AIDS when she was 5, had been out of high school for eight years when she learned of the opportunity scholarship; she applied immediately.All but one of the students were enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Created in 2012 by an Obama-administration executive action, DACA allowed teenagers and young adults who came to the United States illegally as children with their parents to register with the government and in turn receive a two-year renewable protection against deportation, along with work permits and Social Security numbers. Most of the students, like Indira, signed up at age 15, as soon as they were eligible. With DACA, Indira, who is now 18, was able to get a driver\u2019s license and a job at a Publix supermarket when she was in high school, working 20 hours a week as a cashier and bagger. Being able to work and drive legally, free of the fears her mother faced, and fitting in with her classmates, Indira says, was \u201cliving the American dream.\u201d With her income from Publix, she even was able to get braces for her teeth.Undocumented children poured into the nation\u2019s schools over the next generation, and as they reached college age, they coalesced into a movement, advocating access to higher education as well as full citizenship. In 2001, they began calling themselves Dreamers, now an estimated 2.1 million young immigrants who have grown up as Americans in almost every way except for their passports. The name came from the Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors), introduced in Congress in 2001 by Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, and for which activists fought for over a decade. The measure, which would have put undocumented children on a path to citizenship, never passed, but the vast network of Dreamers became a compelling political force.In 2001, hundreds of them turned out to testify in Texas in favor of legislation to allow undocumented residents to pay in-state college tuition if they graduated from Texas high schools and lived in the state for three years. \u201cSomething magical happened when those kids told their stories,\u201d says the former Texas state representative Rick Noriega, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. \u201cIt was a humanizing of a very real issue dealing with children\u2019s dreams and hopes. Every heart on that committee was touched, Republicans and Democrats.\u201d The legislation passed both houses almost unanimously and was signed by Rick Perry, then governor of Texas and now President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for energy secretary. Texas became the first state, followed quickly by California, to allow Dreamers to pay in-state tuition. Today, 21 states charge Dreamers the same tuition as legal residents, including six carried by Trump \u2014 Florida, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Texas.In many of those states, however, the once-bipartisan issue has turned politically treacherous. In Texas, efforts to repeal the tuition law come closer to passing every year, and Noriega says there is no chance the original measure would pass today. The leading national opponents of in-state tuition for Dreamers include the Republican senator Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general, and the secretary of state of Kansas, Kris Kobach, a Republican who was a leader of Trump\u2019s transition team on immigration. Each argues that students who are in the United States illegally should not get a public benefit in any state that is denied to a citizen from another state. In other words, if Dreamers pay in-state tuition in Texas, citizen students next door in Arkansas and Oklahoma \u2014 or Massachusetts, for that matter \u2014 should have the same right. \u201cHow much sense does that make, to have people here illegally, and they have more benefits than those who are here legally?\u201d Sessions asked in a Senate floor statement. Kobach used the same argument to bring class-action lawsuits against in-state tuition for Dreamers in Kansas and California. Judges found no legal basis for the claims and dismissed the cases.The larger debate over how to treat an estimated 11 million immigrants who came here illegally has been at a stalemate for decades, with advocates seeking a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d for law-abiding families who have been in the country for years and opponents denouncing \u201camnesty\u201d for people who broke the law to enter the country. Amid hardening resistance in Congress to immigration reform, Dreamers brought pressure on Obama \u2014 including sit-ins and hunger strikes at his 2012 campaign offices \u2014 to use his executive power to create DACA. The program, announced on June 15, 2012, the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s Plyler decision, proved transformative for Dreamers. They have entered college, taken on-the-books jobs, received driver\u2019s licenses, bought cars. They now fly on planes, passing effortlessly through airport security. They still lack legal immigration status, but no longer are they exactly undocumented. \u201cDACAmented,\u201d many have called themselves.Even in states where they pay in-state tuition, Dreamers still struggle to afford college because they are disproportionately low-income and have no access to federal financial aid. Fewer than 10 percent of Dreamers who graduate from high school enroll in college. At a time when college graduates earn 70 percent more than those without degrees, these numbers conjure the 1982 warning by the Supreme Court that undocumented children could become a permanent underclass.In response, a handful of philanthropies have adopted the cause of sending students with DACA status to college. The biggest of these, TheDream.US, has raised $90 million to eventually finance 4,000 students at public colleges, with significant contributions from Donald Graham, former publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, and his family; Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan; Bill and Melinda Gates; the hedge-fund executive William Ackman; and Michael Bloomberg, among others. (I was a reporter at The Washington Post from 1980 to 2008.) In 2014, TheDream.US began offering Dreamers full scholarships in states that charge them in-state tuition. Last year, in partnership with Delaware and Connecticut, the organization created the opportunity-scholarship program for students from the other 29 states, financed by $41 million in philanthropy from Graham and his family and two anonymous donors. The governors of Delaware and Connecticut agreed to charge roughly in-state tuition rates for the 34 scholars at Delaware State and the 42 at Eastern Connecticut State \u2014 a total of $80,000 per student for tuition, room and board for four years. In an effort to pre-empt political opposition, Graham says, the philanthropy works only with schools, like Delaware State and Eastern Connecticut State, that have excess capacity, so that undocumented students are not displacing citizens. And private donors pay all expenses, so that no state dollars are spent.Still, when The Delaware State News ran an article in September about the D.S.U. opportunity scholars, the online comments complained that undocumented immigrants, not citizens, were benefiting. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t perfect, but I will vote for him because he puts Americans FIRST,\u201d wrote a reader named John Huff of Magnolia, Del. \u201cThere are plenty of kids who are citizens who have the same dream and should come first.\u201d And as news of the scholarship spread on the Delaware campus this fall, a number of African-American students told Dreamers that they resented that their own families had to go into debt for a portion of their education costs while the DACA students got full scholarships.By then, Trump had mobilized anti-immigrant anger in large swaths of the country, having kicked off his campaign criticizing Mexican immigrants \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u201d \u2014 and vowing to build a wall on the border to keep them out. In stump speeches, he promised to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and, in his first 100 days in office, to terminate DACA, labeling it \u201cillegal amnesty.\u201d Both vows became instant applause lines.Separation from family, from home, even from Mexican food made most of the opportunity scholars profoundly lonely. Estephany Martinez, a petite criminal-justice major with long black hair, couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her sisters in the first weeks. \u201cWhenever we came home from school, all four sisters would sit in the living room and do our homework and talk and watch TV,\u201d she recalled wistfully of her life in Winder, Ga. In Delaware, \u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody that cared for me. I didn\u2019t have anyone to come home to.\u201d In early September, she summoned all the scholars to a gathering in the dorm\u2019s second-floor lounge. \u201cAll right, you guys, we\u2019re going to be here for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cThat part of our lives \u2014 being undocumented \u2014 is critical to who we are. We have to share our stories.\u201d Everyone crowded in, sitting on the sofa, spilling onto the floor, sitting shoulder to shoulder on counters that once were part of a kitchenette, sprawling into one another\u2019s space.Carlos Gonzales of Manteo, N.C., a lanky and cheerful marketing major whose mother is a restaurant cook, broke down crying when he recalled the violence that drove his family from Mexico City. He, his mother and his younger sister moved to North Carolina when he was 7. It was his mother who encouraged him, beginning in elementary school, to reach for college. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to live the life we\u2019re living now,\u201d she told him. In high school, he was an honor student and varsity wrestler and runner, working nights and weekends at McDonald\u2019s in his Outer Banks town. When he received the email telling him he was an opportunity scholar, he said: \u201cI hugged my mom and cried for two hours. The only reason I stopped was I had to go to work.\u201dIndira told the harrowing story that led to her own family\u2019s departure from Mexico. In 2004, when she was 6, three masked gunmen broke into their home, which housed her parents\u2019 clinic, and robbed them of everything \u2014 money, jewelry, a new computer, a television, cameras and medications. They filed a report with the police, they said, who didn\u2019t investigate, in deference to cartels then taking over Guerrero, now the most violent state in Mexico. An uncle of her father\u2019s already had been killed. In subsequent years, a cousin of her mother\u2019s, a veterinarian, was kidnapped and never found. Two nephews disappeared. Her mother\u2019s sister has been kidnapped twice \u2014 most recently this past November \u2014 and returned only after her family paid steep ransoms.Weeks after the robbery, Indira\u2019s family of five arrived in the United States on a tourist visa that her father procured a month earlier in hopes of taking everyone to Disney World. Instead, they went to Gainesville, where her father\u2019s brother worked in construction \u2014 one of thousands of Mexican workers who flocked to the north Georgia community in the last 25 years, swelling the Hispanic population to more than 40 percent in 2013 from 8 percent in 1990. Indira said her parents are certain they would have been killed had they stayed. They decided to forfeit their careers for their family\u2019s safety. \u201cI no longer saw my future, but I saw my children\u2019s future,\u201d her father said to me.Antonio Patino, a computer-science major who is a lifeguard and plays bass and guitar in his spare time, told the group about riding with his family in their car in 2015 in Lawrenceville, Ga., when a police officer pulled them over, though none of them understood why. His father, who is undocumented and processes returns for a local manufacturer, was driving but did not have a license. Antonio and his mother, younger sister and brother all watched in terror as his father was handcuffed, placed in a police cruiser and driven off to jail. As it turned out, he was released the next day after paying a fine of more than $800 and was not referred to immigration court for further proceedings, but the incident shook Antonio\u2019s sense of belonging in America. \u201cI felt like I got slapped in the face just for living, trying to be a normal person in this beautiful country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like a hole inside me.\u201d He said he now found himself gripped with fears for his parents\u2019 safety at random moments during his days at D.S.U. It is as if he has swapped roles with his mother and father. \u201cLike I\u2019m now the parent and they\u2019re the child, and I\u2019m worried for them,\u201d he told me. \u201cNot being there, all these what-ifs swarm into my mind. What if out of nowhere they get pulled over again?\u201d Calling them and hearing their voices usually comforts him. But after one such call, he said: \u201cI went outside, and I had to cry a little. I was feeling like I couldn\u2019t help them.\u201dA number of students shared the enormous sacrifices they had seen their parents make for them. Juan Chavez, 23, who grew up in Plymouth, Ind., and worked for five years after high school, told of his mother suffering a breakdown after her divorce from his father. He saw it as a response to the crushing instability of their lives, moving from one home to another in search of shelter. \u201cShe\u2019s the strongest person I\u2019ll ever know,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my role model. My father figure as well as my mother.\u201d He continued: \u201cI felt so helpless to make things better. I decided almost right then I\u2019ll go to college and medical school if it takes me the rest of my life.\u201d He is now a psychology and pre-med major, intending to become a psychiatrist.On and on the students went until almost 3 a.m., the common threads in their stories drawing them closer. It was the first time most of them had talked openly about being undocumented, but instead of feeling exposed, they felt safer. Until then, Antonio had gone out of his way to avoid conversations with non-Dreamers at D.S.U. about his scholarship, not wanting to have to explain that he got it because he was undocumented. The next day, though, he fell into conversation with a student who asked him how he happened to come all the way from Georgia to D.S.U., and he said without hesitation: \u201cI got a scholarship.\u201d\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m undocumented,\u201d Antonio said, surprised at how comfortable this felt.\u201cO.K., man, that\u2019s cool,\u201d the student said.After their long night talking, the scholars also better understood what had propelled them all for as long as they could remember. Throughout high school, the opportunity scholars watched undocumented friends and siblings give up and drop out, shamed and beaten down by public scorn over illegal immigration and the dead-end options awaiting even those who excelled in high school. But they kept on striving, steeled to the insults, positioning themselves for a breakthrough they couldn\u2019t yet see. Now this all made sense. \u201cThis pain \u2014 it pushes us,\u201d Estephany said. \u201cIt\u2019s motivation. It has made me who I am. It makes me go through every day.\u201d\u201cNow we know what drives us,\u201d Indira said.A similar scene unfolded that morning in the ultramodern science center, in computational-thinking class, where Antonio and Jose Reyes Rios, another computer-science major, sat front and center with an African-American classmate named Hanqaamo Lintisio, who is from Maryland and has a track scholarship. The three had formed a study group and tutored one another so effectively that they all scored above 100 on the midterm. (They nailed the bonus question.) Theirs were the only A\u2019s in the class.The Dreamers gather daily at a long Formica table in a D.S.U. cafeteria for food and conversation. At lunch, Carla Moreno propped her English composition textbook, \u201cPatterns for College Writing,\u201d against a napkin holder, securing it with an apple. She paged through a chapter while eating her salad and chili dog. \u201cIt\u2019s just a quiz,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I want to keep my A.\u201d\u201cI deal with a lot of students, and I feel like the Dreamers are at a different level,\u201d says Kevin Noriega, the adviser for their scholarships. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got to make this happen because it\u2019s my only option.\u2019\u2009\u201d Of the 488 scholars funded by TheDream.US who began college in 2014, 94 percent remain enrolled after their sophomore year; research shows that only 66 percent of low-income college students nationally return after one year. \u201cThis is a low-income population with retention rates like Harvard\u2019s,\u201d Donald Graham says. Because beneficiaries of TheDream.US have full rides, they avoid a common problem faced by other disadvantaged students: running short of money for costs not covered by Pell grants or other forms of aid.One night in October before a biology exam, Indira went to the D.S.U. athletic center for a workout to relieve stress. She was armed with a stack of homemade flash cards and her iPhone, on which she had downloaded discussions of test topics from various websites. While pounding out three miles on the treadmill, she flipped through her study cards, then plugged in her earbuds for a YouTube lecture on glycolysis. Returning to her dorm, she sat down at her desk for a final review. Hanging on the wall in front of her was a collage of family photographs. One showed the whole family of nine around their dinner table. \u201cWhen I\u2019m struggling, I look at a picture of my mom or dad, and I say, \u2018I\u2019m working for that person,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. That night, her studying complete, she took a last look at her parents\u2019 picture and fell asleep listening to recordings of her biology professor\u2019s lectures. She got an A on the exam.Such unsinkable optimism, which I heard from many D.S.U. Dreamers in the early fall, is hard to maintain, and many of the estimated 65,000 undocumented immigrants who graduate from high school every year \u2014 and thousands who drop out \u2014 simply can\u2019t muster it. In a recent book, \u201cLives in Limbo,\u201d Roberto G. Gonzales, an assistant professor at Harvard\u2019s graduate school of education, writes that academically successful Dreamers are far outnumbered by those who become casualties of \u201cthe deeper and more far-reaching consequences of being undocumented: living in poverty, having parents and family members who also bear the burdens of being undocumented, watching friends moving forward but being unable to join them, watching opportunities pass you by, navigating a world of exclusions while constantly looking over your shoulder.\u201dAt least some of the opportunity scholars\u2019 optimism last fall came from their assumption, based on reported polls, that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. They were heartened by her speeches about keeping families together and pursuing comprehensive immigration reform. At the very least, they were confident that DACA would remain in effect under her leadership. Though they didn\u2019t believe Trump could win, he unnerved them with his speeches branding Mexicans criminals who stole Americans\u2019 jobs and lived off their tax dollars. They took this rhetoric as a personal affront and were horrified by the hatred they saw on the faces of those who cheered his words. \u201cThe only thing that depresses me is so many people support him,\u201d Jose Reyes Rios, the computer-science major, who aspires to work at Google one day, said in late September.On election night, a group of Dreamers gathered around the flat-screen TV in the dorm lobby, many of them studying as they watched returns. Indira had exams the next day in math and biology and arrived equipped with her flash cards. The mood turned dark after Trump won Florida. Everyone\u2019s mind flooded with his vows that they had discounted until now \u2014 to revoke DACA, to deputize local police departments to enforce federal immigration laws. \u201cWe will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings,\u201d Trump said last summer in Arizona. As all of them knew well, these crimes included one of their parents\u2019 daily activities \u2014 driving without a license. If DACA disappeared, and with it their Social Security numbers, their own driver\u2019s licenses would be worthless. So would their federal work authorization, meaning most would lose the jobs that paid for their books, phones, clothes, travel home and anything else they needed.By 1 a.m., Indira became too distressed to concentrate. Olivia Bekale was one of four opportunity scholars who watched until Trump was declared the president-elect. \u201cWe were just looking at each other and crying,\u201d she says. \u201cWe hugged each other and went to our rooms.\u201dSocial media brought aftershocks for all of them as they discovered that many of their best friends voted for Trump. Almost all of Antonio\u2019s high-school swim teammates in Lawrenceville had Trump filters on their Facebook and Snapchat profile pictures. \u201cAll I could think was: You voted against me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did I do to you?\u201dThe day after the election, Indira couldn\u2019t bear to call her mother until the afternoon. Instead, she confided her fears in text messages to her former science teacher, Teresa Leach. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so disappointed in this country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so powerless. ... I\u2019m scared about my family, my mom. ... Not sure if I\u2019ll even get my degree, much less go to medical school here.\u201d When Indira finally did call home, her mother insisted she was not afraid and told Indira that education was now even more important.Several of Indira\u2019s friends back home told her they doubted Trump would follow through on all his campaign promises, and in any case, they couldn\u2019t imagine he would target her. \u201cThese are people who helped me get to where I am, who remind me they love me, and I love them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll never understand what we feel. They say, \u2018He won\u2019t do that.\u2019 Do they think he\u2019s going to send back all the immigrants except Indira?\u201dA lifeline of sorts arrived the week after the election, when the students received letters from TheDream.US, Governor Markell and the president of D.S.U., pledging to stand behind their scholarships no matter what became of DACA. Donald Graham lined up attorneys to represent them if anyone challenged their right to be in school.But their bigger fears were for their parents. Antonio and Indira went home for Christmas to find their families filled with trepidation. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be invisible, trying to stay hidden,\u201d Antonio\u2019s father said, \u201cdo only the things we have to do to live, like go to work, go buy groceries.\u201d During the 2015 holiday season, they took a driving tour of the Christmas lights and celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve in downtown Lawrenceville. \u201cNow we can\u2019t go to any festivities because for us it\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d his mother told me in their apartment in a complex in Buford, Ga. \u201cThere are a lot of police there.\u201dAntonio\u2019s father said he worries about driving his daughter, Litzy, 15, home from her swim-team practice at rush hour, when the police presence increases. Litzy was born in Georgia, and he thought of asking her to leave the team until she is old enough to drive because, as a citizen, she will be able to get a driver\u2019s license. \u201cBut then I said to myself: \u2018No! That\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here \u2014 for our kids. So they can take advantage of every opportunity.\u2019\u2009\u201d He continues to ferry her \u2014 carefully \u2014 during rush hour.Indira found her mother more frightened than at any time since receiving her deportation order. Her mother says she has no choice but to drive when someone at her church asks for help, when her children call for rides home and when she is needed at a charity medical clinic where she volunteers as a doctor\u2019s assistant and translator. \u201cLife changed after the election,\u201d she told me in December, in her living room decorated with framed academic awards for each child. She was surrounded by her kids, who listened carefully. \u201cThe children know I don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. They know at any time maybe the police will take me again. \u2018If I can\u2019t come back,\u2019 I tell them, \u2018you have to go to school every day. You have to study hard \u2014 even harder.\u2019\u2009\u201dEstephany Martinez focused on her life\u2019s mission. \u201cMy goal is being a police chief \u2014 something that makes my voice louder,\u201d said the criminal-justice major. \u201cI have to educate myself to get there. I want to show people who don\u2019t believe in us: \u2018I got all the way here. I\u2019m starting from the bottom with education, and I\u2019m going to get there.\u2019\u2009\u201dAs they settled into the semester, they monitored everything Trump and his close allies were saying about immigration, their moods shifting with each utterance. Back in December, they felt hopeful when Trump, in his interview as Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year, said approving things about Dreamers and indicated that he would deport serious criminals before other undocumented immigrants. They were discouraged in January when Jeff Sessions, in his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, appeared unconcerned about the consequences of revoking DACA. They took heart two days later when Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, said in a CNN town-hall meeting that he wanted Congress to pass legislation making Dreamers \u201cright with the law.\u201dSoon after classes started, the opportunity scholars learned that their collective grade point average for the first semester was a 3.76. Six of the 34 students had achieved a perfect 4.0. Indira was one of them. \u201cSucceeding for me is how I can get my revenge,\u201d she told me over the phone, interrupting her biology homework for a few minutes. \u201cI want to break the stereotype of us being here taking jobs away and not helping the economy. I want Trump to see we\u2019re the total opposite of what he thinks.\u201dDale Russakoff is a freelance writer and the author of \u201cThe Prize: Who\u2019s in Charge of America\u2019s Schools.\u201d This is her first article for the magazine.Advertisement"}

More than half of that total came during the final month of the reporting period.Much of that money may be eligible for the city\u2019s matching funds program, which provides a six-to-one match for the first $175 in contributions to a candidate from any city resident. In that way, a voter who makes a $175 contribution to a candidate makes it possible for the candidate to receive an additional $1,050.The board said that 78 of the 130 candidates registered to run in city elections this year have signed up to use the website.Some of the best-known candidates who already have established fund-raising machines are not using the site. They include Mayor Bill de Blasio, the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, and the public advocate, Letitia James. Paul J. Massey Jr., a wealthy Republican real estate executive running for mayor, has not signed up either.Justin Brannan, a first-time candidate running for City Council as a Democrat in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, said that donors see the power of the matching funds program when they use the site, because it shows them how much the candidate will receive in addition to their personal contribution.\u201cWhen they give 50 bucks and they see that their $50 is going to turn into $350, I think it\u2019s very impressive,\u201d Mr. Brannan said. \u201cI don\u2019t have big-money donors, I don\u2019t have special interests or PACs, I\u2019m just a guy from the neighborhood running for office.\u201d He said that he took in about $40,000 through the site in the last month, from donations averaging about $100.\u201cDepending on how politics shake out in the next few months, I\u2019ll be ready to run for citywide office if the opportunity presents itself,\u201d Mr. Lancman said. \u201cThere is a very strong interest within the Democratic Party for a progressive voice that is independent of Mayor de Blasio.\u201dMr. Lancman said that donors gave him about $130,000 through the board\u2019s website.\u201cI am not shy,\u201d he said, \u201cabout taking out my phone and handing it to a prospective donor and saying, \u2018You can enter your credit card information right now.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

Meituan later allied itself with a top Alibaba rival, Tencent.Koubei, whose name roughly translates into \u201cword of mouth,\u201d was created as a joint venture in 2015 by Alibaba and the Ant Financial Services Group, the Alibaba-affiliated finance company that runs Alipay. The backing of those two companies has amply buoyed the young business in a fiercely competitive space.Perhaps more important, Koubei is closely tied to Alipay, giving businesses greater insight into customers who come in using Koubei. Knowing who those customers are and how often they have been patrons could in theory allow Koubei-affiliated businesses to offer highly targeted coupons or discounts.Koubei said it handled more than 15 million daily orders in 2016. Alibaba has disclosed that Koubei garnered some $7 billion in payment volume in the third quarter last year.\u201cThis is how Alibaba wants to get those people \u2014 the customers who go to restaurants or to local convenience stores \u2014 to transact and bring them more fully into the Alibaba ecosystem,\u201d Ken Hao, a Silver Lake managing partner and managing director, said in an interview.That tight integration with Alibaba made Koubei an interesting opportunity for Silver Lake. The American investment firm was an early supporter of Alibaba, putting $500 million into the company in 2011 and 2012. By the time Alibaba went public in the fall of 2014, the value of that stake had ballooned to $5.1 billion.By the time Koubei was ready to raise money, its chairman, Joseph Tsai \u2014 who is also Alibaba\u2019s vice chairman \u2014 reached out to investors who were considered friends of Alibaba. Besides Silver Lake, the consortium includes CDH Investments, Primavera Capital, Temasek, Yunfeng Capital and Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the sovereign wealth fund of Malaysia.\u201cOut of the more than 100 Chinese investment opportunities that have surfaced in recent years, Koubei was the special one that fit Silver Lake\u2019s criteria for size and risk-reward, and provided a great opportunity to work with the exceptional people at Alibaba again,\u201d Mr. Hao said.By bringing in outside money, Koubei will gain both additional capital to expand and some degree of independence. It could eventually be listed as a public company, much as Ant is expected to be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zimbabwe Stands Still as President Vacations Off the Grid", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 It was an urgent matter for President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe: His approval was needed so that a loyal supporter who had just died could be buried at a cemetery for national heroes.But with Mr. Mugabe off on his extended annual holiday in Asia this month, it took the acting president a couple of days to track him down, en route from Beijing to his Asian base in Singapore.\u201cI phoned the president telling him about the death, and he told me that he had learned about it through the first lady, who had read about it on the internet,\u201d said the acting president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, one of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s two vice presidents.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays are one of the unusual aspects of the rhythms of political life in Harare, the capital of this southern African nation. Every year, from mid-December through the end of January, Mr. Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years with a tight grip, seemingly releases it. He vanishes in Asia, going off grid, becoming at times unreachable to his own deputies.A couple of years ago, one of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s sons posted photos on Instagram showing the family at a high-end Japanese restaurant in Singapore, apparently enjoying teppanyaki. But the Mugabes have otherwise remained discreet about their holiday activities, sensitive perhaps to criticism back home that they are wasting public money while government coffers are nearly empty.So committed has Mr. Mugabe been to staying away from Zimbabwe that even when he interrupts his long Asian holiday with an official trip to an African nation \u2014 as he did in mid-January by traveling to Mali \u2014 the presidential plane, Air Zimbabwe Flight 1, has made a beeline right back to Asia.In Harare, government decisions, big and small, are put off. It\u2019s a slow month and half for political journalists, even as rumors fill the vacuum. But even in Mr. Mugabe\u2019s absence, the grip of the only leader Zimbabwe has ever known never really loosens.\u201cWhen Mugabe goes on holiday, he goes on holiday with the state,\u201d said Pedzisai Ruhanya, a political analyst and the director of the Zimbabwe Democracy Institute, a research group. \u201cMugabe\u2019s behavior is inconsistent with practices in other countries, with general state practices. This is kind of strange.\u201dThis time, Mr. Mugabe left for Asia immediately after his party\u2019s annual conference in mid-December, which was dominated by his wife, Grace Mugabe, 51. Mr. Mugabe, the world\u2019s oldest head of state, who will be 93 in February, slept through most of the conference but was selected as his party\u2019s candidate in next year\u2019s presidential election.His party is increasingly divided by fighting over succession, and Mr. Mugabe has lost the support of longtime allies like veterans of the country\u2019s war of liberation. Zimbabwe\u2019s financial state remains so precarious that government workers were paid late in December, after Christmas, and have yet to receive their year-end bonuses.\u201cUnder normal circumstances, when things are not O.K. in your house, you wouldn\u2019t leave for such a long time,\u201d said John Masuku, a journalist who worked for 27 years at the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, including as a presidential correspondent.And yet, even in increasingly frail health, Mr. Mugabe has not cut short his annual holidays. The reality, allies and rivals alike say, is that he has secured the loyalty of the political class through patronage, eviscerated the opposition and installed relatives and close associates in important posts in the army and the police. Unlike less-secure strongmen who rarely venture abroad, Mr. Mugabe sticks to his annual routine, leaving Zimbabwe at the same time every year, and he has even lengthened his holidays in recent years.\u201cHe feels quite comfortable,\u201d said Rugare Gumbo, who was a longtime ally of Mr. Mugabe and is now in the opposition. \u201cNo one can take a chance by raising any controversial issue because he would be accused of trying to overthrow the old man.\u201dIndeed, when Mr. Mnangagwa, the acting president, was shown recently in Facebook photos holding a mug with the words, \u201cI Am the Boss,\u201d the attacks against him by party rivals were immediate and relentless. Accused of wanting to push Mr. Mugabe aside, Mr. Mnangagwa had to issue a statement to the contrary.Mr. Mugabe, a well-known Anglophile, used to spend his annual holidays in London or elsewhere in Europe. But sanctions imposed by Western governments after the seizure of white-owned farms in 2000 pushed the Mugabes to look elsewhere.The Mugabes have vacationed in Malaysia and Hong Kong as well as in the Middle East, mostly in Dubai. But Mr. Mugabe has settled in recent years on Singapore, which, in addition to having excellent Japanese food, has a leading medical tourism industry \u2014 and, perhaps most important, is a former British colony.\u201cHe finds it congenial to be in a former British colony than in any other country,\u201d Mr. Gumbo said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get pleasure in London, you might as well get it in its colonies.\u201dWith Mr. Mugabe gone, neither the government nor the ruling party bothers to hold high-level meetings.\u201cWe didn\u2019t hold cabinet meetings in Mugabe\u2019s absence because he is the one who chairs the meetings,\u201d said Didymus Mutasa, who served as a minister to Mr. Mugabe for many years and is now in the opposition. \u201cWhen Mugabe goes on leave, some of his ministers also go on leave.\u201dTendai Biti, an opposition leader who served as finance minister in a coalition government from 2009 to 2013, said that Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays have long been a drain on Zimbabwe\u2019s finances. In a system established before independence, government officials traveling overseas are given hard currency, usually American dollars, upon authorization from the Finance Ministry, Mr. Biti said.During Mr. Biti\u2019s tenure, Mr. Mugabe typically asked for $3 million for his annual holidays, and Mr. Biti said he authorized from $800,000 to $1.2 million.\u201cThe money comes as cash,\u201d Mr. Biti said. \u201cBut whether they put it in suitcases or whatever, I don\u2019t know. That was not my job.\u201dUnspent money \u2014 from Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays or his frequent trips outside Zimbabwe \u2014 is not returned to the state.\u201cIt has become a vehicle for looting,\u201d Mr. Biti said.Most high-ranking government and ruling party officials refused to comment on Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays.But Tshinga Dube, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s minister for war veterans, said that he carried out his duties the same way whether Mr. Mugabe was in or out of the country. Describing himself as an \u201cambassador\u201d serving under \u201ca Julius Caesar,\u201d Mr. Dube said, \u201cYou cannot do things differently just because he is not there.\u201dAsked about popular criticism that Mr. Mugabe is out of touch by taking such long and costly holidays while the country\u2019s economy teeters, Mr. Dube said that it was \u201ca matter of personal opinion.\u201d\u201cIt is very difficult,\u201d he added, \u201cto talk, to comment about your boss, especially on issues that relate to his health, his age, and things of that nature.\u201dJeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Norimitsu Onishi from Johannesburg.Advertisement"}

But Mr. Price said, \u201cI had no access to nonpublic information.\u201dA list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Mr. Trump said last week that drug companies were \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and that Medicare should negotiate with drugmakers to secure lower prices, a position long championed by Democrats and fiercely opposed by Republicans.Asked if he would press Congress to authorize such negotiations, Mr. Price did not give a definitive answer. \u201cI think we need to find solutions to the challenges of folks\u2019 gaining access to needed medication,\u201d he said.He added that, if confirmed, he would try to give states more freedom and flexibility under Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides coverage for more than 70 million low-income people. In response to questions, he said states should be allowed to require certain able-bodied adults without children to work, seek work or participate in job training as a condition of receiving Medicaid. Some Republican governors want to impose such requirements, but the Obama administration has turned down their proposals.Mr. Price praised Indiana\u2019s program to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act with conservative policies that state officials say promote \u201cpersonal responsibility.\u201d\u201cStates know best\u201d how to care for their Medicaid beneficiaries, he said, adding, \u201cWhat Indiana has done is really a best practice, I think, for many other states to follow.\u201dMr. Trump has not said much about the future of Medicaid in the 31 states that have expanded eligibility, with large amounts of federal money.Democratic senators were often frustrated in their efforts to get Mr. Price to say whether he supported the coverage requirements and insurance mandates in the Affordable Care Act.In a typical response, he said that patients should have \u201caccess to the kind of coverage that they want,\u201d rather than having it dictated to them by the government.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said that Mr. Price appeared to support the coverage and protections provided by the Affordable Care Act, but that \u201cwe don\u2019t get any specifics as to how that\u2019s going to occur\u201d if the law is repealed.Without mandating coverage of specific benefits, Mr. Price said, the Trump administration could \u201cmake certain that individuals had the care and the kind of coverage that they needed for whatever diagnosis would befall them.\u201dHe said the administration could put in place \u201ca different construct\u201d that \u201cwould allow for every single person to gain access to the coverage that they want and have nobody fall through the cracks.\u201dHe did not say how the Trump team would guarantee such protection.Mr. Trump has expressed support for a provision of the 2010 health law under which insurers must allow children to stay on their parents\u2019 policies until the age of 26. This is \u201cbaked into the insurance programs that are out there right now,\u201d Mr. Price said.\u201cI think that the insurance industry has included individuals up to age 26 on their parents\u2019 policies virtually across the board,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t see any reason that that would change.\u201dDemocrats were skeptical. Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire said there was no guarantee that such protections would continue in the absence of federal requirements. Insurance companies did not routinely cover drug abuse treatment in the past and might not do so in the future without a requirement, she said.\u201cI think there\u2019s been a lot of talk about individuals losing health coverage,\u201d Mr. Price said. \u201cThat is not our goal, nor is it our desire, nor is it our plan.\u201d\u201cOne of the important things that we need to convey to the American people is that nobody\u2019s interested in pulling the rug out from under anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that it\u2019s absolutely imperative that individuals that have health coverage be able to keep health coverage and move, hopefully, to greater choices and opportunities for them to gain the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their families.\u201dMr. Price said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d consider administrative action to stabilize the market for insurers, which are supposed to submit proposals for 2018 coverage in April. Insurers say it will be nearly impossible to calculate premiums if they have no idea what will replace the health care law.Mr. Price championed \u201cmedical innovation\u201d as an essential ingredient of high-quality care but criticized the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, which was created by the health law to test new ways of paying doctors, hospitals and other providers.He said that the agency had great promise, but that too often, its experiments were compulsory for doctors and nearly nationwide in scope. He said he \u201cadamantly opposed the mandatory nature\u201d of some payment models, like one for joint replacement surgery and one for expensive drugs administered in doctors\u2019 offices.Mr. Price said he would not object if Medicare tested payment methods with small pilot projects that could expand if successful.The health committee will not vote on Mr. Price\u2019s nomination. Another hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday by the Senate Finance Committee, which will vote on whether to recommend confirmation. The committees share authority over issues for which the Health and Human Services Department is responsible.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Right-Wing Hoteliers in Japan Anger China With Radical Historical Views", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 She is the colorful face of Japan\u2019s largest hotel chain, known for her garish fashion sense and business books with titles like \u201cI Am a President.\u201dHe is the darker side of the partnership: a right-wing polemicist who has leveraged the couple\u2019s success to support contentious political causes, including defending Japan\u2019s militarist past.Now Fumiko Motoya and her husband, Toshio, founders of APA Group, a Japanese real-estate and hotel empire, are facing a barrage of criticism in China. Their twin projects \u2014 business and conservative politics \u2014 collided this week in an uproar over right-wing historical books promoted at APA\u2019s chain of 370 budget hotels, in which such publications are often distributed to rooms in much the same way as Gideon Bibles in American hotels.The furor over the books, which promote the claim that Japanese forces did not massacre Chinese civilians during a rampage in Nanjing in 1937, has prompted a rebuke from Beijing and threats of a boycott by Chinese travelers, a fast-growing and economically important group for Japan.\u201cThis once again shows that some forces in Japan are still reluctant to look squarely at history, and even try to deny and distort history,\u201d a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said on Tuesday, as the outcry took on international political dimensions. On Thursday, China\u2019s Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall said it strongly protested the books.The Motoyas have shown how fraught that embrace can be. APA\u2019s stance has touched off anger online in China and condemnation from official media outlets, along with calls for Chinese travelers to take their business elsewhere.APA has been unrepentant. In a statement, it said that \u201chistoric interpretation and education vary among nations,\u201d but it defended Mr. Motoya\u2019s claims about Nanjing.\u201cTherefore, we have no intention to withdraw this book from our guest rooms,\u201d the company said, adding that \u201cno one-sided pressures\u201d would force it to change its mind. APA invited readers to correct any inaccurate statements \u201cso that we can seriously study about them.\u201dThe Motoyas may not be as well known as another divisive and politically minded hotelier, Donald J. Trump, nor are their midmarket properties as gilded. But in Japan, they come close to being stars. Ms. Motoya, in particular, has embedded herself in popular culture though books, television appearances and an intermittent singing career.The Motoyas are among the most prominent backers in Japan of rightist historical revisionism. While Fumiko Motoya represents the APA brand in public, her husband writes essays and books that seek to put Japan\u2019s sometimes brutal imperial past in a kinder light. Their activism has put them at the center of controversies that have bedeviled Japan\u2019s relations with China and South Korea for decades.\u201cAs political patrons, they can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d said Tamotsu Sugano, an author who has researched Japanese rightist groups. \u201cThey spread money everywhere.\u201dThe Motoyas have used a fortune estimated to be in the billions of dollars to court and support politicians, mostly on the conservative end of the spectrum \u2014 from the center-right establishment to the fringe. Guests at their long-running wine parties have included Shinzo Abe, the current prime minister, according to a record of an event in 2005 that includes a photograph and was circulated by APA at the time.A Japanese magazine, Shukan Gendai, has estimated that Mr. Motoya, who serves as president of the overall APA Group while Fumiko leads the hotel division, is Japan\u2019s fourth-richest person, with assets worth 220 billion yen, or about $1.9 billion. Shukan Gendai made its calculation based on tax records and on published APA documents, but because the company is privately owned, its disclosures are scarce and a precise figure is difficult to obtain.The Motoyas hail from Fukui, a rural area on the Sea of Japan, where they met while working at a small local credit union, according to Ms. Motoya\u2019s autobiography. They built APA from a small operation beginning in the 1970s, starting with real-estate sales before moving into hotels for budget-conscious business travelers. In 2015, they expanded to the United States by buying a 200-room former Hilton hotel in Woodbridge, N.J.Right-wing literature has long been a staple, if odd, amenity at APA hotels in Japan. Much of it is written by Mr. Motoya, who uses a pen name but acknowledges authorship.The books and articles describe a kind of alternative historical universe, one where Japan fought entirely nobly in World War II and in which its alleged atrocities were invented by Chinese and Korean propagandists. The accounts differ sharply from those of mainstream historians, both in Japan and abroad.One piece of literature that was featured for years was an essay by a former air force general, Toshio Tamogami, which won a prize in an APA-sponsored contest in 2008. In it, Mr. Tamogami claimed that Japan had been duped into attacking the United States at Pearl Harbor in 1941, in a plot he said was hatched by Communists inside the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.The latest controversy was touched off by a video on the internet. Posted by a couple describing themselves as an American woman and a Chinese man who stayed at an APA hotel, it shows excerpts from a book by Mr. Motoya denying the Nanjing massacre and the forcible recruitment of women into wartime Japanese military brothels. The video spread quickly through the Chinese internet this week, generating outrage and promises of a boycott.For its part, the Japanese government appears to want to keep its distance. The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, declined to comment on the APA books when asked on Wednesday, saying only that Japan, China and South Korea should seek \u201cforward-looking\u201d ways to cooperate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Funding Disparities Abound in New York\u2019s Senior Centers, Report Finds", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported bySenior centers across New York City receive varying levels of funding from the city, and the disparities are glaring: A center in Lower Manhattan gets just $3.54 to provide a meal to an elderly client, while a center in Brooklyn gets $18.36.The Department for the Aging contracts with more than 100 nonprofits to operate about 250 senior centers, where older people can receive meals and participate in cultural, recreational and fitness programs. In its report, Union Settlement said that the city acknowledged the disparities in funding, which can be attributed, in part, to the department having inherited centers from other city agencies over the decades.In response to the study, the department said in a statement that \u201cthe city is taking steps to address inequities in funding for senior centers across the five boroughs.\u201dUnion Settlement decided to investigate the funding mechanisms after noticing wildly divergent payments from the city to its four centers. For example, the organization\u2019s Jefferson Senior Center and Gaylord White Senior Center were both expected to serve 75 seniors per day in 2016. And the centers provided the same services, including meals, transportation and nutrition education, among other things.\u201cGiven these nearly identical requirements, one would expect the two centers to receive similar amounts of funding from the Department for the Aging, but they do not,\u201d the report said.Under the contracts with the city, Union Settlement received up to $413,841 to operate the Jefferson center, but half that amount, or $206,610, to run the Gaylord White center. As a result, Union Settlement had $22.07 per senior per day to provide services at Jefferson, and less than half that amount \u2014 only $11.02 a day \u2014 at Gaylord White.Even greater disparities were found in other neighborhoods around the city. The contract for a senior center in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, for instance, allowed for $5.32 in funding per person a day, while the contract for a center in Jamaica, Queens, provided more than nine times as much as that amount, or $50.31 per senior each day.One particularly egregious example centered on activities to promote health and wellness, a chief focus of senior centers. A center in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn received just 11 cents per unit of so-called health promotion \u2014 the city\u2019s term for activities like nutrition counseling and fitness classes \u2014 while the contract for a center in the Morris Heights community in the Bronx provided 465 times as much funding, or $51.16 per unit.When Union Settlement shared its draft report with the city, officials at the Department for the Aging were receptive to the group\u2019s recommendations, Mr. Nocenti said. \u201cI believe the current administration is committed to ensuring that appropriate and equitable levels of funding are provided to every center throughout the city,\u201d he said.The group\u2019s recommendations include an immediate increase in the budgets of underfunded senior centers so that they are brought up to the median spending level citywide, and creation of a Fair Senior Funding Working Group to establish the actual cost of a high-quality senior center program. It also recommends adoption of a financing formula to ensure that senior centers all receive the same amount of spending per person served.In its study, Union Settlement tried to find underlying reasons for the funding disparity. It considered whether variation could be explained by the number of clients who use a center and the number of meals served each day. The group also looked at such factors as whether a center cooked its own food or bought prepared meals from a vendor.But those variables, the report said, \u201cexplained a surprisingly small portion of the variations in funding\u201d for the centers\u2019 services.The number of people using a center explained only 25 percent of the variation in the amount of overall financing, even after taking costs like rent and utilities into consideration. The number of meals offered at a particular center accounted for 49 percent of the disparity in the amount of contracted funding.The report concluded that the methodology used by the city to provide funding to senior centers was \u201cinequitable, with no apparent logical basis\u201d for most of the disparities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Governors Seek Flexibility on Medicaid and Health Markets", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican governors pleaded with their fellow Republicans in Congress on Thursday to give states more control over both their Medicaid programs and their individual health insurance markets as lawmakers work with President-elect Donald J. Trump to replace the Affordable Care Act.In town for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, nine governors \u2014 some who had expanded Medicaid under the law and some who had refused \u2014 presented a united message: The Obama administration was too rigid in prescribing standards for Medicaid and private insurance coverage, and states need more power to set their own policies.Many had already sent letters to Republican lawmakers urging them not to repeal the law before approving a replacement plan, and in comments after Thursday\u2019s session they focused on the details of what that replacement plan should be.Given greater flexibility to set their own policies, several governors said, they would like to trim the number of people in Medicaid and the array of benefits offered in both the public program and private plans sold in the markets.Yet at the same time, some, including John R. Kasich of Ohio and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, are lobbying to keep the generous federal financing provided by the law for expanding Medicaid. Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Kasich have indicated they would like to reduce their Medicaid expansion populations while still having the federal government pay at least 90 percent of the cost of covering those who remain in the program.Medicaid is the nation\u2019s largest government health insurance program, serving 22 percent of the population \u2014 more than 70 million people \u2014 at a cost of more than $500 billion a year. Before the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid recipients were largely children, parents, pregnant women and the elderly and disabled.The law sought to change that by requiring every state to expand Medicaid to cover anyone with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level, or about $16,500 for a single adult. But the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the provision, and many Republican-led states did so.Still, 16 of the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the law have Republican governors who now must decide whether to fight to preserve the size and scope of their programs in the Trump era.The law offered a major financial enticement to lure states into expanding Medicaid: The federal government paid the entire cost for the first three years. Although states are beginning to pay a small portion of expansion costs this year, they are never required to pay more than 10 percent under the terms of the Affordable Care Act.Some Republican governors have also expressed tentative support for Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to change federal spending on Medicaid from an open-ended entitlement to a fixed annual amount, or block grant, for each state. Critics say block grants could result in states cutting people from the Medicaid rolls or reducing the services they get.\u201cThe difference between a good block grant and a dangerous block grant is in the detail,\u201d Mr. Kasich wrote to congressional leaders recently.Gov. Rick Scott of Florida told reporters outside the meeting room on Capitol Hill that he wanted the Trump administration to give him a set amount for each Medicaid beneficiary, but that the amounts should differ depending on the beneficiary\u2019s health needs. \u201cIndividuals with different problems, there are different costs involved,\u201d he said.Referring to the Department of Health and Human Services, Mr. Scott added, \u201cIt was frustrating to me under Obamacare, where the H.H.S. didn\u2019t appear to have any interest in working with me. They said, \u2018You should do this and do it all 100 percent on my terms.\u2019\u201dMr. Hutchinson said he was \u201cvery, very pleased\u201d with the meeting with senators, which also included Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will play a large role in writing legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act. Governors held a separate meeting with Republican members of Mr. Walden\u2019s committee.\u201cWhenever you see senators and Chairman Walden taking notes on what governors are saying, that\u2019s a significant day for the principle of federalism,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said.In addition to Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Kasich and Mr. Scott, the governors of Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, South Dakota, Texas and Utah attended the meeting.In letters before the meeting, the governors also warned Congress not to do anything that would disrupt coverage for people who have gained it under the health law.\u201cWe support a single repeal-and-replace package, but are concerned that a strategy to repeal now then later replace the A.C.A. could have serious consequences,\u201d Mr. Kasich wrote. He added that such consequences could include destabilizing the insurance markets and reversing recent coverage gains.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Seem Invincible. That Worries Lawmakers.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech \u2014 from IBM to Hewlett-Packard to Cisco to Yahoo \u2014 were eventually outmaneuvered by start-ups that came out of nowhere.The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place.Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable.In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world\u2019s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will.The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump\u2019s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds.This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year.Let\u2019s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends \u2014 mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs.Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech \u2014 on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance.The Five aren\u2019t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple\u2019s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet\u2019s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren\u2019t entirely safe from competition from start-ups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot.Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from start-ups; today\u2019s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five.But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you\u2019re supposed to in America \u2014 by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren\u2019t considered that bad. They weren\u2019t causing environmental disasters. They weren\u2019t selling cigarettes. They weren\u2019t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five\u2019s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn\u2019t I called them the Fabulous Five?Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with.During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos\u2019s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry\u2019s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public.For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised \u2014 entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others.\u201cDuring the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U.S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,\u201d said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them.During Mr. Genachowski\u2019s term at the F.C.C., and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201d which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies.But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. \u201cThe next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things \u2014 battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,\u201d he said.That\u2019s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger \u2014 their benefits to society as well as their potential costs \u2014 when deciding how to police them.But there\u2019s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today\u2019s start-ups. The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining, voice-activated assistants, self-driving cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five.That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more; and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul J. Massey Jr. Takes Lead in New York\u2019s Mayoral Fund-Raising Race", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byThe mayoral election fight of 2017 may be slowly gearing up, with Mayor Bill de Blasio facing his stiffest challenge so far from a Republican real estate developer with deep pockets but little name recognition among New Yorkers.The developer, Paul J. Massey Jr., raised more than $1.6 million in contributions in the last six months, according to campaign filings made public on Tuesday. Mr. Massey, who is running on the Independence line and hopes to prevail in a Republican primary, has also put in more than $1.2 million of his own money so far, and has vowed to eschew the city\u2019s generous campaign finance matching system.The mayor, a Democrat, raised less money in the latest filing period, which ended last week and covered the last six months of 2016. But he did so from a broad array of New Yorkers, collecting contributions from 3,261 individuals, more than any other mayoral candidate during a single filing period in recent years.Mr. de Blasio reported contributions of just over $1 million during the six-month period. That was slightly less than he raised in the previous six months, but it came from more than double the number of donors and includes significantly more money eligible to receive matching funds.Mr. Massey received contributions from 826 donors.The mayor\u2019s potential Democratic challengers lagged far behind in fund-raising. The city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, who is said to be considering a run, raised $346,385 from 457 contributors, according to his filing. Tony Avella, a state senator from Queens, raised $725 from seven contributors.The potential match between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Massey could bolster one of the central claims of the mayor\u2019s campaign: that moneyed interests and \u201cpowerful forces\u201d are bent on booting him from power. It also offers a textbook case in two approaches to running a campaign in a city where small donations carry a premium \u2014 under the city\u2019s system, the first $175 given to a candidate by city residents is matched six-to-one with public funds.\u201cOur goal here was to move our operation towards what I think is the shape of things to come,\u201d the mayor said during an unrelated news conference on Tuesday. \u201cA lot more donations from the grass roots, and a lot more involvement from the grass roots.\u201dBased on eligible contributions reported by the mayor for this filing period, he could receive an additional $1.1 million in city matching funds.Mr. de Blasio also received more than 90 donations at the $4,950 maximum, which accounted for more than 40 percent of his total fund-raising during the filing period. Funds came from some of the city\u2019s richest residents, like Barry Diller; celebrities, like Cynthia Nixon; and labor unions.Mr. Massey, a real estate sales executive who sold his company about two years ago to Cushman & Wakefield, said that although he has no political experience, he is the kind of manager the city needs.\u201cThis is more a C.E.O. manager job than a political job,\u201d he said in an interview in late December. \u201cThe focus should be on running the city.\u201dHe criticized Mr. de Blasio\u2019s handling of the homelessness crisis and said he could do a better job creating affordable housing because of his real estate experience.Mr. Massey refused to say how much of his own money he would spend on the campaign.His plan to spend outside the limits could ultimately allow Mr. de Blasio to spend more as well. Under the city\u2019s matching funds system, candidate spending is normally capped at a combined total of about $14 million for the primary and general elections. But if a candidate who refuses matching funds exceeds certain spending levels, the cap for those receiving the funds can be raised or lifted completely.For the mayor, that would require a whole lot of $3 donations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio Proposes Budget of $84.7 Billion", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday unveiled an $84.7 billion budget proposal for New York City that outlined his spending priorities as he starts his run for re-election, but did not address what he called the \u201cgreat unknown\u201d of possible federal cuts to city financing from the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress.If adopted by the City Council, the city\u2019s budget would be about $12 billion greater than it was when Mr. de Blasio became mayor in 2014. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s final budget called for $72.7 billion in spending.\u201cThis is a budget against a backdrop of a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said at the start of a news conference in City Hall.The mayor cited threats by President Trump and other Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, pare support for social services and public housing, change the way schools are financed and retaliate against so-called sanctuary cities that resist a crackdown on illegal immigrants.But he said that none of those possibilities were reflected in the preliminary budget because it was still unclear which, if any, would occur.\u201cIt\u2019s a budget that focuses on what we can do for ourselves while we wait to see the shape of things in Washington,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, adding that a revised budget proposal in the spring might be able to take those factors into account.The proposed budget takes into account a variety of savings at city agencies, largely through debt service and revised cost estimates. The City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito and the chairwoman of the council\u2019s finance committee, Julissa Ferreras-Copeland,called for the mayor to find ways to cut costs further. Both are Democrats.\u201cI think it is prudent that we actually save more,\u201d Ms. Ferreras-Copeland told reporters. \u201cWe are very concerned about the potential wave that is coming our way.\u201dThe city budget last year included more than $8 billion in federal funds.While saying there was \u201cnothing Trump-specific\u201d in the budget, Mr. de Blasio spent much time talking about the new president and his proposals. He emphasized the importance of immigrants to the city\u2019s economy, trumpeted law enforcement spending and stressed investments in infrastructure, one of the few areas of possible agreement with the White House.The budget presentation, titled \u201cNew York Stands Strong,\u201d echoed many of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s public comments after the presidential election. It offered a vision of a city facing economic headwinds, but did not contain warnings of recession, a departure from last year\u2019s presentation. Instead, it pointed to expected increases in tax revenue in the next fiscal year after a decline during the current one.Many of the proposals \u2014 including money for repaving roads, assisting schools and financing programs for the Police Department \u2014 seemed like typical election-year fare for any mayor trying to please various constituencies, and many represented relatively small investments.The mayor\u2019s proposal for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, included $10.4 million to install bullet-resistant windows in police cars, and $6.3 million to hire 200 additional school crossing guards and 100 crossing guard supervisors.In his initial presentation, Mr. de Blasio did not mention the city\u2019s homelessness crisis, which has become a major vulnerability for him as he has struggles to find a way to care for a record number of people flooding into city shelters.\u201cWe have continued in this budget a lot of the investments we needed to make to continue to improve our approach to homelessness,\u201d he said, in response to a question. But budget documents made available later showed that while city spending on homelessness rose to an estimated $1.7 billion in the current fiscal year, above initial projections, the amount budgeted for the Department of Homeless Services in the coming fiscal year would be $257 million less than that.Freddi Goldstein, an administration spokeswoman, said that the mayor\u2019s office was evaluating its approach to homelessness and expected to include additional spending before the budget is approved.In a statement, the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog group, blamed inadequate management at City Hall for some of the spending increases.\u201cA substantial portion of the expenditure growth derives from challenges managing serious problems, notably an inability to stem the growth in homelessness and in the reliance on overtime among city agencies,\u201d the statement said.Currently, 292,418 full-time employees work for the city, the mayor\u2019s office said.Mr. de Blasio did not unveil any grand new plans on Tuesday. But he suggested one could be coming.Asked about plans for Rikers Island, including its possible closure, under study by an independent commission, Mr. de Blasio hinted at an announcement in the executive budget in the spring. He said he would \u201ccome back in the coming months with a long-term vision.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He said the media had unfairly emphasized the deaths over the agency\u2019s overall track record. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a single article about the children who are saved every day,\u201d he said.The \u201crespectfully,\u201d perhaps needless to say, soon vanished from that exchange.Advertisement"}

Hours earlier, a petroleum pipeline had exploded in a town outside Lagos, Nigeria, his home city, leaving more than 200 people dead. Hopping on his motorbike with his camera, Mr. Akinleye, a Reuters staff photographer based in Nigeria, swerved through miles of thick traffic and arrived on site in less than 30 minutes.Mr. Akinleye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sudden thrust into news media prominence is rare for even the most experienced photojournalists, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an even rarer occurrence for an African one. Of the most covered news events in sub-Saharan Africa over the past several years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including antigovernment protests in South Africa and Ethiopia, the Boko Haram kidnapping in northern Nigeria and West Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ebola crisis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 only a handful of stories were assigned to African photographers by major international publications. Looking at the previously published work from Akintunde Akinleye, Andrew Esiebo, LagosPhoto and more.Since World Press Photo released its initial report in 2015, Lars Boering, the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s managing director, said accessing data about their contest applicants as well as surveying the photojournalism industry were critical first steps in closing this gap. The organization recently held its first Joop Swart Master Class in Kenya, working with photographers across East Africa, and plans to host another one, in Accra, Ghana, this March. Other organizations, including the Magnum Foundation and the Prince Claus fund, have also invested in supporting photojournalists on the continent.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe needed to flip it open. It will make us vulnerable, but it was important to start talking about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Boering, who is based in Amsterdam. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a billion people living in Africa. We should make sure the visuals we get reflect our worldview.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Akinleye, who has spent the past decade covering West Africa for Reuters, said as digital cameras have become more accessible, he has seen a surge in the number of local photographers in the field. But better equipment hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily equated to more opportunities for aspiring photojournalists, he said. With the absence of formal photojournalism programs at universities, young photographers are not learning the fundamentals of storytelling and editing, Mr. Akinleye said. Independent newspapers in his country have also struggled to navigate hostile relations with government leaders known for threatening the local news media, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung people are asking, how do we get work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Akinleye, who noted that the majority of working photographers he knew in Africa were stringers for wire services.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have told them to look for opportunities abroad to gain exposure and to learn the ethical standards of the industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t working with Reuters, I probably would just be part of the crowd.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had taxi drivers and former studio photographers and we gave them cameras,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said two-time Pulitzer prize winning photojournalist, Muhammed Muheisen, who is currently the chief photographer for the Middle East, Pakistan and Afghanistan for the AP. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe region was getting a lot of attention, so it became a place where Iraqi photographers could develop and show their talent.\u00e2\u0080\u009dKhalid Mohammed, AP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief photographer in Iraq, was one of those emerging talents. Mr. Mohammed, who worked for an Iraqi newspaper before the war, gained the reputation of beating foreign photojournalists to deadly scenes and was one of six Iraqis on the AP team that won the Pulitzer Prize for photography in 2005. Many of his most striking images, including one showing the charred bodies of U.S. contractors hanging from a bridge in Fallujah in 2004, appeared  in publications around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI choose to cover the war to expose the crimes and violations against my people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Mohammed, who is currently in Mosul, wrote in an email interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had to be ready to accept the sacrifice and know that this picture may be the last image,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Mr. Muheisen, a Jordanian national born in Israel, said that until news organizations begin investing in more extensive coverage of African news, African photographers might have to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfind and broadcast their own stories\u00e2\u0080\u009d on various social media platforms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll you need to do is pay some attention to that region and give the photographers a chance to appear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Muheisen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no better way to tell a story then when you are in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a big believer in looking at images globally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Muluneh, who was born in Ethiopia and raised in Yemen and England. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to look beyond our borders to see what other photographers are producing in order for us to compete in the industry as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During the year, Ms. Muluneh, who worked as a freelance photographer at The Washington Post before returning to Ethiopia in 2007, puts on a series of monthly photography workshops for developing photographers with her company Desta for Africa Creative Consulting. Using social media and e-mail blasts to promote coming events, Ms. Muluneh also organizes photo walks, where she can reach younger photographers who may use only cellphone cameras. She said she organized her biennial photo festival in 2010 for an international market with hopes that editors at top news organizations would travel to Ethiopia and meet new talent.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to send somebody here to photograph,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Muluneh said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are folks here that are doing the work that just haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been given the opportunity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interested in photojournalism, but Africa has become a playground for photographers coming to tell the \u00e2\u0080\u0098truth\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about the continent and they get stuck on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098hopeless\u00e2\u0080\u0099 narrative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in the Lens post. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can sculpt so much more than this.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs budget cuts hit newsrooms across the country, Alice Gabriner, Time magazine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s international photo editor, said there was less money to assign long-term photo stories. To offset costs, Ms. Gabriner said she had to look for photographers with completed bodies of work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something she hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consistently found with African photographers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not seeing African photographers who are coming to me with their work saying this is work I can pick up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Gabriner, who previously worked as a national photo editor for Time, as well as a senior photo editor at National Geographic. To find new work, Ms. Gabriner travels to photo festivals and meets with photographers in her New York office, though she has not yet attended a photo festival in Africa.

His approach for recruiting photographers differs depending on the location, he said, as local talent in news media hubs like Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria are typically easier to recruit than in smaller regions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I am on location in different countries, I try to meet with new photographers and look at their work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Italian-born Mr. Longari, who is based in Johannesburg. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe set guidelines and manage expectations early on, so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any misunderstandings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn certain areas of the continent, the idea of photography is not yet developed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, noting that many photojournalists he meets are also working wedding photographers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe equipment is there. The focus should now be on visual literacy training.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs these programs continue to sprout in the region, Mr. Esiebo says he hopes African photographers will depend less on being published in international publications, but instead raise the standards of publications in their home countries.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do we raise the standards of our papers to be like The New York Times?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Esiebo asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should start from home and tell our stories better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Jared Kushner, a Trump In-Law and Adviser, Chases a Chinese Deal", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byIt was a mutually auspicious moment.Mr. Wu and Mr. Kushner \u2014 who is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and is one of his closest advisers \u2014 were nearing agreement on a joint venture in Manhattan: the redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue, the fading crown jewel of the Kushner family real-estate empire. Anbang, which has close ties to the Chinese state, has seen its aggressive efforts to buy up hotels in the United States slowed amid concerns raised by Obama administration officials who review foreign investments for national security risk.Now, according to two people with knowledge of the get-together, Mr. Wu toasted Mr. Trump and declared his desire to meet the president-elect, whose ascension, he was sure, would be good for global business.The Anbang talks, which have not previously been reported, began roughly six months ago \u2014 \u201cWell before the president-elect\u2019s victory,\u201d Mr. Kushner\u2019s spokeswoman, Risa Heller, noted. That was, however, just as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. While the talks are far along, representatives for Mr. Kushner said some points remained unresolved. Ms. Heller declined to outline the financial terms under discussion.Mr. Kushner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has hired a leading Washington law firm, WilmerHale, to advise him on how to comply with federal ethics laws should he join the White House staff as an adviser to the president. The firm has concluded that one potential sticking point, a federal anti-nepotism law, is not applicable, though not all ethics experts agree. While the law prohibits federal officials from hiring relatives for agencies they lead, Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyers argue, among other things, that the White House is not an agency and is therefore exempt.As for conflicts of interest, Mr. Kushner would be required to make limited financial disclosures, which could give the public a clearer picture of his holdings. And, unlike Mr. Trump, who as president will be exempt from conflict-of-interest laws, he would have to recuse himself from decisions with a \u201cdirect and predictable effect\u201d on his financial interests.Jamie S. Gorelick, a WilmerHale partner who served in the Clinton administration, said that while plans were not final, Mr. Kushner was taking significant steps to extricate himself from the family business. \u201cMr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws, and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take,\u201d she said.He will resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, and though the law does not require it, she said he would divest \u201csubstantial assets.\u201d She did not name them, but Ms. Heller said they would include his stake in 666 Fifth Avenue.Just how meaningful that plan is remains to be seen. Mr. Kushner\u2019s representatives declined to detail his personal financial interest in Kushner Companies\u2019 properties, and they said he intended to keep his interest in other properties beyond 666 Fifth Avenue. He also has a stake, through a family investment vehicle, in a private equity firm run by his brother, Joshua, with far-flung investments of its own.Mr. Kushner, who turns 36 on Tuesday, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. Already he is involved in steering policy, making personnel choices and serving as the middleman between foreign leaders, the White House and the president-elect in ways that could affect his business, even as companies like Anbang see opportunity in entering into new ventures with the president-elect\u2019s son-in-law.Indeed, despite a lack of foreign policy experience, Mr. Kushner is emerging as an important figure at a crucial moment for some of America\u2019s most complicated diplomatic relationships. Such is his influence in the geopolitical realm that transition officials have told the Obama White House that foreign policy matters that need to be brought to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention should be relayed through his son-in-law, according to a person close to the transition and a government official with direct knowledge of the arrangement.Ethics experts said that while the conflict-of-interest law is narrowly drawn, Mr. Kushner\u2019s mix of roles leads inevitably to ethical questions.Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, said deals like the one with Anbang \u201cmight not be illegal under the conflict-of-interest rules, but raise a strong appearance that a foreign entity is using Mr. Kushner\u2019s business to try to influence U.S. policy.\u201dWithout knowing details of Mr. Kushner\u2019s holdings and divestiture plans, he said, the merits of his proposal are hard to assess. Even if he divests his stake in certain properties, Mr. Sanderson added, \u201cit strikes me as a half-measure\u201d that \u201cstill poses a real conflict-of-interest issue and would be a drag on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency and cause the American people to question Mr. Kushner\u2019s role in policy making.\u201dLike the president-elect, Mr. Kushner built on the fortune of a successful father.Jared, 23 at the time of his father\u2019s conviction, had recently graduated from Harvard. He was studying for an M.B.A. and law degree at New York University in 2006 when he bought The New York Observer, at the time an influential weekly newspaper known for its coverage of the city\u2019s elite and high-end real estate.It is unclear exactly when he assumed control of the family business. The company now says he became chief executive in 2008, but contemporaneous news accounts rarely describe him that way until 2012. Nevertheless, Mr. Kushner quickly became the company\u2019s public face as it expanded across the Hudson River into Manhattan, much as Mr. Trump had left Queens for the big city decades before.Charles Kushner was released from federal custody in August 2006. He immediately resumed a significant role in the business and remains heavily involved today. Still, it was with Jared as headliner that the company soon made its biggest play ever: $1.8 billion for the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue that would remain at the center of its story to this day. It was the highest price ever paid for a single office building in the United States \u2014 and more than three times what its seller had paid six years earlier.Everything was looking up, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t. Within a year after the deal, the overheated lending market seized up and Kushner Companies struggled to repay its considerable loans \u2014 and to hold on to 666 Fifth Avenue. To the rescue over the next few years came the Carlyle Group, a giant private equity firm; Vornado Realty Trust, then a co-owner of two of Mr. Trump\u2019s largest properties; and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men.In the end, Mr. Kushner\u2019s company survived, and he and Ms. Trump became fixtures on the international boldface-name circuit.In August, they were spotted with Wendi Deng, an ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch, on the 453-foot yacht Rising Sun, owned by the entertainment mogul David Geffen. Several weeks later, they were photographed watching the United States Open tennis finals with the art collector Dasha Zhukova, wife of the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, a member of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle.Since 2012, Kushner Companies has been on a buying spree. It has acquired at least 120 properties, mostly a mix of existing commercial and residential buildings in New York and New Jersey, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics, a research firm.Recent deals include the $340 million acquisition of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 headquarters in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, and $345 million for a nearby plot of undeveloped land. Mr. Kushner\u2019s company also bought several floors of the old New York Times building for $295 million in 2015 from Lev Leviev, an Israeli who is chairman of one of the largest real estate development companies in Russia.Increasingly, the company is branching out across the country \u2014 to Philadelphia; Baltimore; Toledo, Ohio; and Kansas City, Mo. In Chicago, it owns the building that houses the Midwest headquarters of AT&T. In all, the company owns more than 20,000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space.Beyond real estate, Mr. Kushner has moved into the Wall Street, health care and tech spaces.But the money behind many of Mr. Kushner\u2019s real-estate investments remains a mystery. While the company lists dozens of partners on its website, it does not disclose the individuals behind those companies.One of the newest Kushner projects \u2014 a Trump-branded luxury apartment tower that opened in November in Jersey City \u2014 got nearly a quarter of its financing, about $50 million, from Chinese investors who are not publicly identified.Then there are the Kushners\u2019 continuing negotiations with Anbang\u2019s Mr. Wu, one of the most politically connected men in China.In 2015, Mr. Kushner began pursuing a grand vision for 666 Fifth Avenue. The renowned architect Zaha Hadid was asked to come up with a design to resculpt the 40-story, 1950s-era aluminum-clad office building, adding apartments, a hotel and a mall and nearly tripling its height to 1,400 feet.But the plan needed money, and while Mr. Kushner had managed to hang on to his family\u2019s flagship building, it still had a lot of debt, with a $1.1 billion loan coming due in 2019, and a good portion of the commercial office space vacant.Anbang, which got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004, had become one of the most aggressive Chinese buyers of United States real estate, and had begun investing in hotels. But it had encountered problems of its own; its byzantine ownership structure had given rise to concern on Wall Street and in Washington.Anbang\u2019s structure has stoked such suspicion about its true ownership that some Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley, have opted not to advise the company on United States mergers and acquisitions because they cannot get the information needed to satisfy their \u201cknow your client\u201d guidelines.National security concerns have also complicated Anbang\u2019s efforts to acquire other properties in the United States.One deal, to buy the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, fell apart in October amid concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or state-connected companies. The Hotel del Coronado is near a naval base, and deals involving proximity to national security infrastructure typically receive heightened scrutiny. Anbang was, however, able to acquire the other hotels in the same collection.But Anbang was nothing if not savvy. Company officials had cultivated a relationship with Benjamin M. Lawsky, who had earlier led the financial services agency, from May 2011 to June 2015. It was Mr. Lawsky, by then a consultant, who introduced Anbang to Kushner Companies, according to people with knowledge of how the discussions came about. Mr. Lawsky declined to comment.Mr. Kushner led the negotiations, his spokeswoman, Ms. Heller, confirmed. Kushner Companies would disclose little else about the joint venture, except to say that Anbang would become one of the equity partners in the building\u2019s redevelopment if an agreement is finalized. Anbang declined to comment.It was just coincidence that Mr. Kushner\u2019s Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf with Mr. Wu took place the week after the election, Ms. Heller said, adding that it had been in the works for a while.By the time of the meeting, Mr. Kushner had decided to hand off certain business relationships, including the one with Anbang, to others at Kushner Companies, according to Ms. Heller, and it was for that reason that he invited his father and Laurent Morali, the president of Kushner Companies. She said he planned to sell his stake in 666 Fifth before the closing of any Anbang deal, but she declined to name the potential buyers or the price Mr. Kushner hoped to get.Ms. Heller stressed in her statement that the United States has \u201cnot found Anbang to be a state-owned enterprise\u201d \u2014 an important technical point, given that the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause prohibits the acceptance of payments and gifts from foreign governments.Should it consummate its deal with Anbang, she said, Kushner Companies will seek any necessary approvals from the federal government. She expressed confidence that any deal would pass muster with the foreign investment committee, citing the fact that it did not block the Chinese company from buying the Waldorf Astoria.Come Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated, that committee will be made up of his cabinet members, and the process is such that the president has the final say.On China, Mr. Trump has talked a tough game, accusing Beijing of currency manipulation and raising the possibility of a trade war. But whether that is only a negotiating tactic remains to be seen. The president-elect has his own financial entanglements with China: He owns a 30 percent stake in a partnership that owes roughly $950 million to a group of lenders that includes the Bank of China, and one of his biggest tenants at Trump Tower is another state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.With Anbang a magnet for controversy, Mr. Kushner has kept the negotiations under wraps. But a week after the Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf, Mr. Kushner\u2019s father and Mr. Wu met at the hotel for lunch. After the elder Mr. Kushner departed, Mr. Wu was clearly elated.\u201cI love you guys,\u201d he exclaimed in English to his remaining entourage, according to one person present.Nina Bernstein, Michael Forsythe, Megan Twohey, Leslie Picker and Charles V.

{"Headline": "Metal Detectorists Help Archaeologists Dig Up a Secret History", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byNEW LONDON, Conn. \u2014 Keith Wille was metal detecting in the woods of Connecticut a few years ago when he found a triangle of brass about two-and-a-half inches long with a small hole in the middle. He thought little of the find at first, and threw it in his scrap pile. Mr. Wille, 29, is a manager at a survival training company, but spends most of his spare time metal detecting.Inside the museum, Mr. Wille unpacked his boxes, displaying items discovered around the Pequots\u2019 homeland: George Washington inaugural buttons, musket and cannon balls, a gold ring, commemorative spoons, a 100-year-old military insignia and the triangle of brass.Dr. McBride, the museum\u2019s director of research, and David J. Naumec, its senior historian, inspected the lot, but were most curious about the crude brass triangle. They knew it was a kettle point, an arrowhead fashioned from a piece of a brass trade kettle (which resembles a pail) \u2014 an archaeological signature of the 17th century.The two scientists were finishing a seven-year project documenting the Pequot War of 1637, especially the running battle the English fought as they retreated to their ship, after massacring the Pequots at Mistick Fort.Many archaeologists consider metal detectorists looters who shouldn\u2019t be allowed anywhere near their labs or dig sites, but Dr. McBride has a different view.\u201cIt\u2019s a real ongoing debate in the profession,\u201d he said. \u201cTo what extent do we embrace hobbyists or amateurs? You\u2019re not going to stop them so \u2026 join them.\u201dAt first Dr. McBride and Mr. Naumec tried to do some metal-detecting themselves on the battlefield in 2008. \u201cWe figured it wasn\u2019t rocket science,\u201d he said. But they learned that while it\u2019s not hard to find a dime lying on the floor, it takes years of practice to recognize the sound of a musket ball eight inches underground and then determine its provenance.The scientists then reached out to local metal detecting clubs and formed an unconventional alliance with several detectorists, deputizing a few citizen-scientists who already spend free time looking for what archaeologists want. With so many significant Pequot war-era sites still undiscovered, the relationship has begun to produce results.The metal-finding enthusiasts tend to be wary of archaeologists and authorities in general, who might restrict their access to a place or take away their finds. Yet when one detectorist, George Pecia, started working with the archaeologists, he realized they could benefit each other. The detectorists get to search areas otherwise off-limits and \u201cpiece together a mystery, which is what detecting is about,\u201d Mr. Pecia said, and the scientists get an efficient way to find anything metal.He and others scanned the dig sites, and Dr. McBride paid them through a grant from the National Park Service\u2019s American Battlefield Protection Program that funds his fieldwork. \u201cWe call them Jedi masters,\u201d Dr. McBride said, pointing out that detectorists had found about 80 percent of the artifacts cataloged in the project. \u201cEven with the most intense digging, we would have found about 5 percent or less of the objects recovered through metal detecting,\u201d he said.At the lab, Mr. Wille told the archaeologists about scraps of brass and lead he found close to the kettle point. Nearby, he also struck a layer of shells and two stone arrow heads. \u201cMan, we got to check this spot out!\u201d Mr. Naumec said. \u201cBrass scrap gets us excited. We look for a weird lead \u2014 the shells!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a huge signature,\u201d he explained. \u201cA shell heap or shell midden \u2014 it\u2019s basically their trash.\u201dIn late November, Mr. Wille led Dr. McBride to where he had found the kettle point, a high, level spot now entirely covered with brambles and small oak trees. Dr. McBride logged the situational details of the find in his iPad.The site got him thinking about the months and years after the English defeated the Pequots. The survivors were handed over to the Mohegans and Narragansetts, the Pequots\u2019 traditional enemies who fought with the English. It was \u201cbasically cultural genocide,\u201d Dr. McBride said. Men were beheaded, women sold to other English colonies. The postwar treaty specified: \u201cYou shall no longer be called Pequot.\u201dThose given to the Mohegans were resettled, away from their traditional homeland, in five villages. A 1638 letter from Roger Williams, who founded Rhode Island, to John Winthrop, governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, said that four of the five villages were by the Thames River near present-day New London. The precise locations of the villages, which were occupied from 1638 to 1651, were unknown.Crouching over his iPad, the archaeologist looked up at Mr. Wille and said, \u201cI think you\u2019ve got one.\u201d\u201cThe adze, the point, brass scrap \u2014 to me, it\u2019s highly suggestive of one of those villages,\u201d said Dr. McBride, listing other artifacts Mr. Wille had found in the area, especially an iron adze. A burial from the early 1600s had also been discovered nearby. \u201cIt all kind of fits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe always had a sense they\u2019re along the river, but I never, never, thought I\u2019d be standing on one.\u201dMr. Wille may have discovered \u201cthe first forced resettlement\u201d of a native people, Dr. McBride said. The site predates Mashantucket, the first Native American reservation that was established in 1666, where the Pequot museum now sits.If this spot had not been found until now, and it took a metal detectorist to find it, Mr. Wille asked: Would it sway the negative opinion that other archaeologists have of metal detectorists?\u201cNo,\u201d Dr. McBride said, but added: \u201cWe\u2019ve done modeling. You can dig forever and not find the stuff you found in, what, a couple of hours?\u201d\u201cI found the kettle point the first time I was here,\u201d Mr. Wille said. \u201cI probably spent two hours.\u201dThe two men walked downhill to where the adze, a cutting tool with an arched blade, was found. Mr. Wille fetched his detector from the car, wanting to use the remaining daylight to search the area more thoroughly.Dr. McBride knelt to log the location.The difference between archaeology and looting, explained Brian Jones, Connecticut\u2019s state archaeologist, is the recording of context. Detectorists tend to be \u201cfocused on the things,\u201d Dr. Jones said, adding, \u201cArtifacts are important to archaeologists, but really only in the story they tell, and you can\u2019t tell the story unless you know where things are found.\u201d Many detectorists mean well, but if an object is removed from its surroundings without a detailed survey of the area, the story is lost, Dr. Jones said, \u201cand it\u2019s really just looting.\u201dThis is why some archaeologists \u201cstart tearing their hair out and turning red\u201d when approached by detectorists, he said. \u201cA lot of important archaeological sites have been damaged beyond any future scientific use by metal detectorists,\u201d Dr. Jones said. But he complimented Dr. McBride\u2019s work, noting that it was in the vanguard of archaeologically responsible metal detecting.\u201cNinety-percent of what is out there has never been found; we don\u2019t have time to be out looking for sites,\u201d Dr. Jones said, adding that much of his time was spent trying to preserve known historic sites from development. The majority of finds, then, will either stay in the ground or be discovered by amateurs.When Mr. Wille returned with his detector, he set it to find large pieces of iron, at Dr. McBride\u2019s suggestion. Within 10 minutes the machine made a loud squeal. Mr. Wille jabbed his shovel in a circle and pulled out an eight-inch-thick plug of earth. Digging a bit more and using a vibrating pin pointer, he extracted a flat oblong piece of iron about four inches long, wider and curved at one end, flat on the other.He handed it to Dr. McBride, who brushed the dirt off and looked closely. \u201cThat\u2019s worth an X-ray,\u201d he said. \u201cIt vaguely resembles the shapes we see in other sites.\u201d It looked like a tool, possibly traded to the Pequots, or repurposed by them. Dr. McBride said he would like to check it against finds from Jamestown Fort in Virginia or Plymouth, Mass., both contemporaneous sites. \u201cAn intriguing shape,\u201d he said.Dr. McBride says there is a \u201cbetter than even\u201d chance that Mr. Wille discovered the site of Tatuppequauog, one of the villages mentioned in the 1638 letter. The letter said it had 20 houses; Dr. McBride estimated that about 200 people might have lived there, a large enough village to account for the distance between where the adze and kettle point were found.If it is Tatuppequauog, Mr. Wille would be listed as the discoverer. While he displayed little emotion that afternoon during the search, afterward he was ecstatic that his pasttime might contribute to history. \u201cYou become a part of something bigger than filling your cabinet with musket balls and belt buckles,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Debt Projected to Grow by Nearly $10 Trillion Over Next Decade", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byThe deficit figures released Tuesday will be a major challenge to House Republicans, who were swept to power in 2010 on fears of a bloated deficit and who made controlling red ink a major part of their agenda under former President Barack Obama.Statutory caps imposed in 2011 on domestic and military spending have helped temper the deficit. But those controls are likely to be swamped by health care and Social Security spending that will rise with an aging population.At a confirmation hearing on Tuesday, senators from both parties peppered Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to be the White House budget director, with questions about how Mr. Trump intended to keep his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare while addressing the budget shortfall.Mr. Mulvaney said that it would be his role to deliver hard truths to Mr. Trump. One of those truths, he suggested, could be the need to raise the eligibility age for Social Security, a proposal that is sure to be contentious.\u201cI haven\u2019t been quiet and shy since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cI have to imagine the president knew what he was getting when he asked me to fill this role. I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s why he hired me.\u201dHe added, \u201cI believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later.\u201dThe deficit is expected to shrink this fiscal year and next before increasing in 2019 and beyond. Deficits would cumulatively total $9.4 trillion from 2018 to 2027, the budget office projects. By 2023, the deficit would reach $1 trillion, and in 2027, a projected $1.4 trillion deficit would be equal to 5 percent of the economy.Most economists believe that deficits are helpful when economies are in recession, but some say that when they are near full employment, as the United States economy is now, deficits should be kept below 3 percent of the economy to avoid a drag on investment \u2014 or worse, a financial crisis.The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s budget and economic outlook said that the share of debt held by the public was expected to reach 89 percent of gross domestic product in 2027. That level could increase the risk of a financial crisis and raise the possibility that investors will become skittish about financing the government\u2019s borrowing, some economists say, although many countries have far higher debt levels.\u201cWithout changes to the federal budget, we are on a path to fiscal crisis with spending, deficits and debt continuing to balloon out of control,\u201d said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the group.Besides the deficit, tepid economic growth is also a concern. Over the next 10 years, real economic output is projected to grow at an annual rate of 1.9 percent.Mr. Trump has promised that his combination of tax cuts and investment in infrastructure will push growth above 4 percent, and Mr. Mulvaney argued on Tuesday that spurring growth was the most effective way of reducing the debt without imposing painful cuts to social safety-net programs.Some senators such as Angus King, independent of Maine, warned against a return to much-debated theories that tax cuts would generate enough growth to pay for themselves and reduce the deficit.Democrats are likely to oppose large tax cuts, but they will press Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to spend big on infrastructure. Senate Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a $1 trillion plan to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads, bridges, rails, transit systems, airports, sewer systems and power grid. \u201cWe will not cut middle-class programs like education and health care to pay for it,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.When it was pointed out that he was proposing the kind of deficit spending that Republicans were sure to balk at, Mr. Schumer was dismissive.\u201cWe Democrats believe that this should be a measure to get the economy going,\u201d he said.Republicans are pressing their own spending priorities, urging passage of legislation that would lift statutory spending caps on national defense, imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, while leaving in place the caps on domestic spending.In one of the testier exchanges of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s two confirmation hearings on Tuesday, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, actually pressed the nominee to accept more military spending, castigating him for struggling to remember his House votes to cut military budgets.\u201cBoy, I\u2019ll tell you, I would remember if I voted to cut our defenses the way you did, Congressman,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t take it with the seriousness that it deserves.\u201dLike many of Mr. Trump\u2019s picks, Mr. Mulvaney has taken positions that contradict Mr. Trump, and it remained unclear how that dynamic would play out in the White House if he is confirmed.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the former Democratic presidential candidate, said that Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s views on the deficit, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid were out of sync with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to protect the programs. He said he feared that Mr. Mulvaney would pull the president to the right.\u201cIt does not make sense to me to have a key adviser to the president having views directly in opposition to what the president campaigned on,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Despite the concern about a growing deficit, the tenor of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s nomination hearings did not reflect the sense of anxiety that was palpable when Mr. Obama was assembling his economic team during the financial crisis eight years ago.

(Mr. de Blasio, in part because of earlier fund-raising and Mr. Massey\u2019s spending spree, has more than twice as much money in the bank as Mr. Massey. The mayor is also participating in the city\u2019s generous matching funds program and already has contributions that will qualify him for more than $2 million in public financing. Mr. Massey has opted out of that program.)As the latest businessman to shoot for City Hall, following in the footsteps of Michael R. Bloomberg and others, Mr. Massey plans to sell himself to New Yorkers as an experienced manager who can do a better job of running the city than Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat.\u201cAs people get to know me they\u2019re going to realize I\u2019m the manager for the job,\u201d Mr. Massey said in an interview in his campaign office on the 12th floor of a building on Fifth Avenue near Madison Square (monthly rent: about $13,000).But Mr. Massey, who favors tightly knotted neckties and crisp white shirts, was vague about how he would get his message across, falling into business-speak.\u201cIt\u2019s a multipronged strategy,\u201d he said more than once, adding that he would reach out to New Yorkers through social media, more traditional media and community visits.At the moment, Mr. Massey is mostly connected to his campaign team. Douglas E. Schoen, his chief strategist, is a veteran consultant and pollster best known for his work with Democrats like Bill and Hillary Clinton; he was also Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s pollster.Mr. Schoen said an internal poll showing that most New Yorkers did not recognize Mr. Massey\u2019s name was not a handicap.\u201cThat is an interesting data point, but not of fundamental importance in determining what will happen nine, 10 months from now,\u201d Mr. Schoen said.The campaign paid Mr. Schoen $210,000 between September and January, according to its finance report.Most of the consultants Mr. Massey has hired have deep New York Republican bloodlines, many with ties to former Gov. George E. Pataki. They include the Republican pollster Arthur J. Finkelstein; Chris Larson, a Republican operative close to Mr. Pataki; Cathy Blaney, a fund-raiser who has worked for Mr. Pataki, Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo; Adam Stoll, a former campaign manager for Mr. Pataki; and Ann W. Herberger, a longtime fund-raiser for members of the Bush family.In addition, William F. B. O\u2019Reilly, an adviser to many Republican campaigns, is acting as Mr. Massey\u2019s spokesman; other advisers include Mike DuHaime, who advised the presidential campaigns of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and Michael Lawler, a former executive director of the state Republican Party who was campaign manager for Rob Astorino during his failed bid for governor.Mr. Bloomberg, however, is a billionaire who completely financed his campaigns with his own money. He spent more than $70 million on his initial run in 2001, $84 million in 2005 and $108 million when he ran for a third term in 2009.Mr. Massey is a mere millionaire, and he says he will pay for his campaign with a mix of his own money and contributions.\u201cPeople needed to understand his life story first, then learn what he stood for and how he was going to make their lives better,\u201d Edward Skyler, the press secretary during Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s 2001 campaign, said of Mr. Bloomberg.Mr. Schoen would not say if Mr. Massey would do something similar, although he said television advertising was still the most powerful tool for the candidate to reach voters.Mr. Massey has a big hurdle running as a Republican in a city where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by six to one.Mr. Massey, who has long lived in Larchmont, in Westchester County, and voted for the first time as a New York City resident last year (he has an apartment on Park Avenue), said he had written in Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s name on the presidential ballot.\u201cThere are many things that I disagree on in terms of Donald Trump\u2019s policies,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in women\u2019s equality on every level.\u201dHe also said he disagreed with Mr. Trump on immigration policy and health care. \u201cThere will be no wall around New York City,\u201d he said, explaining that he was referring to immigration.Still, the biggest challenge for Mr. Massey may be the most basic: articulating a strong rationale for his candidacy. At a time of low crime, rising employment and a building boom, he will have to present an argument for why voters should boot their Democratic mayor in favor of a Republican real estate executive.Mr. Massey has also spent heavily on campaign employees, many of them from the real estate world. He paid a total of more than $727,000 to four employees, all men, from early September to early January.In an interview in December, Mr. Massey seemed a bit wooden in trotting out stock criticisms of Mr. de Blasio, and had to be prompted to do so by an aide. In the January interview, the criticisms flowed more freely, as he poked at Mr. de Blasio\u2019s work ethic, cited state and federal investigations into the mayor\u2019s fund-raising and skewered his handling of homelessness and his ability to create enough affordable housing.But in both interviews he was unable to give details about how he would tackle those issues.\u201cIn the first 100 days, people will see radical change\u201d in policy toward the homeless, he said, adding that he would appoint a group of experts who would come up with a way to \u201ctear apart\u201d the homeless shelter system. He was unable to say what he would replace it with.Mr. Massey also said he would outdo Mr. de Blasio\u2019s push to build and preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing over 10 years, adding that as a real estate executive he could be more effective than the mayor on housing issues. He pledged to build or preserve 400,000 units, but again was unable to give details.How would he do it? With \u201ca multitude of programs.\u201dWhen? \u201cOver a very quick period of time that we are going to delineate down the road.\u201dMr. Massey\u2019s name was left off the survey because the pollsters believed that too few people knew him. They said they would include him in their next poll.J. David Goodman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Choice of Trade Negotiator, Trump Prepares to Confront Mexico and China", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump on Tuesday named as his chief trade negotiator a Washington lawyer who has long advocated protectionist policies, the latest sign that Mr. Trump intends to fulfill his campaign promise to get tough with China, Mexico and other trading partners.Mainstream economists warn that protectionist policies like import taxes could impose higher prices on consumers and slow economic growth.\u201cWe wanted him to know that we\u2019ll work with him on doing that,\u201d Mr. Trumka said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has enough Republican support to do it, and rewriting the rules of trade is a necessary first step in righting the economy for working people.\u201dMr. Trump and his top advisers on trade, including Mr. Lighthizer, share a view that the United States in recent decades prioritized the ideal of free trade over its own self-interest. They argue that other countries are undermining America\u2019s industrial base by subsidizing their own export industries while impeding American importers. They regard this unfair competition as a key reason for the lackluster growth of the economy.In picking Mr. Lighthizer, who has spent much of the last few decades representing American steel producers in their frequent litigation of trade disputes, Mr. Trump is seeking to hire one of Washington\u2019s top trade lawyers to enforce international trade agreements more vigorously. He must be confirmed by the Senate.\u201cHe will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement.Mainstream Republicans have sought common ground with Mr. Trump, emphasizing, for example, the importance of enforcing trade rules, but they have not abandoned the party\u2019s longtime advocacy for trade. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which will hold hearings on Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s nomination, issued a cautiously supportive statement Tuesday.\u201cAs the world and our economic competitors move to expand their global footprints, we can\u2019t afford to be left behind in securing strong deals that will increase our access to new markets for American-made products and services,\u201d Mr. Hatch said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to a vigorous discussion of Bob\u2019s trade philosophy and priorities.\u201d\u201cThose who say U.S.T.R. will be subordinated to other agencies are mistaken,\u201d said Alan Wolff, another former senior American trade official who was the steel industry\u2019s co-counsel on trade with Mr. Lighthizer for nearly 20 years, citing Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge of trade law. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a dominant figure on trade, in harmony with Wilbur Ross and Navarro.\u201dProponents of trade hope the broader circle, and congressional Republicans, will exert a moderating influence.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a pretty clear indication that there will be a focus on the enforcement of our trade agreements and on the letter of the law,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer at White & Case. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a significant turn toward protectionism. Even free trade guys like me support enforcement.\u201dTrade opponents on the left and the right, meanwhile, are hoping Mr. Trump means to break with several decades of pro-trade policy.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a war within the Trump administration on where they go with trade, and we\u2019re hoping to energize the worker base he had to make sure they go in the right direction to benefit the American worker,\u201d Mr. Trumka said.A broader shift in trade policy would unfold more slowly. Mr. Trump has promised to renegotiate Nafta; the original process took most of three years. He has promised to pursue enforcement actions against other nations, but it takes time to mount cases. He has threatened to impose new tariffs on imports, but sweeping changes most likely would require congressional legislation.Mr. Trump already is seeking to exert influence by seizing the presidential bullhorn.\u201cGeneral Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,\u201d he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. \u201cMake in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\u201dGeneral Motors announced in 2015 that it would make the Cruze in Coahuila, Mexico. American manufacturers are moving small-car production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs and because of declining domestic demand. They continue to build more expensive vehicles in the United States.Ford\u2019s announcement Tuesday does not reverse that trend. The carmaker said it still planned to move production of the compact Ford Focus from Michigan to Mexico. But it said it would invest in a different Michigan plant to expand production of higher-priced vehicles, including its F-150 pickup truck and the Mustang sports car, as well as a new battery-powered sport utility vehicle.\u201cWe are encouraged by the pro-growth policies that President-elect Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue,\u201d said the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields.Mr. Lighthizer served as deputy United States trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration, when he was involved in pressing Japan to reduce its restrictions on American imports and its subsidies for its own exports. Mr. Trump has criticized China for similar practices, setting the stage for a new round of confrontations.Reagan is often remembered as an advocate for free trade, but his administration in its early hours imposed a quota on Japanese auto imports. It was the first in a long series of measures aimed at putting pressure on the nation that was then regarded, like China in recent years, as a threat to American prosperity.Keith Bradsher and Neal E.

{"Headline": "The Internal Invasion", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byThis is a remarkable day in the history of our country. We have never over our centuries inaugurated a man like Donald Trump as president of the United States. You can select any random group of former presidents \u2014 Madison, Lincoln, Hoover, Carter \u2014 and none of them are like Trump.We\u2019ve never had a major national leader as professionally unprepared, intellectually ill informed, morally compromised and temperamentally unfit as the man taking the oath on Friday. So let\u2019s not lessen the shock factor that should reverberate across this extraordinary moment.It took a lot to get us here. It took a once-in-a-century societal challenge \u2014 the stresses and strains brought by the global information age \u2014 and it took a political system that was too detached and sclerotic to understand and deal with them.There are many ways to capture this massive failure, but I\u2019d rely on the old sociological distinction between gemeinschaft and gesellschaft. All across the world, we have masses of voters who live in a world of gemeinschaft: where relationships are personal, organic and fused by particular affections. These people define their loyalty to community, faith and nation in personal, in-the-gut sort of ways.But we have a leadership class and an experience of globalization that is from the world of gesellschaft: where systems are impersonal, rule based, abstract, indirect and formal.Many people in Europe love their particular country with a vestigial affection that is like family \u2014 England, Holland or France. But meritocratic elites of Europe gave them an abstract intellectual construct called the European Union.Many Americans think their families and their neighborhoods are being denuded by the impersonal forces of globalization, finance and technology. All the Republican establishment could offer was abstract paeans to the free market. All the Democrats could offer was Hillary Clinton, the ultimate cautious, remote, calculating, gesellschaft thinker.It was the right moment for Trump, the ultimate gemeinschaft man. He is all gut instinct, all blood and soil, all about loyalty over detached reason. His business is a pre-modern family clan, not an impersonal corporation, and he is staffing his White House as a pre-modern family monarchy, with his relatives and a few royal retainers. In his business and political dealings, he simply doesn\u2019t acknowledge the difference between private and public, personal and impersonal. Everything is personal, pulsating outward from his needy core.The very thing that made him right electorally for this moment will probably make him an incompetent president. He is the ultimate anti-institutional man, but the president sits at the nerve center of a routinized, regularized four-million-person institution. If the figure at the center can\u2019t give consistent, clear and informed direction, the whole system goes haywire, with vicious infighting and creeping anarchy.Some on the left worry that we are seeing the rise of fascism, a new authoritarian age. That gets things exactly backward. The real fear in the Trump era should be that everything will become disorganized, chaotic, degenerate, clownish and incompetent.The real fear should be that Trump is Captain Chaos, the ignorant dauphin of disorder. All the standard practices, norms, ways of speaking and interacting will be degraded and shredded. The political system and the economy will grind to a battered crawl.That\u2019s ultimately why this could be a pivotal day. For the past few decades our leadership class has been polarized. We\u2019ve wondered if there is some opponent out there that could force us to unite and work together. Well, that opponent is being inaugurated, not in the form of Trump the man, but in the form of the chaos and incompetence that will likely radiate from him, month after month. For America to thrive, people across government will have to cooperate and build arrangements to quarantine and work around the president.People in the defense, diplomatic and intelligence communities will have to build systems to prevent him from intentionally or unintentionally bumbling into a global crisis. People in his administration and in Congress will have to create systems so his ill-informed verbal spasms don\u2019t derail coherent legislation.If Trump\u2019s opponents behave as clownishly as he does \u2014 like the congressmen who are narcissistically boycotting the inaugural \u2014 the whole government will get further delegitimized. But if people redouble their commitment to constitutional norms and practices, to substance and dignity, this thing is survivable.Already you see the political system uniting to contain Trump. In negotiations on the Hill, administration officials feel free to ignore his verbiage on health care and other issues. Members of his team are already good at pretending that Trump doesn\u2019t mean what he clearly does mean, on matters of NATO and much else.I\u2019ve been rewatching \u201cYes, Minister\u201d these days. That was a hilarious British sitcom about a permanent government apparatus that contained and overruled a bumbling political master. America will need a beneficent version of that sort of clever cooperation.With Trump it\u2019s not the ideology, it\u2019s the disorder. Containing that could be the patriotic cause that brings us together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Senate Move Quickly to Repeal Affordable Care Act", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byTransition Briefing\u25a0 President-elect Donald J. Trump and Senate Republicans moved quickly to begin dismantling the Affordable Care Act.\u25a0 Hillary and Bill Clinton will attend Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing in on Jan. 20. Awkward.\u25a0 A White House job for Omarosa Manigault, the reality TV star.That didn\u2019t take long.Before the new members could even be sworn in, Senate Republicans revealed the parliamentary language that congressional Republicans will use to dismantle Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act, without fear of a filibuster by Democrats in the coming months.The instructions are simple and vague: The Senate Finance and the Health Committees, along with the House Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees, have until Jan. 27 to \u201creport changes in laws\u201d within their jurisdiction \u201cto reduce the deficit by not less than $1,000,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2017 through 2026.\u201dTranslation: The Senate and House have barely more than three weeks to complete legislation that reduces the deficit slightly over the next decade and, in the process, guts the Affordable Care Act beyond repair.Debate will begin on the Senate floor on Wednesday, bypassing the Senate Budget Committee to speed passage.Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to amplify the message.Left unsaid: What will happen to more than 20 million Americans now insured under the Affordable Care Act, or to the 27 percent of Americans with pre-existing medical conditions who, under the health care act, cannot be denied coverage by insurance companies?It is customary for former presidents and first ladies to observe the peaceful transfer of power in person. Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, will also be in Washington on Jan. 20 for the inaugural festivities.Not since Al Gore shared the stage with Mr. Bush in 2001 has such an awkward pairing occurred at an inauguration. Mr. Gore won the popular vote in 2000 and only conceded the loss after the United States Supreme Court intervened to stop a recount in Florida. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss was less contested, but her victory total in the popular vote, by 2,864,974 million votes, dwarfed Mr. Gore\u2019s 543,895 margin in 2000. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s total popular vote was the largest for a losing candidate since 1876.Omarosa Manigault, an original series star of Mr. Trump\u2019s reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d is expected to have a senior role in the Office of Public Engagement at the White House, a senior transition official said.Ms. Manigault has no government experience. But she has been deeply loyal to Mr. Trump, and was among his few well-known black supporters during the campaign.Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, made a forceful plea on Tuesday for the Senate not to confirm Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as attorney general, recalling when the two men were on opposite sides of a racially tinged case three decades ago, and calling Mr. Sessions \u201cthe wrong person to place in charge of our justice system.\u201dIn 1985, Mr. Sessions, then a federal prosecutor in Alabama, brought criminal charges against three black voting rights activists for helping older black voters, many of whom had been barred from voting for most of their lives, fill out absentee ballots. One of the lawyers for the defense in that case was Mr. Patrick, who was working for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and later became head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division under President Bill Clinton.A jury acquitted the defendants.In a letter sent Tuesday to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Patrick, who is black, wrote that Mr. Sessions relied on a baseless theory \u2014 that helping someone to vote is illegal \u2014 and did so selectively, targeting black people who had helped black voters. Mr. Patrick is a Democrat, and Mr. Sessions, nominated by Mr. Trump to lead the Justice Department, is a Republican.\u201cTo use prosecutorial discretion to attempt to criminalize voter assistance is wrong and should be disqualifying for any aspirant to the nation\u2019s highest law enforcement post,\u201d he wrote. And while absentee ballots were in widespread use, \u201cMr. Sessions investigated only the use by black voters and only where white incumbents were losing political ground.\u201dIt has been a busy day for the president-elect on Twitter, but he took the time to prepare his supporters for a late flurry of transfers from Guant\u00e1namo Bay that Mr. Obama plans in the coming days.All of the men set to leave the prison are on a list of those recommended for transfer, if security conditions can be met in the receiving country, by six United States security agencies. Most have been held for about 14 years in wartime detention without trial and are from unstable countries, like Yemen, which complicated efforts to find a place to send them.While Mr. Obama failed to fulfill his vow to close the Guant\u00e1namo prison, he refused to place any new detainees there and has whittled its population from the 242 prisoners he inherited from the administration of President George W. Bush.Mr. Trump has vowed to keep the prison open and \u201cload it up with some bad dudes.\u201dThe protest season is beginning even before the swearing in.Officials of the N.A.A.C.P. and its Alabama chapter occupied Mr. Sessions\u2019s office in Mobile, Ala., demanding that the senator withdraw his name from consideration to be the next attorney general.Mr. Trump, whose campaign for the White House was centered on an anti-trade and anti-globalization message, on Tuesday selected Robert E. Lighthizer, an international trade lawyer who has argued in favor of protectionist policies in some cases, as his United States trade representative.In Mr. Lighthizer, a top trade attorney representing multinational companies at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom who was a trade official for Ronald Reagan, Mr. Trump has selected a seasoned negotiator who is intimately familiar with the benefits of global agreements. But Mr. Lighthizer has also been outspoken in pointing out their potential harm to United States interests. It is not clear what role he will play in the Trump administration now that the president-elect has created a White House National Trade Council and placed Peter Navarro, an economist who is a leading critic of China, at its helm.\u201cGiven the Tea Party\u2019s desire to restore America\u2019s greatness, it will push Washington to stand up to China and re-establish American pre-eminence, even at the cost of the country\u2019s free-trade record,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer wrote.In response to the announcement, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and an ardent free-trade supporter, appears to have given up on the kinds of expansive multilateral trade deals, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that he once championed. What is left of the free-trade caucus now appears content with small deals with individual countries.\u201cThe incoming Trump administration has a unique opportunity to pursue new, bilateral trade pacts of the highest caliber that can be submitted to Congress for an up-or-down vote with no amendments,\u201d Mr. Hatch wrote.The president-elect, who targeted Boeing on its Air Force One upgrade, Lockheed on its advanced military fighter jet and, of course, Carrier on its Indianapolis furnace plant, seems to have taken a shine to General Motors.And G.M. has now responded:G.M. imports hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, which was only a small percentage of the 172,000 Cruzes sold through November, said Patrick Morrissey, a spokesman.With less than three weeks left before he leaves office, Mr. Obama has a more immediate concern in Congress: how to prevent Mr. Trump and Republicans from rolling back his domestic accomplishments, especially the Affordable Care Act.Mr. Obama, who returned on Monday from a two-week vacation in Hawaii, plans to make a rare visit to Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning to huddle privately with House and Senate Democrats and discuss how to thwart the coming Republican assault on his legacy.A handful of Republicans \u2014 including several former governors and members of Congress \u2014 have joined with liberal ethics activists in pressing Mr. Trump to sell his business assets to prevent White House conflicts that could be \u201cseriously damaging\u201d to the presidency.But the letter suggests that Mr. Trump is beginning to face calls from a broadening universe of people to take more aggressive steps to eliminate potential conflicts, such as selling off his real estate holdings and businesses before taking office.\u201cThe only way to solve the problems you face remains divesting into a blind trust managed by an independent trustee or the equivalent,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAs long as you continue to maintain ownership of the Trump Organization, no other steps that you take will prevent the serious conflicts of interest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Or it could be those nonsensical patches of facial hair.One senses that something ultimately did happen between him and Carrie back in Berlin; he has spent enough time with Franny for her to miss him, and vice versa, and his news that he\u2019s \u201cmet someone\u201d seems to disturb Carrie in ways that belie the disdain she continues to profess for his offers of a life partnership.It\u2019s a tricky situation. Otto\u2019s clearly not a fan of Carrie\u2019s new legal defense venture, for reasons that are a little hard to fathom. And it\u2019s an open question whether he had a role in financing her foray into brownstone Brooklyn. (\u2018Fess up: is there a single New Yorker \u2014 current or former \u2014 who watched this episode without wondering how Carrie, with her past career in government and nonprofit salary, now has managed to procure herself such a nice piece of real estate?)Turning to what may be more serious matters: The aggrieved Sekou Bah is a nice addition to Homeland\u2019s roster of handsome, vulnerable, angry and sure-to-be-horribly-mistreated young men. In fact, he\u2019s currently so compelling \u2014 his prayer mat a tiny island of order and purity in a filthy, decrepit, dog-eat-dog landscape \u2014 that I wonder if he isn\u2019t destined to win our trust, raise our hopes, then turn out to be evil. My gut says he\u2019s a good guy; some of you may well disagree. If you recall, I showed terrible judgment about the treacherous Allison Carr last season.I\u2019m glad to see Dar Adal is already playing such a prominent role, too. And wearing a suit! Haunting what appears to be an exclusive paneled club! Stabbing Saul in the back, or perhaps protecting him, who can tell the difference? And \u2014 did my eyes deceive me \u2014 I thought I saw a hint of humanness, in the whiff of desire making its way toward the young, blunt and beautiful Israeli agent.\u201cPoor old Saul,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope he\u2019s sworn off women.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t we all?\u201d Dar drawls.That will end badly.What do you make of this curious new president? (\u201cMadam President-Elect,\u201d she corrects, in a moment meant, I imagine, to make us cringe.)She\u2019s obviously not modeled on hawkish Hillary Clinton \u2014 a fortuitous creative decision. And she\u2019s clearly meant to be a bit off, with her uncouth spoon-licking gesture and the oddly unattractive cut of her pants. We know these things matter on \u201cHomeland\u201d; at this point, though, there\u2019s no way to tell what they mean.Let\u2019s hope we see a whole lot more of her bite, and not too much sad locket-gazing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fight Trump Faces Over Drug Prices", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump has made it clear that he thinks drug prices are too high and that the pharmaceutical industry, as he put it at a news conference this month, is \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201dHe joins a host of lawmakers and others who have excoriated drug makers in recent years for high-priced drugs that are out of the reach of many Americans. On Monday, Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, reaffirmed that the issue would be a priority.One of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals \u2014 to force drug makers to bid for the right to sell their products to Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 has repeatedly failed to attract enough support in Congress, especially among his fellow Republicans.Removing that prohibition is a favorite cause of liberal politicians like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but it has been opposed by the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans, including Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the nominee for secretary of health and human services.Whether freeing the government to negotiate on drug prices would lower costs, however, is anything but clear. And its chances of passing a Republican-led Congress are even less so.Medicare did not cover prescription drugs until 2006, after Congress expanded the program to add a drug benefit, known as Part D. But the measure included something called the noninterference clause, which was backed by the pharmaceutical industry and prevented the federal government from negotiating directly with drug makers.This prohibition does not mean that pharmaceutical companies can set any price they want. Privately run prescription drug programs, which control the benefits for large groups of Medicare beneficiaries, negotiate on the government\u2019s behalf. These programs are run by the same companies \u2014 including Express Scripts, CVS and UnitedHealth \u2014 that manage the drug plans for large employers and insurers.\u201cYou get your largest negotiating power from your ability to walk away,\u201d said Dr. Aaron S. Kesselheim, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who has written frequently on drug prices.Even if Medicare were to remove those protections and agree to cover fewer drugs \u2014 a politically unpopular move that has failed in the past \u2014 drug companies might find ways to make up the financial losses, said Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, a consulting firm that works for drug companies, hospitals, insurers and others.Today\u2019s most expensive drugs typically treat rare conditions, like cystic fibrosis and certain types of cancer, for which there are few options. In those cases, drug companies hold the bargaining power, no matter who is on the other side of the table.\u201cI worry that if you force one price across the market, you may well end up with a higher price in noncompetitive categories than you would otherwise,\u201d Mr. Mendelson said.And even if the negotiating ban were lifted, the United States would still not have the same clout as, say, Britain, whose universal health care coverage makes the government the country\u2019s only buyer of drugs.Some worry that if the United States government were to significantly lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, pharmaceutical companies would respond by raising prices for the millions of people insured through large employers or private insurers. Others contend that if the prices negotiated by Medicare were public, the transparency could level the playing field and lower prices across the board.It seems unlikely, given that Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\u201cIt\u2019s been a nonstarter with Republicans, and it\u2019s the traditionally Democratic talking point,\u201d said Alana Dovner, a research analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors, which advises investors on developments in Washington. \u201cSomething as dramatic as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices \u2014 that would be such a radical change, and so opposite the traditional Republican health care policies, that it just seems unfathomable at this point.\u201d\u201cYou are by definition saying yes to some drugs and no to others,\u201d Mr. Mendelson said. He called that position politically dangerous, saying it would be denounced as \u201cgovernment practice of medicine.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pander or Diversify? Hollywood Courts China With \u2018The Great Wall\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 When the trailer for \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d a high-profile China-Hollywood coproduction, was released last year, critics pounced: The scenes of Matt Damon leading a Chinese army into battle seemed like yet another instance of Hollywood\u2019s \u201cwhite savior\u201d complex and its repeated whitewashing, the practice of casting white actors in roles originally conceived as Asian (or nonwhite).She added, \u201cHis character, a mercenary soldier who stumbles into an elite corps fighting mythical beasts, spends the course of the film being humbled, outsmarted and re-educated in Chinese virtues of bravery, selflessness, discipline and invention.\u201dThough Asian-American actors have been quite vocal in the last year about their consistent underrepresentation in Hollywood, whitewashing is a fairly novel concept for Asians in Asia, where most local television shows and movies feature all-Asian casts. Instead, moviegoers here have become especially sensitive to pandering, another common Hollywood tactic that can have several meanings.But it can also refer to efforts to cater to Chinese audiences by dropping Asian actors into roles not meaningful to the plot \u2014 a form of \u201creverse whitewashing,\u201d if you will. In these films, the actors serve as what Chinese derogatorily call \u201cflower vases.\u201dThen again, what\u2019s a little criticism when the incentives to pander are so tempting? China has the world\u2019s second-largest box-office market after North America, and success here can help salvage otherwise lackluster box office in North America (as was the case last summer with another Legendary Entertainment film, \u201cWarcraft\u201d) or turn a hit into a megahit. (\u201cTransformers: Age of Extinction\u201d racked up $320 million from Chinese moviegoers alone.)Pandering also pays because the Chinese government encourages it. Include enough so-called Chinese elements in the film by, for example, casting local actors, shooting on location and raising Chinese financing, and the movie could qualify as an official coproduction, a government label that entitles a foreign studio to a greater share of the box-office revenue.\u201cThe Great Wall\u201d was in many ways meant to be a solution to the pandering problem. With a Chinese director; a mostly Chinese cast, story line and locations; and abundant references to the country\u2019s culture, it is perhaps the most Chinese film to be made with significant Hollywood studio backing. Instead of mollifying Chinese audiences with quick cameos, the film is dominated by Chinese actors \u2014 thousands of them, if you include the armies.The film \u201cwasn\u2019t coming to China just for finance or for access to the market,\u201d said Peter Loehr, one of its producers. \u201cIt was a story that organically took place here that organically had mixed actors.\u201dThe decision to cast Mr. Damon, an international star, in the lead and make the movie mainly in English was, if anything, an attempt to pander to viewers outside China.But solving one problem opened up another. By framing the movie as a Chinese story packaged in a Hollywood studio film, the question naturally became: Why does the central hero need to be a white guy?\u201cIt\u2019s a question we will definitely have to consider in the future,\u201d Zhang Yimou, the film\u2019s director and a celebrated filmmaker in China, said in a recent interview. He explained: \u201cThe way the market is right now, we can\u2019t make an internationally successful film on our own. If we didn\u2019t have Matt Damon, if we didn\u2019t speak English in the film, then it would just be a purely Chinese film.\u201dEither way, it will certainly be a lesson learned for future Chinese-Hollywood co-productions. As frustrations with Hollywood\u2019s lack of diversity become more apparent around the world, the old rule of thumb for big Hollywood blockbusters \u2014 to offend as few moviegoers as possible \u2014 may be increasingly difficult to follow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in . . . Los Cabos, Mexico", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate21 PhotosA FOUR-BEDROOM VILLA NEAR THE BEACH IN LOS CABOS$2.9 MILLIONThe villa served as a vacation home for Kathy Christopherson and her husband, Michael, and after his death in 2007 was primarily rented out. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to sit empty,\u201d said Ms. Christopherson, a retired business owner from Lilydale, Minn., who built a smaller home for herself on a nearby lot. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like having our little boutique hotel.\u201dVilla Miguel offers many hotel-like amenities in addition to the resort community\u2019s golf and tennis facilities. The house is just over a tenth of a mile from the beach and has an L-shaped infinity pool with a Jacuzzi, along with an outdoor kitchen, firepit and seating areas on an expansive terrace. Each of the four spacious en-suite bedrooms has private outdoor space facing the ocean.The property is entered through a wrought-iron gate that opens to a large landscaped courtyard with a traditional Spanish colonial fountain, in \u201ctruly authentic Mexican hacienda style,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said.Inside, through a carved antique mesquite front door from Guadalajara, is the foyer, with a curved staircase and striking brick domed ceiling. Two master bedrooms are upstairs, while a third master suite, a smaller bedroom and a half-bath are downstairs. The lower level, with double-height vaulted ceilings, also contains the living room, dining area and kitchen in an open floor plan that connects to the terrace.The home\u2019s rustic aesthetic continues in the living room, with exposed beams and columns and a double-height stone wall that holds a gas fireplace. If you look closely at the locally crafted Saltillo terra-cotta floors, Ms. Christopherson said, \u201cyou can actually see animal footprints in them.\u201dCabo del Sol is in the \u201cGolden Corridor,\u201d which extends about 20 miles from Cabo San Lucas to San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo and has several championship golf courses and resort developments. The Los Cabos area is known for its warm, sunny climate and outdoor activities like fishing, scuba diving and whale watching.MARKET OVERVIEW\u201cThe market is attracting a lot of buyers \u2014 it\u2019s very active,\u201d said Marco Ehrenberg, an agent with Los Cabos Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. He said that sales volume increased by about 30 percent in 2016 over the previous year.But the market still generally favors buyers, he said, particularly with properties below $2 million. \u201cThere are a lot of homes that were built six to 10 years ago coming to market,\u201d Mr. Ehrenberg said. \u201cIn these older developments you can still get deals.\u201dWHO BUYS IN LOS CABOSMost buyers are from the United States and Canada. There has also been increased interest from Australians, said Mr. Stephenson of Engel & V\u00f6lkers. Many major American cities offer direct flights to the Los Cabos airport, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta.BUYING BASICSReal estate transactions involving international buyers are mostly done in cash. Some local banks will offer financing, though at less-attractive terms than in the United States, said Louis M. Espinoza, a real estate lawyer based in San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo.Mexican law requires that purchases by foreigners be made through a fideicomiso, or bank trust, if a property is within 50 kilometers, or about 31 miles, of the coastline (which is the case for Los Cabos). The bank holds the trust deed for the buyer, who becomes the beneficiary and retains full ownership rights and responsibilities, Mr. Espinoza said.A public notary prepares and certifies all the closing documents. Buyers may also want to hire a lawyer to represent them at the closing.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSpanish; Mexican peso (1 peso = $0.047)TAXES AND FEES The seller pays the broker commission, typically around 6 percent. (Commissions are sometimes lowered, to 3 to 4 percent, for properties above $5 million.) The buyer\u2019s closing costs include a one-time acquisition tax paid to the municipality (usually averaging 2 percent of the purchase price), along with various other fees for the notary and certification.For Villa Miguel, closing costs would total around $88,000, according to Mr. Espinoza\u2019s calculations. The annual homeowners association fee is $3,788 and monthly property management fee is $500; annual property taxes are $924.CONTACTAn earlier version of this article, using information from the listing agent, misstated the homeowners association fee and property management fee for the property.

{"Headline": "A Rare Corner of Finance Where Women Dominate", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byOnce a year, a small group of executives who control trillions of dollars in American companies meet for lunch in Manhattan. Among the things they discuss: pushing for greater say in how companies are run.It is an elite gathering, but you will not see a single man in a suit in the room. The event, called the Women in Governance lunch, underscores a rare corner in finance where women dominate.Women hold the top positions in corporate governance at many of the biggest mutual funds and pension funds \u2014 deciding which way to vote on the directors of a company board. They make decisions on behalf of teachers, government workers, doctors and most people in the United States who have a 401(k). The corporate governance heads at seven of the 10 largest institutional investors in stocks are now women, according to data compiled by The New York Times. Those investors oversee $14 trillion in assets.Corporate governance is playing a growing role within the broader ecosystem of corporate America. Each spring, publicly traded companies hold shareholder meetings and outline business strategy for the coming year. Shareholders like BlackRock, T. Rowe Price and State Street vote on corporate strategy and issues including company board appointments and compensation.Their votes can go a long way, given the huge stakes these institutions control in United States companies. BlackRock holds a stake greater than 5 percent in 75 of the 100 largest companies, according to data compiled by Jerry Davis, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. State Street has more than than 5 percent of 23 of the largest companies, while Capital Group owns more than 5 percent of 20 of the biggest companies.That power, however, is rarely wielded to confront companies. Most of the time, these huge institutional investors choose to vote with management.And their approach contrasts sharply with that of brash activist billionaires like William A. Ackman and Daniel S. Loeb, who have made a name for themselves as corporate agitators. These investors bring about change by theatrically pounding on the front doors of companies and using the public court of opinion to bully companies into changing their strategies.Still, the heads of corporate governance at institutional giants say they are working quietly behind the scenes to advocate for greater shareholder rights.Now, Ms. Anderson\u2019s team is weighing whether to create a similar policy for gender diversity on corporate boards.\u201cWe have an interest in seeing more women on boards because there is data that a more diverse board makes better decisions,\u201d said Ms. Anderson, who was at Invesco before T. Rowe Price and has been working in the field of corporate governance for two decades.Efforts by mutual funds to change the behavior of a company by using the power of a proxy vote is a fairly recent phenomenon. For decades, powerful institutional investors automatically rubber-stamped the decisions of corporate management and boards. At the same, many top executives paid little attention to the concerns of their shareholders.\u201cMany years ago, for every 10 letters we wrote, we generally heard back from half,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cNow it\u2019s 100 percent.\u201d Today, companies in which T. Rowe Price holds a large stake will even reach out to the firm unprompted.The 2008 financial crisis was a turning point for shareholders, said Anne Sheehan, the director of corporate governance at California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the public pension fund.Ms. Sheehan joined the pension fund, Calstrs, in October 2008, in the depths of the financial crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. \u201cTalk about hitting the ground running and seeing what the impact of that crisis was doing to our portfolio,\u201d she said.The experience was an eye-opener. \u201cI saw it as an opportunity to make our voices known in the debate,\u201d Ms. Sheehan said. \u201cWhat were these directors doing on our behalf? How could shareholders speak up?\u201dThe crisis, she added, \u201creally brought home the prevalence of the \u2018Old Boys Network\u2019 inside the board rooms of these financial firms which resulted in too much group think.\u201dThe corporate governance team at Calstrs regularly questions companies on a range of issues including gender diversity and the pay gap between the top executives at a company and the most junior employees. Having women in positions of governance has helped bring these issues to the forefront of the discussion at companies, Ms. Sheehan said.\u201cIt reminded me of the old adage: If you want to get something done, put a woman in charge,\u201d she added.At BlackRock, Michelle Edkins and her team of 30 analyze whether certain corporate directors are being paid too much and whether they have overstayed their terms. If there is a problem, they begin by opening a dialogue with the company.Ms. Edkins, who trained as an economist in New Zealand and took her first position in corporate governance in 1997 by answering an ad in The Financial Times, said women tended to be less confrontational than men, making it easier to address a problem and try to fix it in this way.\u201cWe don\u2019t meet with C.E.O.s and tell them how to remedy the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a stylistic difference and my observation is that this constructive challenge comes more naturally to women.\u201dBut to some critics, this approach is not yielding change fast enough.BlackRock\u2019s track record on voting against corporate management reveals that it is taking a slower approach to pushing for change. For example, on the issue of executive pay, during the most recent reporting period ending on June 30, BlackRock voted 96.3 percent of the time to support compensation policies across the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, according to Proxy Insight.It also voted against every shareholder proposal relating to diversity, environment, governance and social concerns over the last year, according to Proxy Insight.The record is not much better at other top institutional investors.Nick Dawson, a co-founder of Proxy Insight, said that while investors treat issues related to environmental, social and governance policies, known in industry parlance as E.S.G., very seriously, \u201cthere is a clear preference for behind-the-scenes engagement on these issues.\u201d \u201cAsset managers prefer to ensure that management teams are capable of dealing with E.S.G. issues in-house, rather than by applying external pressure,\u201d he said.Still, BlackRock said that it voted against pay practices or compensation committee members at 10 of the 50 companies where executives were paid the most during the most recent reporting period.And other investors like the activist hedge fund Elliott Management said that it had become much easier to engage with companies.\u201cWhen an activist shows up to a situation, having these engaged, thoughtful leaders involved in the discussion helps the company and the activist get to a collaborative solution,\u201d said Jesse Cohn, the head of United States equity activism at Elliott. This, he added, happens \u201cwell in advance of a proxy contest.\u201dThere is concern that on the subject of gender, women are less likely to push for greater diversity. Some women in high-power corporate governance positions said that they preferred not to bring up gender as an issue in discussions with management on concern they will be perceived to have an agenda.But some experts say there is tremendous potential for the network of women in corporate governance to make a bigger difference.\u201cIf there is an old girls\u2019 network so to speak with so much authority in corporate governance, this is an opportunity to create an agenda for greater diversity through a formalized means,\u201d said Mr. Davis, at the University of Michigan.While women like Ms. Edkins are fighting behind the scenes to bring more women onto the boards of America\u2019s biggest companies, they are struggling with an entirely different diversity challenge of their own: the lack of men in the field of corporate governance.\u201cIt\u2019s counterintuitive in finance,\u201d Ms. Edkins said. \u201cBut when we are hiring, we need to really push that diversity to make sure we have men on the slate.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Other Kushner Brother\u2019s Big Bet", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byJust days after the 2016 presidential election, a young venture capitalist called an emergency staff meeting.Prepare for a storm of publicity, he told one of the start-ups that he had helped found. There would be questions about his political affiliations and loyalties, he said. There would be questions about the survivability of the start-up, a health insurance company named Oscar Health. The world was about to change, he said.At the same time, Joshua Kushner has had to deal with queries from investors in his venture capital funds who have asked him how Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension would affect his work. Some wondered whether he would join the White House. Others worried that the presidential circus would be a distraction, especially since ties with his brother might make it difficult to maintain a distance.\u201cJosh doesn\u2019t want a public profile,\u201d said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, which is an investor in Thrive. \u201cHe assured us that he would remain focused on Thrive.\u201dTo date, money from Mr. Kushner\u2019s immediate family members represents less than $5 million of his venture funds. Jared is now divesting his shares in Thrive because of his move into the White House. The Trump family has not invested.While the brothers are known by friends and colleagues as ambitious workaholics with ties to power brokers on both coasts, in many ways their paths have diverged. Jared Kushner has emerged as an increasingly public figure since becoming the face of the family\u2019s real estate firm, Kushner Companies, and buying the publisher Observer Media. That company\u2019s newspaper, The New York Observer, has mythologized the city\u2019s media, real estate and political power brokers for a generation of New Yorkers. Jared is also often photographed at society events with Ms. Trump, and is now frequently seen in the background of meetings with the president-elect.\u201cMost moguls love to name-drop and tell you about their vacations and appeal to you with how celestial their orbit is, but that\u2019s not Josh,\u201d said Patrick Collison, the chief executive of Stripe, a mobile payments start-up in San Francisco that Mr. Kushner has invested in.Mr. Kushner declined to speak on the record for this article, and a spokesman for Mr. Trump declined to comment. In an interview, Ms. Trump said that \u201cJared and Josh have a very special relationship defined by tremendous love, admiration and mutual respect.\u201d She declined to talk about politics.Mr. Kushner and his siblings grew up spending nights and weekends at work with their father, visiting properties, looking at financial data and sometimes skipping school to attend business meetings. In 2004, Mr. Kushner was accepted to Harvard, which Jared had also attended.During the summers, Mr. Kushner interned at Goldman\u2019s real estate banking division and at the real estate giants Vornado and SL Green with an eye toward working in the industry. But in his junior year of college, he started a company, Vostu, that made video games for social media networks like Facebook. He founded Vostu with two classmates, including Mario Schlosser, who is now the chief executive of Oscar Health.\u201cJosh stepped away from the family business,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a Harvard classmate who now runs Cadre, a real estate start-up that lets wealthy individuals buy pieces of commercial property developments. The company was started in the offices of Thrive.Neither Vostu nor Unithrive was a runaway success. Vostu has since laid off most of its employees, and Unithrive is defunct. So, using money generated from Vostu, Mr. Kushner turned away from founding businesses and began investing in them instead, beginning with small investments in companies like the crowdfunding site Kickstarter.His investments caught the attention of others in the tech industry, including Joel Cutler, a venture capitalist at General Catalyst. \u201cJosh had been able to get into investment pools with the best and smartest in the industry,\u201d Mr. Cutler said. \u201cI encouraged him to start a firm.\u201dIn 2010, while at Harvard Business School, Mr. Kushner started Thrive. He was 25.In an interview in 2011, while juggling business school with working at Vostu and meeting with start-ups, Mr. Kushner said his job as an investor was to look for new ideas that could change industries through technology. \u201cAny market yet to be disrupted by modern technology will be at some point in time,\u201d he said.Mr. Kushner said that he would not be content to simply invest in companies, and that he wanted to nurture some from scratch himself. \u201cBeing satisfied is not a good thing,\u201d he said.Mr. Kushner set about building Thrive in a methodical way, drawing on his constellation of connections.Aryeh Bourkoff, the founder of LionTree, a merchant bank that specializes in tech and media deals, said he was impressed by Mr. Kushner\u2019s focus when the young investor spoke at an event Mr. Bourkoff held in 2011. Mr. Kushner argued before a roomful of media executives that online video would create more upheaval than the cable industry anticipated. Many in the room disagreed with that idea at the time but said he made a compelling case.By the spring of 2012, Mr. Kushner had scored his first investment hit. He had become friends with a Silicon Valley entrepreneur named Kevin Systrom, who had started Instagram. Mr. Systrom said he had met Mr. Kushner long before he was thinking about raising large sums of money for the app, and the two had stayed in touch.Mr. Kushner has developed a reputation among entrepreneurs for an eye for detail. When he was considering investing in Zola, a wedding registry company founded by Shan-Lyn Ma and Kevin Ryan, Mr. Kushner and his team put together their own study of the wedding registry market and what was missing.\u201cMost other investors I met with said that they\u2019d asked their wives or girlfriends about whether they\u2019d use Zola,\u201d Ms. Ma said. \u201cThat was generally their only data point.\u201dThrive led a $5.85 million investment in Zola in 2013. Since then, the company has raised more than $40 million.Thrive\u2019s other investment successes include Twitch, a live-streaming video site for gamers that Amazon.com bought for $970 million, and the e-commerce site Jet.com, which Walmart agreed to acquire for $3 billion. Thrive also owns stakes in hot start-ups like the workplace messaging company Slack and the streaming music service Spotify, each of which are valued at billions of dollars.Not all of Mr. Kushner\u2019s investments have worked out. It can take a decade or more to determine whether a private company becomes the next Facebook, a failure or something in between. While Instagram was a rare overnight success story for investors, Mr. Kushner has also invested in flops such as Fab.com, a high-profile online retail company that went bust and was later purchased by a manufacturing company in a fire sale.It is unclear if Joshua and Jared Kushner have discussed how a health care overhaul could affect Oscar Health. Representatives of the brothers declined to comment on any conversations they have had about the company.Mr. Kushner\u2019s work is not totally separate from his family\u2019s. Thrive\u2019s offices are in the NoLIta neighborhood of Manhattan, in the historic Puck Building, which is owned by Kushner Companies. Some start-ups that Thrive has incubated, including Cadre and Oscar, are housed there, too.The brothers have also made investments together. They founded Cadre with Mr. Williams, invested in it and are advisers to the company.Mr. Kushner has not been vocal about his political beliefs. Over the years, he has donated about $100,000 to Democratic candidates and causes. Federal Election Commission data shows he has been giving to the Democratic Party since 1999, when he financially supported Bill Bradley and, later, Al Gore for president. He made his last donations in 2014.\u201cPeople who are different from you, you can learn something from them,\u201d Mr. Kushner said in the 2011 interview. \u201cAt least, I think I can.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Non-Tech Companies, if You Can\u2019t Build It, Buy a Start-Up", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byFor years, mergers and acquisitions in technology were fairly straightforward: Every investment bank kept a list of a dozen or so companies like Google and IBM that had a track record of acquisitions and cash to deploy. When the time and price were right, bankers would seek to match the tech giants with a start-up, and a deal would be hatched.Now the technology deal-making club has had its doors blown wide open.All kinds of companies, including century-old industrial stalwarts like General Motors and General Electric, are among the corporate giants acquiring tech start-ups of late.This trend, of course, reflects how new technology is radically changing many traditional businesses. Developments like connected homes and driverless cars are upending old models. Many companies have come to the realization that building technology in-house was a painstaking process that often meant getting leapfrogged by start-ups.So companies not usually thought of as being in the tech sector have become more aggressive, making more than $125 billion worth of acquisitions in 2016, the most ever. Five years ago, that figure was $20 billion.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that many non-tech companies have tried to build and have made the determination that it\u2019s enormously challenging,\u201d said Anthony Armstrong, co-head of technology mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley. \u201cIt\u2019s better to acquire disruptive technology than to be disrupted by that technology.\u201dLast year, the number of technology companies sold to non-tech companies surpassed those acquired by tech companies for the first time since the internet era began, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding private equity buyers, 682 tech companies were purchased by a company in an industry other than technology, while 655 were acquired by tech companies, Bloomberg\u2019s data showed.More broadly, merger activity was down in 2016. Companies around the world announced $3.6 trillion worth of deals last year, a decline of 16.6 percent from 2015, which was a record year, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. The number of deals signed rose slightly from 2015, the data showed.Of the 45,416 transactions announced last year, 6,657, or 15 percent, were acquisitions of technology companies, more than any other sector, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters on Thursday. That was in line with the proportion of technology deals in 2015.Still, many of tech\u2019s big traditional buyers were quiet last year. Four of the five largest tech companies by market capitalization did not announce any giant deals in 2016.Investment bankers expect this trend to continue this year as well. They have been fielding many calls from companies outside the tech sector wondering what shareholders might think about a potential tech acquisition.Non-tech chief executives have been found mingling at technology conferences, trying to spot their next potential target. And the assortment of so-called unicorns, or private companies valued at $1 billion or more, may be more inclined to sell this year after very few went public or sold in 2016.Only 20 technology companies went public last year, the fewest since 2009, according to Thomson Reuters. With almost 200 unicorns, there could be more exits this year if the markets hold up.One major shift as to why non-tech executives are becoming more active in tech deal making is that they have become more comfortable with the technology itself.\u201cVery rarely are management teams willing to get into businesses that they absolutely don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Scott Adelson, co-president and global co-head of corporate finance at Houlihan Lokey. \u201cSoftware and internet are so pervasive that it\u2019s no longer something that the average management team can\u2019t wrap their head around.\u201dSome companies are also trying to recast themselves as tech companies.General Electric has moved its headquarters to Boston, more of a hub for tech and start-ups than its previous home in Fairfield, Conn. The company\u2019s recent commercials feature the tagline: \u201cThe digital company. That\u2019s also an industrial company.\u201dHoneywell\u2019s incoming chief executive, Darius Adamczyk, was formerly the head of a technology company that Honeywell acquired eight years ago. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering, and a master\u2019s degree in computer engineering.Historically, non-tech companies have largely not felt comfortable paying the high prices that many tech companies can fetch. Older, mature companies tend to trade at lower valuations relative to measures like revenue and earnings, compared with young technology companies \u2014 which sometimes do not even have earnings.\u201cWhen it comes to M.&A., boards and C.E.O.s of non-tech companies have become much more fluent in the language of tech company valuations,\u201d Mr. Armstrong of Morgan Stanley said.The next challenge for many of these companies might be in integrating their tech start-ups with the main business.When traditional companies acquired small technology companies, they typically would place them in a \u201cdigital division\u201d separate from the rest of the company.That too needs to change, according to Aryeh Bourkoff, the founder and chief executive of the investment bank LionTree.\u201cTechnology should not be a division of a company. It should be integrated into every division,\u201d he said.For now, investors in traditional companies seem willing to let these companies make bets and take risks because they too know the stakes of disruption are high.\u201cShareholders are judging management teams on their ability to be bold and not just make short-term moves,\u201d Mr. Bourkoff said. \u201cThe bold C.E.O.s are the ones that play to the future.\u201dGraphic by The New York TimesAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Czech Artist\u2019s Grandson Sues to Block Loan of Works to Tokyo", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byPRAGUE \u2014 Walking the creaking floors of a 17th-century building perched on the same hill as Prague Castle, John Mucha led an informal tour through the house where he has lived nearly all his life.Which is why he is taking the city of Prague to court.Mr. Mucha \u2014 along with local art restorers, conservators and historians \u2014 passionately opposes the city\u2019s plan to take his grandfather\u2019s masterwork \u201cSlav Epic\u201d on tour internationally for the first time.For Mr. Mucha, this is too much of a risk to take. He also says it is a violation of a 1913 agreement between the artist and his benefactor, the American philanthropist Charles R. Crane, who financed the creation of \u201cSlav Epic.\u201d The agreement stipulates that the works be donated to Prague on the condition that the city build a permanent facility to house them \u2014 a promise that, nearly 90 years after the cycle\u2019s completion, has not been kept.For this reason, Mr. Mucha said, he is asking the courts \u201cto confirm that the deed of gift was not done,\u201d and that it is invalid. In a lawsuit filed in his name against the city of Prague, he is asking that ownership of the works be transferred back to the Mucha estate. Court hearings are set to begin Jan. 18.Alphonse Mucha, who lived from 1860 to 1939, rose to fame in Paris as a designer of advertising posters in the 1890s before going on to create a range of illustrations and paintings in an ornate style synonymous with Art Nouveau. (In the 1960s, Mucha\u2019s influence was revived in psychedelic posters from San Francisco\u2019s rock scene.)But \u201cSlav Epic\u201d is widely seen as Mucha\u2019s masterpiece, and its insurance value is at least 10.8 million euros, or roughly $11 million at current exchange rates, the Czech news media reported in September.\u201cHe is referred to as kind of a godlike figure,\u201d said Gabriel Weisberg, a professor of art history at the University of Minnesota, adding that Mucha contributed to the revitalization of the color print revolution during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Prof. Karel Stretti, who leads the restoration department at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, said the largest of the \u201cSlav Epic\u201d pieces measures 26.5 feet by 20 feet, meaning handlers would have to remove it from its frame and roll it up, which could crack the paint.\u201cThe nature of the works \u2014 egg tempera on a hemp canvas \u2014 and the way it may be insulated makes them particularly vulnerable,\u201d the professor added.In 1921, five canvases were sent to New York and Chicago at the behest of Mr. Crane. The works returned with minor blemishes and the city of Prague advised in 1936 that they were not be moved again, according to letters Professor Stretti showed to The New York Times.During World War II, the \u201cSlav Epic\u201d paintings were nearly lost forever. Mucha was interrogated by the Gestapo, accused of being a nationalist and a Jewish sympathizer, shortly before his death from pneumonia in 1939. The canvases were then rolled up and hidden in a local school to keep them out of the hands of the Nazis. They would not be seen again until the 1960s, when they were exhibited in a castle near where Mucha was born. They were moved to Veletrzni Palace in 2012.According to Professor Stretti, who leads an association of restorers, 600 people have signed a petition calling for Prague to cancel the Tokyo loan. Restorers, conservators and local experts have accused the Prague government of not appreciating the risks of a relocation, and of being blinded by the typical financial incentives in such loans.\u201cPolitical and economic interests should not be placed ahead of the interests of our culture,\u201d the professor said.Neither the city of Prague nor the National Art Center in Tokyo responded to inquiries about how much the center would pay for the loan.Jan Wolf, Prague\u2019s councilor in charge of culture, who is responsible for the loan, declined requests for an interview.The Prague City Gallery, which is controlled by the City Council, has sought to reaffirm its decision to lend the paintings, saying in an emailed statement last month that Mucha had wanted \u201cto show the importance of Slavic history to the widest possible audience, not only in Europe but also overseas.\u201dThe city maintains that, in any case, it is not contractually obligated to build a venue for \u201cSlav Epic,\u201d Jana Felixova, a lawyer representing Prague in the forthcoming trial, said by email. She said that John Mucha\u2019s case hinged on the 1913 agreement between his grandfather and Mr. Crane.The document, a scanned copy of which was seen by The New York Times, states that the city agreed in 1909 to build a place to house \u201cSlav Epic.\u201d While the city recognizes the document as authentic, Ms. Felixova said, it is not bound by it because Prague is not a signatory.Despite the pending court hearings, the gallery plans to move ahead with its project: It says the 20 canvases that make up the \u201cSlav Epic\u201d will be rolled up in the next two weeks and be sent to Japan in time for the exhibition.\u201cPrague accepted the ownership of the \u2018Slav Epic\u2019 in good faith and was, and still is, convinced of the indisputability of its ownership,\u201d Ms. Felixova said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s Education Pick, Plays Hardball With Her Wealth", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byAfter Tom Casperson, a Republican state senator from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, began running for Congress in 2016, he assumed the family of Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee to be education secretary, would not oppose him.The DeVoses, a dominant force in Michigan politics for decades with a fortune in the billions, had contributed to one of Mr. Casperson\u2019s earlier campaigns. But a week before his primary, family members sent $24,000 to one of his opponents, then poured $125,000 into a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d Concerned Taxpayers of America, that ran ads attacking him.The reason, an intermediary told Mr. Casperson: his support from organized labor.\u201cDeceitful, dishonest and cowardly,\u201d was how Mr. Casperson\u2019s campaign described the ads, complaining that the groups running them \u201cwon\u2019t say who they are or where their money is coming from.\u201d On Primary Day, Mr. Casperson went down to defeat.In announcing his intention to nominate Ms. DeVos, Mr. Trump described her as \u201ca brilliant and passionate education advocate.\u201d Even critics characterized her as a dedicated, if misguided, activist for school reform. But that description understates both the breadth of Ms. DeVos\u2019s political interests and the influence she wields as part of her powerful family. More than anyone else who has joined the incoming Trump administration, she represents the combination of wealth, free-market ideology and political hardball associated with a better-known family of billionaires: Charles and David Koch.\u201cThey have this moralized sense of the free market that leads to this total program to turn back the ideas of the New Deal, the welfare state,\u201d Kim Phillips-Fein, a historian who has written extensively about the conservative movement, said, describing the DeVoses.Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed for this article.Like the Kochs, the DeVoses are generous supporters of think tanks that evangelize for unrestrained capitalism, like Michigan\u2019s Acton Institute, and that rail against unions and back privatizing public services, like the Mackinac Center.They have also funded national groups dedicated to cutting back the role of government, including the National Center for Policy Analysis (which has pushed for Social Security privatization and against environmental regulation) and the Institute for Justice (which challenges regulations in court and defends school vouchers). Both organizations have also received money from the Koch family.Indeed, the DeVoses\u2019 education activism, which favors alternatives to traditional public schools, appears to derive from the same free-market views that inform their suspicion of government. And perhaps more than other right-wing billionaires, the DeVoses couple their seeding of ideological causes with an aggressive brand of political spending. Half a dozen or more extended family members frequently coordinate contributions to maximize their impact.All of this would make Ms. DeVos \u2014 whose confirmation hearing has been delayed until next week amid mounting pressure that her government ethics review be completed beforehand \u2014 very different from past education secretaries.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.\u201cShe is the most emblematic kind of oligarchic figure you can put in a cabinet position,\u201d said Jeffrey Winters, a political scientist at Northwestern University who studies economic elites. \u201cWhat she and the Kochs have in common is the unbridled use of wealth power to achieve whatever political goals they have.\u201dMs. DeVos, 59, grew up in Holland, Mich., the daughter of a conservative auto parts magnate who was an early funder of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group. When she married Dick DeVos in 1979, it was akin to a merger between two royal houses of western Michigan.A fan of Rolls-Royces and pinkie rings, Richard Sr. wrote books with titles like \u201cTen Powerful Phrases for Positive People.\u201dA similar air hung over his business. Amway sales representatives, which the company calls \u201cindependent business owners,\u201d make money both by selling the company\u2019s products \u2014 everything from perfume to toilet bowl cleaner \u2014 and by recruiting other sales representatives.The Federal Trade Commission once investigated the company for running a pyramid scheme before concluding that it had misled potential recruits about how much they could expect to earn.The flip side of the family\u2019s proselytizing for capitalism, according to Professor Phillips-Fein, has been an effort to dismantle much \u201cthat would counterbalance the power of economic elites.\u201dAmway funded a nationwide ad campaign in the early 1980s, protesting high taxes and regulations. Not long after, the company pleaded guilty to cheating the Canadian government out of more than $20 million in revenue.The family had a more winning public face in Dick DeVos, who combined the practiced empathy of a pitchman with the entitlement of an heir, spending over $30 million on an unsuccessful run for governor of Michigan in 2006. The Detroit Free Press described him that year as the wealthiest man to seek office in the state\u2019s modern history.Betsy DeVos, who served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party for most of the decade between 1996 and 2005, has often played the role of strategist in the relationship. She was a key adviser in her husband\u2019s run for governor and publicly brooded that he had been too gentlemanly in his first debate against the incumbent.\u201cHe\u2019s very good with people, a retail politician who looks you in the eye, shakes your hand, listens to what you say,\u201d said Randy Richardville, a former Republican leader of the Michigan Senate, describing the couple\u2019s strengths. \u201cI would never underestimate Betsy DeVos in a knife fight.\u201d\u201cBetsy DeVos was like my 4-year-old granddaughter at the time,\u201d said Mike Pumford, a former Republican state representative who once clashed with her. \u201cThey were both sweet ladies as long as they kept hearing the word \u2018yes.\u2019 They turned into spoiled little brats when they were told \u2018no.\u2019\u201dBut Ms. DeVos has often made up for what she lacks in tact through sheer force of will.Mr. Richardville said he and Ms. DeVos disagreed over term limits, which she supported as party chairwoman and he opposed: \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you should be setting policy. You should be supporting those of us who do make policy.\u2019 But she never backed down.\u201dTheir economic views are strikingly similar to the elder Mr. DeVos\u2019s.The company has also opposed crackdowns on tax shelters.Ms. DeVos has been an outspoken defender of unlimited contributions known as soft money, which she described in a 1997 editorial as \u201chard-earned American dollars that Big Brother has yet to find a way to control.\u201dAfter Congress later passed a major campaign finance reform bill, a nonprofit that Ms. DeVos helped to create and fund masterminded the strategy that produced Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision laying the groundwork for super PACs funded by corporations, unions and individuals to raise and spend unlimited amounts in elections.And then there are the family\u2019s efforts to rein in the labor movement.Through their contributions to think tanks like the Mackinac Center, as well as Mr. DeVos\u2019s direct prodding of Republican legislators, the family played a key role in helping pass Michigan\u2019s so-called right-to-work legislation in 2012. The legislation largely ended the requirement that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment.Unions in the state bled members in 2014, the first full year the measure was in effect.Allies say the DeVoses fight for their beliefs. \u201cBetsy and Dick see themselves as principled conservatives,\u201d said Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt kind of seems healthy and admirable to give resources to folks who are going to fight for causes you believe in.\u201dBut the fights can appear to be as much about consolidating power as ideology. Unions were arguably the family\u2019s most formidable political opponent in Michigan, one of labor\u2019s traditional strongholds.The DeVos family\u2019s roots as education activists date back at least to when Richard DeVos Sr. was running Amway and an institute based at the company\u2019s headquarters trained teachers to inject free-market principles into their curriculum.\u201cIf we could choose the right school for our kids\u201d \u2014 by which she appeared to mean primarily private schools \u2014 \u201cit only seemed fair that they could do the same for theirs,\u201d she told the magazine.The family spent millions of dollars on a ballot proposal in 2000 asking if Michigan should legalize vouchers, in which students can use taxpayer money to attend private schools.After voters objected by more than a two-to-one ratio, Dick DeVos gave a speech at the Heritage Foundation saying such efforts would have to shift to state legislatures, where groups backed by deep-pocketed donors could offer \u201ca political consequence for opposition, and political reward for support of education reform issues.\u201dIt is not unusual for the wealthy \u2014 who devote nearly 50 percent of their philanthropic dollars to education, according to the group Wealth-X \u2014 to spend aggressively in the political realm to impose their preferred reforms.Even by these standards, however, the DeVoses stand out for the amount of money they spend trying to advance their goals through politics rather than philanthropy, such as research into reforms or subsidizing schools.As Sarah Reckhow, an expert on education philanthropy at Michigan State University, put it: \u201cThe DeVoses are like: \u2018No, we know what we want. We don\u2019t need to have all this window dressing.\u2019\u201dMs. DeVos has led two nonprofits that have spent millions of dollars electing governors and legislators sympathetic to school vouchers around the country.Matt Frendewey, a spokesman for one of the groups, said the efforts had frequently been bipartisan, and that the amount of money they had spent has been dwarfed by contributions from teachers\u2019 unions opposed to reform. Yet in Michigan, at least, the family\u2019s political strategy has not been subtle.After he defied Ms. DeVos on a key charter school vote, Mr. Pumford, the former Republican legislator, survived an effort by the Great Lakes Education Project, a nonprofit the DeVoses bankrolled, to defeat him in his 2002 primary.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.But shortly after, the House speaker told him the Education Committee chairmanship he coveted would not be forthcoming. \u201cI said, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d Mr. Pumford recalled. \u201cHe said: \u2018You know why. The DeVoses will walk away from us.\u2019\u201d Mr. Pumford added: \u201cShe told me that was going to happen.\u201d(Rick Johnson, the House speaker, said he did not recall the conversation but also that he had not promised Mr. Pumford the chairmanship and would not have explained his reasons for withholding it.)Over time, the Great Lakes Education Project helped elect Republican majorities sympathetic to the DeVoses\u2019 agenda. But the DeVoses\u2019 lobbyists and operatives also discovered less messy ways to advance legislation.Late one night of their last workweek in 2015, the Michigan House and Senate were about to approve some uncontroversial changes to campaign finance law, when the bill abruptly grew by more than 40 pages.After the legislators discovered what they had voted for, many said they were horrified.Tucked away in the new pages was a provision that would have made it much harder for local bodies like school boards to raise money through property tax increases.\u201cMichigan schools will likely suffer the brunt of the impact because the vast majority rely on periodic voter approval of local operating levy renewals for property taxes,\u201d the ratings agency Moody\u2019s wrote of the measure the following month.\u201cI was fooled into voting for something I opposed,\u201d said Dave Pagel, a Republican representative. \u201cI consider it the worst vote I\u2019ve made.\u201dThe chief culprits, according to Mr. Pagel and others at the state Capitol when the bill passed, were lobbyists closely tied to the DeVoses.Tony Daunt, a spokesman for the Michigan Freedom Fund, a nonprofit headed by the DeVoses\u2019 longtime political aide, and whose political spending arm they have funded generously, said the group was \u201cpart of the discussion process with people in the legislature\u201d about the proposal and \u201chad consistently expressed support for the policy.\u201dThe law was later blocked by a federal judge, but the group has vowed to try again.Ms. DeVos\u2019s advocates see in these fights the toughness to take on entrenched opponents of expanding reforms like charter schools and vouchers.But critics see someone with an unmistakable agenda. \u201cThe signs are there that she will do something radical,\u201d said Jack Jennings, a former general counsel for the House education committee. \u201cTrump wouldn\u2019t have appointed this woman for this position if he didn\u2019t intend something radical.\u201dNoah Weiland contributed reporting.

The bit about the kid in Detroit and the kid on the \u201cwindswept plains of Nebraska\u201d \u2014 black and white, get it? \u2014 looking up at the same night sky. Overall, though, there was the air of a diligent adolescent trying to put something down on paper but not quite hitting the mark. \u201cAmerica is totally unstoppable\u201d sounds like a schoolyard brag. \u201cWe will bring back our borders\u201d \u2014 where did they go? The \u201cvery sad depletion of our military\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to imagine Barack Obama, or even George W.

The endless emphasis (\u201cBelieve me,\u201d \u201cbig league\u201d) is as well. All humans festoon their talk tic-style with assurances of sincerity such as \u201creally\u201d and \u201ctotally.\u201dThe issue is talking versus \u201cspeaking,\u201d a more crucial distinction than we have reason to think about until someone as linguistically unpolished as President Trump brings talking into an arena usually reserved for at least an attempt at speaking.One major concern: His barking style lends itself to expressing casual hatred too easily. Also, Mr. Obama had much less room to be \u201cauthentic.\u201d Mr. Trump has the privilege of talking as he pleases with no concern for how he sounds. He can string his impressions together as they come, while a black politician who sounds too \u201cstreet\u201d gets only so far. (Hillary Clinton, too, was boxed in, by gender. If she had used traits associated with the casual speech of women she would have been branded as trivial.)Mr. Trump talks the way any number of people would over drinks, and many of us might be surprised to see elements of that style in our own downtime speech if transcribed.Still, we wonder, what is someone with this after-hours baggy way of talking doing in the Oval Office? The reality is it was only a matter of time. America\u2019s relationship to language has become more informal by the decade since the 1960s, just as it has to dress, sexual matters, culinary habits, dance and much else.We shed the fedora and the white gloves eons ago. What are the chances we would still cherish \u201cwhom\u201d-using oratory?Today, when newscasters announce that we\u2019re \u201cheadin\u2019 into some chilly weather\u201d and blogs publish headlines like \u201cAn Intriguing, Totally Not Recommended Method for Clearing Your Earwax,\u201d we hear casual speech as \u201creal\u201d \u2014 a realness that no one expected of a Franklin D. Roosevelt or even a Lyndon B. Johnson. Mitt Romney, with his perfectly square speaking style complete with \u201cgosh\u2019s,\u201d lost in 2012 partly because he sounded what used to be called \u201cpresidential\u201d but now translates to many as stiff. Meanwhile, part of Barack Obama\u2019s visceral appeal was his ability to summon up black preacherly cadence. Imagine Mr. Romney or John McCain trying to get any music out of \u201cYes, we can!\u201d the way Mr. Obama did.We could have seen it coming that a president would be unabashedly semi-articulate. George W. Bush\u2019s election despite his prolific malapropisms was a first indication that being well spoken was a much lower priority for Americans in choosing a president than it once was. Mr. Bush, however, always gave the impression of at least trying to \u201cspeak\u201d rather than \u201ctalk,\u201d with a deer-caught-in-the-headlights quality so perfectly captured by Will Ferrell on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Sarah Palin was a kind of next step, blithely unconcerned with her swivel-tongued syntax and yet revered by millions.It wasn\u2019t going to be long before someone came along as unembarrassed to orate while inarticulate as Ms. Palin, while also getting higher in office than she did. With President Trump, the saloon-style speech is baked in. His career has never given him a reason to even pretend to speak rather than talk; he reportedly doesn\u2019t read, and he lacks introspection \u2014 none of this bodes well for carefully considered self-expression. It would be surprising if this president weren\u2019t a Twitter addict: The 140-character limit creates a way of writing that, like texting, diverges as little as possible from talking.Because it is novel that someone in the Oval Office can\u2019t be bothered with trying to be articulate, President Trump\u2019s speaking style is throwing off the news media. All understand that his speech is structurally ungraceful. It may be harder to grasp that Mr. Trump, as someone just talking rather than artfully communicating ideas, has no sense of the tacit understanding that a politician\u2019s utterances are more signals than statements, vehicles meant to convey larger messages.Anthropologists have documented a tribe, the Kuna of Panama, whose chief gives a long speech in elevated terms and is followed by an assistant who explains what the chief said. This sounds exotic to us until we realize that commentaries after the State of the Union speeches are all but the same thing.So how should we listen to this man daily for years? First, we have to realize that his talking style isn\u2019t as exotically barbaric as it looks on the page \u2014 the oddness is that it winds up on the page at all. And second, we have to understand that his fans\u2019 not minding how he talks is symptomatic of how all of us relate to formality nowadays. Language has just come along with it.I think of Theodore Roosevelt. While he was quite articulate on all levels, he was an ebullient, ever-curious person, about whom an observer once said, with affection, \u201cYou must always remember that the president is about 6.\u201d Linguistically, I listen to the man who is now president as if he were roughly 12 years old. That way, he is always perfectly understandable.Advertisement"}

Our client tends to be that guy. Top of the industry, but he had to earn it.\u201dAnd that guy, Mr. Nagrani said, doesn\u2019t like to go with the crowd, even when it comes to his clothes. That\u2019s why, since starting his first full collection in 2013, Mr. Nagrani has offered limited editions, with each item numbered on an inside tag. The pieces are made in factories and workshops in Italy or Peru. Suits start at $1,800, and the shirts range from $350 to $695.Mr. Nagrani, born in Pune, India, and raised in Northern and Southern California, sold what he called \u201cjunk toys\u201d before his foray into socks. He built the business from there.A set of stairs leads to a larger space, with flowers, fake palm trees, colorful art, rotary-dial telephones, a framed vintage Playboy Club membership card and a fully stocked bar. Right outside the larger space is a narrow putting green and a life-size painting of Superman and Batman embracing each other.Toward the back of the store is yet another room, set up as a closet, complete with a settee and a mounted deer head. Whose closet? In Mr. Nagrani\u2019s imagination, it\u2019s Bruce Wayne\u2019s.If you\u2019re Bruce Wayne, and you\u2019re out all night kicking people\u2019s butts, he said: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to think about what you\u2019re going to wear the next morning. But you still have to look like Bruce Wayne. So everything is interchangeable. Each piece should layer and function six months of the year.\u201dWhich is why Mr. Nagrani offers classic lines, luxurious fabrics and subtle details, like a shirt sleeve lined with suede or a jacket constructed with Alcantara, a durable fabric developed in Japan for car upholstery.Perhaps the reason he is so familiar with his customer\u2019s desires is that he\u2019s really designing for himself.\u201cBeing in this industry and having friends at different brands, I had my choice of everything before,\u201d Mr. Nagrani said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t cohesive and it didn\u2019t feel the way I wanted it to. That\u2019s why I started making clothes. They\u2019re not designed for everybody.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Are Coping (for Now) With Blows to Unity in Europe", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byLosing one referendum crucial to the future of Europe may be regarded as misfortune, but, as Oscar Wilde might say, losing two looks like carelessness. Europe\u2019s leaders are looking careless after forcing votes in Britain and Italy that went the wrong way, from their perspective, within less than six months.But you would barely realize that any of that happened, judging by the performance of European markets.Popular exchange-traded funds, like Vanguard FTSE Europe and iShares Europe, lost 3.9 percent and 3.2 percent on the year, although dividend payments meant that shareholders just about broke even.European government bond yields have soared since the so-called Brexit vote, but they were still down for all of 2016, which means that bond prices, which move in the opposite direction, rose.The markets are taking political developments in stride, but that may not last. For while the people have spoken, they are not about to pipe down soon; national elections are scheduled this year in the two most important European Union states: Germany and France.There are populist parties on the ballot in each that could achieve enough support to ruffle the markets. Many Europeans are frustrated with decades of economic stagnation exacerbated by a failure by leaders to confront barriers to prosperity like high taxes and rigid labor markets. With so much at stake, investment advisers warn, it would be foolish to downplay the dangers.Europe is suffering from \u201cthe rise of populist backlash against the establishment,\u201d said Paul O\u2019Connor, head of multiasset for Henderson Global Investors, a British company that manages $12.5 billion in assets in American mutual funds. \u201cIt feels as if it\u2019s in its infancy, and it\u2019s going to overshadow the next few years quite significantly.\u201dPopulist governments often spend lots of money on infrastructure projects and other programs intended to curry favor with the public, market strategists say. That enhances growth in the short run, and it may provide a notable boost for Europe by accelerating a nascent trend away from the austerity that many governments imposed during the debt crisis a few years ago.But the spending programs are often financed with borrowed money, something that Europe owes plenty of already, and the damage from the added debt usually outweighs and outlasts the benefits from the growth. Stock buyers lately seem to be focusing on the positive growth factors, while bond sellers are looking further ahead.\u201cTypically, when a populist government gets elected, one of the first things it does is fiscal expansion\u201d to promote job growth and voter confidence, said Markus Stadlmann, chief investment officer of Lloyds Private Bank. \u201cWhat happens in the next phase of fiscal expansion is that it\u2019s financed by government borrowing.\u201d President-elect Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain have proposed programs of one sort or another that would serve this purpose, Mr. Stadlmann said.When the bill comes due, it is often in the form of higher interest rates or higher inflation. At that stage, he warned, \u201cgovernment is less in control, the deficit deteriorates, government spending is unsustainable, wages fall in real terms and there are capital outflows. That\u2019s one of the reasons the bond rout has been really intense.\u201dAnother populist impulse that should worry investors is protectionism through tariffs or other curbs on foreign goods. The aim is to protect jobs, but most economists say that constraining trade limits competition and leads to higher consumer prices.One concern about Brexit is that Britain will lose access to the free-trade zone within Europe. Not only might British merchandise be hit with tariffs, but British companies might also have to pay more for European goods used in manufacturing.Mr. Stadlmann called the potential for trade disruptions \u201ca big risk.\u201dA potentially (if, at the moment, unlikely) catastrophic economic event that investment advisers say is not accounted for in asset prices is the departure from the European Union, or at least the euro, of the one indispensable member: Germany.If Germans wanted to leave the union \u2014 say, because of disenchantment with the influx of migrants or the assistance provided to weaker member states \u2014 it could do so. Germany has a more robust economy than its neighbors, and it runs a large current-account surplus with the world outside Europe (more money comes in than goes out), so it could replace the euro with a stronger currency, reducing the country\u2019s debt burden, whereas a weaker country that left the eurozone might risk default.If Germany left, \u201cthe E.U. would be severely wounded, at best,\u201d said William Porter, global credit strategist for Credit Suisse, adding, \u201cPolitics in the periphery is not what\u2019s going to drive\u201d developments in Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s the core.\u201dMr. Stadlmann expressed similar thoughts, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not Spain and Italy that are different in the E.U., it\u2019s Germany.\u201d He added that he is \u201cnot very negative on the E.U. holding together at the moment.\u201dWhat investment advisers are very negative on when they consider the impact of rising populism is European bonds.\u201cThe re-pricing in government bonds is incomplete,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Connor at Henderson, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s plausible the bull market in fixed-income has come to an end.\u201dMr. Stadlmann likewise noted that the reversal of bond yields is \u201ccontinuing and gaining speed.\u201d As for other assets, he encourages being \u201cvery, very selective.\u201d In particular, he favors stocks of German retailers and real estate companies.John Maxwell, manager of the Ivy International Core Equity Fund, is more optimistic on European stocks, especially on multinational companies that are cheaper than rivals based elsewhere and that are comparatively immune to politics.\u201cIf something goes wrong, it doesn\u2019t mean Procter & Gamble is going to do better than Unilever selling detergent in Italy,\u201d he said.Unilever is one portfolio holding that illustrates his point. Others are the energy company Total, British American Tobacco, the health care concern Smith & Nephew and Reckitt Benckiser, which makes household goods.Mr. O\u2019Connor of Henderson prefers market segments that do well when inflation rises, including financial services and economically cyclical sectors like natural resources and consumer discretionary. Among the 10 largest holdings in the Henderson International Opportunities fund on Nov. 30, the last date for which holdings had been disclosed, were the French carmaker Renault, the British insurance company Standard Life and the German tire manufacturer Continental.But Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s support for European stocks in general is lukewarm, and with the penchant that European voters have shown for making surprising decisions with ramifications that will remain hard to gauge, taking big investment risks may start to look like carelessness.\u201cEquities are the place to be, but I think it\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride,\u201d he said. While he finds that \u201cmomentum is gradually improving,\u201d the inability to find lasting solutions to what does not work in Europe ensures that there will be \u201cno very powerful bull script.\u201d\u201cThere is a more plausible path to growth\u201d in Europe, Mr. O\u2019Connor said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not enough to dispel some of the political things that are flaring up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nation\u2019s Largest Offshore Wind Farm Will Be Built Off Long Island", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byUNIONDALE, N.Y. \u2014 Seeking to meet growing electric demand in the Hamptons with renewable energy, the Long Island Power Authority approved the nation\u2019s largest offshore wind farm on Wednesday, set for the waters between the eastern tip of Long Island and Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\u201cIt is the largest project to date, but it will not be the last project,\u201d the power authority\u2019s chief executive, Thomas Falcone, said before the vote as a crowd of supporters erupted in whoops and applause.Wind power has struggled to take off in the United States, but the Long Island project signals that the long-awaited promise of a new, lower-carbon source of electricity is poised to become part of the national energy mix.It has been given new life by New York\u2019s push to meet Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s goal of drawing 50 percent of the state\u2019s power from renewable sources by 2030. That goal includes 2.4 gigawatts of offshore wind, enough to power 1.25 million homes. It is the largest commitment to offshore wind in the country and is part of the state\u2019s way of showing the nascent industry it is serious about developing the resource.\u201cThis project will not only provide a new, reliable source of clean energy but will also create high-paying jobs, continue our efforts to combat climate change and help preserve our environment,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday in a statement, two weeks after he publicly called for the power authority to approve the proposal.The project\u2019s cost was projected at $1 billion but is now expected to be $740 million. Deepwater plans to finance the project with loans and equity investments, according to Jeffrey Grybowski, the company\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Grybowski expressed confidence that the project would qualify for an investment tax credit, set to phase out at the end of 2019, that is worth 24 percent of the development\u2019s cost. Whether it does, however, could be open to interpretation by the Treasury.The turbines, each roughly 600 feet tall, would be connected to a substation in East Hampton by a 50-mile undersea cable. The town has a goal of its own: meeting all of its electric demand with renewable energy by 2020.Other offshore wind projects, notably one off Cape Cod, have encountered opposition over their effect on ocean views. But Deepwater has said the turbines supplying East Hampton would not be visible from Montauk, on the tip of Long Island, and would barely be visible from Martha\u2019s Vineyard, 15 miles away.The approval comes six weeks after the nation\u2019s only other functioning offshore wind-energy farm \u2014 a Deepwater project in Rhode Island state waters off Block Island \u2014 began serving customers on the grid.Big multinational developers like Statoil and Dong Energy are also investing in the business, snapping up leases for ocean parcels with the aim of competing for utility contracts in Maryland, Massachusetts and New York. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority is putting together an offshore wind master plan to guide development, including a swath south of the Rockaways.The projects have all faced some opposition, some of it from commercial fisheries concerned that the turbines, attached to the seafloor, will disrupt their businesses and consumers worried about higher electricity prices. The power authority, which plans to buy all of the Long Island farm\u2019s output over 20 years, says the cost is about the same as its other renewable energy projects, about 16 cents a kilowatt-hour. Its average electricity price is 7.5 cents a kilowatt-hour, so the project is expected to add $1.19 a month to the average customer bill.No opposition was in evidence as the authority voted at a public meeting at its headquarters here. Several supporters praised the proposal as a way to move the electric system off fossil fuels to slow climate change, and as an engine for jobs. But much remains to be done before those benefits materialize.First, the developers must study and map the ocean floor to determine precisely where and how to anchor each turbine, and then go through the federal and state permitting processes. The farm is to begin transmitting power by the end of 2022, so Deepwater would need to start construction no later than 2020.\u201cWe think that thousands of megawatts are going to be built off the coast of the United States in the coming decades,\u201d Mr. Grybowski said. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous clean energy resource. It\u2019s easy for us to tap into it, but we need projects to get from essentially one project to these thousands of megawatts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That year, Forrest Mars Sr. bought Chappell Brothers, giving the candy company access to Chappie brand canned dog food.Today, Mars has 39 brands in its Petcare portfolio, its second largest division. With this deal, Petcare will become its largest business, as VCA adds about $2 billion in revenue. Together, Petcare, chocolate and Wrigley contribute 90 percent of company sales.The impetus for the acquisition goes back years. Mars, based in McLean, Va., uses VCA\u2019s lab services in its veterinary businesses. Talks about a deal began when Mars approached VCA in November. VCA, based in Los Angeles, had been an independent company for more than 30 years, and Bob Antin, the chief executive, said it was not looking to sell.But Mr. Antin said the prospect of joining Mars, and no longer being a public company, was intriguing.Merging with Mars, which is privately held, rids VCA of the challenges of being a public company, including the difficulty of justifying large investment in research and development, said Mr. Antin, 66, in an interview. He said he would remain chief executive of the unit after the acquisition closes.\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to leverage off their technology, and the amazing part about it is their company is focused on what\u2019s best for veterinarians,\u201d Mr. Antin said.Mars agreed to acquire VCA for $93 a share in cash, 31 percent higher than where the shares closed on Friday. VCA traded at a high, up 28 percent to $90.60 a share, after news of the acquisition. Including debt, the deal is valued at $9.1 billion.Mars has committed financing from JPMorgan Chase for the transaction, which has been approved by both boards but still needs approval from VCA shareholders and regulators. The companies said they expected the transaction to close in the third quarter of this year.Mr. Antin and Mr. Weihrauch, 48, have more in common than the combination of their businesses. They each have labradors and three children.Morgan Stanley and BDT advised Mars, while Barclays was the exclusive financial adviser to VCA. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom advised Mars on the acquisition, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett provided legal advice on the debt financing and McDermott Will & Emery advised on antitrust. The law firms Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Potter Anderson Corroon advised VCA.An earlier version of this article misstated when Mars began offering two pet food brands, Pedigree and Whiskas. Both brands were introduced before 1990; they were not introduced in the 1990s.Advertisement"}

Mr. Xiao is a Canadian citizen with an Antiguan diplomatic passport, though he was born in China.His removal from Hong Kong appears to contravene the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d rule that allows the former British colony to run its own affairs and bars the Chinese police from operating here.When asked on Tuesday about Mr. Xiao, the Hong Kong police issued a statement saying that \u201cthe subject\u201d had entered mainland China through a border crossing on Friday. His disappearance was reported the following day, but on Sunday one of Mr. Xiao\u2019s family members reported that Mr. Xiao was safe and that the family had asked to withdraw the missing person\u2019s filing.Mr. Xiao, 45, had spent years outside China, most recently staying at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong.Mr. Xiao\u2019s fortunes rose after his graduation from the university in 1990, where he had been head of the official student organization and stayed loyal to the government during the pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989.In Chinese, there is no ambiguity: \u201cAbroad\u201d means outside the mainland. Those posts have since been removed. Those statements were untrue, according to the person close to Mr. Xiao, and were meant to tamp down interest in the story, because China\u2019s government did not want it publicized.The person did not know why Mr. Xiao had been taken to the mainland, adding that his relatives, including his wife and son, were not in China. The Tomorrow Group has extensive holdings in China. Previous disappearances of Chinese billionaires have generated turmoil in Chinese stock markets, which are closed this week for the Lunar New Year.On Tuesday evening, the Hong Kong police press office would not comment on whether the local police had helped arrest Mr. Xiao and transport him across the border, and it would not say whether the Chinese police had illegally apprehended Mr. Xiao, saying only that it had asked the mainland police for help in the case.The Chinese Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request seeking comment on Mr. Xiao.

{"Headline": "How Efficiency Is Wiping Out the Middle Class", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewI am concerned that my childhood dreams may turn into a nightmare.Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d which I first saw in 1968 at seven years of age, sparked my fascination with computers and artificial intelligence, and I have since focused my academic studies and career pursuits within this area.Fast-forward to today. I still believe that A.I. and automation can keep bringing good to the world. Its effects on middle-skill workers, in America\u2019s industrial Midwest and elsewhere, however, worry me.It has been suggested that the significant job loss and career destruction illuminated by the 2016 presidential election are a result of bad trade deals and corporate greed. I disagree. It\u2019s much more likely a result of computers, including significant advances in A.I., which have allowed us to optimize our economy as never before. Already, they have permitted the global economy to function as if it were in your backyard. In the next decade, they will take over a vast array of routine work, in new industries, affecting even more workers.The economic dislocations that computers and artificial intelligence have unleashed have been vastly underestimated. And we are just in the early days.Think about commercial trucking in America. A.I.-based self-driving truck technology for travel on interstate highways is already technically feasible. Today, about five million drivers are employed in this industry. Even a 20 percent reduction in this work force over the next 15 years equates to a million lost jobs.One of capitalism\u2019s bedrock promises \u2014 one that dates back to Adam Smith \u2014 is that competition in the free market benefits society at large. Somewhere along the line, intoxication with efficiency caused us to lose sight of that principle at the expense of workers. Getting back to that promise will require policy changes and a renewal of forgotten values.The raw, widespread anger we saw during the recent election \u2014 and the unexpected swing of several industrial states from reliably blue to red \u2014 reflects in large part the intense despair that many middle-skill workers feel as they see their families\u2019 economic prospects fade and social conditions deteriorate.Trade and immigration have become boogeymen, while technological advances and the huge efficiency gains they bring truly underpin the \u201chollowing out\u201d of the middle class behind the scenes. Industrial automation has been displacing workers for decades \u2014 particularly those doing repetitive, lower-skill work.With so many at risk of being pushed aside by Smith\u2019s invisible hand, no one should be surprised if people decide to push back.Unless we change course now, we can expect many more Everytowns to become Allentowns.What\u2019s the answer? Most of the commonly proposed fixes are unlikely to resolve the issue. For example, an increasing focus on education, while necessary (the number of American college graduates falls short of labor demand by about 300,000 annually), is not sufficient; what good is a college degree if there are no opportunities to use it? The same could be asked of worker retraining programs.Some promote the promise of the so-called gig or sharing economy \u2014 flexibility! convenience! \u2014 but I don\u2019t buy it. Working as an Uber driver might help make ends meet in the short term, but the experience actually causes skills to atrophy over time. When I speak of jobs being lost or saved, what I really mean is careers: the kind of work that provides skill development, meaningful wage growth prospects and a reasonable likelihood that one\u2019s work won\u2019t be automated away. The types of careers, in other words, that have traditionally formed the foundation of healthy communities.Some argue that history teaches us not to worry: The Industrial Revolution was disruptive, but it created jobs eventually, didn\u2019t it? Sure. Will the Information Revolution do the same? Nobody knows. Creative destruction has become a hallowed concept in the American boardroom, but let\u2019s be honest: Not all destruction is creative in the Schumpeterian sense. As we are seeing, it might just create a wasteland where middle-class communities once thrived.Mr. Christensen and Mr. van Bever suggest rebooting the capitalist system through a series of policy incentives aimed at making investment capital more \u201cpatient,\u201d evolving the curriculums at business schools, realigning corporate strategy and resource allocation and freeing managers to focus on long-term value creation.These ideas are worthy of support. I would go further and recommend aligning corporate tax policy with the goal of creating and fostering careers by skewing tax rates to favor businesses that create opportunities meeting the criteria described above (skill development, wage growth and resistance to automation).Given the nature of the problem we face, companies able to create careers through innovation should reap significantly greater policy rewards than companies focused primarily on driving down costs \u2014 and eliminating careers.And business leaders must wake up to the scope and difficulty of the challenges we face. It\u2019s going to require a shift in values. The hollowing out of the middle-skill work force is a classic tragedy of the commons, and few in leadership positions today feel a personal responsibility to help address it. Unfortunately, the true costs associated with the upheaval have thus far been borne not by those in the C-suite, but predominantly by the hard-pressed American worker.A narrow emphasis on efficiency puts our entire system at risk. Moving forward, creating careers (rather than dead-end jobs) must be an equally valid goal. We cannot and should not try to stop the march of technological progress. But we have to redefine what progress really means.David Siegel is co-founder and co-chairman of Two Sigma Investments. Advertisement"}

They expect, she said, \u201ca middle-aged man.\u201dBut Constable Wheatley, slight of build and with an easy smile, is exactly the kind of officer her superiors want to recruit.Constable Wheatley, who studied social policy at the University of Birmingham, joined the police last summer, one of more than 150 officers farmed out across England as part of an independent initiative financed by the British Home Office that started in 2015.The program, Police Now, recruits university graduates and assigns them for two years in the country\u2019s most troubled areas, where they walk the streets and provide a public face for the police.With police forces in the United States facing accusations of racial bias over shootings involving officers and unarmed black men, the British initiative focuses in particular on the recruitment of women and minorities, looking to diversify a corps often derided as \u201cmale, pale and stale.\u201dIn Burnley, Constable Wheatley\u2019s supervisor, Inspector Catherine Platt, has seen the changes to the police\u2019s composition firsthand.When she joined the force in 1993, Inspector Platt was required to wear a skirt and stockings and was given a police-issued handbag. (Her baton was smaller than that of male colleagues so it could fit inside.) Her only pair of trousers was for use on night shifts.\u201cSeven gents and myself,\u201d Inspector Platt, 45, said of her cohort of officers at the time.\u201cWe\u2019ve still got a way to go,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re always making progress.\u201dIt is a significant change in a law enforcement tradition that traces its roots to 1829, when the Metropolitan Police, the force responsible for London, was established, thanks in part to Sir Robert Peel, the home secretary at the time.Police Constable Rhian Samuda, another participant, has no plans to leave.Constable Samuda, however, is familiar with it all: She was born in the neighborhood.The granddaughter of immigrants from Jamaica, she went to college in Nottingham, a city 100 miles north of London, before returning to live with her parents in the capital.\u201cI love the fact that I used to live here,\u201d she said, sitting in the Tottenham Police Station canteen. \u201cAnd now I give back to this community.\u201dThe program aims to address lingering allegations of excessive violence and complaints that efforts to diversify have not gone far enough.Police Now graduates, though a small proportion of overall forces, are more reflective of population statistics. So far, 176 officers have been hired since the program started in summer 2015, and around 250 more are set to join this year. Of those who are already on the beat, 49 percent are women and 18 percent are members of minorities.Several challenges remain, though, for police forces and for Police Now.Experts also note that policing has become more complex in recent years, as officers sort through data and evidence from an increasingly wide array of sources. It is too much for anyone to learn in two years, critics of the Police Now program charge.The program\u2019s organizers say that it has attracted a diverse cohort of officers and that many will follow a career in policing, though there are no explicit retention targets. David Spencer, a Police Now founder and program director, added that those who did leave would become \u201cambassadors\u201d for Britain\u2019s police forces in whatever industry they joined.That feeling is not lost in the town itself. As he walked through the office, one of Constable Wheatley\u2019s colleagues jokingly asked when Burnley looked its best. \u201cWhen you\u2019re leaving it.\u201dOn a recent patrol, Constable Wheatley was accompanied by Police Constable Mark Bewley, her \u201cmentor\u201d \u2014 an experienced officer assigned to team up with her in the early weeks of her career. The pair drove through the areas they are responsible for, and Constable Wheatley sat in as the police representative in a meeting of officials discussing recent episodes at a local care home.They later walked down a nearby street where three windows had been shattered by bricks. Around the corner, the pair walked by the house of a resident who was suspected of breaking the windows, and briefly stopped to chat with him.\u201cIt\u2019s always good to know not just the nice people in the neighborhood, but also the people who might commit crimes,\u201d Constable Bewley said.At the end of the working day, back at the police station, an army veteran approached them. After saying he had been drinking, he added that he was considering overdosing because of his marital problems. The man broke down crying as Constable Wheatley comforted him.\u201cI can\u2019t do this again,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201dConstable Wheatley and Constable Bewley drove the man to his brother\u2019s house, sat with the men in the living room and calmed the situation. As the officers left, the men thanked them and said they would try to resolve the marital difficulties before approaching law enforcement for help again.But earlier in the police station, her arm around the man\u2019s shoulder, Constable Wheatley had reassured him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be scared, she said. \u201cYou coming to us was the best thing you could have done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s \u2018The Apprentice, Supreme Court Edition,\u2019 as Trump Summons Finalists to White House", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byFirst 100 Days Briefing\u25a0 President Trump is bringing his top two candidates for the Supreme Court to the White House on Tuesday, adding to the tension ahead of his prime-time court announcement.\u25a0 Networks will give Mr. Trump the show he wants, cutting into prime-time programming to broadcast his Supreme Court choice.\u25a0 The Border Patrol gets a new chief, drawn from its own ranks.It\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice, SCOTUS Edition.\u201dMr. Trump, who has a penchant for the theatrical and loved teasing out suspense in his key appointments throughout the campaign, plans to bring his two top choices for the United States Supreme Court to the White House ahead of his announcement tonight at 8 p.m., according to a CNN report.The two judges, Neil M. Gorsuch and Thomas M. Hardiman, are traveling to Washington this afternoon, the report said. The move is highly unusual for Washington, where Supreme Court announcements are treated with solemn gravity. But it is very familiar for Mr. Trump, who was the original star of the reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and who used to produce beauty pageants.Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about which way he is leaning. Judge Hardiman has been recommended by Mr. Trump\u2019s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, who is a federal judge. But Judge Gorsuch has strong supporters.The Trump administration is also mindful of making a choice that would be seen as moderate enough that Justice Anthony Kennedy, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, could feel comfortable with retiring in the next few years, opening up another seat for the current president to fill.Judge Gorsuch was a clerk for Mr. Kennedy.The major broadcast networks are set to carry President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court announcement live on Tuesday evening, cutting into regular prime-time programming.The coverage by ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox broadcast affiliates is likely to significantly expand the television audience for the president\u2019s announcement, which has taken on the air of a reality television special. Mr. Trump has used his Twitter account to encourage Americans to tune in for the event.Typically, the introduction of a Supreme Court nominee occurs during the daytime, when viewership is relatively lower. The major cable-news networks also plan to carry tonight\u2019s announcement live.The Customs and Border Protection agency announced on Tuesday that Ronald Vitiello, an executive assistant commissioner and long-time insider at the agency, has been named the new chief of the Border Patrol.Mr. Vitiello\u2019s elevation to head the 93-year old agency comes nearly a week days after Mark Morgan, who had been chief since October 2016, was asked to step down by the Trump administration.Mr. Morgan\u2019s last day was Tuesday. Mr. Morgan, a former F.B.I. agent, was appointed chief in June and took over in October. He was the first chief in the agency\u2019s history that had never worked as a border patrol agent. He had led the internal affairs office at Customs and Border Protection before taking over the Border Patrol.His appointment drew criticism from the National Border Patrol Council, the union for Border Patrol workers, which said an insider should have been appointed to head the agency.The union endorsed Mr. Trump during the election, and the union\u2019s president, Brandon Judd, also served on Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team.President Trump, who just weeks ago accused the pharmaceutical industry of \u201cgetting away with murder,\u201d demanded on Tuesday that major drug companies lower their prices and return operations to the United States. But he vowed to help them by shredding regulations and leveling the playing field with foreign countries.Mr. Trump gathered the heads of pharmaceutical companies in the Roosevelt Room for what has become a regular feature of his first days in the White House: a meeting with corporate leaders, at which the president holds forth on an pet issue for the television cameras.\u201cThe U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the pricing has been astronomical,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have to get prices down for a lot of reasons.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be streamlining the process, so that, from your standpoint, when you have a drug, you can actually get it approved if it works, instead of waiting for many, many years,\u201d he added.Much of his message had to do with luring corporate investment back to the United States. He promised that the Food and Drug Administration would speed its approval of new drugs. And he said the United States would end \u201cforeign freeloading,\u201d which he described as countries devaluing their currencies to undercut the competitiveness of the American market.\u201cBecause our country has been run so badly, we know nothing about devaluation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look at what China\u2019s doing, you look at what Japan has done over the years. They play the money market, they play the devaluation market, while we sit here like a bunch of dummies.\u201dChina\u2019s currency has actually been appreciating of late, and Japan has not intentionally manipulated its currency values for several years.The acting attorney general has been fired, protests are rocking the nation\u2019s largest airports, and a constitutional clash is brewing between the executive and judicial branches, but Mr. Trump thinks the Democrats are a real mess because their audio equipment malfunctions, as do their tear ducts.The rally he was referring to was surprisingly large for what amounted to a political event on the steps of the Supreme Court. But what is really sticking in the president\u2019s craw is the glacial pace of confirmations in the Senate \u2014 which is intentional. His choice for transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, is likely to be confirmed on Tuesday afternoon, and his nominee for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, will probably get a vote on Wednesday. Committee votes are expected today for his nominees for attorney general, Jeff Sessions and small business administrator, Linda McMahon. The Senate Education Committee voted out the nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary on a party-line vote.But Democrats are deliberately slowing the process as they demand more answers to questions about ethics and the nominees\u2019 views on Mr. Trump\u2019s temporary immigration ban from citizens of seven predominantly Muslim nations.Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets only gave Democratic leaders the opportunity to grab the high ground. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, the House minority leader, responded:\u201cThe mic briefly didn\u2019t work, but this thin-skinned President clearly heard the voices of the more than 250 Members of Congress and thousands of others who gathered outside the Supreme Court last night. The President\u2019s immoral executive order is clearly unconstitutional \u2013 no matter how many times he tweets or how many Administration officials he fires.\u201dSo did Mr. Schumer\u2019s spokesman, Matt House:\u201cPresident Trump should learn that name calling is not going to solve the many problems this administration has already brought upon itself. He ought to repeal this un-American, poorly put-together, and rushed executive order that makes America less safe and figure out a real way to stop terrorism.\u201dDemocrats on the Senate Finance Committee sought to stall the confirmations of Steven Mnuchin and Tom Price, Mr. Trump\u2019s picks for Treasury secretary and secretary of health and human Services, refusing to attend scheduled votes on Tuesday.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said that recent news reports suggested that Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Price had given false statements in their nomination hearings and that the committee members needed more information before making judgments about the nominees.\u201cWe have made clear that we need additional information,\u201d Mr. Wyden said outside of his office, explaining the reason for the boycott.Republicans expressed dismay at the delay. But with a Supreme Court vacancy nearing its 12-month point after an unprecedented blockade by Republicans, Democrats weren\u2019t exactly feeling the heat, at least not yet.Democrats now have every reason to drag out the confirmation fight over Mr. Sessions as long as possible, leaving Mr. Trump\u2019s order defended by a Justice Department rived by dissent against a growing list of opponents.Mr. Trump seems to understand this.But what about Republican senators like John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Cory Gardner of Colorado?They have leverage to demand changes before they seat Mr. Sessions at the Justice Department. But as the fight drags on, so does the lag in warrants. The pressure will only intensify.At her confirmation hearings to be deputy attorney general, Ms. Yates faced a grilling from Republicans who were furious about former President Barack Obama\u2019s order liberalizing immigration policy.The question: Would Ms. Yates be willing to stand up to the president?Her inquisitor? Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, and now Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general.\u201cIf the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say \u2018No?\u2019\u201d Mr. Sessions asked.\u201cI believe the attorney general or deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and Constitution and give their independent legal advice to the president,\u201d Ms. Yates replied.The European Union negotiator on Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union returned from the United States and declared that a united Europe now faces three threats: Islamist terrorism, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Mr. Trump.\u201cTrump spoke very favorably of the fact that also other countries will want to break away from the European Union, and that he hoped for a disintegration of the European Union,\u201d he added.President Trump and his administration have enraged Mexico, bewildered Japan, incensed China and angered much of the Muslim world. So what\u2019s wrong with tweaking the Germans?Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s new National Trade Council, told The Financial Times that Germany was using a \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro to \u201cexploit\u201d the United States and its European Union partners.That did not sit well with Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel.\u201cGermany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did that before the euro existed,\u201d Ms. Merkel told a news conference with Stefan Lofven, the prime minister of Sweden, according to Reuters. \u201cBecause of that we will not influence the behavior of the E.C.B. And as a result, I cannot and do not want to change the situation as it is,\u201d she added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Takes a Right Turn", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byMost tech executives and employees remain supportive of Democrats, especially on social and cultural issues. The Republican tilt of the PACs at Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook suggests, however, that as these companies\u2019 domains grow larger, their bottom-line interests are becoming increasingly aligned with the policies of the Republican Party.In 2016, the Microsoft PAC gave $478,818 to Republican House candidates and $272,000 to Democratic House candidates. It gave $164,000 to Republican Senate candidates, and $75,000 to Democratic Senate candidates.This was not small change. In 2016 Microsoft employees gave a total of $6.47 million.The firm first became a noticeable player in the world of campaign finance in 2012 when employees and the company PAC together made contributions of $910,000. That year, Facebook employees backed Democrats over Republicans 64-35, while the company\u2019s PAC tilted Republican, 53-46.By 2016, when total Facebook contributions reached $3.8 million, the Democratic advantage in employee donations shrank to 51-47, while the PAC continued to favor Republicans, 56-44.While the employees of the three other most valuable tech companies, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and Apple, remained Democratic in their giving in 2016, at the corporate level of Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 that is, at the level of their PACs \u2014 they have not.Tech giants can no longer be described as insurgents challenging corporate America.American consumer technology companies are getting larger, more entrenched in their own sectors, more powerful in new sectors and better insulated against surprising competition from upstarts.Among Ferenstein\u2019s findings: a minority, 29 percent, of tech company founders described labor unions as \u201cgood,\u201d compared to 73 percent of Democrats. Asked \u201cis meritocracy naturally unequal?\u201d tech founders overwhelmingly agreed.Ferenstein went on:One hundred percent of the smaller sample of founders to whom I presented this question said they believe that a truly meritocratic economy would be \u201cmostly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unequal. This is a key distinction: Opportunity is about maximizing people\u2019s potential, which founders tend to believe is highly unequal. Founders may value citizen contributions to society, but they don\u2019t think all citizens have the potential to contribute equally. When asked what percent of national income the top 10% would hold in such a scenario, a majority (67%) of founders believed that the richest individuals would control 50% or more of total income, while only 31% of the public believes such an outcome would occur in a meritocratic society.One of the most interesting questions posed by Ferenstein speaks to middle and working class anxieties over global competition:In international trade policy, some people believe the U.S. government should create laws that favor American business with policies that protect it from global competition, such as fees on imported goods or making it costly to hire cheaper labor in other countries (\u201coutsourcing\u201d). Others believe it would be better if there were less regulations and businesses were free to trade and compete without each country favoring their own industries. Which of these statements come closest to your belief?There was a large difference between tech company officials, 73 percent of whom chose free trade and less regulation, while only 20 percent of Democrats supported those choices.Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University who writes about demographic, social and economic trends, sees these differences as the source of deep conflict within the Democratic Party.The disruptive force is largely Silicon Valley, a natural oligarchy that now funds a party teetering toward populism and even socialism. The fundamental contradictions, as Karl Marx would have noted, lie in the collision of interests between a group that has come to epitomize self-consciously progressive mega-wealth and a mass base which is increasingly concerned about downward mobility.The tech elite, Kotkin writes, \u201cfar from deserting the Democratic Party, more likely will aim take to take it over.\u201d Until very recently, theconflict between populists and tech oligarchs has been muted, in large part due to common views on social issues like gay marriage and, to some extent, environmental protection. But as the social issues fade, having been \u201cwon\u201d by progressives, the focus necessarily moves to economics, where the gap between these two factions is greatest.Kotkin sees future partisan machination in cynical terms:One can expect the oligarchs to seek out a modus vivendi with the populists. They could exchange a regime of higher taxes and regulation for ever-expanding crony capitalist opportunities and political protection. As the hegemons of today, Facebook and Google, not to mention Apple and Amazon, have an intense interest in protecting themselves, for example, from antitrust legislation. History is pretty clear: Heroic entrepreneurs of one decade often turn into the insider capitalists of the next.In 2016, Donald Trump has produced an upheaval within the Republican Party that shifted attention away from the less explosive turmoil in Democratic ranks.Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed bid to finesse the inherent conflict between her dependence on corporate contributions and her need for a strong turnout by union workers, minorities and idealistic millennials embodies the Democratic Party\u2019s long term struggle.The public, at least for the moment, is not willing to support the continued compromise of principle that has been a hallmark of both parties. Trump has provided a temporary solution for the Republican Party; the Democrats need to find a legitimate and more lasting one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Cities are resurgent. Increasingly they\u2019re where new jobs, economic growth and people are all thriving. From Miami to Munich and S\u00e3o Paulo to Shanghai, the world\u2019s cities are multiplying in number and growing in size.Already, more than half of the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas. By mid century, that share will grow to two-thirds, the U.N. predicts. This urbanization comes at a cost, though. Infrastructure is strained. Cars are multiplying but roads are not, so congestion is worsening. And the supply of vital resources \u2014 energy, clean air and fresh water \u2014 is imperiled.A new generation of technology can help. Self-driving and electric-powered vehicles are here now, pointing toward a safer, cleaner future. As car sharing has boomed, our relationship with autos is evolving: from things we own for years, to services we use, and pay for mile by mile. At the same time smart sensors, big data, artificial intelligence and advanced analytics are evolving in a way that will help improve how cities operate.We\u2019re not there yet. But these dynamics are encouraging public officials, private leaders and everyday residents to hunt for smart ideas, pioneering innovators and revelatory discussions. Ford Motor Company asked many of them to share their dreams for the City of Tomorrow. We invite you to share yours, too.The seeds of the City of Tomorrow \u2014 from technologies like autonomous vehicles to innovations like the sharing economy \u2014 are all around us. But what is it about city life we seek to preserve and accelerate?James Altucher, an entrepreneur and self-help expert who has lived in New York since 1994, sees cities as centers of opportunity. Future cities, he says, will magnify those opportunities for citizens: \u201cCities are remarkable for the amazing number of opportunities. That\u2019s why people have historically moved from rural areas to cities. So the way to reinvent the city is to use technology, innovation and networking to multiply access to opportunity. That turns a city into a megacity. \u201cOne way to multiply opportunity is to provide easier access to everything that\u2019s empty. For empty rooms and offices, you can now provide access through Airbnb or WeWork. This idea didn\u2019t even exist 10 years ago and now it\u2019s everywhere.\u201cIn any situation where there\u2019s excess capacity and people who want to buy that excess capacity, a platform in the middle can multiply exponentially the number of opportunities by matching supply with demand.\"Opportunity is always in the cities, that\u2019s never going away. But the cities that will win will be those that facilitate easy access to those opportunities. Mobility actually increases the value of cities because it allows many more people to take advantage of the opportunities there.\u201dBrigham Yen, chronicler of the downtown Los Angeles renaissance in the DTLA Rising news blog, sees the robust futures of cities inspired by their history: \u201cDowntown L.A., Manhattan and Chicago were built as cities meant for people. You had a grid and a transportation network and people walked. The suburban paradigm that is viewed today as mainstream is really the new way that baby boomers pushed forward after World War II. The idea took off, but there were obviously unforeseen aspects to the suburban model. If everybody gets around by a car, you are going to get traffic. You are going to be isolated. Everything was homogenized. My generation, the millennials, just kind of thought, \u2018It\u2019s boring.\u2019\u201cThe urban paradigm is so much more stimulating. It rests on the idea of a mix of uses and close proximity. You have a concentration of business, residences, culture, entertainment and education. Everything is mixed together dynamically. Especially when they\u2019re younger, people have ambitions, entrepreneurial drive and that spirit to execute their ideas.\u201dIn the past, cities built roads, subways and railroads to support the movement of goods and people. The City of Tomorrow will be built on a digital foundation that\u2019s flexible, intelligent and more affordable.In 2009, New York City closed a stretch of Broadway to vehicles. The move was hotly debated but proved a big success. Tomorrow\u2019s smart cars might make similar decisions independently \u2014 and less contentiously. Former Lord Mayor Stephen Yarwood of Adelaide, Australia, explains: \u201cArtificial intelligence in a vehicle will consciously avoid high pedestrian environments knowing that it will slow its trip and reduce the productivity of the city. Just as at the moment we\u2019re battling to reclaim public space for pedestrians, in the future that will be an organic process where vehicles will choose not to drive through environments where they know that people are.\u201cYou\u2019ll find that people will be able to reclaim public spaces in ways that we don\u2019t understand today. People think that autonomous vehicles, if they look like a duck, quack like a duck, and smell like a duck, they must be a duck. But these vehicles will start to move through cities in different ways, and enable people to reclaim public space.\u201dThe advent of autonomous vehicles and other smart-city technologies will not just reshape how people and goods are moved around. They will also reshape how much is spent on transportation projects, says former U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk: \u201cTransportation is expensive. One of the topics of discussion around the implementation of autonomous vehicles is the impact that they will have on the necessity of building roads, particularly in places like the United States.\u201cI think as we begin to understand the deployment and uses of this technology more it will impact financing decisions because you may not need the same infrastructure that we presumed you would need 30 years ago.\u201cThe smart deployment of this technology can go hand-in-hand with reducing the need for building traditional transit infrastructure. It will allow you to maybe use those dollars elsewhere.\u201dThere is no shortage of data about transportation. The challenge is figuring out how to make it accessible and useable, says Ford Smart Mobility Chairman Jim Hackett: \u201cWe have to imagine that the data has always been there. For example, data exists about where we\u2019re going, the route we will take and what we will face along that journey. Now, as the data becomes transparent \u2014 if people want to opt in \u2014 then we have a chance for the system to be better orchestrated.\u201cWhat we need to realize the full potential of this future is an open operating system. This will help allow all the various actors in the system to engage. Unfortunately, there is no central source for this today. This is where we need to rely on our mayors and other government leaders.\u201cOur role in this system is to deeply understand what people care about in the transportation system as well as be responsible for certain transportation modes in that system. In addition, we want to be a catalyst for the discussion with mayors and city leaders to envision this future.\u201dOpportunities and other benefits of urban living are available only to those who can access them. Will the City of Tomorrow be accessible to everyone?As the CEO of Travel Noire, Zim Ugochukwu has visited many cities around the world. But her vision for a City of Tomorrow is grounded in her experience on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, when she was living on $3 a day: \u201cI used to live on Treasure Island, which is right under the Bay Bridge to San Francisco, and the only way to get to San Francisco was to take a bus. That one bus ran 24 hours but relatively infrequently, so unless you had a car \u2014 you can\u2019t walk across the Bay Bridge \u2014 you were stuck.\u201cWhen you got into the city you had all of these different modes of transportation to get you to different parts of San Francisco. I found that really intriguing: A diversity of transportation options is key.\u201dCar- and bike-sharing services provide access to jobs and fun. But they usually require a bank account. Columbus, Ohio, is working with local banks to find affordable solutions for the 33,000 people who live in the city\u2019s Linden neighborhood. Mayor Andrew Ginther explains the public-private partnership: \u201cAll the mobility options that you and I take for granted, whether it\u2019s Uber or Car2Go or bike-sharing, require a credit card. And research shows it\u2019s the first mile and the last mile that are the biggest challenges around mobility, particularly for folks living in neighborhoods that are more isolated.\u201cIn a pilot, financial institutions are helping us work on a card that you can load cash onto and use to access all different modes of transportation. Some of the neighborhoods that we\u2019re focused on are food deserts, they\u2019re health care deserts, they\u2019re job deserts, and so having access to smart, consistent, safe, reliable transportation is critical to helping those families access what you and I take for granted.\u201cIf you live in Linden, you need to get to a rapid transit stop and then to the front door of your job, your school, your child care, your health care, your job training, or fresh fruits and vegetables. So this transit card is going to help Linden residents navigate that first mile and last mile. That transit card allows them to make that connection. Our hope is to use that strategy in other neighborhoods too.\u201dThe City of Tomorrow will support a diversity of ideas through education and recognize our planet does not have an infinite supply of energy, water or other natural resources.Though the diversity of cities is frequently praised, it\u2019s often not respected. Education will be critical to preserving diversity in the City of Tomorrow, says Blake Mycoskie, an author and the founder of Toms Shoes: \u201cWe have to find a way in the City of Tomorrow to be more supportive of diverse ways of thinking. It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019re even still having this conversation in 2017, but even in the United States we still have work to do on our tolerance for true diversity and different ways of thinking, different religions, different philosophies. We need to find a way in our cities to create educational experiences so that people can see that even though we have differences, we all still have the same basic needs.\u201cThat is going to do the most for our future. We have to find a way to live together in support of one another better than we\u2019re doing today. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a technological solve for that, but there might be a design solve in terms of the ways that we create educational experiences so that our children are experiencing a more radical diversity from the very beginning. That would make the world a better place.\u201dSustainability has been a part of Ford Motor Company since Henry Ford introduced the assembly line. His great-grandson, Executive Chairman Bill Ford, says protection of the planet remains a driving force at the company: \u201cSustainability is about using the resources we have in a way that benefits us today but also preserves them for future generations. Smart mobility is the logical next step in sustainability, because it provides the most efficient and effective way to move people and things. I hope that historians look back on Ford as a company that continually helps make people\u2019s lives better \u2014 by providing mobility for all.\u201cOn sustainability, our vision is underpinned by a \u201czero mentality,\u201d including using zero minerals in our vehicles that contribute to conflict. In our manufacturing plants, our goals include reducing drinkable water use to zero, and helping deliver clean water to communities that need it. And sending zero waste to landfills from our facilities around the world. These are the goals which are driving us into the future.\u201dYounger people are flocking to cities and the opportunities they offer. Their voices are critical in the conversation about the City of Tomorrow.Former Adelaide Lord Mayor Stephen Yarwood \u2014 who, at 39, was then the youngest mayor of an Australian capital city when he took office in 2004 \u2014 says it\u2019s imperative for older generations to keep an open mind: \u201cI would encourage city leaders to listen to the next generation more effectively. They need to create entrepreneurial ecosystems that support contributions by a generation that thinks completely differently than us. Engaging younger people who are digitally literate, who actually think in a nonlinear way \u2014 who understand, have and share and live those values \u2014 is incredibly important as well.\u201cI encourage city leaders to actually give it a go. Install a few apps. Try a few things. Talk to a few people. Maybe become a little bit more reliant on doing some things yourself and having some of those personal human experiences in their own city. What mayors have actually stayed in an Airbnb in their own city and talked to those hosts and had the experience? You can live in a bubble as a leader, and it\u2019s really good to be able to immerse yourself in the community and connect and actually understand how people live and use cities.\u201dTo Ryan Seacrest, television personality, producer and entrepreneur, the City of Tomorrow and work spaces are already being shaped by new generations: \u201cThe younger consumers today are pushing us all to look and see things differently. Some people grumble about their pursuit of instant gratification that technology has enabled, and obviously there\u2019s major disruption happening in many different businesses as a result, but I think it\u2019s actually an exciting time.\u201cToday, people are just as ambitious as they always were. However, they like to have the option to work from home rather than at a traditional work space, and flex hours are what they believe to be normal \u2014 not necessarily nine-to-five.\u201cHere in Los Angeles many of the young members of our team are designing their lives so they can share the commuting experience. They carpool or use Uber or other ride-sharing services or maybe they rent an apartment close by, so they can ride their bike to the office.\u201dHuman ingenuity, partnerships and robust debate were critical in the creation of today\u2019s urban landscape and will be as the City of Tomorrow takes hold.Cities alone can\u2019t create a revolution in mobility, and the job is too much for a single company or even an industry. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford explains the need for partnerships around the globe: \u201cCore to our mobility work are the cities around the world facing congestion and pollution. We know these cities need a partner to deliver mobility solutions that work for their communities to help people live, work or play where they choose. And we are deeply committed to being a thoughtful partner.\u201cThe Ford City Solutions team is the first from any automaker, working with cities around the world, to conceptualize and implement new ways of getting locals and visitors where they want to go. We also recently began to collaborate with Mike Bloomberg in his philanthropic work with a coalition of mayors worldwide to accelerate solutions in cities. In doing so, we will collect the best ideas from around the world and put them into action.\u201cWe know we can\u2019t do it alone, which is why we\u2019re so focused on finding partners to help us bring these solutions to life.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Can Donald Trump and Ra\u00fal Castro Make a Good Deal?", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Cuba operates as if it had two parties, President Ra\u00fal Castro joked in his main report to the Seventh Congress of the Cuban Communist Party last April: \u201cFidel leads one and I, the other.\u201dThis was more than just a joke: Fidel Castro, Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s brother and the former president, had criticized President Obama\u2019s visit to Havana a month earlier in official publications. It was the first public split between the brothers on an issue of such importance. President Obama\u2019s Cuba policy change, announced in December 2014, drove a wedge through the Cuban leadership, making manifest the differences between government hard-liners and soft-liners. For the balance of 2016, the hard-liners dominated official communications, republishing tales of American perfidy over the previous two centuries. During the same period, however, Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s senior team negotiated and signed many practical agreements to alter American-Cuban relations.Last year, more than half a million visitors from the United States had set foot in Cuba and American commercial airlines now fly regularly between the United States and Cuban cities. Earlier in the Obama presidency, the United States government liberalized rules on sending money transfers to Cuba, and much of it informally financed the re-emergence of a Cuban private business sector. The number of small- business licenses now exceeds a half-million in a country of 11.2 million people. Money transfers from the United States fund a Cuban civil society independent of the state for the first time in a half-century.Recent agreements between the two countries make it easier for them to cooperate on hurricane tracking and biodiversity protection, share information on pollution and undertake joint maritime geological exploration. Other agreements protect migratory birds and fish. Cuba and the United States now also work together on cancer research, in which Cuban scientists have registered significant advances, and on the prevention and cure of infectious diseases, including combating the Zika epidemic, in which Cuba is a worldwide example of effectiveness.Cuba and the United States have long cooperated on security matters, coordinating on security around the United States Navy base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Since the mid-1990s, the two countries have worked together to prevent undocumented migration. Cuba patrols its ports to prevent anyone from stealing boats and rafts; at its airports, it checks for valid visas among those about to board. United States Coast Guard cutters intercept undocumented migrants in the Straits of Florida and return them to Cuba.The two countries have informally combined efforts on drug traffic interdiction since the 1990s, and this was formalized last July; Cuba provides an effective barrier against drug traffic into the United States.And Cuba long ago adopted the Trump-preferred migration policy: seek to stop the departure and accept the return of undocumented migrants.Suppose you are the United States president-elect. What is not to like?Still, while economic agreements emphasize the two countries\u2019 equality, some of the deals couldn\u2019t be more lopsided. Only American airlines fly between the two countries; Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n does not. And since late 2002, Cuba has purchased about $5.3 billion worth of United States agricultural products, paying cash, while exporting almost no goods to the United States.What\u2019s wrong with agreements already in place that benefit both countries? The United States wants to warn Florida and the Carolinas about hurricane trajectories, its fowl and fish to winter in Cuba\u2019s Caribbean waters and come back, and to benefit from Cuba\u2019s scientific expertise. Cuba and the United States are interested in exploring for oil in the Gulf of Mexico and have agreed to track seismic threats beneath the gulf\u2019s waters to prevent oil spills.On delicate issues, President George W. Bush and Fidel Castro, and later President Obama and Ra\u00fal Castro, developed ways of agreeing substantively while publicly denying any negotiation had taken place. That diplomatic ruse worked. In 2002, the Cubans induced the Bush administration to begin exporting American agricultural products; each side made it known that these were unilateral, independent and sovereign decisions. In December 2012, the United States and Cuba did not trade spies; rather, each made unilateral, independent and sovereign decisions to release some of the other\u2019s prisoners.Slowly, United States-Cuba relations got better. That serves Cubans who may travel more easily, receive friends, rent space through Airbnb, and get working capital through money transfers to establish private businesses and fund an independent civil society. That serves Americans who benefit from freer travel and cooperation on issues such as migration, crime and drug trafficking. What next? Rely on unilateral, independent and sovereign Cuban decisions to foster change.Here\u2019s how Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s joke ended at the April party congress: \u201cFidel will certainly say, \u2018I want to lead the Communist Party,\u2019 and I will say, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ll lead the other one, the name does not matter.\u2019 \u201d If you are a Cuban hard-liner, that joke is terrifying. President Ra\u00fal Castro is prepared to open the gateway to something different, less dogmatic, whose name neither he nor we know. But we know what it is not. It is not called \u201cCommunist.\u201dJorge I. Dom\u00ednguez is a professor of government at Harvard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking a Fresh Start Without Limitations", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byThe Neediest Cases FundOn a chilly October morning, Talea Childs, 4, still dressed in pajamas, bounced along the living room rug of a United States map.\u201cKonnichiwa,\u201d she greeted in Japanese, and bowed.Surrounded by shelves of her favorite books, she selected a thin volume and sat to read.\u201cShe\u2019s been interested in books since she could belly over and look at the pages,\u201d her mother, Trenicia Childs, said as Talea settled into the story.Ms. Childs is applying to kindergarten for next year \u2014 a notoriously rigorous process in New York City schools \u2014 and nurtures her daughter\u2019s learning at home. A schedule taped to a cupboard by the kitchen lists Circle Time, Music/Movement, Storytelling, Cooking and other activities. Brushes, thick with paint, sit in a canister by the sink, and evidence of recent art projects lines the walls \u2014 abstract strokes of pinks, purples and green glitter. Also on the walls are posters of the solar system, the human body, the numbers through 100 and the words \u201clarge,\u201d \u201csmall,\u201d \u201crun\u201d and \u201cwalk\u201d and associated words.While Talea read in the corner, Ms. Childs sorted through piles of housing documents. The Childses, who are among almost 565,000 people in New York State who receive some public assistance, according to state calculations in June, never expected to need help. Ms. Childs, 45, and her husband, Tarrell Childs, 40, an Air Force veteran, have college degrees and work force experience.While serving in the military for a decade as an account finance specialist, Mr. Childs worked through an injury in 1997 that gouged and blinded his right eye. A Bronx native, he returned there in 2003, working full time while studying English literature at Fordham University. He wrote short stories, plays and short film scripts late into the night.The couple met at Moca Bar and Lounge at a spoken word performance in Harlem in 2010. Mr. Childs wondered aloud what their children would be like on their second date. A year later they were married and expecting their daughter.With Mr. Childs\u2019s steady income as a property manager, Ms. Childs postponed completing her master\u2019s in education to raise their daughter. She was one certification shy of graduation. But Mr. Childs lost his job in 2014 when his company restructured because of financial problems.\u201cThat\u2019s when we really started getting behind,\u201d Ms. Childs said.With his G.I. Bill benefits set to expire, Mr. Childs dusted off his screenplays and applied to the New York Film Academy. He got in. He planned to work while going to school, but he found that an accelerated yearlong conservatory program packed with 12-hour days did not allow for extra time.Although the military covered his studies, the family exhausted its meager savings.With little time to search for jobs during school, Mr. Childs graduated in September 2015 without work. That month, bringing in just $594.98 in disability payments from Veterans Affairs, the Childses applied for public assistance, confronting a frustrating labyrinth of city departments and aid applications, according to documents provided by the family.Their debt quadrupled while they waited for paperwork to be fixed, and they faced imminent eviction after missing rent payments, the family said.That same month, the Childses found out they had qualified for public assistance through the Human Resources Administration. But two days later, another error closed their case, halting all public assistance, including food stamps.In early 2016, the Human Resources Administration reopened the case, and the family reapplied to the Neighborhood Association for Inter-Cultural Affairs. But a week later the nonprofit denied the application. Eventually, in February, the Human Resources Administration referred the family for an eviction prevention subsidy.\u201cIt felt personal,\u201d Ms. Childs said. \u201cIt was one more stressor when there were already weeks we didn\u2019t have enough food on the table.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s right out of a Kafka novel,\u201d said Alice Kenny, the organization\u2019s director of special projects.In May, Catholic Charities got the city to help settle the Childs family\u2019s arrears with a lump sum of $12,083.46. Then in June, nine months after initially applying for a housing subsidy, they received their first payment, along with another conciliation notice threatening case closure. The family resolved the notice and now receives $960 a month toward rent from the city.Still, despite noting Mr. Childs\u2019s veteran status in September 2015, the family was not referred to the proper office for public assistance for more than a year.Last summer, Mr. Childs got a job as a substitute teacher. Working toward a teaching license while interning on film projects, he anticipates additional film work this year. In January, he began a work training program at a martial arts school in the Bronx, learning to become an instructor.The family brings in $950 monthly, and currently has about $2,000 in rent arrears.HomeBase provided the family with $340 in July to buy a dresser and a toddler bed for Talea. Then in September, Catholic Charities provided $162.85 in Neediest Cases funds to cover the cost of Talea\u2019s school clothes and bedding.Through public assistance, the family can use child care centers that are suggested and subsidized by the city. The family tried several of those education programs last year, but the workload and environment were not stimulating, Ms. Childs said, so she enrolled Talea at a Montessori school, where the family receives financial aid, in late October and doubled her efforts at home.At night, the family dresses up and improvises plays, which Mr. Childs records. Many end in life lessons. Self-limitation is not one of them.While sitting on a park bench on a recent mother-daughter outing, Ms. Childs said, she had a conversation with another mother who did not agree that everyone deserved the same chances. Unaware that the Childs family receives welfare, the woman depicted recipients as sloths sitting at home, sending their children to overpriced day care centers.\u201cBut is that who we are?\u201d Ms. Childs asked, recalling the conversation. \u201cThe assumption is if you\u2019re on public assistance, you don\u2019t want to work. Yes, we receive a check every month. But we also work and are involved in our kid\u2019s life. We\u2019re working hard to make something of ourselves. So, no, that\u2019s not who we are at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Not Only Elite Law Schools Offer Great Returns on Investment", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byMore law school graduates, laden with six-figure debt, have been questioning whether their investment in a degree that comes with such a hefty tuition price tag pays off with a highly paid job.Elite institutions are generally worth the outlay, but, according to a newly released study, a few less nationally known schools also make the cut.The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Houston and the University of Georgia were among the 10 schools offering the best salary-to-debt ratios, according to the study by SoFi, which stands for Social Finance Inc., an online student loan refinance company. They are grouped with Harvard, Yale and Stanford among the top schools that offered their graduates good value for the substantial debt they incurred while law students.SoFi rated the schools after examining salary and debt records of more than 60,000 people who applied to refinance their student loans with the San Francisco company between 2014 and 2016.The Ivy League school offers financial aid packages, and about 60 percent of the law school\u2019s students qualify for need-based scholarship grants, according to SoFi\u2019s findings.Texas graduates have the advantage of low tuition costs, said Amanda Wood, SoFi\u2019s director of business operations and strategy. The tuition is $34,000 a year, the second-lowest in-state tuition among the country\u2019s top 20 ranked schools, according to the study. The Texas school has a national ranking of No. 15.Another Texas school, the University of Houston, had a similar salary-to-debt ratio, Ms. Wood noted. The average graduate from that school three years out had $100,160 in debt and earned an average $136,370.Over all, typical law student loan debt is estimated to be in the low to mid six digits for private law school students, and lower for those who attended public institutions. However, no one official figure covers all law schools.The SoFi study points out that graduates with well-paid jobs and good credit can typically refinance their student loans at a lower rate. However, refinancing with a private lender eliminates protections such as income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness for those in public service jobs.For those seeking a great law school deal, the best may be Brigham Young University, where the average debt is $68,873 and graduates, many of whom stay and practice law in Utah, earn an average of $108,916. But not everyone can qualify. Tuition costs are exceptionally low for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but non-Mormons pay double the $12,000 annual tuition, Ms. Wood said.At the opposite end of the spectrum, SoFi also listed the worst law schools for salary-to-debt ratio, including Florida Coastal School of Law, Charlotte School of Law and Arizona Summit Law School, all three of which are for-profit schools owned by Infilaw Holdings, in Naples, Fla. At two schools, students ran up more than $150,000 in student debt but earned, three years after graduation, slightly over $84,000. Only Arizona Summit, which was formerly known as Phoenix School of Law, had graduates with average annual earnings of slightly over $96,000 \u2014 but that came with debt exceeding $155,000.Infilaw did not respond to a request for comment.Other law schools that graduated newly minted lawyers who earned modest salaries but carried heavy debt loads \u2014 approximately 1.5 times as much as annual salary \u2014 included St. Thomas University, Appalachian School of Law, Thomas Jefferson School of Law and Elon University, SoFi found. Hefty debt means large portions of recent graduates\u2019 paychecks go toward paying off student loans.Taking into account salary only, graduates of three prestigious law schools \u2014 Columbia University, Cornell University and New York University \u2014 earned average salaries above $175,000 three years after getting their degrees, according to SoFi\u2019s data.Those salaries are \u201cjust one or two raises away from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 best-paid lawyer salary of $187,200,\u201d said Ms. Wood, who also noted that the top three schools are all in New York.

But Mr. Barrett appeared to time his death as an inspiring message to his colleagues that the journalistic values he represented \u2014 brutal honesty and tenacity \u2014 can and must survive him and, more important, the new administration that seems so intent on gutting them.Despite what Mr. Trump and his aides say about journalists, those among the congregation \u2014 representing just about every major news organization based in New York \u2014 were never in it for \u201capproval ratings\u201d or \u201cpower.\u201dAn openly ideological journalist who spent most of his 40-plus-year career at The Village Voice, Mr. Barrett never let people off the hook just because they leaned in the same political direction he did.

{"Headline": "Giving Back a \u2018Stolen\u2019 Property to the Original Manhattanites", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byThe squat clapboard house overlooking the Hudson River in the West Village might not seem like an obvious place for a Native American prayer center.The house\u2019s ground floor now sits directly on Manhattan soil, said Jean-Louis Goldwater Bourgeois, 76, a wealthy activist who bought the property in 2006. He says he is essentially donating it back to its original owners: the Lenape Indians.Mr. Bourgeois pointed to a hole recently jackhammered through the thick concrete flooring of the house, which left black soil exposed underneath.\u201cYou can actually touch Manhattan soil \u2014 the idea is to be in touch with Mother Earth,\u201d he said, adding that the plan was to remove the concrete and simply have a dirt floor.Anthony Jay Van Dunk, a former chief of the Ramapough Lenape Nation, a tribe based in Mahwah, N.J., is Mr. Bourgeois\u2019s choice to start a prayer house, or a Pahtamawiikan, as it is known in one of the languages spoken by the Lenape.Mr. Bourgeois said he had always been troubled by the well-known and not quite accurate legend that, four centuries ago, the Lenape sold Manhattan to Dutch settlers for the equivalent of $24 worth of goods.\u201cIt\u2019s quite offensive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of conquest.\u201dMr. Van Dunk, 54, a Brooklyn woodworker who is active in Native American issues, pointed out that, if such a transaction had taken place, the Lenape might have meant it as a good-will exchange for sharing the land, and not as transferring ownership, especially because the tribe did not believe anyone could own land or water.The Lenape \u201ctried to embrace and share,\u201d Mr. Van Dunk said. \u201cAnd in return, they got everything taken, even their lives.\u201dNow, of course, Manhattan \u2014 whose name comes from the Lenape tongue, meaning roughly \u201cthe land of many hills\u201d \u2014 has been developed to the hilt into a center of global commerce.\u201cManhattan is a capitalist rock; this is a quiet protest against that,\u201d Mr. Bourgeois said of his gift. \u201cI\u2019m giving it back to whom the land was stolen from, and that\u2019s really a joyful event.\u201dMr. Bourgeois said that he bought the building, 392 West Street, in 2006 for $2.2 million, and that it had probably appreciated in value to about $4 million. With three floors and less than 3,000 square feet, it is one of the last wood-frame buildings along the Hudson waterfront.Though some documentation describes the house as being built in the 1830s, Mr. Bourgeois said he believed it may actually date to the 1770s.The house was built on land that had been part of Newgate State Prison, a colonial jail, and then became part of the Greenwich Market, also known as the Weehawken Market, of which it is the last surviving segment.Over the centuries, it has been home to a saloon, a gambling parlor, an oyster house and a pool hall, Mr. Bourgeois said, and in recent decades it housed bars. He said that when he bought it, there were peep show machines inside, which he had removed.The new center would be run by female tribal elders, Mr. Bourgeois said, as a nod to the matrilineal traditions of the Lenape and in memory of his wife, Carollee Pelos.Mr. Bourgeois was introduced to Mr. Van Dunk by a Native American man he met six years ago during the Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Van Dunk said the house would be a space for ceremonies, prayer, meetings and education.But Mr. Bourgeois\u2019s generous gesture has not come without controversy.Mr. Perry criticized Mr. Van Dunk\u2019s handling of tribal business and finances and said he had been barred from the nation by a tribal vote.\u201cHe\u2019s a confidence man,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Van Dunk enjoyed posing as a \u201cmedicine man of the month.\u201dMr. Perry expressed concern that the tribe could be sued if anything went wrong with a Lenape center purportedly being run on behalf of the Ramapoughs.After hearing of the gift, Mr. Perry said he had invited Mr. Bourgeois to visit the Ramapough elders in New Jersey and to consider giving the property to the current leaders to establish a \u201cnative embassy site\u201d there. Mr. Bourgeois never responded, Mr. Perry said.Mr. Van Dunk called being barred from the tribe a political vendetta by Mr. Perry, and said it did not affect his status as a Ramapough. And he said his accomplishments as chief \u2014 including dealing with the authorities after the shooting in which the officer was found not guilty of manslaughter, and creating many tribal programs \u2014 spoke for themselves.Mr. Bourgeois said he had confidence in Mr. Van Dunk and called his decision a \u201cdone deal.\u201d Ownership of the house, he added, was currently being transferred to a nonprofit group overseen by Mr. Van Dunk.What mattered most, he said, was that the land was going back to the Lenape and that \u201cwe\u2019re bringing back the spirits.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Jungle Scours Him Back.", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The year may still be young, but I would wager a small fortune that Douglas Preston has already written the best snake-decapitation scene of 2017. The passage is nestled midway through \u201cThe Lost City of the Monkey God,\u201d Preston\u2019s account of accompanying an archaeological expedition through the wilds of eastern Honduras. Shortly after he and his group set up camp in La Mosquitia, a jungled expanse that conceals a trove of pre-Columbian ruins, Preston spots a venomous pit viper next to a hammock. He calls on Andrew Wood, a former British commando who has been hired to keep the expedition\u2019s death toll to a minimum, to handle the matter. Wood does so by jabbing at the snake with a forked tree branch, to the snake\u2019s clear displeasure.\u201cAs its head lashed back and forth, straining to sink its fangs into Woody\u2019s fist, it expelled poison all over the back of his hand, causing his skin to bubble,\u201d Preston writes. After he finally gets the better of the fight and manages to lop off the snake\u2019s skull, Wood apologizes for failing to clean up the bloody aftermath right away; he explains that he had thought it wise to wash off the venom first, since it was starting to seep into an open wound.Though I was enthralled by Preston\u2019s frenetic depiction of man-on-serpent violence, I also feared it signaled that his latest book was about to take a turn for the trite. Memoirs of jungle adventures too often devolve into lurid catalogs of hardships, as their authors take undue glee in detailing every bug bite, malarial fever and bad cup of instant coffee they\u2019ve had to endure. But Preston proves too thoughtful an observer and too skilled a storyteller to settle for churning out danger porn. He has instead created something nuanced and sublime: a warm and geeky paean to the revelatory power of archaeology, tempered by notes of regret.Preston has earned considerable fame as the co-author, with Lincoln Child, of brisk and noirish thrillers like last year\u2019s \u201cThe Obsidian Chamber.\u201d But he has also long maintained a side gig as a magazine writer who specializes in chronicling quests for dinosaur bones, Egyptian tombs and Anasazi relics. While working on one such assignment for National Geographic in 1996, Preston first heard the legend of La Ciudad Blanca (the White City), an abandoned jungle metropolis said to be hidden deep within Mosquitia. Numerous explorers have sallied forth in search of this alleged archaeological wonder, only to return with empty hands or fantastic lies. One British adventurer named Frederick Mitchell-Hedges, for example, claimed to have stumbled upon the sunken continent of Atlantis while on a failed mission to locate the city in the early 1930s. (Throughout his long and shady career, Mitchell-Hedges also falsely purported to have fought alongside Pancho Villa and to have hunted for sea monsters with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s son.)The explorer most synonymous with La Ciudad Blanca is Theodore Morde, a Massachusetts-born journalist who made his name covering the Spanish Civil War. In 1940, Morde declared that he\u2019d found the fabled city after a torturous trek through Mosquitia. He described a walled settlement, large enough to have once housed 30,000 people, that was festooned with elaborate carvings of monkeys. He refused to reveal the city\u2019s location to anyone, including the millionaire oil heir who had financed his trip. Preston contends that Morde kept mum because he had engaged in a grand deception: He had spent all his time in Honduras prospecting for gold rather than looking for the White City as he had promised his patron. (Morde receives a fuller and more forgiving portrait in another recent book, Christopher S. Stewart\u2019s \u201cJungleland.\u201d)Morde\u2019s colorful tales may have been bunk, but decades later they helped inspire a cinematographer named Steve Elkins to try to find the White City with the aid of advanced technology. Thanks to some Hollywood wheeling and dealing \u2014 an executive producer of the film \u201cBeasts of No Nation\u201d pops up in Preston\u2019s narrative \u2014 Elkins raised enough money to have a chunk of Mosquitia surveyed with an aircraft-mounted lidar scanner, which uses lasers to detect topographical anomalies. The scans revealed something potentially majestic beneath the jungle canopy: evidence of moldering buildings, plazas and possibly even a ball court.Preston was not disappointed by what he saw on the 2015 expedition to explore the ruins, though he admits that a layperson might feel otherwise. \u201cThe jungle-choked mounds in Mosquitia are, at first glance, not nearly as sexy as the cut-stone temples of the Maya or the intricate gold artwork of the Muisca,\u201d he writes. But by letting archaeologists riff on the possible meanings of specific objects, Preston builds a compelling case for the scientific significance of what the expedition unearthed. He takes evident delight, for example, in listening to a Colorado State University professor explain how stone jars rimmed with \u201ctriangular-headed humanoid figures\u201d could symbolize \u201cbound captives, ready for sacrifice.\u201dThe book\u2019s most affecting moments don\u2019t center on the ruminations of archaeologists, however, but rather on the otherworldly nature of the jungle \u2014 a place that Preston portrays as akin to a sentient creature. He marvels at how the jungle floor undulates with a \u201cgreasy, jittering flow\u201d of cockroaches, and he shares his awe at the \u201cchromatic infinities\u201d of the impenetrable flora that has frustrated generations of explorers. And as the great scale of the archaeological site becomes clear, Preston laments that the yearslong process of excavation will inevitably rob Mosquitia of much of its mystique.\u201cI had the sense that our exploration had diminished it, stripping it of its secrets,\u201d he observes upon departing for home. As Adam and Eve can well attest, the pursuit of knowledge is never without its unintended consequences.For all his curiosity about the Mosquitia ruins, Preston exhibits puzzlingly little interest in Honduras itself. He appears to have met few ordinary Hondurans during his travels, and the book can occasionally feel clinical as a result. At one point, for example, Preston mentions that a town he stopped in has been plagued by drug-related violence. \u201cHowever, we were assured that we were in no danger because of our guard of elite Honduran soldiers,\u201d he curtly notes, before switching back to discussing his preparations for the jungle. Preston also seems largely indifferent to the Honduran public\u2019s feelings about the ruins, which may or may not be connected to the White City myth; we hear a good deal from the nation\u2019s president, who lauds a projected rise in tourism, but not much from anyone of lesser rank who might have more complicated views of what\u2019s to come for Mosquitia and its inhabitants.It is hard to feel anything but sympathy for Preston, however, given that he ended up suffering so grievously for the sake of this book. I won\u2019t spoil the nasty means by which the jungle exacted its revenge on the Mosquitia expedition, except to say that I wouldn\u2019t blame Preston in the slightest if he chooses to stick to fiction from now on. But let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t end up being the case, for few other writers possess such heartfelt appreciation for the ways in which artifacts can yield the stories of who we are.Brendan I.

{"Headline": "U.S. Commando Killed in Yemen in Trump\u2019s First Counterterrorism Operation", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 One American commando was killed and three others were wounded in a fierce firefight early Sunday with Qaeda militants in central Yemen, the military said on Sunday. It was the first counterterrorism operation authorized by President Trump since he took office, and the commando was the first United States service member to die in the yearslong shadow war against Al Qaeda\u2019s Yemen affiliate.After initially denying that there were any civilian casualties, American officials said they were assessing reports that women and children had died in the attack.The military\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command had been planning the mission for months, according to three senior American officials. Obama administration aides had deliberated extensively over the proposed operation, weighing the value of any information that might be recovered against the risk to the Special Operations forces plunging into hostile territory. But administration officials ultimately opted to hand the decision on the mission to their successors.As helicopter gunships and armed Reaper drones provided cover, the commandos carried out the attack against the home of the Qaeda leader in the rugged mountainous region of Bayda Province, a part of Yemen that has been a focal point of United States military operations over the past month. The main target was computer materials inside the house that could contain clues about future terrorist plots.In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump called the raid \u201csuccessful\u201d and said that it had captured \u201cimportant intelligence that will assist the U.S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world.\u201d He also lamented the loss of the American service member \u201cin our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism.\u201dA United States military aircraft helping with the operation experienced a \u201chard landing\u201d near the site of the raid, resulting in injuries to two other service members, military officials said. That aircraft, identified by a senior American official as an Osprey that was evacuating the troops wounded in the firefight, was unable to fly after the landing and was deliberately destroyed by American airstrikes. The wounded troops and the Osprey\u2019s crew were lifted to safety by another American aircraft.American officials and analysts said the Qaeda leader who was believed to have been killed was Abdulrauf al Dhahab.The raid took place in Yemen around the time that Mr. Trump was signing a directive in Washington on Saturday afternoon ordering Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to devise within 30 days a more aggressive plan to defeat the Islamic State.The Islamic State was born from Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Iraq, but the two terrorist organizations are now sworn rivals not only in Iraq and Syria, but also in other hot spots like Yemen and Afghanistan, where both groups have affiliates.Because Mr. Trump had been explicit about his intention to ask for the review to accelerate the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, American military planners had begun drafting classified options to present to the new commander in chief. Some of those options, like pushing more authority to conduct strikes to commanders in the field or loosening restrictions designed to limit the risk to civilians, could also be applied to attacks against Qaeda fighters and Islamic State insurgents.There were no immediate indications that the rules of engagement had been loosened for the mission in Yemen, military officials said. The Central Command\u2019s statement did not elaborate on details of the raid or identify the commando who was killed.A local resident who witnessed the raid, speaking by phone, said he had seen warplanes bombing several houses in the village around 2 a.m. Sunday. The man said he had seen at least three buildings being struck before he fled. He did not want to be identified because he feared that speaking out would endanger his life.A Yemeni government official in Bayda Province said the targeted buildings belonged to the Dhahab family, which is known for its ties to Al Qaeda. Two male members of the family have been killed in drone strikes over the past two years.The Yemeni official said that at least eight women and seven children, ages 3 to 13, had been killed in the raid. Qaeda supporters said that Mr. Awlaki\u2019s young daughter was among the dead and denied that any senior Qaeda leaders had been killed, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist communications.Faisal Mohamed, a Bayda official whose two sons witnessed the attack, said it severely damaged a school, a health facility and a mosque.\u201cI was on the way back to town when they called and said that there were Americans everywhere, so I knew I should not go,\u201d Mr. Mohamed said by phone from nearby Marib Province. \u201cMy kids told me that the sky was crowded with helicopters and that they saw people jumping out of planes.\u201d\u201cThe last thing they said to me was that the whole town is devastated now,\u201d Mr. Mohamed said.Just over a week ago, United States drone strikes killed three other men suspected of being Qaeda operatives in Bayda Province, the first such killings reported in the country since Mr. Trump assumed the presidency.Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group\u2019s branch in Yemen, has long been seen by American intelligence and counterterrorism officials as among the most dangerous branches of the global terrorist network, and the one posing the most immediate threat to United States territory. The group\u2019s leaders have sought in at least three cases to detonate bombs hidden aboard American commercial jetliners. All of those plots were thwarted.The raid on Saturday night was the latest in a series of Special Operations drone strikes and ground attacks in Yemen in recent years.Nour Youssef contributed reporting from Cairo; Saeed Al-Batati from Al Mukalla, Yemen; and Shuaib Almosawa from Sana, Yemen.Advertisement"}

The couple went into contract for a two-bedroom condo in fall 2014, before the development was built; they sold their old place in fall 2015.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s National Security Pick Sees Ally in Fight Against Islamists: Russia", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, traveled to Moscow about a year after he took charge of the Defense Intelligence Agency to cultivate what he saw as natural allies in the fight against Islamist militants: Russia\u2019s spy agencies.It was June 2013, a briefly optimistic moment for both the Americans and Russians, and Mr. Flynn hoped to take advantage of it. During the trip, he met with the chief of the Russian military intelligence unit known as the G.R.U. \u2014 the same agency that has since been implicated in interference in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 and held an hourlong discussion with midranking officers at its headquarters.During that trip he also tried repeatedly to meet officers at the C.I.A\u2019s station in Moscow \u2014 housed inside the American Embassy \u2014 to press for closer ties with Russia\u2019s spies. But C.I.A. officers in Moscow, who have an adversarial relationship with Russia, declined to meet with him.The report is likely to renew questions about Mr. Flynn\u2019s avowed eagerness to work with Russia, and his dismissal of concerns about President Vladimir V. Putin, which have at times exceeded even that of Mr. Trump himself. Neither has shown any indication of being swayed by the intelligence report on Russian meddling, and the two will within weeks be in a position to reorder American priorities in favor of closer ties with Moscow.Any shift toward Moscow would very likely put the new administration in direct conflict with senior military commanders and intelligence officials, as well as powerful Republicans, like Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. It may also rankle some of Mr. Trump\u2019s own cabinet nominees \u2014 Gen. James N. Mattis, his choice for defense secretary, and Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, the nominee for C.I.A. director, pushed the Obama administration to take a harder line on Russia.\u201cWhat we both have is a common enemy,\u201d Mr. Flynn said in an interview in October. \u201cThe common enemy that we have is radical Islam.\u201dBut Mr. Flynn, who has not responded to requests for comment since the election, then took a tack straight from Mr. Trump\u2019s playbook: He quickly shifted to questioning the evidence of Russian meddling before dismissing it.The real problem, he said, was that Mr. Putin respects only strength, and that the United States had behaved like a weakling under President Obama.That would change under Mr. Trump, Mr. Flynn said. Mr. Trump understood that the danger posed by \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d was paramount, and that Russia could help bring Iran into line and stabilize the Middle East, Mr. Flynn said.\u201cWe can\u2019t do what we want to do unless we work with Russia, period,\u201d Mr. Flynn said.A Trump administration would not be the first to try to reset relations with Russia. President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama sought to do the same early in their presidencies, though both approached the issue with more skepticism. Neither succeeded.\u201cI was able to brief their entire staff. I gave them a leadership OPD,\u201d he added, using a military abbreviation for a professional development class. He and the G.R.U. officers \u201ctalked a lot about the way the world\u2019s unfolding.\u201dBrig. Gen. Peter Zwack, a retired Army officer who was the American military attach\u00e9 in Moscow at the time of the visit, said Mr. Flynn was not blind to the pitfalls of forging closer ties to Russia. He saw areas of mutual interest, as did many others in the United States at the time, but was always firm in advancing the American position in areas where there was disagreement, General Zwack said.\u201cThere was nothing kumbaya about these talks at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a question of finding common ground on this big, complex, fractious and increasingly dangerous planet.\u201dOthers, though, were more skeptical of Mr. Flynn\u2019s efforts. David Rubincam, who was the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s top agent in Moscow between 2011 and 2012, said it was clear the Russians had little interest in greater cooperation.\u201cThe hard stuff was hard but they made the simple stuff hard. There was always a concern: Did they have a secondary agenda? We had to be cautious on sharing information.\u201d Mr. Rubincam said. After Mr. Putin was re-elected in March 2012, \u201cthe atmosphere became increasingly toxic.\u201dFor most American officials, any lingering hopes of closer ties were finally dashed when Russia invaded Crimea in early 2014 and the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on Moscow.Even then, though, Mr. Flynn pushed to maintain a dialogue with Russian military intelligence. In early March 2014, when he headed the Defense Intelligence Agency and American officials were weighing sanctions, he was making plans to meet with Russian officials later that month. When his superiors found out about his plans, they ordered the meeting canceled.The intelligence agencies\u2019 report on Russian meddling presents an especially awkward development for Mr. Flynn by indirectly casting a harsh spotlight on his relationship with RT. It includes a lengthy and damning assessment of the network, describing it as \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s principal international propaganda outlet.\u201dMr. Flynn has appeared repeatedly on RT, and his paid speaking engagement in December 2015 also included an invitation to the network\u2019s lavish anniversary party. There, he was photographed sitting at the elbow of Mr. Putin.Mr. Flynn said in October that he went to Moscow only to continue pressing for better relations.\u201cI basically told the audience that I thought that Russia should get Iran to back out of the proxy wars that Iran is running so we could stabilize the Middle East,\u201d he said.\u201cThat was my whole purpose for going,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there to kowtow to Putin.\u201dThe report also said that RT is almost entirely financed by the Kremlin, which spends at least $190 million a year on RT\u2019s broadcasting infrastructure alone. If that is accurate, Mr. Flynn\u2019s speaking engagement could violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits officials from accepting anything of value from foreign governments and covers retired military officers.Though the report was released only Friday, much of the material in it about RT comes from a report that American intelligence officials prepared in 2012, when Mr. Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Its view of RT as a Russian propaganda outlet has been widely shared by American officials for years.But not Mr. Flynn, apparently. In the interview with The Post this summer, he argued that it differed little from American television news networks.\u201cWhat\u2019s CNN? What\u2019s MSNBC? Come on!\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

For them, everything is going to change.In winning the presidency, Donald J. Trump proposed a grand hypothesis: that the federal government can be managed like a business. \u201cIf we could run our country the way I\u2019ve run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of,\u201d he told voters in the final presidential debate. It\u2019s a theory that has been suggested, to various degrees, by almost every president in the last century, from Calvin Coolidge to Barack Obama.What\u2019s different this time is the vigorousness of the experiment. With his inauguration on Friday, and a cabinet that is likely to include three billionaires, five former chief executives and some of the business world\u2019s most accomplished leaders, Mr. Trump is poised to test, perhaps once and for all, if good governance and crafty deal making are really similar skills.But, as anyone who has spent time in a laboratory can attest, experiments are messy. Separating the signals from the noise takes diligence. And in this case, so much will depend on the savviness of those woeful billionaires who had it so good, and now will be guinea pigs thrust into a maze that has overwhelmed so many test subjects before them.\u201cRunning an agency is very, very different from running a company,\u201d said Carlos M. Gutierrez, who was commerce secretary under George W. Bush after serving as chief executive of Kellogg\u2019s. \u201cSome of the skills do transfer, but you have to be careful figuring out which ones. In government, you can\u2019t fire anyone. Your board of directors is 535 people in Congress, and half of them want to see you fail.\u201dOne of the first challenges will be figuring out what \u201cbusiness leadership\u201d means when so many of capitalism\u2019s tools \u2014 firing misbehaving employees; giving raises to those who overperform \u2014 aren\u2019t allowed by federal rules. \u201cC.E.O.s who come in saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to show everyone how it\u2019s done,\u2019 are the ones most likely to fail,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said.One problem has always been that while the business world rewards leaders for an intense focus on a singular goal \u2014 maximizing profits as efficiently as possible \u2014 government yearns for the opposite: pleasing the largest number of people with methods that offend the fewest. And while competition is usually a good thing within business, inside government, it\u2019s often more corrosive, as the partisanship of the past decade demonstrates.\u201cYou succeed in Washington by collaborating,\u201d said Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was widely lauded as Treasury secretary for Mr. Bush and, before that, as chief executive of Goldman Sachs.Businesspeople tend to see competition as a means to find the best solutions, a sorting device that pushes the smartest ideas ahead. But many of the trickiest government issues, like immigration or tax reform, involve dozens of agencies, as well as lawmakers and lobbyists, who must be persuaded to cooperate. Intelligence in government is almost always a humble, group activity.\u201cYou can\u2019t just think about your own agency, or your own goals,\u201d Mr. Paulson said. \u201cYou have to please both sides of the aisle, while making sure you\u2019re not outshining other officials, and persuading employees who don\u2019t have to obey your orders. And you have to adjust to having a boss, the president, instead of being the boss. It takes a lot of humility.\u201dSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s picks might have an easier time making the transition than others. Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil and the choice for secretary of state, is among the nominees who have spent their careers involved in the day-to-day operations of complicated firms that span continents.\u201cTillerson has basically been a politician for the last 20 years; he\u2019s just been doing it for the nation of Exxon,\u201d said Paul H. O\u2019Neill, who became Treasury secretary during Mr. Bush\u2019s first term after leading the aluminum company Alcoa. \u201cHe\u2019s negotiated with foreign governments, he\u2019s had more than 80,000 employees. You don\u2019t run a company that size by telling people what to do. You learn how to persuade them to follow your vision, to accommodate all kinds of different agendas and personalities.\u201dOther cabinet secretaries have spent their careers mostly as investors, not as direct managers. Hedge fund and private equity professionals like Steven T. Mnuchin, likely to be the next Treasury secretary; Betsy DeVos, who has been tapped as education secretary; and Wilbur L. Ross, the expected commerce secretary, have largely devoted their lives to buying and selling companies. And so there are questions about how well they will make the shift to jobs that demand a day-to-day focus on the smallest details of governance.Mr. Ross, whose confirmation hearing was held on Wednesday, presents a fascinating test subject. As an acquirer of steel mills, coal mines and other heavy industries, he has amassed a personal fortune worth billions. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve had businesses that actually operated in some 23 countries,\u201d Mr. Ross said at the hearing. \u201cWe have been on the ground in all of the major trading partners of this country.\u201dUsually, when Mr. Ross buys a new company, he follows a pretty successful script: He shows up, says a few words and then hands operations to professional managers who know how to run things \u2014 and who know he will fire them if they fail.However, when Mr. Ross takes the oath of office, that script will change. He will be whisked off to the executive wing of the Commerce Department and walked past long rows of barren offices. (The furniture of political appointees is removed during each presidential transition, and \u2014 spoiler alert \u2014 it often takes weeks for new desks and bookcases to arrive.) If he can find enough chairs, he might call a meeting of the few employees milling around (his deputies and key department heads need senatorial approval, which might take a few months). He will be handed dozens of binders explaining how his department does everything from monitor weather satellites to administer patents, and admonished to study up. (Congress loves humiliating cabinet members who haven\u2019t done their homework, and explaining that you are an excellent delegator, alas, fails to impress on Capitol Hill.)If Mr. Ross hopes to fly to one of the department\u2019s satellite offices, he will have to decide if he wants to complete the reams of paperwork needed to use his own jet, or go coach, as secretaries in previous administrations were encouraged. \u201cPerception matters a lot in Washington,\u201d said Karen G. Mills, who always flew in the cheap seats as administrator of the Small Business Administration after a career in finance left her with more than $40 million. \u201cI did, however, try to avoid the middle seat.\u201dIf Mr. Ross is lucky, by the end of his first day, someone will have shown him where the bathrooms are. There\u2019s a risk, however, that the agency\u2019s permanent staff\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 goal will be to find ways to sabotage each new cabinet secretary as soon as they walk through the door,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker who was a campaign adviser to Mr. Trump. \u201cAll those bureaucrats overwhelmingly voted for Clinton. There won\u2019t be any real cooperation until we change federal law so we can fire them.\u201dWorst of all, though, is that at the end of his tenure, no matter how hard Mr. Ross works or how much he sacrifices, a large part of his success \u2014 as well as that of the other secretaries and this experiment as a whole \u2014 will be outside his control. Ultimately, the most important variable in testing this hypothesis will be Mr. Trump himself. What kind of management style will he adopt? Will he be an operator or a delegator? Will he change as president, or simply relocate and remain C.E.O. in chief?How a president behaves filters into the cabinet, and senior officials, no matter how talented or powerful they once were, become an appendage of their new boss \u2014 a hard demotion for any former master of the universe. If Mr. Trump can\u2019t manage the presidency, then no one working for him is likely to succeed. And vice versa.So as this experiment unfolds before a captivated nation, pity Mr. Ross and all the poor billionaires. They are sacrificing themselves so that all of us might learn. And, in case they are wondering: The bathrooms are down the hall and around the corner. You\u2019re responsible for replacing the toilet paper if you\u2019ve used the last of the roll.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: At Globalfest, a World of Cultural Keepsakes With a Dance Beat", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byWith Ms. Machado\u2019s forthright voice answered by her group\u2019s close harmonies and carried by all sorts of percussion \u2014 drums large and small, scrapers, shakers, castanets \u2014 the group performed songs about saints, dancing, slavery and the hard lives of the cocoa-plantation workers who originally sang parranda. The costumes were brightly patterned; dancers had light, quick steps that barely seemed to touch the stage.This was the kind of group that world-music fans have always been thrilled to discover: vital, accomplished, local, unplugged, deeply rooted. But Ms. Machado\u2019s group is also using 21st-century tools. It has done DNA testing to trace the musicians\u2019 specific African ancestry; an Indiegogo campaign financed its American tour, and a documentary crew captured the scene.Each group at Globalfest, which doubles as a showcase for concert promoters during the annual Association of Performing Arts Presenters conference, was navigating between preservation and adaptation, as well as between home and away. And this year, nearly all of them did it with a dance beat \u2014 not with the globe-flattening four-on-the-floor of electronic dance music, but with cultural keepsakes from particular places.The alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa led his Indo-Pak Coalition \u2014 a trio with Rez Abbasi on guitar and Dan Weiss switching between trap drums and tabla \u2014 in pieces that traveled from crisp, tricky, zig-zagging melodies in South Asian modes to the vocabulary of jazz, and back.Alsarah and the Nubatones are led by Alsarah, a singer and songwriter born in Khartoum, Sudan; she described her music as \u201cSudanese and Nubian-inspired East African retro pop.\u201d She learned one song, she said, from girls at a refugee camp in South Sudan who had written it. In contemplative ballads or springy, danceable tunes, her music was transparent: an electric oud shared her melodies, a hand drum supplied the beat, and virtually the only harmonies came from a backup singer.Three bands had been around long enough to be traditions of their own. Rare Essence was part of the original wave of go-go bands that emerged in Washington in the 1970s, stringing together songs, chants and percussion workouts around the unhurried but steadily propulsive go-go beat. Forty years on, it was a flashback to a funky alternate path for the early days of hip-hop, one that depends on human players rather than programming.L\u2019Orchestre Afrisa International reunited Congolese musicians who forged the suavely irresistible syncopations of soukous \u2014 an African reclamation of the rumba topped by gleaming guitar lines \u2014 as the backup band for Tabu Ley Rochereau, who died in 2013. It played songs from its old repertory with Rochereau and his onetime wife, M\u2019bilia Bel; Blandine, a Congolese singer now based in Toronto, gave Ms. Bel\u2019s material grace with a steely core.And from Cuba, Globalfest brought Septeto Santiaguero, which was formed in 1995 to revive 1940s- and 1950s-style Cuban pop with a slight twist: adding a conga drummer to make it an eight-man septet. Driven by conga and bongos, topped with acoustic guitar and solos plucked on the tres, with trumpet cheekily answering the singers, it was sly, romantic, definitively Cuban and not just for local delight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Pick for Education Could Face Unusually Stiff Resistance", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byNominees for secretary of education have typically breezed through confirmation by the Senate with bipartisan approval.But Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s choice for the post, is no typical nominee. She is a billionaire with a complex web of financial investments, including in companies that stand to win or lose from the department she would oversee. She has been an aggressive force in politics for years, as a prominent Republican donor and as a supporter of steering public dollars to private schools.Her wealth and her politics seem likely to make her confirmation hearing unusually contentious, and possibly drawn out.The hearing, which was originally scheduled for Wednesday of this week, was postponed until Tuesday after Democrats complained she had not completed an agreement with the independent Office of Government Ethics that outlined a plan to deal with potential conflicts of interest. The ethics office has said it has not completed its review of Ms. DeVos, which is required before the office can make any agreement. A spokesman for Ms. DeVos said she had responded to a first round of questions from the office last weekend.On Thursday, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee that will hold the hearing, said she and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, \u201chave some concerns about missing information\u201d on the financial disclosure forms that Ms. DeVos has filed with the Senate. Ms. Murray would not specify what they were looking for, because those disclosures are not public, but said they had asked Ms. DeVos for additional information. Ms. Murray said she had \u201cpushed very hard\u201d not to hold the hearing until Ms. DeVos had completed her agreement with the ethics office.\u201cThis is a candidate with extremely complicated financial dealings,\u201d the senator said. \u201cWe have to know, if there are conflicts of interests, how those are going to be resolved. If we don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s incumbent on all of us to say we cannot vote for that.\u201dSome Republican committee leaders, including Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, have said they will hew to a tradition of not holding hearings until the ethics office signs off on the nominee.But a spokeswoman for Mr. Alexander said his panel \u2014 the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \u2014 had \u201cno rules\u201d about a need for an ethics review, and that the chairman intended to hold the hearing on Tuesday regardless.Mr. Alexander also said he would limit senators on the panel \u2014 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats \u2014 to five minutes of questions each, after opening statements by him and Ms. Murray.His office noted that Rod Paige, President George W. Bush\u2019s first education secretary, had a hearing eight days before his ethics review was complete. But Mr. Paige, a school superintendent when he was nominated, did not have nearly the same wealth or financial investments as Ms. DeVos.Mr. Alexander\u2019s office said the committee would not hold a vote on Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination until her ethics review was complete.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.That could take awhile. In a letter to Ms. Murray about the DeVos nomination, the ethics office said on Monday that \u201cmultiple rounds of questions and revisions are usually needed before a report can be finalized,\u201d because of the complexity of financial disclosure rules. And some nominees \u201cfind it difficult to untangle\u201d their investments quickly. So the vetting process \u201ccan take weeks,\u201d the office wrote, \u201cand, in the case of extremely wealthy individuals, sometimes months.\u201dDemocrats have repeatedly noted that Penny Pritzker, a billionaire real estate entrepreneur who became the commerce secretary during President Obama\u2019s second term, took six months to complete her ethics agreement.Ms. DeVos also lists herself as a director of the RDV Corporation, which similarly invests in companies with education products, including digital textbooks and online charter schools.Unlike most past secretaries, Ms. DeVos has never been an educator or overseen a state education agency. She did not attend public schools, or send her children to them.Her primary involvement in education has been as a benefactor and board member for groups that advocate steering taxpayer dollars away from public schools in the form of vouchers to help families attend private and religious schools.But school choice means different things to different people. Many educators and groups that support charter schools \u2014 which are public \u2014 do not support vouchers, which steer public money away from public schools by giving families money to spend on private school tuition.So teachers\u2019 unions have opposed her nomination, but so, too, have organizations that have fought unions.The main association of charter schools in Massachusetts, for example, which is generally considered to have the nation\u2019s best charters, sent a letter to the state\u2019s senior senator, Elizabeth Warren, who sits on the committee that will hold the DeVos hearing. The letter expressed concern about Ms. DeVos\u2019s support for vouchers and loose accountability in Michigan, which it said would \u201creduce the quality of charter schools across the country.\u201dMr. Trump has promised to steer $20 billion in federal education funds to vouchers, and Shavar Jeffries, the president of Democrats for Education Reform, a pro-charter organization, said he was worried that the Department of Education would take the money from Title I funds, which go to public schools serving the poorest students.Other groups have noted Ms. DeVos\u2019s millions of dollars in political contributions to Republican senators who will vote on her nomination, insisting that they recuse themselves from any vote on her. Her supporters have countered that Democrats who receive money from teachers\u2019 unions should recuse themselves, as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oakland Raiders Apply to Move to Las Vegas", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byAfter decades of shunning Las Vegas, the American city most closely associated with gambling, the N.F.L. has moved a lot closer to having a team there.On Thursday, the Oakland Raiders applied to relocate to Las Vegas, a bid that will test the league, which has stridently opposed sports gambling for decades. Relocation would require approval from at least 24 of the 32 teams, and the earliest the owners are expected to vote is late March, when they are to meet in Phoenix.Although the league has long shunned the idea of putting a team in Las Vegas, that stance has softened in recent years with the growth of daily fantasy sports and other forms of wagering. The N.F.L. is still wary of gambling and its potential influence on games, but players, coaches and some owners, most notably Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, have dismissed those concerns.\u201cThe unique thing about Las Vegas is it\u2019s a jewel for our country,\u201d Jones said in a recent interview. \u201cIt really can be a plus for the \u2018wow\u2019 factor and for the N.F.L.\u201dThe Raiders, he said, had the \u201ccachet\u201d and the national following to make a splash in Las Vegas.The Raiders have said they want to move to Nevada because they have failed for years to find a replacement for their home, Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, one of the oldest and most decrepit stadiums in the league. Local government officials have said they cannot pay a large share of the bill for a new sports facility, something the Raiders have demanded.If enough owners approve the application, which seems quite likely based on the swift approval of recent moves and statements from powerful owners like Jones and Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots, the Raiders would become the third N.F.L. team to move in less than two years.After nearly two decades of relative stability, the N.F.L. map would be altered dramatically. Two teams \u2014 the Chargers and the Rams \u2014 already abandoned smaller markets in San Diego and St. Louis for Los Angeles.The Raiders would leave a city that already lost the team once, when it moved to Los Angeles in 1982 before returning in 1995. They have significant fan bases in both Northern and Southern California.Having reordered its domestic map, the N.F.L. may now set its sights on potentially placing a team in London, though significant logistical hurdles must still be addressed.The Raiders tried to leave Oakland last year but failed to persuade the owners of other teams to let them build a new stadium in Southern California with the Chargers, who last week announced their move from San Diego to Los Angeles. So the Raiders owner Mark Davis, who also had talked with officials in San Antonio, began meeting with lawmakers in Nevada, who ultimately agreed to contribute $750 million in hotel taxes to help pay for a domed stadium that Davis wants to build in Las Vegas.Lawmakers and business leaders in Oakland can still come up with an alternative plan to keep the Raiders, but time is running short. The City Council voted last month to give Fortress, an investment group, 60 days to persuade the Raiders to consider a plan to build a new stadium in Oakland.\u201cThe Bay Area, millions of stalwart fans and the business community are not giving up on keeping the Raiders here where they belong,\u201d Jim Wunderman, president and chief executive of the Bay Area Council, a business and public policy group, said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to believe that a deal can be reached to build a modern stadium complex that the Raiders deserve and that benefits Oakland.\u201cWe urge the Raiders, the N.F.L. and Oakland to work together to find an agreement that can benefit everyone and avoid the disruption and pain of a costly move. Relocating a franchise with the deep roots and storied history that the Raiders have here in the Bay Area would be a disaster for the community.\u201dRaiders fans were not surprised at the move but were still angered by it.\u201cWhy would you rip a team out of a market that has supported you for more than four decades?\u201d said Jim Zelinski, a lifelong Raiders fan who helps run Save Oakland Sports. \u201cThe Raiders mystique will be gone forever if they move to Las Vegas and play in an air-conditioned dome.\u201dThere are significant questions as to whether Las Vegas \u2014 which will welcome an N.H.L. expansion team, the Golden Knights, next season \u2014 can sustain an N.F.L. team, although with about 2.5 million residents, the metropolitan area is bigger than several others with N.F.L. teams, including Buffalo, Green Bay and New Orleans.But if the owners were to allow the Raiders to move, the team would be leaving Oakland, a city in a far wealthier and larger region. Las Vegas, which primarily makes its money on tourism, has a less diversified economy and is prone to economic swings.The owners will also have to consider how Davis intends to pay for a stadium, because the league prohibits owners from having direct interest in gambling establishments. Sheldon Adelson, a casino magnate and the chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, will reportedly pay $650 million for a share of the new stadium, which is projected to cost $1.9 billion. It is unclear, though, whether he also wants a share of the Raiders.The N.F.L. owners\u2019 stadium and finance committee was shown plans last week by the Raiders that included building a stadium without financial support from Adelson.Davis, who does not have any significant business interests beyond his stake in the Raiders, will be eligible to receive $200 million in financial aid from the league for stadium construction, and presumably can raise money through the sale of stadium naming rights and licenses to purchase season tickets. But he would also have to pay a relocation fee, which will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.Little may change in the short term. Davis has said the team will play in Oakland for at least two more seasons while a stadium in Las Vegas is being built.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "We Will Miss Antibiotics When They\u2019re Gone", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsThis anonymous woman is only the latest casualty in a war against antibiotic-resistant bacteria \u2014 a war that we are losing. Although most bacteria die when they encounter an antibiotic, a few hardy bugs survive. Through repeated exposure, those tough bacteria proliferate, spreading resistance genes through the bacterial population. That\u2019s the curse of antibiotics: The more they\u2019re used, the worse they get, especially when they\u2019re used carelessly.Already, more than 23,000 people in the United States are estimated to die every year from resistant bacteria. That death toll will grow as microbes develop new mechanisms to defeat the drugs that, for decades, have kept infections at bay. We are on the cusp of what the World Health Organization calls a \u201cpost-antibiotic era.\u201dYet few new antibiotics are in development. Most large drug companies have fled the field. The reason is simple: To conserve their effectiveness, new antibiotics are put on the shelf to be used only when older antibiotics stop working. That makes perfect sense for public health, but companies can\u2019t make a profit on what they can\u2019t sell. This mismatch between the huge social value of new antibiotics and the relative indifference of drug manufacturers could spell disaster.But the law probably won\u2019t stimulate much innovation. A couple more years of poor sales are a small incentive and may actually promote overuse of antibiotics. The law is also poorly targeted. Some \u201cnew\u201d antibiotics are similar to existing compounds \u2014 so similar that bacteria are already resistant to them. We don\u2019t need to reward manufacturers for tweaking antibiotics that we already have. We need them to develop entirely new antibiotics.A few federal agencies have shown more initiative. Medicare, for example, has moved to require hospitals and nursing homes to adopt plans to prevent the spread of drug-resistant infections and to assure the proper use of antibiotics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is taking steps to limit the spread of resistant infections and to reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics. The Food and Drug Administration has simplified approval standards and has worked with industry to limit the use of antibiotics in livestock, which today accounts for three-quarters of antibiotic sales in the United States. And the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority has been working creatively to build public-private partnerships to support the most promising research.But Congress needs to think bigger if it wants to fix the broken antibiotic business model. Although the patent system is good at producing new blood-pressure medications and cardiovascular drugs, it\u2019s not the right fit for antibiotics. Because new antibiotics may be held in reserve for years, manufacturers can\u2019t sell enough during the patent term to justify large research investments. Congress should instead reward manufacturers that bring a targeted, highly innovative antibiotic to market with a substantial financial prize; in exchange, manufacturers would surrender their patent.This kind of \u201cmarket-entry\u201d reward would enable public health officials and physicians to deploy new drugs precisely where they\u2019re needed. Manufacturers would no longer have an incentive to milk their patent, marketing the drug for inappropriate uses. The antibiotic could also be sold at a reasonable price in developing countries, which might otherwise be unable to afford a patented antibiotic.Financing market-entry rewards would be expensive, perhaps $4 billion per year in total, or about 10 percent of the annual global bill for antibiotics. But you can\u2019t defeat bacteria on the cheap. They\u2019ve survived for billions of years because they\u2019re so good at adapting to new threats. Staying one step ahead will require ingenuity, money and radical change. Tinkering around the margins isn\u2019t going to cut it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Improvised Path to a Month of Executive Action", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump plans to take executive action on a nearly daily basis for a month to unravel his predecessor\u2019s legacy and begin enacting his own agenda, his aides say, part of an extended exercise of presidential power to quickly make good on his campaign promises.But in a reflection of the improvisational style that helped fuel his rise, he has made few, if any, firm decisions about which orders he wants to make, or in which order. That is a striking break from past presidents, who have entered office with detailed plans for rolling out a series of executive actions that set a tone for their presidencies and send a clear message about their agendas.It was plain that Mr. Trump had devised no such strategy by his first day in office, as advisers expressed doubt until the last moments about whether he would issue any directives on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a game-day decision,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that afternoon.Then, around 7 p.m., reporters were suddenly summoned to the Oval Office. After sprinting from the briefing room, they watched Mr. Trump sign a directive to federal agencies to begin scaling back parts of the Affordable Care Act.New York Times reporters analyze the 45th president\u2019s comments.\u201cThere are a number that are being looked at, but it\u2019s just a question of which ones he feels like doing, and when,\u201d Mr. Spicer had said of executive orders earlier on Friday. In recent days, he had said that Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides were still deciding on the \u201csequencing\u201d of the unilateral actions.Still, there is little doubt about the policy areas in Mr. Trump\u2019s sights: international trade deals, illegal immigration, the fight against the Islamic State, climate change and Washington lobbying.In his first half-day in office, Mr. Trump focused on health care, ordering the machinery of government to look for every opportunity to pull back on President Barack Obama\u2019s signature achievement by waiving fees or granting exemptions to states, businesses, individuals and insurance companies. He also moved quickly to freeze the Obama administration\u2019s unfinished regulations, a routine step for an incoming president of the opposite party.During the campaign, Mr. Trump railed against Mr. Obama\u2019s use of executive authority to sidestep an uncooperative Congress on issues like immigration and health care. After his victory, Mr. Trump vowed to use those same powers to quickly reverse the country\u2019s ideological course.29 PhotosAides said they hoped to group Mr. Trump\u2019s executive actions thematically for maximum impact. They gave few other details, though some advisers suggested that executive actions on illegal immigration could be among the first issued after the inaugural weekend.Advocates for undocumented workers are anxiously waiting to see what Mr. Trump will do.If he moves aggressively, he could immediately overturn Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA \u2014 the program Mr. Obama created to protect young immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children, giving them legal status and access to work permits. Ending that program would put as many as 800,000 of them at risk of being removed from their families and sent to the countries they had left as children.The White House could instead unwind the program slowly, giving the young people, often called Dreamers, more time before their immigration protections and work permits expire. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said on Friday that in a brief conversation with the new president, Mr. Trump had given him assurances about the program.The president, Mr. Durbin said, told him that \u201cwe don\u2019t want to hurt those kids; we\u2019re going to do something.\u201d\u201cThank goodness he said that,\u201d the senator added.The president could also order federal agents to conduct workplace raids to crack down on immigration violations. He could take action against so-called sanctuary cities, those that shield undocumented immigrants from deportation. Or he could issue an order reinstating a program known as Secure Communities, in which the local authorities cooperated with federal agencies to detect and deport illegal immigrants.And he could order work to begin, at least symbolically, on a wall at the southern border. Financing construction of the entire wall would require congressional action, however. But on the border wall and other promises, Mr. Trump now faces the challenge of translating slogans into action. He has already missed the deadline for a vow he made in August to start deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records on his first day in office.\u201cWe will begin moving them out, Day 1,\u201d he said during a rally in Phoenix. \u201cMy first hour in office, those people are gone.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s approach to using his newly minted executive power mirrors his often chaotic transition to the White House.Estimates put the crowd gathered for President Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration at far less than President Obama\u2019s in 2009.The stop-and-start nature of the new president\u2019s first 24 hours reflected his management style, both in his business empire and in the campaign, which went through four shake-ups as aides fell into and out of favor. His travel schedule was rarely planned out more than a few days in advance, and Mr. Trump did not hesitate to tear it apart when he wanted to. Decisions would be telegraphed by top advisers, only to be pulled back within hours, or never formally announced.The lack of planning stands in stark contrast to the approaches of past presidents, who have sought to demonstrate the change in direction they hope to lead and maximize the effectiveness of their unilateral actions.Ronald Reagan retreated to the President\u2019s Room just off the Senate floor only moments after being sworn in and signed an order freezing federal hiring, echoing the declaration in his inaugural address that \u201cgovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201dMr. Obama also decided well in advance which executive actions he wanted to take in his first days, after a team of lawyers led by Gregory B. Craig, his first White House counsel, spent much of his transition planning what he could do without Congress to illustrate a stark break with George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.On his second full day in office, Mr. Obama ordered the closing of the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison \u2014 a directive still unfulfilled \u2014 and banned torture by mandating that terrorism interrogations be guided by the Army Field Manual.Mr. Obama\u2019s embrace of executive orders \u2014 early in the administration and later, when a Republican-controlled Congress blocked his legislative agenda \u2014 may have helped pave the way for Mr. Trump to take quick action. Since many of Mr. Obama\u2019s achievements were put in place with executive action, Mr. Trump can reverse them, at least over time, the same way.Maggie Haberman and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Trump that its readers helped to propel.In recent months, the website has talked of expanding its coverage in Washington and elsewhere in the United States, and of opening bureaus in foreign cities including Paris and Berlin.In its latest push to extend its appeal and compete more directly with a mainstream media that had largely dismissed it, Breitbart has hired John Carney, an experienced business reporter from The Wall Street Journal, to run a finance and economics section that will focus on news, commentary and analysis.Mr. Carney, 43, said in an interview on Tuesday that joining Breitbart was an opportunity for him to \u201cchallenge orthodoxies\u201d and return to online journalism.\u201cIn some ways, I feel like I\u2019m going back to my roots by going there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do things at Breitbart that won\u2019t necessarily work at The Wall Street Journal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always had an entrepreneurial start-up bit of my DNA,\u201d he added, \u201cand frankly, I missed the atmosphere of working at a small shop and producing things and getting to rewrite the rules about the way journalism can work.\u201dMr. Carney said he shared Breitbart\u2019s message of populism and economic nationalism.\u201cFrankly, that is my point of view, so I don\u2019t have a problem with that,\u201d he said.In a statement, Larry Solov, chief executive of Breitbart News, said of Mr. Carney: \u201cThere simply isn\u2019t a better person in media to lead the economics section of an anti-establishment, center-right, global news outlet.\u201dBreitbart, which embraced Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign, has already established a connection to the incoming administration.

{"Headline": "Off Long Island, Wind Power Tests the Waters", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported byOnly a few years ago, the long-held dream of harnessing the strong, steady gusts off the Atlantic coast to make electricity seemed destined to remain just that. Proposals for offshore wind farms foundered on the shoals of high costs, regulatory hurdles and the fierce opposition of those who didn\u2019t want giant industrial machinery puncturing the pristine ocean views.Now the industry is poised to take off, just as the American political landscape and energy policy itself face perhaps the greatest uncertainty in a generation.And in New York, after years of stymied progress, the Long Island Power Authority has reached an agreement with Deepwater Wind, which built the Rhode Island turbine array, to drop a much larger farm \u2014 15 turbines capable of running 50,000 average homes \u2014 into the ocean about 35 miles from Montauk. If approved by the utility board on Wednesday, the $1 billion installation could become the first of several in a 256-square-mile parcel, with room for as many as 200 turbines, that Deepwater is leasing from the federal government.\u201cWe\u2019re developing this first offshore wind project in federal waters, but it\u2019s really a gateway project to other locations around Long Island,\u201d said Thomas Falcone, the power authority\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019re now at a point where developers can build projects at prices where utilities are willing buyers, and to me that is a very big deal.\u201dThese projects could also become an important test case in establishing just how far states can go to to pursue their clean energy agendas under the Trump administration. Before putting steel in the water, the project would need federal approvals and policies that are in doubt amid Washington\u2019s changing of the guard.Wind power has finally become viable for a number of delicately interlaced reasons. It has taken favorable state policies and technological and economic advances to spur the current level of activity, as well as interest among developers and investors, including foreign oil and gas companies that see offshore wind as an important part of their corporate strategies. In Europe, where the offshore wind industry is far ahead of the United States\u2019, costs have plummeted to roughly half of what they were five years ago, said Thomas Brostrom, who runs United States operations for Dong Energy, the Danish oil and gas giant and a leading offshore wind developer.As the industry has grown, manufacturers have been able to take advantage of economies of scale and cut their prices. At the same time, turbines have grown ever larger, allowing them to capture and produce more energy on the same site.Dong hopes to help foster similar developments in the United States. The company bought leases in Massachusetts and New Jersey and opened an office in Boston. \u201cWe are here to create an industry,\u201d Mr. Brostrom said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a ways to go, but everything that we hoped would happen has happened.\u201dDong has plenty of company. Statoil, the Norwegian fossil-fuel giant, has been aiming to get into the offshore business in the United States for years, and proposed in 2011 to build a farm off the Maine coast using floating platforms it had designed. The company withdrew the project two years later amid uncertainty over changing state policies, eventually deciding to build off the Scottish coast.Now it is back, having won a 33-round auction to secure a 79,000-acre site south of Jones Beach on Long Island. Statoil beat out several other bidders, including the state\u2019s energy agency, Dong and a subsidiary of Iberdrola, a leading energy company based in Spain. Statoil pledged $42.5 million for the lease, which still awaits final approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, far more than the $16 million generated by all earlier offshore wind auctions combined.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of companies starting to invest that had been wary of the U.S. offshore wind market and some of the initial lease sales,\u201d said Walter Cruickshank, acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. \u201cThey have been coming to the table in a big way more recently.\u201dThe appeal of offshore winds as an energy source goes beyond their potential role in efforts to slow global warming. As people flock to coastal cities, where land is scarce and expensive, and conventional power plants are moving toward retirement, states have looked to add new forms of power production. Moving it out to sea has become more attractive, proponents say.The country\u2019s coasts, home to over half the population, offer some of the strongest wind resources in the world, creating, in theory, enough energy to provide roughly four times the power the nation now produces.Though it is easier and cheaper to construct turbines on land, the East Coast in particular offers opportunity because of its strong winds and shallow waters, which means turbines can operate farther out to sea, and out of sight. The potential of offshore wind power converged with rising demand on Long Island\u2019s South Fork, where in areas like the Hamptons, commercial activity was rising and property owners were building larger houses, calling for more air-conditioning and more pool pumps.In New York, the Long Island farm is part of a plan to meet Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s goal of drawing 50 percent of the state\u2019s power from renewable sources by 2030. That includes developing 2.4 gigawatts of offshore wind, he said in his State of the State address this month, by far the nation\u2019s highest target, equaling the capacity of the Niagara Falls generating station.The wind array would not be visible from Montauk Point, and difficult to see from Martha\u2019s Vineyard, some 15 miles away, said Jeffrey Grybowski, Deepwater\u2019s chief executive. That makes it unlikely to stir the kind of public opposition that all but sank Cape Wind, the ambitious development that would have positioned 130 wind machines just five miles off Cape Cod but stalled in a political storm over blighted vistas.The Rhode Island project allowed Deepwater to work through many of the obstacles that had been holding back the industry, Mr. Grybowski said, including the lack of an established permit process and acceptance on the part of the public and the electric companies. \u201cThe Block Island project made offshore wind a reality in the United States,\u201d he said, \u201cso the conversations changed with utilities, who want to know that you can actually deliver on a project that you\u2019re proposing to them.\u201dDeepwater Wind first proposed the South Fork wind farm in response to a Long Island Power Authority solicitation for projects, but it was ultimately rejected by the authority\u2019s board in favor of several solar farms. The wind developer returned the next year with a new proposal that came close to approval a number of times, but fell short.Now, however, executives have negotiated a contract that they expect the board to approve. Under it, the utility will purchase all of the electricity delivered from the turbines by an underwater transmission line to a substation in East Hampton, paying a price comparable to what it would pay for other utility-scaled renewables like onshore wind and solar, according to the utility. Those prices have run around 16 cents a kilowatt-hour, higher than its average wholesale price of 7.5 cents.Deepwater plans to finance the project with a mix of loans and equity investments, though it is unclear if it will be able to benefit from federal tax credits that have spurred investment in wind farms and helped reduce the price of the power they produce. Until this year, a federal investment tax credit worth 30 percent of the development cost could be claimed. That has dropped to 24 percent for projects that begin this year and is set to be phased out by the end of 2019. To qualify, the project would need to demonstrate construction activity by then, which could be open to interpretation by the Treasury Department.But wind developers and advocates say the credit is also important to red states in the middle of the country, where it has helped drive the spread of land-based wind farms. Nurturing an offshore wind industry would meet the stated goals of many Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration, including the pursuit of an \u201call of the above\u201d energy program. Building and installing the wind machines could create thousands of new jobs, as it has in the land-based wind business, in manufacturing and construction. The project would also require special vessels and large onshore staging areas to assemble the components of the platforms and turbines, which could help the shipbuilding and port industries.\u201cWe\u2019re a heavy industry that\u2019s poised to build, employ and invest,\u201d said Nancy Sopko, who manages advocacy and federal legislative affairs at the American Wind Industry Association.That momentum may be difficult to slow, even if new federal policies put a stop to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management\u2019s leasing activities for wind energy, its proponents say. The active leases alone, if developed, are enough to create an industry, they say. And the commitments of states like New York and Massachusetts, and experienced multinational developers, show that the struggle to harness Atlantic breezes is no longer the same as tilting at windmills.\u201cIt is a sign of something that\u2019s inevitable, which is the addition of offshore wind into the energy mix,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be too appealing. In the end, the economics trump Trump.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the future of offshore wind farms misidentified the agency that needs to sign off before Statoil can proceed with its plan for a wind farm site south of Jones Beach on Long Island. The remaining signoffs involve the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management \u2014 not the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, which have already approved the plan. \u0081Advertisement"}

If the results of those matches are annulled, it would leave East Timor without a single win to its name. (East Timor\u2019s federation joined FIFA in 2005, shortly after winning independence from Indonesia.) FIFA could also add its own punishment, potentially barring East Timor from qualifying for the 2022 World Cup, to be hosted by Asia in Qatar.In addition to the penalties against the team, the Asian Football Confederation barred the East Timor federation\u2019s general secretary, Amandio de Araujo Sarmento, for three years and fined another Timorese official, Gel\u00e1sio Da Silva Carvalho, for interfering with a witness.The Timorese federation avoided official sanction itself, however, meaning it will continue to receive financing from FIFA and can still field teams in international friendlies and competitions like the Southeast Asian Games. The president of East Timor\u2019s federation, Francisco Kalbuadi Lay, who is also a member of the A.F.C.\u2019s executive committee, escaped sanction, despite the involvement of his organization\u2019s flagship team in the eligibility scandal.Still, without direct punishments, many of the players will continue to make a living playing in leagues like Thailand\u2019s, where a spot on each club\u2019s roster is reserved for a player from another Asian nation.\u201cThe investigation made no finding regarding the validity of the Timor-Leste citizenship held by those footballers,\u201d the Asian Football Confederation said in its statement, effectively clearing the players to continue playing club soccer under Timorese nationality. \u201cThat is a question for the state authorities of Timor-Leste.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Rashida Begum, 22, chose to plunge with her three children into a deep, swift-running creek, only to watch as her baby daughter slipped from her grasp.Sufayat Ullah, 20, also chose the creek. He stayed in the water for two days and finally emerged to find that soldiers had set his family home on fire, leaving his mother, father and two brothers to asphyxiate inside.\u201cThere is a risk that we haven\u2019t seen the worst of this yet,\u201d said Matthew Smith of Fortify Rights, a nongovernmental organization focusing on human rights in Southeast Asia. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure what the state security forces will do next, but we do know attacks on civilians are continuing.\u201dThe crackdown began after an attack on three border posts in Rakhine State in October, in which nine police officers were killed. The attack is believed to have been carried out by an until-then-unknown armed Rohingya insurgent group.The military campaign, which the government describes as a \u201cclearing\u201d operation, has largely targeted civilians, human rights groups say. It has sent an estimated 65,000 Rohingya fleeing across the border to Bangladesh, according to the International Organization for Migration.\u201cThey started coming in like the tide,\u201d said Dudu Miah, a Rohingya refugee who is chairman of the management committee at the Leda refugee camp, near the border with Myanmar. \u201cThey were acting crazy. They were a mess. They were saying, \u2018They\u2019ve killed my father, they\u2019ve killed my mother, they\u2019ve beaten me up.\u2019 They were in disarray.\u201dSoldiers were attacking villages just across the Naf River, which separates Myanmar from Bangladesh, so close that Bangladeshis could see columns of smoke rise from burning villages on the other side, said Nazir Ahmed, the imam of a mosque that caters to Rohingyas.He said it was true that some Rohingya, enraged by years of mistreatment by Myanmar forces, had organized themselves into a crude militant force, but that Myanmar had dramatically exaggerated its proportions and seriousness.Rohingyas are \u201cfrustrated, and they are picking up sticks and making a call to defend themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, if they find a farmer who has a machete at home, they say, \u2018You are engaged in terrorism.\u2019\u201dIn interviews in and around the Kutupalong and Leda refugee camps here, Rohingya who fled Myanmar in recent weeks said that military personnel initially went house to house seeking adult men, and then proceeded to rape women and burn homes. Many new arrivals are from Kyet Yoepin, a village where 245 buildings were destroyed during a two-day sweep in mid-October, according to Human Rights Watch.Muhammad Shafiq, who is in his mid-20s, said he was at home with his family when he heard gunfire. Soldiers in camouflage banged on the door, then shot at it, he said. When he let them in, he said, \u201cthey took the women away, and lined up the men.\u201dMr. Shafiq said that when a soldier grabbed his sister\u2019s hand, he lunged at him, fearful the soldier intended to rape her, and was beaten so severely that the soldiers left him for dead. Later, he bolted with one of his children and was grazed by a soldier\u2019s bullet on his elbow. He crawled for an hour on his hands and knees through a rice field, then watched, from a safe vantage point, as troops set fire to what remained of Kyet Yoepin.\u201cThere are no homes left,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is burned.\u201dJannatul Mawa, 25, who is from the same village, said she crawled toward the next village overnight, passing the shadowy forms of dead and wounded neighbors.\u201cSome were shot, some were killed with a blade,\u201d she said. \u201cWherever they could find people, they were killing them.\u201dDozens more families are from Pwint Phyu Chaung, which was near the site of a clash between militants and soldiers on Nov. 12.According to Amnesty International, the militants scattered into neighboring villages. When army troops followed them, several hundred men from Pwint Phyu Chaung resisted, using crude weapons like farm implements and knives, the report said. A Myanmar army lieutenant colonel was shot dead, and the troops called in air support from two attack helicopters.Mumtaz Begum, 40, said she was awakened at dawn when security forces approached the village from both sides and began searching for adult men in each house.She said she and her daughter were told to kneel down outside their home with their hands over their heads and were beaten with bamboo clubs.She said her 10-year-old son was shot through the leg, her daughter\u2019s husband was arrested, and her own husband was one of dozens of men and boys in the village who were killed by soldiers armed with guns or machetes that night.

{"Headline": "Remaking Kennedy Airport Is Governor\u2019s Next Big Plan", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Wednesday that with a complete overhaul of La Guardia Airport underway, he wants to rebuild New York City\u2019s other airport, John F. Kennedy International.Mr. Cuomo outlined a plan to spend more than $10 billion modernizing Kennedy\u2019s terminals and improving the highway and transit systems connected to the airport. He did not provide a timetable for the plan or say specifically where all of the money would come from.\u201cThe next step is to tackle J.F.K., because La Guardia isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, speaking at a meeting of the Association for a Better New York, a business group, in Manhattan. \u201cWe need to build a new airport at J.F.K. and go through the same process as we did with La Guardia.\u201dThe plans offered by Mr. Cuomo on Wednesday suggest that he does not intend to stop trying to impose his will on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates La Guardia and J.F.K. The authority\u2019s commissioners are scheduled to meet on Thursday to vote on a $30 billion long-term spending plan that includes only about $1 billion for improvements at J.F.K.When Mr. Cuomo formed an advisory group in 2015 to study how to improve J.F.K., he said the panel would make recommendations to the authority. But the authority\u2019s chairman, John J. Degnan, did not see the panel\u2019s final report until Tuesday.\u201cWe await an opportunity to review the details of the governor\u2019s proposal,\u201d Mr. Degnan said on Wednesday. \u201cWe will have to evaluate it against other compelling capital needs identified by the Port Authority, both within other airports and within other operations that we oversee.\u201dMr. Degnan, an appointee of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, has been at odds with Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, over the authority\u2019s spending priorities. The agency also operates the main commuter bus terminal in Manhattan and Newark Liberty International Airport.Mr. Cuomo pushed for $2.5 billion in the capital plan for improvements at the New York airports, possibly including an AirTrain link from New York City\u2019s subway system to La Guardia. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s advisory panel suggested that most of the rest of the money \u2014 up to $7 billion \u2014 could come from private sources, including airlines that use J.F.K.Kennedy is a collection of free-standing terminals, some of which were built, at least in part, by the airlines that occupy them. JetBlue Airways and the authority split the cost of building Terminal 5, which opened in 2008. Delta Air Lines has spent more than $1 billion in the recent years to improve its facilities at Terminals 2 and 4.At La Guardia, the authority has committed $600 million to the rebuilding of Terminals C and D against an estimated cost of about $4 billion. That investment would come on top of a $4 billion rebuilding of the Central Terminal Building there, which began last year.Mr. Cuomo hopes to entice airlines to make similar investments at J.F.K. to compete for customers. He challenged airlines to make offers, saying Delta had called him at 5:45 a.m. on Wednesday.Mr. Cuomo did not mention seeking federal financing. President-elect Donald J. Trump has said he plans to make an ambitious investment in infrastructure a priority of his administration.As part of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s plan for J.F.K., Matthew Driscoll, New York State\u2019s transportation commissioner, said his agency would spend as much as $2 billion to improve the flow of traffic to and from the airport. The changes would include adding a lane to the Van Wyck Expressway and widening ramps at the busy interchange in Kew Gardens, Queens, which Mr. Driscoll said handles 250,000 vehicles per day.Thomas F. Prendergast, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said that transit agencies would explore creating a one-seat ride between Manhattan and J.F.K. Travelers must now switch to the AirTrain from the subway or Long Island Rail Road, a transfer that Mr. Prendergast described as \u201cschlepping with your luggage.\u201dThough New York City owns the land under J.F.K., no one from City Hall attended Mr. Cuomo\u2019s speech. \u201cInvestments in New York City\u2019s airports are vitally important to our region\u2019s long-term development,\u201d said Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cWe look forward to hearing more details about the plans for J.F.K. in the months to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Stop Trump, Democrats Can Learn From the Tea Party", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsToday is the first day of the 115th United States Congress. In less than three weeks, this Congress will join with President-elect Donald J. Trump to claim a mandate they do not have for policies that most Americans do not support. Together, they will seek to enact a bigoted and anti-democratic agenda, threatening our values and endangering us all.But Americans have the power to resist this dangerous turn. We know because we\u2019ve seen it before.We served as congressional staff members during the early years of the Obama administration. It was an exhilarating time to be a progressive in Washington: An inspirational new president was taking office, accompanied by a majority in the House and a supermajority in the Senate. But by February 2009, something had begun to change. Small protests calling themselves \u201ctea parties\u201d were popping up all over the country. In April, their Tax Day demonstrations dominated the news.Their tactics weren\u2019t fancy: They just showed up on their own home turf, and they just said no.Here\u2019s the crazy thing: It worked.The Tea Party\u2019s ideas were wrong, and their often racist rhetoric and physical threats were unacceptable. But they understood how to wield political power and made two critical strategic decisions. First, they organized locally, focusing on their own members of Congress. Second, they played defense, sticking together to aggressively resist anything with President Obama\u2019s support. With this playbook, they rattled our elected officials, targeting Democrats and Republicans alike.Politics is the art of the possible, and the Tea Party changed what was possible. They waged a relentless campaign to force Republicans away from compromise and tank Democratic legislative priorities like immigration reform and campaign finance transparency. Their members ensured that legislation that did pass, like the Affordable Care Act, was unpopular from the start. They hijacked the national narrative and created the impression of broad discontent with President Obama.And they organized for the 2010 election, targeting Republicans in the primaries and Democrats in the general election. After the November 2010 elections, the Democratic majority in the House and supermajority in the Senate were gone. With them went all hope for bold progressive reform under President Obama.The Tea Party\u2019s success was a disaster for President Obama\u2019s agenda and for our country, but that success should give us hope today. It proved the power that local, defensive organizing can have.The guide is informed by a simple principle: Federal policy change in the next four years doesn\u2019t depend on Mr. Trump but on whether our representatives support or oppose him. And through local pressure, we have the power to shape what they consider possible.This kind of local advocacy can make nearly any member of Congress think a lot harder about his re-election chances. It can ensure that the 10 Senate Democrats up next year in Trump-won states recognize that their best hope for survival lies in bold action to defend democracy rather than cutting deals with a petty tyrant.It can also weaken the grip of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, on his slim two-vote majority when he tries to empower Mr. Trump. It can drive home for Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, that his constituents won\u2019t accept deals with a would-be dictator. And it can complement the efforts of organizers as they mobilize to support those most threatened by Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda.If anything, this model has greater potential now than it did for the Tea Party in 2009. Unlike President Obama, President-elect Trump has no mandate, a slim congressional majority and a slew of brewing scandals. Our incoming president is a weak president, and he can be beat.But this fight won\u2019t be won by politicos in Washington, D.C.

{"Headline": "8 Highlights from the Confirmation Hearings", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byHearing BriefingPresident-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s choices to lead the Treasury and Energy Departments faced sharp questions over issues and ethics in their Senate confirmation hearings, but neither seemed to lose any support from Republicans.Here are key highlights:\u25a0 Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, nominated to be Energy Secretary, said he no longer wants to eliminate the department.\u25a0 Mr. Perry also reversed an early position and said he now believed that humans had contributed to climate change.\u25a0 He also vowed to \u201cprotect all of the science\u201d in the Energy Department from budget cuts.\u25a0 Mr. Perry also showed a lighter side in an exchange with Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. Scroll down for the video of the exchange.\u25a0 Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s work in finance represented the worst in banking practices.\u25a0 Mr. Mnuchin said he did not use offshore accounts for his investments to avoid taxes, an assertion Democrats challenged aggressively.\u25a0 Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said he expected a handful of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet selections to be confirmed by the Senate on Friday.Mr. Perry made his case before the Senate Energy Committee that he was qualified to run the agency he vowed to abolish when running for president in 2012.The former Texas governor addressed his awkward history on the issue up front in his testimony.\u201cMy past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy do not reflect my current thinking,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIn fact, after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination.\u201dMr. Perry acknowledged that he had changed his views about the established science of climate change, which, in his 2010 book, \u201cFed Up! Our Fight to Save America From Washington,\u201d he called a \u201ccontrived, phony mess.\u201d\u201cI believe the climate is changing,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cI believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by man-made activity.\u201d\u201cThis confirmation process has been extremely informative and beneficial for me,\u201d Mr. Perry said, noting his conversations with the current energy secretary, Ernest J. Moniz, a nuclear physicist who played a crucial role in negotiating the Iran nuclear weapons agreement.The Perry hearing was short on substantive answers to senators\u2019 questions about what Mr. Perry\u2019s priorities would be at the Energy Department, and might be best remembered for an awkward moment. At the beginning of an exchange with Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, Mr. Franken thanked Mr. Perry for coming to his office to discuss the nomination. He deadpanned, \u201cDid you enjoy meeting me?\u201dWith a broad smile, Mr. Perry said he enjoyed the visit. \u201cI hope you are as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch,\u201d he said.A startled silence followed as those in the hearing room tried to figure out an interpretation of that comment that did not sound, as they say on the internet, not safe for work. Mr. Franken, who was a comedian and political satirist before running for the Senate, milked the moment. He shook his head, and Mr. Perry then asked, \u201cMay I rephrase that, sir?\u201d\u201cPlease,\u201d Mr. Franken responded, with perfectly timed pauses. \u201cPlease. Please. Oh, my Lord. Oh, my Lord.\u201dGetting his feet back under him, Mr. Perry said, \u201cWell, I think we\u2019ve found our \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 sound bite.\u201dThe laughter that had rocked the room subsided, and Mr. Franken said, \u201cLet\u2019s move on,\u201d asking a question about the role of the Energy Department in helping to develop fracking technology and its role in the shale gas boom.In an opening volley, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, asked Mr. Perry where he stood on an early move by the Trump transition team to determine who in the Energy Department had responsibilities related to climate change \u2014 an effort resisted by department officials and later disavowed by the incoming administration.Mr. Perry said that the request for information came before he was nominated, and \u201cI didn\u2019t approve it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t approve of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need that information; I don\u2019t want that information. That is not how I manage.\u201dWhen she followed up with a question about whether he would protect the department\u2019s scientists and the science budget, he said, \u201cI am going to protect all of the science.\u201dIn an earlier question related to the news report, Mr. Perry had suggested that something might not be true just because it appeared on the internet. In response to Ms. Hirono\u2019s return to the question, he joked, \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll have the same experience I had and forget they said that.\u201d The line got a laugh, but the question went unanswered.One by one, Mr. Trump\u2019s choices have given their views on climate change. What they have said often differs substantially from their past statements \u2014 but is also inconsistent with the current state of science.Mr. Perry\u2019s newfound appreciation for the science of climate change echoes the statements of other picks for the cabinets, including Scott Pruitt, who in his bid to head the Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday: \u201cScience tells us that the climate is changing and human activity in some manner impacts that change. The human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuing debate and dialogue, as well they should be.\u201dSimilarly, Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to become secretary of state, said that humans were one of the causes of warming, but that \u201cwe cannot predict with precision\u201d where it is going. That is consistent with the position he has long taken as the chief executive of Exxon Mobil.The straddling sounds more moderate, but does not reflect the state of the science of climate change \u2014 which has grown overwhelmingly conclusive on the role of humans as the prime cause \u2014 and it hedges on the need for action.For those who remember the Nixon years, this might be called a \u201cnondenial denial:\u201d It moves the nominees from Mr. Trump\u2019s much-criticized statement that climate change was a Chinese-created hoax, a comment that he, too, distanced himself from.Peter C. Frumhoff, director of science and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the cabinet selections s were engaged in \u201cmischaracterization of scientific uncertainty to avoid accepting the urgency of reducing emissions is a dangerous distraction from addressing this serious global threat.\u201dSenator Angus King, Jr. of Maine, pressed Mr. Perry on the question of whether cuts will be coming to the Energy department on important areas that include energy research. \u201cWill you commit to me that you are going to be lionhearted in this endeavor to protect your agency? Because they are cutting the legs out from under you.\u201dMr. Perry began to answer that he had an \u201cinteresting background\u201d that involved defending budgets from \u201cthose in the know,\u201d when Mr. King interrupted, saying: it is \u201chard to believe the people who recommended these cuts are in \u2018any kind of know.\u2019\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll allow your statement to stand,\u201d Mr. Perry responded, and then began another of the kind of general statements that have characterized his testimony today. \u201cMy point is, I know what the Department of Energy should be good at. I have spent enough time making myself aware, both talking to individuals inside the agency, individuals who have been there before \u2014 \u201dMr. King cut him off again, citing the limitations on his own time for questions, and said, \u201cI really hope you will be strong in this, and I think you\u2019ve indicated that you will.\u201dMr. Mnuchin has broad experience with banking, finance and even the movie industry, but Democrats did their best on Thursday to paint him as incompetent when it comes to running the country\u2019s finances.The pick for Treasury secretary was peppered with questions about how he would keep Medicare solvent and how he would use the department\u2019s resources to clamp down on the financing of terrorism. Mr. Mnuchin largely kept his answers general and vague on those subjects, but promised to work \u201cdiligently\u201d to get up to speed in areas that are outside of his expertise.He said he did not use offshore accounts to avoid taxes in the United States, an assertion that several Democrats challenged.Before Mr. Mnuchin had a chance to speak, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, tore into his business r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and painted him as a symbol of the banking industry\u2019s worst practices.Mr. Wyden also aggressively questioned Mr. Mnuchin about his view on Social Security taxes, and Mr. Mnuchin conceded that he needed to give the issue more study.Democrats continue to complain that they are not being given enough time to question cabinet choices.Mr. Schumer said that he anticipated a small handful of cabinet selections to be confirmed on Friday \u2014 just after President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 but vowed to continue resisting several other selections of Mr. Trump indefinitely.Mr. Schumer said that the two most likely to be confirmed were selections for national security: Gen. John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security; and James N. Mattis, his pick for secretary of Defense.Mr. Schumer said Democrats also \u201clook forward to beginning the debate\u201d immediately for Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the C.I.A., \u201cin hopes that he can also receive a quick vote.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible that some other noncontroversial nominees could be considered relatively quickly,\u201d Mr. Schumer continued, speaking to reporters in the Capitol. \u201cBut from there, we intend to have a full and rigorous debate on the president-elect\u2019s remaining nominees.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Reassures Employees, Without Wholly Rejecting Travel Ban", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byWall Street is an industry built on courting clients around the globe and hiring some of the best and brightest, wherever they may be.Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, issued perhaps the only condemnation by a Wall Street firm of Mr. Trump\u2019s order, saying it was \u201cnot a policy we support.\u201dMr. Blankfein\u2019s carefully worded criticism still stood as one of the sharpest responses from the finance industry, where business is fundamentally about moving money across the globe. Wall Street has deep roots to immigrants. Marcus Goldman, as a case in point, was a German immigrant, as were the Lehman brothers.And Wall Street, perhaps more than any other industry except the technology business, has prided itself on hiring top job candidates from anywhere in the world. That said, some banking executives said it was unclear how much the still-evolving contours of the travel ban would affect their staffs, with some saying relatively few employees appeared to have been affected thus far.Still, the finance sector has had to confront growing nationalist sentiment in the United States and Britain, where the vote to leave the European Union, widely known as Brexit, has threatened to drive out much of that country\u2019s financial industry, which could limit global trade and the flow of both money and qualified employees.\u201cI think it would probably hurt them because they do tend to rely on the best international talent, regardless of where they\u2019re from,\u201d said Charles Geisst, a professor at Manhattan College who has studied Wall Street.But the finance industry has largely been cautious in moving into political controversy outside its focus on regulation.So perhaps it was unsurprising that Mr. Blankfein used a voice mail message sent to employees on Sunday \u2014 a time-honored Wall Street way of delivering firmwide messages \u2014 to criticize the travel ban and note that parts of the executive order had been at least temporarily suspended.In his message, Mr. Blankfein cited Goldman\u2019s business principles, which included the line \u201cBeing diverse is not optional; it is what we must be.\u201dCitigroup\u2019s chief executive, Mike Corbat, told employees in an internal memorandum on Monday that the firm was \u201cconcerned about the message the executive order sends,\u201d and he encouraged finding \u201cthe right balance between protecting the country and its longstanding role as an open and welcoming society.\u201dAnd top officials at the asset-management giant BlackRock, which oversees $5 trillion in investments and counts big Middle Eastern countries as clients, said that while they recognized the need to keep the United States safe, any approach needed to respect the law.\u201cWe, of course, all want to promote security and combat terrorism, but we believe it needs to be done with respect for due process, individual rights and the principle of inclusion,\u201d the executives, including Laurence D. Fink, a founder and the chief executive, wrote.Still, other firms took a more cautious approach, refraining from outright criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. Most companies that issued statements said they intended to focus on helping any affected employees.In an internal memo, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s top executives said that they were both \u201cgrateful\u201d for efforts to keep the United States safe and supportive of diversity. Wells Fargo also posted a statement on its employee website saying that it was still assessing what the executive order meant for its business and employees but that it was \u201ccommitted to fostering a culture of diversity.\u201dBank of America said in a message from its chief executive, Brian Moynihan, that it was working to ensure it had the most accurate information to best help affected employees.The chief executive of Morgan Stanley, James P. Gorman, wrote to his employees, \u201cContinuing to draw on talent from across the globe is a key element of Morgan Stanley\u2019s culture and ultimately to our success in serving our clients.\u201dOther firms, such as Blackstone and TPG, had declined to comment.Here are the various responses that major financial firms have sent to their employees regarding the executive order. (Some have been edited to remove internal company phone numbers.) We\u2019ll update the list with more responses as we collect them.This is Lloyd. The president has issued an executive order that, generally, bans individuals from seven different countries from entering the United States and freezes the broader refugee program. This is not a policy we support, and I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court, and some of the order has been enjoined at least temporarily.If the order were to become or remain effective, I recognize that there is potential for disruption to the firm, and especially to some of our people and their families. I want to assure all of you that we will work to minimize such disruption to the extent we can within the law and are focused on supporting our colleagues and their families who may be affected.Let me close by quoting from our business principles: \u201cFor us to be successful, our men and women must reflect the diversity of the communities and cultures in which we operate. That means we must attract, retain and motivate people from many backgrounds and perspectives. Being diverse is not optional; it is what we must be.\u201d Now is a fitting time to reflect on those words and the principles that underlie them.To: All EmployeesFrom: James GormanWe are closely monitoring developments around the new United States travel restrictions imposed this weekend. While no individual employees were impacted in their travel to date, we are concerned for those individuals and their families who could be impacted and will provide them support as needed.Any employee who has questions about upcoming travel should contact the Global Travel and Security teams.We value immensely the contribution of all our employees from all over the world. Continuing to draw on talent from across the globe is a key element of Morgan Stanley\u2019s culture and ultimately to our success in serving our clients.In light of recent executive orders in the United States regarding immigration policy, we want every one of you to know of our unwavering commitment to the dedicated people working here at JPMorgan Chase. This includes a number of our outstanding employees \u2014 all of whom have adhered to our country\u2019s immigration and employment processes \u2014 who have come to the United States to serve our company, clients and communities.Over the weekend, we have worked to reach out to all JPMorgan Chase employees on sponsored visas who are potentially impacted by the recent orders. We understand the situation is evolving quickly, so if you have any concerns about your own situation and have not been contacted, please reach out to your local immigration specialist or human resources team.With more than 140,000 employees in the United States alone, we are grateful for the hard work and sacrifices made to keep our country safe. At the same time, we understand that our country, economy and well-being are strengthened by the rich diversity of the world around us, where we are dedicated to serving customers and communities in more than 100 countries every day.Thank you.Dear Colleagues,Since the weekend, we have been reviewing the executive order on immigration, as well as statements by administration officials, to assess its impact. As a United States company and the world\u2019s most global financial institution, we are concerned about the message the executive order sends, as well as the impact immigration policies could have on our ability to serve our clients and contribute to growth. We have been advising colleagues who could be affected and will continue to support them and their families.We are proud of Citi\u2019s diversity and the fact that we hail from over 100 countries. We encourage the leaders of the United States to find the right balance between protecting the country and its longstanding role as an open and welcoming society.Dear colleagues,Since Friday, we have been in touch with many colleagues, clients and friends worldwide concerned about the United States executive order restricting travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa.As a truly global company, we are proud of the diversity at BlackRock and proud of the diversity of our client relationships. We have long had valued colleagues and clients in Muslim nations, and, from the earliest days of our company, we have worked hard to build an inclusive culture that welcomes and values the contributions of people from all parts of the world.BlackRock will continue to embrace our values and culture, notwithstanding the challenges created by this order. Indeed, we believe that it is more important than ever that we promote our principles, which we established at the founding of our company 29 years ago, including our commitment to inclusion. We, of course, all want to promote security and combat terrorism, but we believe it needs to be done with respect for due process, individual rights and the principle of inclusion.In addition to the broader implications of this order, we have been working to assess the impact it may have on travel for BlackRock\u2019s employees. At this time, we believe there are relatively few individuals whose travel will be directly impacted, but of course the full implications are still being assessed. We also are closely monitoring the repercussions for United States citizens traveling abroad.As you have likely already seen in news reports, there are protests at many United States airports. Anyone traveling either internationally or domestically should anticipate longer delays getting to or from airports and passing through immigration. If you have any questions or concerns about your travel, please call the Corporate Security hotline 24 hours a day. We will continue to keep you posted as the situation evolves.BlackRock always has and will continue to engage with and welcome people in all parts of the world. That is at the root of who we are and always will be.Larry Fink, chairman and C.E.O.Rob Kapito, presidentJeff Smith, global head of human resourcesOn Friday, President Trump signed an executive order on immigration that includes a provision blocking citizens of seven countries from entering the United States for 90 days \u2014 these countries are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.The company is currently reviewing the executive order and its implications to determine whether it has any direct effect on team members or our business.\u201cWhile we are still assessing what this change means for Wells Fargo, we know that it may have deeply personal implications for team members who may have friends or family affected by it,\u201d says chief administrative officer Hope Hardison. \u201cAs always, Wells Fargo is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion where our team members are encouraged to value and respect others for their differences. These values will continue to be of great importance as we support team members who have been affected by this executive order.\u201dBelow is a message from C.E.O. Brian Moynihan.As a global company, we depend upon the diverse sources of talent that our teammates represent. In view of this, we are closely monitoring the recent refugee- and immigration-related executive order in the United States, and subsequent developments.We are connecting with teammates who may be affected, in response to questions. We also are working to ensure we have the most accurate and timely information to best assist potentially impacted teammates. We will share information and provide updates as the situation continues to develop.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018It Is Unacceptable\u2019: Ethics Doubts Swirl as Trump Club Doubles Fee", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byOn the same day that the Trump Organization announced its appointment of two ethics monitors to advise on potential conflicts of interest, it faced a new ethical quandary: Is it right to double the price of the initiation fee at Mar-a-Lago, the Trump family\u2019s private club in Florida, or would that be seen as cashing in on President Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House?Mr. Lembcke\u2019s acknowledgment came hours after the Trump Organization announced that it had named Bobby Burchfield, a longtime Republican Party lawyer and corporate litigator, as an \u201cindependent ethics adviser.\u201d The Trump Organization pointed to the move as a sign of its commitment to addressing questions about potential conflicts of interest.\u201cWe take our role and the responsibility we have to our company, and our thousands of employees, very seriously,\u201d Eric Trump, one of the president\u2019s sons and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said in a statement announcing the appointment of Mr. Burchfield.But Robert Weissman, the president of the government ethics watchdog group Public Citizen, said the selection of Mr. Burchfield and the decision to double the Mar-a-Lago initiation fee demonstrated that the Trump Organization was unprepared to confront the ethics challenges it now faces.\u201cAt the minimum, this creates the appearance of cashing in on the presidency and selling direct personal access to the president,\u201d Mr. Weissman said of the new Mar-a-Lago fee. \u201cIt is unacceptable. And it demeans the office of the presidency.\u201d9 PhotosMr. Lembcke, who has worked at Mar-a-Lago for 21 years, acknowledged that there had been an increase in the club\u2019s popularity resulting from Mr. Trump\u2019s election, as a wave of new applicants have sought to become members.\u201cWe have had a sudden surge in requests,\u201d he said, adding that new members must be recommended by a current member, as is the case at many private clubs.The new initiation fee went into effect on Jan. 1, although he said the annual $14,000 dues remained the same. The club has 482 members, Mr. Lembcke said, but has a cap of 500 members.Asked if having Mr. Trump in the White House has meant greater interest in outsiders joining the club \u2014 including people who might want access to Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Lembcke said, \u201cIt enhances it.\u201dMembers are already noticing differences at the club, particularly when Mr. Trump is in town.\u201cIt\u2019s now more cachet,\u201d said Robin Bernstein, a longtime member. \u201cIt\u2019s more exclusive.\u201dAnother member, Jeff Greene, a billionaire developer who ran for a Senate seat in Florida in 2010, said Mar-a-Lago was now a \u201cmuch more interesting\u201d place.\u201cI went there for lunch, actually, a couple of weeks ago,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was much more crowded than it ever was before.\u201dIn addition to Mr. Burchfield\u2019s appointment, the Trump Organization also announced on Wednesday that George Sorial, a longtime executive, would be its chief compliance counsel.Trevor Potter, a former Republican chairman of the Federal Election Commission, commended Mr. Burchfield as a \u201cvery good lawyer\u201d and a \u201ccompetent litigator,\u201d but said a better choice, from a conflicts standpoint, would have been a nonpartisan federal judge.\u201cHe is very much a Republican insider,\u201d said Mr. Potter, who now leads the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit focused on campaign finance. \u201cHe was undoubtedly picked in part because he has a history of being a reliable Republican lawyer, a partisan who has represented the party in a number of suits. So he is not an outsider.\u201dMr. Burchfield declined to comment on Wednesday. A partner in the Washington office of the law firm King & Spalding, he will continue with his practice, and the Trump Organization will essentially serve as a client. His corporate clients have included United Airlines and the N.F.L., and he has at times offered ethics compliance advice to major corporations and individuals, a lawyer at his firm said.Elliot S. Berke, a Republican ethics lawyer who has shared clients at times with Mr. Burchfield, including Mr. DeLay, said Mr. Burchfield was not the kind of lawyer who would simply sign off on what his clients asked. \u201cHe is an absolute master on complex ethics and compliance issues,\u201d Mr. Berke said. \u201cHe has the ability to be impartial and fair. He would see that as his obligation as a lawyer to do so.\u201dBack at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Lembcke said that given the growing interest by potential members in joining the club, \u201cWe are very careful in vetting them.\u201d But he declined to release a list of new members, saying membership was private.\u201cThat is why you join a private club,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want privacy.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Young Entrepreneurs, College Debts Can Snuff Out Start-Up Hopes", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipAs she tried to expand her business, Ms. Berendsohn was denied a personal credit card. Her college loan payment was $400 a month at the time. She took on a website project and began to accept other clients in Carmel Valley Village, Calif. But then she lost a commission for a local mural project. Unable to continue to pay her monthly expenses, she shut down her business after three months and moved back home to Miami.Because of the corrosive impact of student debt on start-ups, millennials seem to be the new lost generation of entrepreneurs.Although it is difficult to pin down a direct relationship between college loans and entrepreneurial activity, the weight of student debt appears to be deterring some would-be business owners.The study found that fewer young people were entering the world of entrepreneurship. The share of new entrepreneurs in the 20- to 34-year-old age group fell to 25 percent in 2014, from nearly 35 percent in 1996.Total student loans rose from around $510 billion in 2007 to more than $1.3 trillion today. Despite an uptick in recent years, \u201coverall start-up activity for adults under 35 years of age has been on the decline\u201d since 1996, Mr. Morelix found.\u201cYoung adults, who used to be the largest age group involved in new companies in 1996,\u201d Mr. Morelix and Mr. Reedy wrote, \u201care now among the smallest demographic group.\u201dMany young entrepreneurs are unlikely to go to venture capital firms or business incubators, preferring to \u201cbootstrap\u201d \u2014 finance their companies with their own money or funds from friends and family members. But being in debt for student loans makes self-financing that much tougher.Even graduates who have begun promising start-ups have found that securing financing when carrying student loans was brutally difficult.Austin Dean, 28, based in Grand Rapids, Mich., started his first business repairing computers in 2007 while he was a student at Grand Valley State. He later had to it shut down after having cash-flow problems.A second business, started in 2012 while he was pursuing an M.B.A., focused on corporate event hosting. But his $40,000 of college loan debt for his undergraduate degree forced him to make some sacrifices along the way, including eating cheap meals.\u201cEvery month the question was, \u2018Do I have enough to make my student loan payment?\u2019\u201d Mr. Dean said. \u201cThe debt is always there, drowning you. Could I have turned around the first business or grown the second business? Personal debt always comes first.\u201d\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have student loan payments, I would absolutely put that cash into my business,\u201d Mr. Dean said. \u201cMy student loan payments are $550 a month. Right now, we operate on a bare-bones model, just enough to get by and keep things running.\u201d The $24,500 balance remaining on his loan will take him another four years to pay off, he says.The issue may begin long before would-be entrepreneurs are even thinking about life after college. Many are in high school when they start to borrow and are not aware of how student debt might affect their finances later.Still, there are options for budding entrepreneurs facing credit challenges. Crowdfunding sites like Indiegogo.com and GoFundMe.com don\u2019t ask for credit reports. Nor is there much, if any, paperwork. Sometimes, simple business concepts can attract thousands of dollars, although getting a lot more than that requires a strong promotional campaign that gets a lot of attention.So-called angel investors can be found through city-based business incubators or sites like funded.com.Mr. Amrein cautioned that such borrowers still have to pay the balance and \u201cinterest on the loans may still accrue, depending upon the federal loan type. Yet there\u2019s no reason to default on federal loans.\u201dFor now, Ms. Berendsohn has to move ahead without much financing. \u201cRight now, my business is a small online and word-of-mouth business,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Obama Struggled at Court, and Trump May Strain to Do Better", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported bySidebarWASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama won a series of major cases before the Supreme Court on health care, gay rights, affirmative action and abortion, helping to preserve significant parts of his legacy.But, over hundreds of cases in eight years, his reception at the court, on the whole, was chilly.On average, presidents win in the Supreme Court about two-thirds of the time. The Obama administration won just 50.5 percent of its cases. That record, the study said, \u201cmay be the worst since the Zachary Taylor administration,\u201d which began in 1849.Supporters of Mr. Obama point out that he faced a generally conservative court inclined to be hostile to his generally liberal policies. His critics say his losing streak was a judicial response to his expansive deployment of executive power.What seems certain is that Mr. Obama\u2019s record is an outlier. But it is also part of a trend that started after the Reagan administration, which won 75 percent of the time. Each succeeding president did worse than the last. President George Bush won 70 percent of his cases, President Bill Clinton 63 percent and President George W. Bush 60 percent.\u201cIt may be that the Obama administration is just the latest victim of a court that has gradually been losing confidence in the executive branch,\u201d the study concluded.If that is so, President Trump may have no more success in the Supreme Court than his predecessor did.The core of the new study considered decisions in orally argued cases from 1932 to 2016 in which the federal government, its officials or its agencies were a party. The study also took a preliminary look at all such cases, starting with the administration of George Washington.\u201cScholars have long attributed the success of the executive branch to the quality of its lawyers,\u201d particularly in the solicitor general\u2019s office, which represents the federal government in the Supreme Court, she said. \u201cBut the emergence of a specialized Supreme Court bar full of former solicitors general and other government lawyers may be offsetting the president\u2019s traditional advantage.\u201d\u201cThe solicitor general\u2019s office, and therefore the president, still has terrific lawyers but has lost its comparative advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd its loss of comparative advantage in expertise during the past three decades has likely decreased at a rate that fairly approximates the decrease in its win rate.\u201dThe private bar, he said, has gotten very good at identifying promising cases and persuading the court to hear them. The government, by contrast, has been filing fewer petitions seeking Supreme Court review. Since the court reverses the decision under appeal some 70 percent of the time, the government has a built-in disadvantage.There are limits to numerical analysis of court decisions. As relatively poor as the Obama administration\u2019s overall results were, its lawyers did win a number of landmark cases, though they were offset by big losses, including in cases on campaign finance and voting rights.The simplest explanation for Mr. Obama\u2019s overall record was that the court he faced was generally conservative. \u201cGreater ideological distances between the court\u2019s center and recent presidents is a natural explanation for the declining win rate,\u201d the study said. \u201cBut the ideological distance today is hardly unprecedented.\u201dOther presidents did better in the face of equal or greater gaps between them and the pivotal justice, the study said, including Presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.There is some support for that critique in a separate set of data that looked only at lopsided wins and losses. In cases involving a federal department or agency, Mr. Obama won unanimously or with a single dissent 20 percent of the time, and he lost by that margin 31 percent of the time.The first number was the lowest since at least the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the second was the highest.\u201cIt fortifies the interpretation that Obama is an outlier rather than the latest victim of a trend,\u201d Professor Posner said. \u201cWe might think of the first group of cases as those in which the president\u2019s position is so strong that even hostile justices vote for him. The second group of cases are those in which the president\u2019s position is so weak that even the most loyal justices (including his appointees) join the other justices to rule against him.\u201d\u201cBy thinking of this in terms of the participation of Democratic justices,\u201d Professor Posner said, \u201cwe can get away from the idea that the court was ideologically opposed to Obama.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May Says Britain Will Lead a New Era of Free Trade", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Trying to reassure bankers and multinational companies that Britain will be open for business even as it plans a sharp break with the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May braved the elitist chill of the World Economic Forum on Thursday to argue that Britain is committed to free trade and globalization.But she also scolded the business and government leaders at the gathering in Davos, Switzerland, for being complacent about inequality and helping to feed a populist reaction from those left behind.\u201cIf we are to make the case for free markets, free trade and globalization, as we must, those of us who believe in them must face up to and respond to the concerns people have,\u201d Mrs. May said.Her defense of free trade was slightly jarring coming after Britain\u2019s decision to quit the largest free-trade grouping on earth, the European Union, judging that control over immigration and complete sovereignty mattered more.She also spoke at a time when free-trade deals are increasingly unpopular, particularly among the people she was accusing the crowd in Davos of ignoring, and with President-elect Donald J. Trump talking of protectionism and criticizing free-trade pacts.But with big multinational banks and companies already announcing that they will reduce their staffing in London because of the vote to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, Mrs. May was eager to reassure them that Britain would emerge bigger and better from the divorce.Conceding that the road ahead will be \u201cuncertain at times,\u201d she said that the British vote to leave was not about isolationism but a chance to become \u201ceven more global and internationalist in action and spirit, too.\u201dBritain wants to negotiate trade deals with \u201cold friends\u201d and \u201cnew allies,\u201d she said, adding that tentative discussions have begun with Australia, India and New Zealand, and that China, Brazil and the Persian Gulf states have expressed interest in striking trade deals.Britain is especially keen to do a deal with Washington, and Mr. Trump has said he is eager to start. But until Britain formally leaves the European Union, deemed unlikely before March 2019, it can only discuss such deals, not sign them. And trade deals normally take many years to negotiate, especially if they are also supposed to cover services and financial services, which has been one of Britain\u2019s strengths.Though Mrs. May\u2019s plans for a clean break with the European Union have received an enthusiastic reception from her Conservative Party colleagues and the right-wing British news media, the reaction from businesses and other European nations has been less positive.Big international banks that have long threatened to relocate staff because of the vote to leave the bloc have begun to make plans to do so. HSBC and UBS have warned they could move around 1,000 jobs out of London. JPMorgan Chase has said that it may have to move 4,000 staff members. The German newspaper Handelsblatt reported that Goldman Sachs is considering halving its London work force to 3,000 and moving key operations to New York and Continental Europe, but the bank has not confirmed that.Andrew Parmley, the Lord Mayor of London and head of the City of London Corporation, which is home to much of the city\u2019s financial services sector, said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the looming departures and said \u201cit is inevitable that people would be speculating about what to do next.\u201dHe argued that some of the thousands of jobs that are likely to leave London may return if Mrs. May can negotiate a good deal for financial services. \u201cI take great comfort from the fact that people are saying, \u2018We are back if we get the deal,\u2019\u201d he said.But most banks and companies regard Britain\u2019s departure as a cost, not a source of profit, and want to minimize or eliminate the expense of being outside the European Union.In the meantime, other countries in the bloc, like France, Germany and Ireland, are trying to lure financial services firms, and Ireland\u2019s central bank has had more than 100 inquiries from financial firms considering moving from Britain, according to Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan.Initial European reaction was skeptical to Mrs. May\u2019s plans for a clean break and a simultaneous negotiation with Brussels for a comprehensive free-trade agreement. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, the executive of the 28-nation bloc, predicted that negotiations on Britain\u2019s departure would be \u201cvery, very, very difficult.\u201dEuropean officials seem to agree that Britain should not get a better deal by leaving the bloc, and some think Britain should be seen to suffer, to dissuade others from leaving.The atmosphere was hardly improved by a characteristic intervention from Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who argued that if President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France \u201cwants to administer punishment beatings to anybody who chooses to escape, rather in the manner of some World War II movie, then I don\u2019t think that is the way forward.\u201dDowning Street quickly suggested that the voluble Mr. Johnson was not really comparing Mr. Hollande to a Nazi camp guard, though Mrs. May on Thursday appeared to be struggling to reassure her Continental counterparts.The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, warned Britain against carrying out its threat to cut corporate taxes if it finds itself locked out of the single market. At Davos, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said that countries in the G-20, which included Britain, had promised not to undermine one another in this way.\u201cThat has been agreed,\u201d he said, adding that, to be taken seriously, countries \u201chave to stick to what was agreed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Orders Wall, Mexico\u2019s President Considers Canceling U.S. Trip", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 When Donald J. Trump called some Mexican immigrants rapists, threatened to deport millions of them and promised to build a wall to keep others out, Mexican officials counseled caution, saying it was merely bluster from an unlikely candidate who, if elected, would never follow through.Now, after just five days in office, President Trump is looking a lot like Candidate Trump \u2014 and the Mexicans are furious.With just a few strokes of the pen on Wednesday, the new American president signed an executive order to beef up the nation\u2019s deportation force and start construction on a new wall between the nations. Adding to the perceived insult was the timing of the order: It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington, and just days before a meeting between the two countries\u2019 presidents.The action was enough to prompt President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico to consider scrapping his plans to visit the White House on Tuesday, according to Mexican officials. In a video message delivered over Twitter on Wednesday night, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto did not address whether he would cancel the meeting, saying only that future steps would be taken in consultation with the country\u2019s lawmakers. Instead, he reiterated his commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people, and chided the move in Washington to continue with the wall.\u201cI regret and condemn the United States\u2019 decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us,\u201d he said.It mattered little to Mexicans whether Mr. Trump\u2019s order would receive congressional approval or the funding required to fulfill it.The perceived insults endured during the campaign had finally turned into action. Decades of friendly relations between the nations \u2014 on matters involving trade, security and migration \u2014 seemed to be unraveling.Calls began to come in from across the political spectrum for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto to cancel his visit, and to respond with greater fortitude to the perceived menace from President Trump. On Twitter, Mr. Trump\u2019s action was referred to by politicians and historians as a \u201can offense to Mexico,\u201d a \u201cslap in the face\u201d and a \u201cmonument to lies.\u201dHistorians said that not since President Calvin Coolidge threatened to invade a \u201cSoviet Mexico\u201d had the United States so deeply antagonized the Mexican populace.\u201cIt is an unprecedented moment for the bilateral relationship,\u201d said Genaro Lozano, a professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. \u201cIn the 19th century, we fought a war with the U.S.; now we find ourselves in a low-intensity war, a commercial one over Nafta and an immigration war due to the measures he just announced.\u201dThe fear of many in Mexico is that Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks will force Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s hand. While the Mexican president has opted for dialogue over confrontation, the building pressure, and perceived slights, could complicate his agenda.That could ultimately lead to disastrous consequences. With Nafta gone, both countries would be likely to suffer significant damage to their economies, and Mexico could see a sharp decline in foreign investment. The United States, meanwhile, might find its southern neighbor far less willing to cooperate on issues of security.Pressure from the political opposition could also color the Mexican government\u2019s response. During a rally, the leftist politician Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador asked for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto to appeal to the United Nations and accused Mr. Trump of \u201cviolating human rights\u201d and of racism.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who ran a close race against Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto for president in 2012, said the actions by Mr. Trump on Wednesday were \u201ca great opportunity for Pe\u00f1a to begin his defense of Mexican immigrants, with steadiness and dignity.\u201dFor a new American president, Mr. Trump is both well known in Mexico and widely disliked. His remarks have unified an otherwise fractious country, where corruption, a shaky rule of law and economic struggles have alienated many and kept them from becoming politically engaged. As Mr. Trump\u2019s promises have begun to materialize into action, the public discourse is changing.Some fear the worst.\u201cDiplomatic relations are ever changing, never static, but there is a real concern that this wall, as a powerful symbol of national resolve, will unleash a blunt, raw nationalism in Mexico,\u201d said Allert Brown-Gort, a professor of international relations at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cIt would be similar to the one the American government is showing, and would undermine all efforts for the relations to go back to their normal state.\u201dThe Trump broadside on Wednesday, coming as the Mexican foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, was to begin preliminary talks in Washington, was a new low in bilateral relations.After Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Mr. Videgaray\u2019s fortunes revived and he became foreign minister. But any hope that his invitation to Washington could be leveraged in Mexico\u2019s favor now seem dashed.Many Mexicans said conciliatory gestures were no longer an option.\u201cIt\u2019s like we are Charlie Brown and they are Lucy with the football,\u201d said Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a former foreign minister. \u201cPe\u00f1a is a weak president in a weak country at a weak moment, but he has to find a way to get some official backbone.\u201dStill, despite the outrage, there was a recognition that the action was more political than substantive, like the wall itself. A meaningful stretch of the United States border is already lined with a wall, and illegal immigration persists.\u201cSymbolic gestures are not going to change the fact that we\u2019re neighbors and that our countries will affect each other in perpetuity,\u201d said Carlos Pascual, a former United States ambassador to Mexico. \u201cWe have no choice but to keep working for better solutions.\u201dOthers took talk of a wall with a grain of salt, figuring Mexican creativity, or ingenuity, would render it useless anyway.\u201cThis is just politics, it won\u2019t upend life in Mexico,\u201d said Ariel Najum, 39, who runs a family business. \u201cYou know how Mexicans are: If they go high, we go underneath, with tunnels.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Glimpsing Cinema\u2019s Northern Lights at Canada\u2019s Top Ten Film Festival", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byIt may seem odd for a country to declare its own best films in this institutionalized fashion, but Canadian cinema is largely drowned out by the dominant influx of American culture. It\u2019s pretty rare for even one Canadian film to play the local multiplex at any given time, even in metropolitan hubs.The names of filmmakers that would be familiar to Canadians are the same that would be known to American viewers: David Cronenberg, Atom Egoyan and perhaps Guy Maddin. And yes, they are often the usual suspects on this annual list. However, none of them released a film in 2016, and so this year the Top Ten is refreshingly original and diverse, hinting at a shift toward a rejuvenated independent culture. Some entries may appear in step with preconceptions of Canadian film identity, but a majority are notably fresh.Johnny Ma\u2019s \u201cOld Stone,\u201d a compelling drama about a cabdriver who hits a motorcyclist and ends up caught in a bureaucratic nightmare as he tries to save the man\u2019s life, is one of three debut features that compose the most exciting part of this year\u2019s list. It picked up the Best Canadian First Feature award at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, and it was shot entirely in China. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the story of Canadian film right now,\u201d said Cameron Bailey, the festival\u2019s artistic director. \u201cNot only is there a new generation, but there\u2019s a generation that is plugged into the world beyond Canada\u2019s borders.\u201d\u201cWerewolf\u201d and \u201cHello Destroyer\u201d were both bankrolled by Telefilm Canada, which was criticized by directors and others in 2016 for a tendency to devote most of its budget to established talents rather than taking chances. Ms. McKenzie and Mr. Funk are trying to change that, and they\u2019re not the only ones. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of a movement, a common approach to the means of production,\u201d Mr. Bailey said. \u201cThese are original new voices, and I\u2019m glad we have a culture here that is looking for that.\u201dShe\u2019s not on this year\u2019s list. Neither is Mr. Johnson, whose sophomore feature, \u201cOperation Avalanche,\u201d a convincing and thrilling mockumentary about faking the moon landing, turned heads at Sundance in 2016.But the annual list serves as an essential spotlight, best used as a gateway. Right now, it\u2019s a view to a particularly inspired moment with what may be a full-fledged new wave on the horizon. Canada\u2019s Top Ten is far from the whole story \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chargers Are Said to Be Moving to Los Angeles for Next Season", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byThe Chargers appear set to return to Los Angeles for next season after more than a half-century in San Diego and several failed attempts to build a new stadium.The Chargers, who began play in Los Angeles in 1960 as part of the old American Football League, are expected to share a new $2.6 billion stadium being built by the Rams in Inglewood, about 10 miles from downtown.The move will give the Los Angeles region \u2014 the country\u2019s second-largest market \u2014 two N.F.L. teams for the first time since 1994, when the Rams and the Raiders played there, and will leave the league without a team in San Diego, a stalwart market that has hosted three Super Bowls.The team owner Dean Spanos was expected to make the decision official on Thursday, when he was to speak to the Chargers\u2019 staff, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement had not yet been made.The league\u2019s stadium and finance committees met in New York on Wednesday but offered no new financial incentives to help the Chargers in their efforts to build a new stadium in San Diego. The Chargers did receive an extension of two days, to Jan. 17, on the deadline for them to decide whether to move in with the Rams.After the meeting, according to the person with knowledge of the matter, Spanos notified Commissioner Roger Goodell and several team owners that he would be moving the Chargers to Los Angeles, something that had appeared all but inevitable since November, when voters in San Diego shot down a proposal to use hotel taxes to help the team build a new stadium.An N.F.L. spokesman declined to comment. A Chargers spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Chargers for years were unable to forge a deal with a succession of mayors to build a jointly financed replacement for Qualcomm Stadium, one of the oldest stadiums in the league. The city also lacked the concentration of big corporations that the league and teams often consider critical to supporting a team.The Chargers\u2019 decision to leave comes almost exactly a year after the team owners decided to allow the Rams to leave St. Louis and return to Los Angeles. The Chargers, who had teamed up with the Oakland Raiders to make a separate bid to move to the Los Angeles area, were rebuffed. But the Chargers were given one year to decide whether they wanted to move in with the Rams in Inglewood.Spanos, whose father, Alex, bought a majority share of the Chargers in 1984, repeatedly said he wanted to find a way for the team to stay in San Diego.Ultimately, though, the business rationale for moving made far more sense than trying to find a solution in San Diego. Even if a proposal for a new stadium in San Diego were to emerge, the public would have to approve any stadium-related tax hikes, something it already rejected.In Los Angeles, the Chargers would be a tenant in the Rams\u2019 stadium, so Spanos does not have to spend years and potentially billions of dollars buying land and overseeing construction. The Chargers would have to pay a relocation fee, which would come to $650 million if it is paid over 10 years. But to soften the blow, the N.F.L. owners have allowed the Chargers to exceed the league\u2019s debt limit and borrow up to $325 million \u2014 half of the relocation fee. The Chargers can also raise money by selling personal seat licenses and sponsorships.The Chargers would have to find a temporary home in Los Angeles until 2019, when the Rams expect to open their stadium. The Chargers could share the Los Angeles Coliseum with the University of Southern California and the Rams or play at StubHub Center, a 30,000-seat soccer stadium in Carson, Calif. They would also need a temporary practice complex and team offices, most likely in Orange County.The move is not without its risks. Spanos said a quarter of the team\u2019s fans were currently in Orange County and Los Angeles, but it is unclear how many fans in San Diego will be willing to make the 120-mile drive to see the team play in Los Angeles, where tickets will undoubtedly be more expensive.The Chargers will also have to compete for fans and sponsors with the Rams, who have had a one-year head start in Los Angeles, where many football fans root for out-of-town teams like the Cowboys, the Packers and the Raiders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President\u2019s Term Running Out, Gambia Shudders as He Refuses to Quit", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byNow, the fate of his nation is hanging on one more anxiety-filled day.West African nations are preparing to enter the country and force Mr. Jammeh\u2019s ouster if he does not leave. In response, Mr. Jammeh has threatened that his own military is prepared to defend Gambia\u2019s sovereignty.Senior officials in his government have resigned in protest or left the country. At least 26,000 Gambians have fled to across the border into Senegal, the United Nations says. Hundreds of tourists on beach vacations were also being evacuated.Now, his opponent in the election, Adama Barrow, who has retreated to Senegal but has the overwhelming support of Gambians and international leaders, is forging ahead with plans for an inauguration ceremony on Thursday, throwing continental Africa\u2019s smallest nation into uncertainty.\u201cWhat we are simply and rightfully asking for is to return to the polls and allow Gambians to elect who they want to be their president,\u201d Mr. Jammeh told the nation, rejecting the previous vote as riddled with irregularities.Parliament added to the confusion on Wednesday, voting to extend Mr. Jammeh\u2019s term for three months, state television reported, although it was not clear whether the move was binding.\u201cRight now all we want is for Jammeh to go,\u201d said Lamine Ceesay, a taxi driver. \u201cEven if they inaugurate Barrow in Jamaica or America, he is already our president. We want change. That\u2019s all\u201dDueling claims to the presidency have upended nations in the region before, coming to a violent end in Ivory Coast in 2010.Back then, Laurent Gbagbo, the president, refused to step down after the challenger, Alassane Ouattara, won a presidential election. Mr. Gbagbo declined to vacate the presidential palace, while Mr. Ouattara was forced to hide in a hotel with United Nations peacekeepers watching over him.Many Gambians are worried about a repeat in their country. Samsudeen Sarr, Gambia\u2019s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, predicted that military intervention in Gambia would lead to a similar civil war if foreign forces intervened.\u201cStarting a war may be easy, but the aftermath of the war is what should be our major concern,\u201d Mr. Sarr said. \u201cThe Gambian Army has been very loyal to President Jammeh, and it should not be underestimated.\u201dBehind the scenes, Mr. Jammeh was fuming over the results. His advisers eventually persuaded him to concede to avoid unrest. Then talk of his prosecution for human rights abuses began. Mr. Jammeh announced that the vote was flawed and appealed to the Supreme Court.Since then, Gambia\u2019s election drama has unfolded with strange twists. Regional leaders flew in but failed to persuade Mr. Jammeh to accept the vote. A hashtag circulated on social media \u2014 #GambiaHasDecided \u2014 with citizens calling for him to step down. The court effort stalled, largely because Gambia has not had a full panel of Supreme Court judges in more than a year, after Mr. Jammeh fired justices and refused to refill the bench.A court hearing on the case was recently rescheduled, but not until May, potentially leaving the fate of the country uncertain for months.Mr. Jammeh called Liberia\u2019s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who is also the chairwoman of the Economic Community of West African States, appealing for help in assembling a panel of Supreme Court justices to hear his case immediately. Mr. Jammeh broadcast the phone call to the nation, unbeknown to Ms. Sirleaf, who apparently thought the conversation was private.Mr. Jammeh\u2019s cabinet is showing cracks. His information minister, who for years had staunchly defended him, fled the country. This week the minister of finance resigned, and a day later his replacement also resigned. The minister of tourism and the health and social welfare minister have also quit.Mr. Jammeh has fired others who have called on him to respect the election results. Sheikh Omar Faye, Gambia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, was called back from his duties after publicly appealing to Mr. Jammeh to step down.Mr. Faye said it was morally difficult for him to remain silent while Gambians were in a state of uncertainty.Alhaji Moamar Njai, the chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission, also fled the country, citing fears for his safety.Joining them are tens of thousands of citizens who have run to the countryside or poured across the border in fear of bloodshed.Even the election winner, Mr. Barrow, has left the country. Last week, he flew to Mali to meet with other regional leaders who pledged their support.For now, he is in Senegal, planning his inauguration ceremony and avoiding security risks that might emerge in Gambia. Over the weekend, his 7-year-old son back home died of a wound from a dog bite. The funeral took place without Mr. Barrow, who had been advised to stay in Senegal for his safety.In recent days in Banjul, the capital, shops in the main markets have stayed closed out of fear. Food prices have shot up, tripling in some areas.The huge presence of security forces across the city is making everyone uneasy.Amy Sakho, a resident of Serekunda, said she went out on Monday to buy a Barrow T-shirt for inauguration day but backpedaled when she saw the police on the streets.\u201cI went back home without the shirt,\u201d she said. \u201cI am really worried about Gambia. I don\u2019t know what to look forward to.\u201dJaime Yaya Barry reported from Banjul, and Dionne Searcey from Dakar, Senegal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ahead of Theresa May\u2019s Visit, Talk of Trade Deal Is Clouded by Politics", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byIn the world according to President Trump, the United States and Britain are about to make their special relationship great again. Having cast off decades of global niceties \u2014 the United States by putting him in the White House, Britain by voting to leave the European Union \u2014 they can now forge a magnificent future.Mr. Trump is readying proof. As he prepares to host Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain at the White House on Friday, he intends to begin discussions on a free-trade agreement that would deepen commercial ties between their countries.What areas of business could be opened to increased competition tend to be the most politically sensitive: agriculture, government procurement and defense. Legions of lobbyists would mount ferocious battles to preserve the privileges of now-favored industries.\u201cIf President Trump genuinely means \u2018buy American, hire American\u2019 above all else, then there\u2019s going to be very little left to offer other countries,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cThere is no way in hell this is a massive trade deal. It would take massive effort to create a trade deal of even minimal effect.\u201dTrade, it is worth noting, tends to involve trade-offs. Negotiations are politically fraught, because they expose domestic industries to the prospect of greater competition with overseas companies. In exchange, domestic consumers gain access to more and cheaper products.British steak aficionados may cheer the shrinking of steep tariffs that limit the influx of American beef. The British beef industry would probably respond less enthusiastically. It would seek protection, particularly as Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc would eliminate European subsidies for British agriculture. Any proposed opening of agriculture would probaly provoke British opposition to genetically modified crops.British insurance companies may be eager for a greater crack at the enormous American market, but that would be outside the scope of a potential deal. In the United States, the insurance industry is regulated at the state level, meaning the Trump administration would lack the authority to engineer an opening.The biggest impediment to a substantial deal between Britain and the United States is the similarity of the two economies, and especially the importance of financial services on both shores.Opening finance to greater competition would require that British bankers pledge fealty to American regulations. Either that, or the rules would have to be opened and renegotiated by both sides. That might happen in the same way that Mr. Trump might perhaps renounce shiny ties and golf in favor of tie-dye and Zen meditation.For American companies, the appeal of giving something up to gain access to the British market has been diminished by the very thing that makes such a trade permissible: Britain\u2019s looming exit from Europe, known as Brexit.Britain\u2019s inclusion in the European Union and its enormous single market has made Britain a prized center for manufacturing and corporate headquarters for multinational companies. American investment banks have been able to set up shop in London and use these bases to serve clients from Ireland to Romania, as if operating in one country.But once Britain leaves Europe, these benefits would almost certainly disappear, raising endless questions about the future terms of trade across the English Channel.Already, major banks are publicly outlining plans to shift some operations to cities in the European Union, exploring Dublin, Paris and Luxembourg. Already, major multinational companies are expressing reservations about sinking the next investment in Britain.All of this makes a trade deal less compelling, diminishing the stakes, leaving politics as the most meaningful context.Last year, before Britain\u2019s referendum, Mr. Obama visited the country and urged voters to opt for remaining in Europe. He sought to undercut a key aspiration of those urging a break from the bloc \u2014 the prospect that a more independent Britain could strike a free-trade deal with the United States.With Mr. Trump now in the White House, Britain\u2019s place in the queue has effectively been upgraded, a handy development for Mrs. May as she presses ahead with Brexit. She is under pressure to demonstrate that Britain, once liberated from Europe, can harvest bounty via trade with faster-growing, more innovative parts of the globe. A trade deal with the largest economy on earth would presumably check that box.\u201cIt is clearly in the British government\u2019s political interest to show that it can negotiate a free-trade agreement with the United States,\u201d said Stephen Woolcock, a trade expert at the London School of Economics. \u201cThe question is what the economic costs and benefits of such an agreement would be? These would seem to be less clear cut.\u201dIn much of the world, Britain\u2019s decision to abandon the European Union has been construed as a retrenchment of British influence and a disengagement from global affairs. In recent weeks, Mrs. May has labored to displace that notion by describing post-Brexit Britain as a land of dauntless capitalists scouring the planet for fresh opportunities.In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, she described a British exit as \u201ca vote to take control and make decisions for ourselves and, crucially, to become even more global and internationalist in action and in spirit, too. Because that is who we are as a nation.\u201dA trade deal with the United States could be considered evidence to further that case.Mr. Trump could post a deal with Britain on Twitter as proof he is not, despite popular perceptions, a nativist protectionist leading the United States on a retreat from global concerns.In a similar vein, he could use a trade deal with Britain \u2014 even a narrow, economically inconsequential one \u2014 to claim vindication for his encouragement of leaving the bloc. That could resonate with the sort of voters who make up Mr. Trump\u2019s base as well as supporters of Brexit in Britain \u2014 that is, those inclined to blame immigrants for economic afflictions.\u201cTrump can play to his constituents,\u201d Mr. Posen of the Peterson Institute said, people \u201cwho believe that trade deals among white rich people are particularly desirable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also suspended high-level economic talks and said staff at the consulate in Busan would not attend events organized by the city government.South Korea showed no sign of acquiescing to Japan\u2019s demand that it immediately remove the statue in Busan, a port city in the country\u2019s southeast. \u201cWe want to stress again that despite difficult issues facing us, both governments must strive to develop bilateral relations based on mutual trust,\u201d said Cho June-hyuck, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, who called Japan\u2019s announcement \u201cregrettable.\u201dSouth Korea\u2019s Finance Ministry urged Tokyo to keep diplomatic disputes out of economic and financial relations.Washington has repeatedly appealed to South Korea and Japan to overcome the persistent, bitter legacies of Japan\u2019s brutal colonial rule over Korea in the first half of the 20th century and to work more closely together to better address North Korea\u2019s advancing threat of nuclear weapons and China\u2019s expanding influence.But the issue of the comfort women, as the former sex slaves were euphemistically called in Japan and South Korea, remains seemingly intractable, despite a 2015 agreement between the countries that was meant to put the dispute behind them.Since then, activists have put up dozens more such statues, in South Korea and abroad. But the one in Busan was only the second to be installed near a Japanese diplomatic mission.\u201cEach side, Japan and South Korea respectively, should implement the agreement with a sense of responsibility,\u201d Mr. Kawamura said, specifying that the deal should extend to the statue in Busan.On Dec. 28, the first anniversary of the agreement, civic groups in Busan installed the statue on a sidewalk near the Japanese Consulate, despite repeated protests from Tokyo and the consulate.The local government immediately removed it, saying it had been placed there without permission, but bowed to public pressure two days later and allowed it to be put back. A visit that week by Japan\u2019s defense minister, Tomomi Inada, to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which commemorates a number of convicted war criminals along with Japan\u2019s other war dead, had deepened resentments in South Korea.Shinsuke Sugiyama, Japan\u2019s vice minister for foreign affairs, who is in Washington attending talks with his American and South Korean counterparts to discuss North Korea and other security issues, lodged an official complaint with his South Korean counterpart, Lim Sung-nam, over the Busan statue on Thursday. For his part, Mr. Lim strongly protested Ms. Inada\u2019s visit to the shrine, officials here said on Friday.Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, and Motoko Rich from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anthony B. Atkinson, Economist Who Pioneered Study of Inequality, Dies at 72", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Anthony B. Atkinson, an acclaimed British economist who pioneered the study of changes in the distribution of wealth and income, allowing for a better understanding of poverty and inequality, died on Sunday in Oxford, England. He was 72.The author of more than 40 books, Mr. Atkinson was mainly known for his creative and exacting use of empirical methods. But in recent years he also put forward bold policy ideas, like creating a \u201cminimum inheritance\u201d to be distributed on reaching adulthood.Mr. Atkinson\u2019s book \u201cThe Distribution of Personal Wealth in Britain\u201d (1978), written with A. J. Harrison, examined inheritance tax records in Britain between 1911 and 1975 to describe changes in the distribution of wealth. That book and an earlier book \u2014 \u201cShares of Upper Income Groups in Income and Savings\u201d (1953) by Simon Kuznets, which drew on income tax records and national accounts in the United States between 1913 and 1948 \u2014 \"are at the origins of all modern research programs on inequality measurement,\u201d Dr. Piketty said.\u201cAtkinson started studying inequality in the late 1960s, at a time when inequality was at a historical low, when there was relatively little interest in it,\u201d Dr. Saez said in an interview. \u201cThe influence and impact of Atkinson\u2019s work grew as inequality made a resurgence in the 1980s and became a serious problem. He dies when inequality is now very high and growing.\u201dHe suggested giving workers, and labor unions, more power to bargain. He called for an explicit target for reducing unemployment, and guaranteed public jobs at minimum wage for those who seek them. He supported setting a minimum wage at a level sufficient to support basic needs.Among his other suggestions: a guaranteed interest rate on savings, via bonds; higher marginal income tax rates, with a top rate of 65 percent (it is currently 39.6 percent in the United States and 45 percent in Britain); and a progressive, rather than uniform, property tax rate.He was a fellow at St. John\u2019s College, Cambridge, from 1967 to 1971, a professor of economics at the University of Essex from 1971 to 1976, and a professor of political economy at University College, London, from 1976 to 1979.He is survived by his wife, Judith Mandeville; three children, Richard, Sarah and Charles; and eight grandchildren.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Racial Barrier Left to Break (Except All of Them)", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byOpinionMr. Obama embodied for many Americans the legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whom we celebrate on Monday. Our national memory of Dr. King has, for nearly 50 years, reinforced the belief that America, unlike any other nation, could extend opportunity to everyone regardless of his or her identity. In Dr. King\u2019s name, assimilation and aspiration have been the keywords of the post-civil rights era, and diversity and inclusion its currency. And Mr. Obama has symbolized more than anyone in American history the idea that racial representation and the content of one\u2019s character were the perfect antidote to racism.It\u2019s true that, in fulfilling the duties of the presidency with great dignity, Mr. Obama represents the highest expression of the goal of assimilation. But for African-Americans, he was also the ultimate lesson in how this antidote alone is insufficient to heal the gaping wounds of racial injustice in America. It\u2019s clear that black leadership, in itself, isn\u2019t enough to transform the country. So we must confront the end of an era and the dawn of a new one.We now live in a post-assimilation America. The 50-year-old rules for racial advancement are obsolete. There is no racial barrier left to break. There is no office in the land to which an African-American can ascend \u2014 from mayor to attorney general and the presidency \u2014 that will serve as a magical platform for saving black people and our nation\u2019s soul from its racist past. We cannot engineer a more equitable nation simply by dressing up institutions in more shades of brown. Instead, we must confront structural racism and the values of our institutions.But the exceptionalism of Mr. Obama\u2019s biography couldn\u2019t save us from the Tea Party revolution, Republican obstructionism, police brutality, voter suppression and Islamophobia. We now know that no individual, no matter how singular, can bend the moral arc of the universe. Not even Dr. King could.The Dr. King we choose to remember was indeed the symbolic beacon of the civil rights movement. But the Dr. King we forget worked within institutions to transform broken systems. He never positioned himself as a paragon of progress. Nor did he allow others to become complacent.In his last book, in 1967, \u201cWhere Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?\u201d Dr. King warned that the movement was already hobbled by delusion. \u201cThe majority of white Americans consider themselves sincerely committed to justice for the Negro,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey believe that American society is essentially hospitable to fair play and to steady growth toward a middle-class utopia embodying racial harmony. But unfortunately this is a fantasy of self-deception and comfortable vanity.\u201dDr. King never imagined the election of African-Americans to office in itself as sufficient. Instead, his \u201cunarmed truth\u201d was the need to remake all of American society. He urged us to become \u201ccreative dissenters\u201d and hold the country \u201cto a higher destiny.\u201dSo what does creative dissent look like in a post-assimilation America?We must recognize that institutions are far more powerful than individuals, no matter how many people of color can be counted in leadership. Structural racism is immune to identity politics. That Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch became attorneys general, for example, was the starting point for the possibility of federal criminal justice reform \u2014 not the reform itself.In addition, history matters. Black people in charge of, or embedded in, institutions that have not atoned for their history of racism can make it easier for those institutions to ignore or dismiss present-day claims of racial bias. That\u2019s because the path to leadership has often meant accepting institutions as they are, not disrupting them. Consider what black Harvard Business School alumni told the journalist Ellis Cose: A key to success is \u201cnever talk about race (or gender) if you can avoid it, other than to declare that race (or gender) does not matter.\u201dAs the failure of the black political leadership in Baltimore to protect black lives and the limited ability of black police chiefs to curb brutality in their own departments demonstrate, people of color can inherit or perpetuate structures of inequality. Many institutions of government, finance and higher education were built on the backs of enslaved African-Americans and remain haunted by that history. Diversity and inclusion policies, therefore, should grow out of truth and reconciliation practices as well as strategic hiring plans. Intentional transformation, even reparations, one government agency, one company, one college at a time moves us past the denial and the empty promises and will take us closer to where Dr. King wanted America to go.Other colleges should take heed. The measure of institutional change will not simply be a new diversity task force or more faculty members of color. We should judge transformation by how our institutions behave on behalf of individuals rather than the other way around.Some Black Lives Matter activists have already embraced the possibilities of the new era. \u201cWe don\u2019t need more elected officials that are just black,\u201d Charlene Carruthers, national director of the Black Youth Project 100 in Chicago, said to a reporter. \u201cWe need champions in the city.\u201dMr. Obama himself seems ready to move on from the era of assimilation. In his farewell speech, there was no more self-congratulatory praise for a country that gave him a chance to be president. Instead, he acknowledged, for the first time, the very real threat of racism to our democracy and the contingent nature of racial progress.In a revision to the American creed, he added, equality may be self-evident but it has \u201cnever been self-executing.\u201d And he listed specific areas where systemic racism needed to be uprooted, which he hadn\u2019t done in his State of the Union addresses or inaugural speeches: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be serious about race going forward, we need to uphold laws against discrimination \u2014 in hiring, and in housing, and in education and in the criminal justice system.\u201d As it turns out, there is no straight line of progress from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall.In post-assimilation America, people of color must continue to pursue leadership roles as the demographics of the nation inexorably change. But they must also reject their personal achievement as the core measure of progress and instead use history as a tool to measure systemic change. To proceed otherwise is to perpetuate the \u201cfantasy of self-deception\u201d that Dr. King rejected.The future is no longer about \u201cfirsts.\u201d It is instead about the content of the character of the institutions our new leaders will help us rebuild.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China, Seeking to Stop Weakening of Currency, Issues Restrictions", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Global markets spent most of 2016 adjusting to the reality of a slow but steady weakening of China\u2019s currency.Now, Beijing appears uncomfortable with that state of affairs.Financial regulators in recent days have introduced new rules to curb the amount of capital flowing out of the country, helping to slow the pace of the renminbi\u2019s decline.They issued stricter rules on the movement of renminbi offshore for conversion into dollars. Analysts also cited worries over reports that authorities were considering restrictions on companies as well.The collective result: a temporary reverse in the slide of the Chinese currency\u2019s value.The effect has been most pronounced in Hong Kong, where investors trade a small pool of offshore renminbi more freely than in mainland China. After a two-day rally, the offshore renminbi rose as much as 2.5 percent, to 6.7853 against the dollar on Thursday, an exceptional gain for a currency that is usually subject to staid trading.It has helped that the dollar has stumbled against major currencies. The currency has fallen in value after minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting showed policy makers were concerned over uncertainty caused by the election of Donald J. Trump \u2014 in the minutes, Fed officials said they regarded both higher growth and lower growth as more likely since the election.Beijing\u2019s capital controls, and fears that more measures could be on the way, have tightened conditions in a city where the Chinese currency is already in short supply.\u201cChina\u2019s effort to curb capital outflow continues,\u201d said Frances Cheung, head of rates strategy for Asia outside Japan at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. She added that \u201cany restrictions that reduce the outflows\u201d of China\u2019s currency will further tighten the market for offshore renminbi.Borrowing costs for offshore renminbi have been edging up for weeks on the interbank market, where lenders and other major financial institutions seek funding. By Thursday, that overnight deposit rate briefly rose as high as 100 percent. By comparison, it hovered between 1 percent and 3 percent for most of October and November.Some analysts said the sharp swings in offshore exchange rates and borrowing costs appeared to be engineered by the Chinese leadership, as a way to ease depreciation pressure on the renminbi and to discourage speculation \u2014 namely short-sellers, investors who bet on declines in the currency, often by using borrowed funds.The Chinese central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, denied that it was behind recent movements in the offshore currency market.In an emailed response to questions, the central bank\u2019s press office said claims that it had directly or indirectly intervened in the offshore renminbi market in Hong Kong were \u201cnot true.\u201d It declined to elaborate.Some economists noted that the tight conditions in the offshore market were enough to set off the squeeze without the central bank having to intervene directly.\u201cLiquidity had been tight since September, and the market had widely expected tight liquidity conditions to continue,\u201d said Becky Liu, the head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong.Kiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Tucked among the policy prescriptions and infrastructure plans in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s state budget proposal this week were several changes to Start-Up that narrowed the program\u2019s focus to true start-ups and reduced the number of jobs companies were required to create to qualify for tax benefits.And the program had a new name: the Excelsior Business Program, a rebranding that carries some irony. Instead of allowing businesses of any size to apply, the program will now be open only to what most people would define as start-ups \u2014 small companies in their formative stages \u2014 in a move aimed at encouraging the next Google or Facebook to hatch in New York State.Currently, businesses are required to create at least one new job each year to remain in the program, which exempts companies operating in certain tax-free zones from all taxes for up to a decade; under the new proposal, the requirement would fall to creating one new job in the first five years the company is in the program.Empire State Development, the state agency that oversees the program as well as the governor\u2019s other economic development efforts, will be required to update the public on the initiative, as well as a related program known as Empire Jobs, once a year.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has not budged from his support for Start-Up, and the state insisted this week that the program would produce more than 4,000 new jobs over the next several years. State officials say the lower requirement for yearly job creation should allow companies to focus on growing rather than on hitting specific job targets, and argue that the companies will generate so little revenue at first that any taxes the state would pass up in exchange would be negligible.\u201dThis program remains in place and the proposed adjustments, which are based on feedback from businesses, will help it reach its full potential,\u201d Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Empire State Development, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain firmly committed to the model \u2014 innovative academia-business partnerships coupled with performance-based, tax-free incentives.\u201dThe program will still require young businesses to move to tax-free zones, most of them near universities, in the hope that academic centers, with their students, research and equipment, will help seed economic growth. Under the new proposal, companies that add enough jobs during the tax-free period can qualify for even more tax benefits in later years under a sibling program called Excelsior Jobs, which officials hope will induce successful companies to stay in New York as they grow.\u201cIt was never the scale to be a really transformative program,\u201d said E. J. McMahon, the president of the Empire Center. \u201cThe governor basically made it a lightning rod for attention and criticism.\u201dHe said he thought the state\u2019s faith that entrepreneurs would move to and stay in New York State seemed unrealistic. \u201cWhat if they get acquired by a company from California?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re still pretending that they\u2019re venture capitalists who can spot a unicorn, and unicorns will grow generally quite oblivious to whether they\u2019re offering financing in a tax-free zone.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information from a spokesman, misstated the time period over which the Excelsior Business Program intended to create more than 4,000 jobs. It is a period of three to five years, not five.An earlier version of this article misstated how often Empire State Development was required to provide the public with updates on Start-Up New York.

{"Headline": "Will France Sound the Death Knell for Social Democracy?", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "FeatureAs a presidential election approaches this spring, even workers in the country\u2019s rust belt are embracing right-wing populism.Supported byThe argument was unconvincing to many in Pas-de-Calais, the rural and industrial area in the northernmost tip of France, where Sailliot lives. In the 1970s, France, like other industrialized countries, began a shift away from manufacturing to a services-based economy, and within a few decades, Pas-de-Calais came to epitomize industrial decline. It is now France\u2019s rust belt and coal country all in one. The working-class voters of Pas-de-Calais have long supported France\u2019s Socialists along with the French Communist Party. But as in the United States, where Rust Belt voters no longer embrace the Democratic Party, these workers have increasingly lost faith in the parties of the left.Sailliot\u2019s union, the General Confederation of Labor, or the C.G.T., was among the most strident opponents of the new labor law. The C.G.T., formerly linked to the Communist Party, is one of the oldest and largest trade unions in France. Though its membership and stature, like those of other French unions, have declined considerably from their post-World War II height, the C.G.T. remains unmatched in its ability to mobilize workers. And many of its members retain a far-left ideology and preference for militant tactics. After a draft of the labor law leaked last February, the C.G.T. demanded that it be scrapped and recommended alternative policies: Reduce the French workweek to 32 hours (from the current 35) and give workers raises.The Socialist government tried to appease the C.G.T. and other unions by watering down the original draft of the law, but opposition to it remained fierce. The face-off ignited one of the most sustained and impassioned protest movements in France since the May 1968 demonstrations that nearly brought down the Fifth Republic a decade into its existence. Marches in Paris and cities across the country drew hundreds of thousands of protesters and often culminated in tear-gas-laden street battles between truncheon-swinging riot officers and anarchist groups. Nuit Debout, a French version of Occupy Wall Street, drew large gatherings of young people to nighttime meetings in the Place de la R\u00e9publique in Paris. C.G.T. activists blocked highway lanes and oil refineries, creating fuel shortages. Labor strikes halted train travel and cut output at nuclear-power plants.Sailliot had another reason to protest. The paper mill in Pas-de-Calais where he worked for three decades shut down in 2015, because of what the company called an \u201caccelerating deterioration in market conditions for printing and writing papers.\u201d Sailliot was still technically employed there \u2014 he was a C.G.T. delegate, he explained, so legally it was harder to lay him off \u2014 but it was an unsettling feeling, he said, to think he\u2019d have to find a new industry to work in. He blamed the Socialist government. His resentment was aggravated by the fact that he voted for Hollande in the French presidential election of 2012, enticed by his leftist pre-election rhetoric. These new Socialist laws, Sailliot said, were even worse than what the right was proposing; as for Hollande personally, Sailliot raised his hand in a gesture, not uncommon among Frenchmen, to indicate his testicles\u2019 springing up to his neck in anger. \u201cHe\u2019s a traitor.\u201dAll around his home and workplace in Pas-de-Calais, Sailliot told me, the far-right, anti-immigration National Front was filling the political void that working-class discontent had created. With national elections looming, the party depicted itself as the new defender of the French worker; as part of that effort, its leader, Marine Le Pen, joined France\u2019s hard leftists in condemning the labor law as \u201csocial regression\u201d \u2014 the same term of disparagement used by trade-union leaders and the Communist Party. Le Pen\u2019s economic rhetoric, in fact, is often hard to differentiate from positions normally held by the far left. She rails against free-trade agreements and \u201csocial dumping\u201d \u2014 the practice of domestically hiring foreigners for lower wages than citizens earn \u2014 and her party has vowed to reindustrialize France and protect social benefits. The French newsmagazine Le Point reported that Hollande, when asked to explain the growing popularity of the National Front, often relays a story a former head of the C.G.T. told him: When the union leader read a National Front leaflet to his fellow union members without telling them what party it was from, the union members all approved of the message.Sailliot, a committed Communist, referred to the National Front\u2019s leaders as \u201cimpostors\u201d \u2014 a word that C.G.T. leaders use when describing the party\u2019s effort to appeal to their rank and file \u2014 and dismissed the notion that the far-right party, if elevated to power, would keep its leftist-sounding promises. But he could not deny the political effectiveness of the message. Among his disaffected colleagues, neighbors, even within his own family, the National Front was increasingly popular, he told me. Laid-off workers saw that mainstream parties hadn\u2019t done anything for them, he said, \u201cso they vote for Le Pen.\u201dIn two rounds of voting this April and May, France will elect a new president to succeed Hollande. According to polls, as of this writing, Le Pen remains a viable contender. Her success \u2014 in the coming election and beyond \u2014 hinges in no small part on her party\u2019s effort to supplant the left in places like Pas-de-Calais, and to make the National Front the new voice of France\u2019s working class.Recently, though, European social democrats have witnessed an extraordinary drop in support. In 2009, the Social Democratic Party of Germany suffered its worst election defeat in post-World War II history. In the British general election one year later, the Labour Party received its second-lowest share of the vote since 1918, the year that voting restrictions on women and non-property-owning men were relaxed. Even in Scandinavian countries \u2014 often cited as the apotheosis of social democracy \u2014 center-left parties are struggling. A recent analysis in The Economist showed that across Western Europe, support for social-democratic parties is at its lowest point in 70 years.The answer, at least in today\u2019s Europe, is probably yes. In the 1990s and early 2000s, leaders like Tony Blair in Britain, Bill Clinton in the United States and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der in Germany led a center-left resurgence. Yet in their fight for the political middle ground, they pulled their own parties away from shrinking labor constituencies and toward a fuller embrace of the free market. In Europe, the demise of the old left has been cemented by the strictures of E.U. membership, which sets in stone practices that were once anathema to socialists: free trade, limits on national spending and monetary policies that subordinate employment to price stability. There is no more blatant example of the European left\u2019s inability to be leftist than Greece, where in 2015 voters elected Syriza, a \u201cradical left\u201d party that promised to thwart E.U. austerity policies. Since its victory, however, Syriza has been compelled, under threat of expulsion from the eurozone, to adopt an agenda that is anything but leftist: privatizations, pension cuts and stringent fiscal targets. In a recent interview in the French journal Le D\u00e9bat, Hollande was asked about his own rightward drift: Will he be the president who presides over \u201cthe end of the socialist idea\u201d? Hollande replied that it was impossible to be socialist in isolation, before going on to frame the left\u2019s challenge. \u201cWhat is at stake is whether the left, rather than socialism, has a future in the world, or whether globalization has reduced or even annihilated this hope.\u201dAs center-left parties become more indistinguishable from their center-right opponents, the classical liberal vision \u2014 a well-informed polity making democratic choices along a left-right continuum \u2014 has blurred. The left-right dichotomy has its roots in the French Revolution, when members of the National Assembly physically divided themselves according to their view on the king\u2019s authority: Those members in favor of more royal power stood on the right side of the chamber, and those opposed stood on the left. While the meaning of the left-right divide has since evolved and the concept has often failed to encapsulate complex political movements, it has since come to define democratic politics. Increasingly, however, voters perceive their democratic choices along a different axis, not from left to right but from a fill-in-the-blank centrist party to a populist, radical one, as a choice between parties that wish to tweak the prevailing order and those that seek to overthrow it.Far-right parties are not the only ones offering revolution. Far-left parties remain on ballots across Europe, and in France, the Left Front, an electoral coalition that includes the French Communist Party, has sought to take advantage of the Socialists\u2019 troubles. The Left Front was popular among many of the trade unionists I met, yet as of now, its support has remained limited. With notable exceptions like Greece and Spain, where far-left parties have surged in the face of economic misery, voters in Europe often perceive these parties to be discredited by history, even irrelevant. And now, in countries like France, the far left faces growing competition from the far right.Many believe that the consequences of this political scrambling will be profound. Dominique Reyni\u00e9, a political-science professor at Sciences Po in Paris, described \u201cthe end of the story of the democratic-socialist model\u201d as \u201cvery bad news,\u201d even though he does not identify as a socialist himself. \u201cIf we consider the invention of pluralistic democracy in Europe at the end of the 19th century, it was founded on the possibility of making a choice between the right and the left,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf we have lost this duality, we have probably lost the mechanical principle of democracy.\u201dI struck up a conversation with Bruno Evrard, a 49-year-old whose father had worked at the mill, as had his grandfather. Evrard worked at the plant for three decades and hoped to spend his working life there. Instead, he was now employed at a nearby cardboard factory on a week-to-week basis. Given the growth in online shopping, Evrard said, cardboard was a relatively good business to be in. Still, he didn\u2019t want to get his hopes up. \u201cThey use temporary people like Kleenex,\u201d he said.Evrard asked me how American workers protected their jobs. \u201cEat or be eaten,\u201d I said, trying to draw a laugh. But this seemed only to confirm the unionists\u2019 view of America\u2019s grim reality. \u201cAre there a lot of \u2018insecure\u2019 jobs?\u201d Evrard asked, meaning jobs with no protections from layoffs. Pretty much all private-sector jobs in America are insecure, I said, explaining that it was common for people to change employers many times over the course of a lifetime.\u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do in France,\u201d Evrard snapped. \u201cThe same kind of stupidity.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the labor law,\u201d Sailliot chimed in.\u201cIt\u2019s American,\u201d Evrard said in perturbed agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s American.\u201dEvrard told me that his opinion of the French Socialist Party, which brought this American idea to France, was \u201czero.\u201d I asked him if that meant he would consider voting for the National Front. He came from a staunchly communist family and maintained his allegiance to the left, he told me. But it was an increasingly lonely position. All Evrard ever heard from his new co-workers was how the government took care of foreigners, not French workers. \u201cI\u2019m never on the right side of the conversation,\u201d he said. The National Front has become \u201ctoo big of a phenomenon.\u201dSailliot then gave me a tour of the expansive grounds, walking me past the brick chateau next to an apple orchard that was built, he said, by the wealthy family that once owned the place, and then over to the mill itself, where he pointed out the virtues of the giant machines. Afterward, we walked over to a nearby restaurant for lunch. At our table, not far from a television that blared out the progress of a horse race, we were joined by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lecoustre, a reticent man with a bulldog tattoo on his neck. Lecoustre works with Sailliot\u2019s wife at a nearby glass factory that, he said, had shed thousands of employees since he started working there two decades ago. His own wife worked at a school cafeteria, part time and on a short-term contract. They had two children, 11 and 14. I asked him if he was worried about losing his job. Lecoustre hesitated to answer, taking a gulp from a glass of red wine.\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally.Sailliot shot him a look of disbelief. \u201cCome on, you know you\u2019re afraid of the future.\u201dLecoustre paused, then gave his explanation: Workers with more menial jobs were at greater risk of losing them. But he worked on a machine, and this gave him more security.Sailliot didn\u2019t press the issue. The two men remained friendly, despite glaring political differences. Lecoustre was a supporter of the National Front. I asked him why.\u201cPeople are fed up,\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe we can try to change something.\u201d\u201cFed up about what?\u201d I asked.\u201cA bit of everything,\u201d he said.The National Front has, in recent years, become more popular in many rural areas and small towns like Wizernes, places that are often relatively homogeneous and have few immigrants. Many people, of course, wish to keep it that way and therefore happily embrace the National Front\u2019s nativist message. Yet immigration is also intertwined with broader anxieties that fuel support for the party \u2014 fear of terrorism, fear of economic collapse \u2014 and so the issue becomes an easy, tangible target, even if it remains an abstraction.I asked Lecoustre if immigration had changed his life in any direct way. He thought for a moment. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.Sailliot interjected. This was the absurdity of it all, he said. There were hardly any migrants in the area, and yet somehow, immigration was everybody\u2019s biggest problem. How could that be? Sailliot went on: Politics ought to be about putting all people first, ahead of global markets, ahead of the bottom line, not about getting some people out of the country. Lecoustre listened, but he did not appear convinced.Presidential-election polls in France, as of this writing, show Le Pen likely to make it to the runoff, to be held in May. The pressing question in France now is: Will the \u201crepublican front\u201d once again hold? Given the unpopularity of the Socialists, Le Pen\u2019s chief opponents are now Fran\u00e7ois Fillon \u2014 a center-right, market-oriented social conservative who has promised to cut public-sector jobs and was recently depicted on the front page of the left-wing newspaper Lib\u00e9ration with a Margaret Thatcher hairdo \u2014 and Emmanuel Macron, a young former investment banker who served as the economy minister under Hollande but has now split to form his own neither-of-the-left-nor-of-the-right political movement. This, bewilderingly, makes the far-right Le Pen the only leading candidate with a traditionally leftist economic message, and it leaves many leftists who remain opposed to her hard-pressed to vote for her opponents.The mining life, despite its hardships, had provided security. Miners lived in rowhouses built by the mining company. Their children went to schools built by the company. Coal, electricity and health care were all provided by the company. Now all that remains of the industry in the basin is a collection of mining pits, slag heaps and workers\u2019 estates so archaic that Unesco, in 2012, added the region to its World Heritage List of unique global treasures. The site \u201cillustrates a significant period in the history of industrial Europe,\u201d Unesco noted. \u201cIt documents the living conditions of workers and the solidarity to which it gave rise.\u201dGlorian\u2019s working life is emblematic of the new uncertainty. For a time, he worked at Metaleurop-Nord, a smelter that produced zinc and lead, then at a textile factory that produced carpet thread. Each of those factories closed. The shuttering of the smelter in 2003 was a particularly hard blow to the region, leaving several hundred workers without jobs. The National Front sensed electoral opportunity. Marine Le Pen has run repeatedly for the French Parliament in the area around Lens, narrowly missing a seat in 2012. At the same time, National Front candidates have steadily chipped away at the left\u2019s power, making significant gains in local elections.Glorian acknowledged that the National Front was attracting some C.G.T. members in Pas-de-Calais; in one case, he said, a prominent C.G.T. delegate from a nearby tire shop ran for office on a National Front ticket. The delegate, Glorian added, was kicked out of the union. When C.G.T. members openly expressed sympathy for the National Front, Glorian told me, union leaders tried to \u201ceducate\u201d them about the errors in their thinking. If that didn\u2019t work, they kicked them out, because the union doesn\u2019t tolerate overt racism and nationalism. Glorian said he was afraid that some of his peers hid their favorable feelings about the National Front from him, knowing they wouldn\u2019t go over well. \u201cThe left is to blame,\u201d he told me of the party\u2019s success. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do their job.\u201dThe C.G.T. delegate turned National Front politician, I soon found out, was not an isolated case. A number of National Front politicians in the area claim to come from unions and other traditionally leftist organizations. The party, it appears, often seeks out members with such credentials as part of its strategy to supplant the left. In M\u00e9ricourt, a town a few miles from Lens that is overshadowed by a volcanic-looking slag heap, the Communist mayor is holding together an alliance of leftists who are battling a rising challenge from National Front politicians like these.On the morning of my visit to M\u00e9ricourt, an outdoor market was set up on the main street, with stalls selling cheap clothes, cleaning supplies, sandwiches. In a bar, I met a foreman named Laurent Dassonville who described himself as a former Communist. Now he is the president of the town\u2019s chapter of the National Front. Dassonville and I moved toward the pool table, where his 12-year-old son sat next to him, playing Pok\u00e9mon Go. Dassonville told me that his father had been a Communist, and so had his grandfather. Years ago, he switched allegiance because, he said, the National Front is the only party that still defends workers. Dassonville ran for local office in 2015 on a National Front ticket. He virtually tied his leftist opponents in the first round of voting but came up short in the second round. After his loss, Dassonville published an angry letter in a local magazine, accusing his leftist opponents of siding with \u201cthe big bosses\u201d in order to prevail over the National Front. \u201cYou followed the instructions of the haves and the powerful,\u201d he wrote. A National Front politician was denouncing the area\u2019s hard leftists as if they were neoliberal capitalists.Dassonville sipped his coffee and lit a Marlboro. He called over a man he introduced as a National Front activist, a retiree who presented a new party membership slip to Dassonville. New members were signing up all the time, Dassonville told me. \u201cLook, this one\u2019s a truck driver,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone from the working world.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help wondering if this interaction was being staged for my benefit. \u201cThey say we are an extreme-right party,\u201d Dassonville said. \u201cBut when you look closely at the words of Marine Le Pen and at the program we are now building, there\u2019s a big part of the left in it. The left forgot its tradition. It\u2019s up to us to appropriate it.\u201dI asked Dassonville if he would call the National Front an extreme-right party or an extreme-left party. Like many in the National Front, he objected to the designation \u201cextreme.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a normal political party,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would you say extreme? What does the word \u2018extreme\u2019 even mean?\u201dDassonville thought the whole left-right spectrum was finished anyway. \u201cFor me,\u201d he said, \u201cit has no value.\u201dJames Angelos is a writer based in Berlin. He last wrote for the magazine about Syrian refugees living in a Bavarian village.Advertisement"}

In other words, the people most in need of a complete ethics review.Exhibit A is Betsy DeVos, a billionaire and education lobbyist who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary. Ms. DeVos\u2019s finances are a tangle that could take weeks to investigate. Despite that, Republicans had set her confirmation hearing for Wednesday. But late Monday night, they pushed it back to next Tuesday.Mr. Trump has at times displayed breathtaking ignorance about the powers and basic function of government. Many on his transition team are new to government service as well. But the Senate, and people advising him, including Reince Priebus, his chief of staff, have no excuse.Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees will need only a simple majority vote to be confirmed. So what\u2019s the hurry? Republicans seem worried that the more time the Senate has to examine some of these nominees\u2019 backgrounds, the more chance a Republican or three could break ranks. Maybe they\u2019re afraid of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire, should any of his picks generate red flags. That\u2019s backward thinking, of course: The potential for conflicts is more reason, not less, to take the time needed for thorough vetting, and the only route to a responsible vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In New York Music Scene, Two Behemoths Vie for the Top", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byThe idea of the New York City rock club may conjure images of graffiti-covered dives where business amounts to little more than beer sales.But in the increasingly consolidated concert business, the reality is that corporate dollars are taking over, even in the clubs that for decades seemed to embody rock music\u2019s anti-establishment ethos.Competition has been escalating between the industry\u2019s two corporate giants, Live Nation Entertainment, the sector leader, and No. 2 AEG Live, which owns the Staples Center in Los Angeles and controls the Coachella festival.The deal, completed in late December, is estimated at $40 million, according to three people briefed on the deal who were not authorized to speak about it publicly. That amount includes investments and advances by AEG Live in addition to its purchase of equity, two of those people said. Both companies declined to comment on the price.The Bowery deal gives AEG one of the most influential promoters in the country, and also represents its latest chess move against Live Nation. In addition to bidding against each other for big tours \u2014 AEG\u2019s roster includes Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber; Live Nation works with U2 and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 the two companies look to taste-making entrepreneurs to develop festivals and spot talent.In an interview, Jay Marciano, the chairman of AEG Live, said that the Bowery Presents was now a crucial part of the company\u2019s expansion plans. Bowery will book AEG\u2019s local venues like the PlayStation Theater in Times Square and will also have a role at Panorama. AEG is also looking to secure more venues in the region for Bowery to operate, he added.\u201cThe Bowery represents a perfect complement to Goldenvoice and the market position we are looking to build or partner up with on the East Coast,\u201d Mr. Marciano said.As these two giants have grown, they have squeezed out or subsumed smaller competitors. In New York, for instance, the Bowery deal means that nearly a dozen of the most prominent clubs in New York will now be tied to two multibillion-dollar companies based in greater Los Angeles.\u201cIt\u2019s getting harder and harder for an independent to survive in a major market,\u201d said Steve Martin, a longtime talent agent at the APA agency in New York.Mr. Marciano noted that since AEG is under the private ownership of a single wealthy investor, it is able to support its partners like the Bowery Presents.\u201cAs an independent company, funding is always difficult to come by,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have virtually unlimited capital for good projects.\u201dFor the Bowery, which puts on about 140 shows a month in the New York area, and has branches and partnerships throughout the Northeast and dotted across the South, it is business as usual despite the AEG deal, said Jim Glancy and John Moore, the company\u2019s two principal partners.Indeed, part of AEG\u2019s pitch to the company was its continued autonomy. In the fall of 2015, Mr. Marciano convened a dinner in SoHo where he let Mr. Glancy and Mr. Moore be wooed by some of the promoters AEG has partnerships with, including Paul Tollett of Goldenvoice and Louis Messina, who presents tours by Kenny Chesney and Ms. Swift. They each testified to the company\u2019s hands-off management style.\u201cWhen you\u2019re an indie company like Bowery, you want to feel you can make your own decisions,\u201d Mr. Tollett said in an interview. \u201cI told them that we run it the Goldenvoice way out here, and AEG is cool with it.\u201dThe negotiations with Bowery were drawn out by its complex ownership structure, involving numerous partnerships. The deal does not include what are perhaps the company\u2019s two most famous clubs, the Mercury Lounge and its namesake, the Bowery Ballroom. Those are owned by Michael Swier, who founded the company and left the partnership. Mr. Marciano said that he and Mr. Swier had not yet discussed a deal.For Mr. Glancy and Mr. Moore, the deal offers a way to better manage what they called the less glamorous side of running the business, like technology and finance. In the spring they will leave their longtime offices on a gentrified block of the Lower East Side for more spacious quarters uptown. But they both said that the deal was their choice.\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t done this deal, we could have continued for years and years as we did,\u201d Mr. Glancy said.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Mr. Moore added. \u201cWe wanted to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Michelle Obama Wore and Why It Mattered", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byCritic's Notebook51 PhotosIt began with Jay Leno.It began, to be more specific, in October 2008, when Mr. Leno, the host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d at the time, turned to his guest, Michelle Obama, the wife of the Democratic nominee for president, and said \u2014 with glee, with gotcha expectation, because it had just been revealed that the campaign clothes budget for Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, was $150,000 \u2014 \u201cI want to ask you about your wardrobe. I\u2019m guessing about 60 grand? Sixty, 70 thousand for that outfit?\u201dAnd thus was an eight-year obsession born. Not to mention a new approach to the story of dress and power.When Mrs. Obama understood the impact of that early answer \u2014 when she saw the public response to her outfit (which had been chosen specifically as a riposte to the Palin news) \u2014 it set in motion a strategic rethink about the use of clothes that not only helped define her tenure as first lady, but also started a conversation that went far beyond the label or look that she wore and that is only now, maybe, reaching its end.Consider all that, and there is simply no ignoring the fact that during these two terms, clothing played a role unlike any it had ever played before in a presidential administration.A noncomprehensive litany of some of the designers whose clothes the first lady wore during her husband\u2019s two terms in office includes: Carolina Herrera, Narciso Rodriguez, Michael Kors, Maria Cornejo, Thom Browne, Isabel Toledo, Jason Wu, Prabal Gurung, Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs, Oscar de la Renta, Ralph Lauren, Marchesa, Tom Ford, Vera Wang, Tadashi Shoji, Cushnie et Ochs, Tory Burch, Naeem Khan, Brandon Maxwell, Rodarte, Bibhu Mohapatra, Zac Posen, Barbara Tfank, Alexander Wang, Rag & Bone, Joseph Altuzarra, Tracy Reese, Monique Lhuillier, Thakoon, Christian Siriano, Calvin Klein, Sophie Theallet, Reed Krakoff, Diane von Furstenberg, Derek Lam, Proenza Schouler and Alice & Olivia. Also Talbots. And Target. And Ann Taylor. Sheesh.Plus, of course: Gucci, Versace, Givenchy, Ala\u00efa, Junya Watanabe, Christopher Kane, Roksanda, Moschino, Lanvin (those controversial expensive sneakers), Dries Van Noten, Alexander McQueen, Duro Olowu, Lanvin and Kenzo. To name a few.It is, by any measure, an unprecedented list.The twin conditions of the historic nature of this presidency and the fact it occurred alongside the rise of social media, which turned every public second into a shareable, comment-worthy moment, combined to create a new reality where every appearance mattered. Not everyone listened to all of the speeches or read the analysis or considered the context. But everyone paused for a moment to assess the visual. And a couple who had spent their entire lives being scrutinized as pioneers understood what that meant, and instead of bridling at it, leveraged it. If you know everyone is going to see what you wear and judge it, then what you wear becomes fraught with meaning. Certainly Mrs. Obama\u2019s significance as a contemporary role model goes far beyond her image, but no one understood the role of fashion, and the potential uses of that, better than the first lady.\u201cShe realized very early on that everything she did had ramifications,\u201d said Thom Browne, who made the tailored coat and dress Mrs. Obama wore for the inaugural parade in 2013, as well as a dress she wore to the 2012 Democratic National Convention and also during the final debate that year. And she understood, he went on, \u201cthat people did not just want to know how she looked, but what she was about,\u201d and that she could plant subliminal cues to the latter with her clothes.Change was the promise, and change was the look \u2014 far beyond the amount of upper arm on display, or the riot of color and prints. Or the cardigans.Just because something appears trivial does not mean it is any less powerful as a means of persuasion and outreach. In some ways its very triviality \u2014 the fact that everyone could talk about it, dissect it, imitate it \u2014 makes fashion the most potentially viral item in the subliminal political toolbox. Talking heads complained early on in the second term about Mrs. Obama\u2019s allowing the clothes conversation to dominate the substance conversation, but in fact she made the two inextricable.That is not a situation that, as any woman would know, happens by accident. We all tend to gravitate toward certain designers in part because of sheer laziness: We know what suits us, what we like, and so we go there first. To have been so, well, evenhanded in her choices could have happened only with careful calculation.\u201cI am not sure people really realized the extent of what she was doing,\u201d said Tracy Reese, whose custom-made pink and gold silk dress, worn by Mrs. Obama for her speech at the 2012 Democratic convention, became her best-selling dress when remade for sale, and whose black dress with big red poppies, worn by the first lady for the 50th anniversary of the 1963 march on Washington, is now on display at the National Museum of African-American History and Culture. \u201cIt was really about us all.\u201d\u201cShe came in at a time when the economy was particularly tough and really shone a light on fashion in the broadest sense,\u201d said Narciso Rodriguez, whose dress she wore on the night in 2008 that ushered in the Obama era, and recently at the National School Counselor of the Year event when she gave her last speech as first lady. If you think that was an accident, there\u2019s a bridge I can sell you \u2014 just as the fact she wore Jason Wu to her husband\u2019s farewell address in Chicago, a designer she also wore at both inaugural balls, was no coincidence. It was closure.13 PhotosBut above all, her wardrobe was representative of the country her husband wanted to lead.It was about the melting pot and the establishment; the 1 percent and the accessible. There was something in her closet for everyone, yet she was beholden to no designer \u2014 free of any specific allegiance to, or association with, a brand. She worked at a remove, through her aide Meredith Koop, and no designers contacted for this article said they knew when the clothes she bought would be worn (if they were for personal use she did buy them, though often at a discount; if they were for state occasions, they were donated by the designer and archived, either at the National Archives or a museum). They were not told in advance, and they found out at the same time everyone else did. It was a business relationship, not a personal one.It may be because the point of what Mrs. Obama wore was never simply that it was good to mix up your wardrobe among a group of designers, but rather that clothes were most resonant when they were an expression of commitment to an idea, or an ideal, that had resonance. And maybe it shouldn\u2019t really matter if anyone else in her position adopts the same approach. Each administration writes its own catechism, after all. Whether we follow is up to us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women\u2019s March Draws \u2018Duty-Bound\u2019 From Wall Street", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byHillary Ripley was on a stair climber at her Brooklyn gym when her 16-year-old daughter texted.A women\u2019s march was being organized in Washington, the teenager wrote, to protest the incoming administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump and to speak up for gender equality. Ms. Ripley hopped off the machine and began searching for a bus-charter company.She contacted US Coachways, got a quote for a 55-seat bus ($3,050 for a day trip) and began querying neighborhood friends to gauge whether she could recruit enough would-be marchers to break even. The seats quickly filled.Across town at home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Alexandra Lebenthal, the chief executive of a stock and bond broker, was also making plans to travel to Washington.\u201cI never have done anything like this in my life before, and I just feel like it\u2019s a time when everybody has to stand up for what they believe in,\u201d Ms. Lebenthal, who was a Hillary Clinton supporter, said.It is an unusual stance for a woman working in the cutthroat world of finance. Wall Street women \u2014 though often tough, tenacious and outspoken \u2014 are not a crowd accustomed to street protest.They are professionals in trading, public relations, marketing, deal-making, investing and the law. They keep punishing schedules, fear losing business by offending their clients and often feel that in an industry still overwhelmingly populated by men, the less attention drawn to their sex, the better.And many of them are employed by financial companies whose share prices have surged since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, a move that could sweeten their compensation.But the inauguration of Mr. Trump has prompted a striking number of Wall Street women to overcome their worries about demonstrating in public.Based on interviews with numerous women from banks, hedge funds, other asset managers, financial law practices and private equity firms, it appears that dozens of industry women in New York, and perhaps significantly more, intend to make the trek to Washington to participate in the march on Saturday.Some are driving, embarking in the wee hours to make it in time for a 10 a.m. rally. Some grabbed early Amtrak reservations before many of the trains sold out or, in one woman\u2019s case, put 70,000 frequent-flier miles toward a ticket.

Many describe it as a signal moment in politics, women\u2019s rights and American history.\u201cI\u2019m not a frequent demonstration participant,\u201d said Jodi Schwartz, a corporate tax lawyer at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, a firm in Midtown Manhattan known for advising companies and banks on mergers and acquisitions.Making time within a cramped schedule to attend the protest rather than taking the simpler route of writing a check to support the cause, Ms. Schwartz said, took some effort. But, she added, \u201cas soon as I heard about this, I knew I was going to go because of my level of horror at the way folks are talking about women\u2019s issues postelection.\u201dThe political climate, she said, is now \u201cletting the cap off a lot of, I think, bubbling caldrons of anti-feminist activity.\u201dAs a relatively affluent woman with the resources to maintain access to insurance and other services, Ms. Schwartz added, she felt \u201cduty-bound\u201d to go and speak for others who \u201cmight not have health care or might not have access to abortions.\u201dMs. Schwartz\u2019s concerns about the threats to gender equality, abortion rights and other freedoms appear to be widely held among her peers.Many of the women interviewed said they were disgusted by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, including his suggestion of prohibiting Muslims from entering the United States, his mocking of a disabled reporter and the crass language he used to describe grabbing women\u2019s genitals during a 2005 taping of \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d that surfaced in early October.Some spoke, too, of concerns that what little progress they had seen on issues of fairness and diversity on Wall Street in recent years would be unwound in Mr. Trump\u2019s America. Most said they had supported Mrs. Clinton for president.At a gathering at her home on Tuesday, Ms. Ripley watched as her daughter, Hawthorne, and a group of friends also attending the weekend march made signs for the event. One of them read, \u201cLeaders Lead. (Twits Tweet.)\u201d Each participant was paying $80 for a seat on the bus, snacks, beverages and other supplies for the trip. The group planned to leave from a Brooklyn parking lot at 4:45 a.m. on Saturday.Yet some Wall Street women said they were avoiding the march because they feared a backlash from colleagues, superiors or clients who were either fans of Mr. Trump\u2019s or critics of public activism.A 37-year-old woman who runs a portfolio at a hedge fund based in New York said she worried that ill-timed social-media pictures from the march could hurt her reputation in the business community.Some managers at private equity firms and banks said they were torn between urging would-be marchers to take caution to avoid angering Trump supporters in the client base and encouraging free expression, regardless of the professional consequences.Ms. Lebenthal, who runs one of the largest woman-owned brokerages on Wall Street, said she was unmoved by client concerns.\u201cI have friends that voted for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a major issue with that, but it\u2019s their right. And I wouldn\u2019t stop doing business with that person if they voted for Trump.\u201dAs for clients who reconsider doing business with Ms. Lebenthal because of her involvement in the women\u2019s march, she said, \u201cIf that happens, it happens.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For-Profit Law School Is Cut Off From Federal Student Loans", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe troubles buffeting the nation\u2019s law schools may be on the verge of claiming their first victim.The federal Department of Education told students of the Charlotte School of Law in North Carolina this week that federal student loans \u2014 the financial lifeblood for law schools \u2014 would not be available. The for-profit school is the first accredited law school to lose access to federal student loans.The Charlotte School said on Thursday that it still planned to open its doors on Monday for spring semester classes.The federal agency took the step to deny loans because the school had failed to disclose to students that it had not followed the admissions and curriculum standards required for law school accreditation. That was a disqualifier for students to receive federal aid, the Department of Education, which oversees the federal student loan program, said.The school is one of three operated by Infilaw Holdings, a group owned by Sterling Partners, a private equity firm with offices in Chicago, Baltimore and Miami. It appealed the department\u2019s preliminary decision last month and reacted angrily on Thursday to the government\u2019s rejection.Federal loans are the chief financing source for the tuition costs of five figures and up in law schools across the country. Charlotte School of Law students received more than $48 million in federal loans last year, according to the Education Department.The Charlotte school had 716 students enrolled in the fall semester, and they pay as much as $45,000 in annual tuition and fees. But the law school\u2019s revenue will be slashed if it remains ineligible for federal student loans.The Charlotte school\u2019s operations have been crippled for weeks as it negotiated with federal officials for a solution to the situation.The negotiations broke down, however, and on Wednesday, Ted Mitchell, the under secretary of education, issued a statement that the school \u201cis no longer recognized to participate in federal student aid programs, and students will not be able to receive federal student aid at C.S.L. for current or future attendance.\u201dThe school\u2019s dean, Jay Conison, and its president, Chidi Ogene, argued in a statement that North Carolina law did not permit the federal government\u2019s solution, which was to shutter Charlotte and temporarily allow a \u201cteach-out\u201d plan that would substitute accredited personnel from another law school to take over student instruction.Such a plan, Dean Conison and Mr. Ogene said, \u201ccould take place only if we remained an active institution delivering curriculum and awarding degrees\u201d under the supervision of the Florida Coastal Law School, one of the three for-profit Infilaw schools.Barry Currier, managing director of the American Bar Association Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, said on Thursday that the accrediting body had directed Charlotte to file a teach-out plan.\u201cGiven the timeline for the school and its students, we would expect the school to not only file its plan in a timely fashion, but begin executing it,\u201d he said.Charlotte Law insisted on Thursday, in contrast to Mr. Mitchell\u2019s statement, that students who received federal loans for the fall semester were entitled to them for the spring. And, according to Kathy Heldman, vice president for marketing at Infilaw, the company is \u201cexploring private loans (including institutional loans) for students who were not awarded federal direct loans for the spring semester.\u201dWhile Charlotte officials tried to cast the dispute as federal overreach, the school\u2019s struggles underscore the plight of a number of law schools across the country that are experiencing a decline in applicants and an accompanying decline in revenue. A handful of students pay from personal resources or obtain loans from private sources, but most students rely on federal loans.The federal government permits loans to accredited educational institutions. The decisions on accrediting law schools are made by the American Bar Association, which placed Charlotte on a two-year probation but did not withdraw its accreditation.Probation was not enough, some law critics say, arguing that the association has been ineffective in curbing law schools\u2019 admission of students who are unlikely to pass the bar and obtain legal employment sufficient to pay off their six-figure debt. Some schools report low bar passage rates and job placement rates below 50 percent.\u201cLong ago, the A.B.A. should have stopped protecting marginal law schools, but it\u2019s a victim of its own insularity,\u201d said Steven J. Harper, an adjunct law professor at Northwestern University\u2019s law school and a former partner at Kirkland & Ellis.\u201cAt far too many schools, students are amassing staggering educational debt in return for law degrees of dubious value,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the department\u2019s action will spur the legal profession to clean its own house before the heavy hand of government does the job for it.\u201dThe future looked much different when the Charlotte School of Law opened in the growing Southern financial center in 2006. It is one of three for-profit schools run by Infilaw, which include Florida Coastal and Arizona Summit Law School. Despite fewer students applying and the dearth of jobs requiring bar passage, the three schools roughly doubled their enrollment figures, to nearly 1,200, in recent years.Each of the three schools failed to cross the 40 percent mark for graduates who were employed in full-time jobs requiring passage of a state bar examination.Yet graduates had law school debt that exceeded $140,000 \u2014 higher than law schools like those at the University of Virginia, where the job placement rate is 78 percent and average debt is $132,182, or Duke, at 80 percent and $125,406, according to bar association figures.The Charlotte School of Law\u2019s practices, said Kyle McEntee, executive director of Law School Transparency, a nonprofit that works for more openness about law school admissions and financing, \u201care similar to the educational degree mills that have been shut down in recent years.\u201dThe turmoil and uncertainty at Charlotte Law have left students adrift and complaining that they have little or no information just days before spring classes are set to start.Two students have filed a complaint in federal court seeking class-action status against Charlotte Law and Infilaw, accusing them of misleading statements and not disclosing accreditation shortcomings.Some students have already taken a leave of absence or transferred, but the cutoff ends a crucial funding source for students like Daniel A. Herrera, who is halfway through his three-year degree.\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I should do,\u201d said Mr. Herrera, 24, of Bayonne, N.J. \u201cI\u2019m trying to decide if I should focus on transferring to another law school.\u201dUprooting from Charlotte, where he likes living and volunteers for a civic project, is a hard and expensive choice, he said. But there are no other law schools in the city.Other law schools are reluctant to accept Charlotte Law\u2019s credits, said Arique Ross, 23, who is a third-year student.\u201cThey say they are going to open the doors, but there is no money to pay,\u201d Mr. Ross said of Charlotte Law. \u201cWhen I ask other law schools about transferring, they are indicating that they can only accept some of my credits and I would have to retake classes and have more debt. So I\u2019m really uncertain about what to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Dennis Daugaard, a Republican, brazenly insisted, as he promised to sign the repeal. The referendum called for the creation of an independent ethics commission to investigate abuses by statehouse politicians and lobbyists, a public financing option to reduce election spending and a $100 annual limit on lobbyists\u2019 gifts to elected officials.The Republican-dominated committee that approved the repeal bill did so under South Dakota\u2019s \u201cstate of emergency\u201d provision that would prevent voters from reversing the repeal with another referendum.This was not only shameless but cunning. In 2014, lawmakers excluded teenagers from a voter-approved referendum to raise the state minimum wage, claiming (as they did this time) that South Dakota\u2019s citizens did not know what they were doing. To their dismay, voters overruled them by a huge majority in a subsequent referendum in November, successfully raising the minimum wage for all workers.Republican legislators \u2014 more eager for political revenge than mindful of the voice of the people \u2014 are now debating a bill that would double the number of signatures required to place referendums on the state ballot.

Much of it goes to the dump, but some of it catches Mr. DiMola\u2019s eye and winds up in his garage on Summerfield Street, a quiet residential block in Ridgewood, Queens.The staggering collection of salvaged items he has amassed over his 30 years in the business is an open secret in this neighborhood on the Brooklyn-Queens border. Every time Mr. DiMola opens his garage doors, passers-by gawk at the explosion of artifacts in his shop.There are old vending machines that once dispensed soda or cigarettes or gumballs. There is a trove of war memorabilia and New York City lore. The ceiling and walls of his office, and sections of his shop, are covered with old street and business signs, and even some working neon signs. There are vintage license plates, old photographs and original oil paintings signed by noted artists.Growing up in Ridgewood and nearby Richmond Hill, Mr. DiMola had little interest in history.\u201cI barely got out of high school,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a big reader.

{"Headline": "An Extremist Holding the Purse Strings", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump will hardly be short of far-right cabinet members, including an education secretary who has called public schools a \u201cdead end,\u201d a labor secretary who has been cited for employment law violations and an Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has sued his own department.But within the Trump team, the views of Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina, his little-known choice to lead the important Office of Management and Budget, rank as among the most reactionary.Only slivers of this were visible in Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s uneventful confirmation hearing on Tuesday.In fact, Mr. Mulvaney \u2014 a founding member of the Freedom Caucus with an almost perfect conservative voting record \u2014 spent his six-year congressional career leading the charge against federal spending and borrowing, voting against everything from Hurricane Sandy relief to reopening the government after the 2013 shutdown.His intransigence placed him well to the right of Republican leadership, including former Speaker John Boehner, whom he repeatedly opposed for \u2014 get this \u2014 being excessively soft on curbing disbursements from the federal purse.Not surprisingly, cutting deeply into core retirement and health care programs is at the top of his to-do list. \u201cWe have to end Medicare as we know it,\u201d he said on Fox Business Network, soon after entering Congress in 2011. (Medicare enjoys support from 77 percent of Americans, according to a 2015 Kaiser Foundation poll.)While Mr. Mulvaney is not alone in his terrifying views, the difference between him and other members of his deeply conservative brigade is that he will likely soon have an unusual opportunity to cement them into place; O.M.B. (as it is universally known) is the control center for the administration\u2019s fiscal policy.Each year, the budget office oversees the federal government\u2019s budgeting process, receiving requests from individual agencies, analyzing them and making recommendations to the president as to what spending should be requested from Congress and what the deficit should be.From that perch, Mr. Mulvaney will be well positioned to help excise funding for the Affordable Care Act, defund Planned Parenthood, abolish the Export-Import Bank, eliminate government-financed research, raise the retirement age for Social Security to 70 and even clamp down on off-budget military spending, to name just a few of his targets.We may already be starting to see the shadowy outlines of this kind of agenda; the new administration is reportedly considering proposals to cut $10.5 trillion of spending over the next decade, more than 40 percent of many important programs.Mr. Mulvaney shares many extreme economic views with his first choice for the Republican nomination, the libertarian-leaning senator Rand Paul, particularly his belief that the mounting national debt is an existential crisis that must be addressed regardless of the consequences.In that quest, the 49-year-old South Carolinian has argued for a balanced-budget amendment, a truly terrible idea that would eliminate the federal government\u2019s ability to use deficit spending in times of economic weakness.Similarly, he has repeatedly voted against legislation to raise the debt ceiling, without which the federal government would shut down and possibly even default on its obligations, neither of which seemed to bother the congressman.And like his new boss, Mr. Mulvaney has suggested that if the nation\u2019s debt continued to mount, one way to address that problem would be to push creditors to accept less than full payment.The consequences of that, said Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, with classic Fed understatement, would be \u201cvery severe,\u201d at a minimum resulting \u201cin much higher borrowing costs for American households and businesses.\u201dThe feelings are mutual. Mr. Mulvaney has repeatedly blasted the Federal Reserve\u2019s low interest rate policies, including at a dinner held by the John Birch Society, an ultraconservative organization founded in 1958 that today could be branded alt-right.His antipathy toward the Fed has led him to support legislation that would severely compromise the central bank\u2019s independence. That\u2019s among Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s most misguided notions; the Fed\u2019s strong response to the financial crisis played a key role in the economic recovery of the last eight years.And then there\u2019s the budget office\u2019s responsibility for reviewing every major proposed regulation \u2014 as well as existing ones \u2014 which will allow him to continue his war against government rules of almost every flavor.I\u2019ll be curious to see how Mr. Mulvaney meshes with his new colleagues. As he acknowledged Tuesday, his unabashed advocacy of cutting Social Security and Medicare puts him at odds with his new boss.The new president has also said that no one should lose their health care when Obamacare is replaced, while the alternatives that Mr. Mulvaney has supported would inevitably result in many losing their insurance.In the same vein, he will surely hate Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for enormous unfinanced tax cuts and huge infrastructure spending, which are projected to increase total deficits by $5.3 trillion over the next 10 years.Policy differences aren\u2019t unusual within the new team. But those who know Mr. Mulvaney say that his absolutism will make it difficult for him to make the compromises that are inevitably necessary in the policy-making process.Let\u2019s hope that cooler heads prevail.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tool Kit for the Donor Eager to Grasp All the Risks of Donation", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersSASHA KRAMER, an ecologist, was having success promoting greater sanitation in Haiti when she lost access to her nonprofit\u2019s only composting site in Port-au-Prince: a dump that was being mismanaged.Her group, SOIL, provides toilets to poor households. Each week it sent representatives to empty the five-gallon buckets, bring the waste to the dump and turn it into compost, which was sold to farmers as fertilizer.Nearly nine years into the work, though, the local dump fell into chaos when the private company managing it lost its contract. The government ceased to keep access roads clear and began burning trash to clear it.\u201cWe managed to keep the compost site open, but we could only get in there once every two weeks,\u201d Dr. Kramer said. \u201cThere was so much smoke out there that it was becoming a health risk.\u201dWorse, she said she didn\u2019t know where to turn to get money for another site.Despite the likelihood of problems, leaders of nonprofit organizations rarely lay out the risks of their projects, lest any hint of failure scare away funders. On the flip side, donors often fail to dig deeply enough to discuss the obstacles a project may encounter. Among donors, 76 percent don\u2019t ask recipients about the risks they face, while 87 percent of nonprofit leaders said grant applications had no questions about risks, according to Open Road Alliance.\u201cThis isn\u2019t anecdotal evidence,\u201d said Laurie Michaels, Open Road\u2019s founder. \u201cThis is donors and funders reporting that 20 percent of the projects need more money. Yet no one ever asks about this.\u201dSpurred by this research, and by its experience with shoring up projects in crisis, Open Road Alliance partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation and Arabella Advisors, a nonprofit consultancy, in convening a group of nonprofit executives to think through risk assessment.\u201cWe designed the tool kit very deliberately, so a foundation could take it in total or pick and choose tools \u00e0 la carte,\u201d said Maya Winkelstein, who served as chairwoman of the group, called the Commons. \u201cOur hope is people will print off the tool kit and bring it to their staff meetings or their board meetings or to their C.F.O. of programming.\u201dGiven the spike in philanthropic giving, the time is ripe to discuss the downsides of giving money away. A study released this week by the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy predicted that charitable giving would rise 3.6 percent this year and 3.8 percent next year, based on a strong economy.The biggest increase will come from foundations, which are often financed by wealthy individuals. Foundations will increase their giving by 5.9 percent and 6 percent in the next two years, the report predicted.But with that increase will come the need to apply business fundamentals to grant making and to look at all the potential downsides of a project. FOR the past five years, the Rockefeller Foundation has set aside contingency funding for individual initiatives and broader programs, said Judith Rodin, its president. Her foundation also assesses its grants by low, medium and high risk.\u201cOur tax-advantaged dollars create opportunities for us to take risk, but the evidence shows there isn\u2019t that much risk-taking in our sector,\u201d Dr. Rodin said. \u201cTaking smart risk is essential.\u201dThe risk management tool kit produced by the Commons covers broader areas like helping donors understand their own risk appetite with their grants, and putting together a risk policy statement similar to ones done for a portfolio of investments.But the kit also has seven items dealing with specific conversations donors ought to have with groups they are supporting. These include talking about contingency funding and planning, putting in place their own risk management strategies and monitoring the progress of the project in order to pre-empt problems.\u201cPart of the reason we focused on donors is they have the money,\u201d said Dr. Michaels, a clinical psychologist who is married to David Bonderman, a founder of the private equity firm TPG.\u201cThere\u2019s a power differential,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for a nonprofit to come to a funder and say, \u2018How are you going to insure us if something gets screwed up?\u2019\u201dLess than a year ago, Reclaim Detroit, which trains workers to salvage wood from homes slated for demolition and repurpose it, lost its warehouse to a blaze. With no wood, no equipment and no work space, it had also no plan for dealing with such a total loss and was in danger of folding.Reclaim Detroit partly supports itself through the sale of objects it makes from the reclaimed wood \u2014 something it could not do after the fire. But it also receives grants from companies like the JPMorgan Chase Foundation, the PNC Bank Foundation and others that are directed at its job training program and operational expenses.What it didn\u2019t have, though, was money to rebuild after the fire.Susan Dundon, business innovation director at EcoWorks, the nonprofit parent of Reclaim Detroit, said the group tried to raise money from the community, but then one of its program funders, REDF, directed it to Open Road Alliance, which gave $100,000 as bridge funding so the nonprofit could get running again.\u201cSome of it went for operating funds to continue to pay our crew, who was paid out of our earned revenues,\u201d Ms. Dundon said. \u201cThe main part was to rebuild our mill shop and to buy new equipment.\u201dNot everyone in the philanthropic community thinks such contingency funding is a good idea. Amir Pasic, dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, said nonprofits having to ask funders for money after a crisis can create an additional level of bureaucracy when funds are really needed.\u201cIt\u2019s getting us to continue to think about projects rather than organizations or causes,\u201d Dr. Pasic said. \u201cIt\u2019s allowing us to forget the fact that if you have a really good relationship with your funder and they know what\u2019s going on, it doesn\u2019t have to be a formal contingency plan.\u201dDr. Pasic, who was not involved with the Commons, said he saw a place for such backstop funding with smaller organizations. But in general, he said, he supported the group\u2019s conclusion that larger nonprofits and funders should plan for problems.\u201cYou need a joint conversation upfront,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to create an honest conversation between both sides so we can be productive.\u201dShelley Whelpton, managing director of Arabella Advisors, said that while the tool kit will start those conversations, it will take time to get donors to think differently. \u201cThere is culture change that needs to take place first,\u201d she said. The kit, she added, \u201cis a way to start a conversation.\u201dIN the case of SOIL, which has an annual budget of $1.3 million, Dr. Kramer said she went back to one of its longest-standing funders, the 11th Hour Project, which is backed by Wendy Schmidt, whose wealth comes from Google. Dr. Kramer said she was told the foundation had already made its grants for the year, and she was pointed toward Open Road Alliance, which issued a $100,000 grant for a new composting site.\u201cWith our other donors, I have much more of a traditional grantee relationship, where I wouldn\u2019t go back and say, \u2018I need more money for the same project,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t something I had considered before.\u201dDespite losing its dump, SOIL was lucky. Open Road Alliance gave $3 million last year, mostly in the form of small grants. But it operates by word of mouth and referral; it hopes that with the tool kit, more nonprofits will be able to talk to their donors about crises.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to get people on board saying, \u2018You\u2019re right, we could be backing up our grantees in a more comprehensive way, but where do we start?\u2019\u201d Dr. Michaels said. \u201cOne way to start is to lay out the path and say, \u2018These steps are not so difficult.\u2019 It\u2019s an attempt to make it easier for people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Insists Mexico Will Pay for Wall After U.S. Begins the Work", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As congressional Republicans on Friday discussed quickly moving ahead with plans for a southern border wall using money included in this year\u2019s spending bills, President-elect Donald J. Trump insisted that Mexico would ultimately pay for its construction.\u201cWe\u2019re going to get reimbursed,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a brief telephone interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to wait that long. But you start, and then you get reimbursed.\u201dThe congressional Republicans\u2019 talk led to speculation that Mr. Trump was retreating on his campaign promise to make Mexico pay for the wall. Mr. Trump insisted he is not.Republicans have balked at increases in domestic spending during the Obama administration and are unlikely to enthusiastically rally behind a proposal that could require billions of taxpayer dollars.Building a wall to keep out unauthorized immigrants could also face intense opposition from a bipartisan coalition in Congress that argues that a vast barrier along the border would be ineffective in stopping people who are determined to enter the country illegally and would represent a symbolic affront to the idea that the United States is a welcoming country that embraces immigration.In the interview, Mr. Trump vowed that Mexico would ultimately reimburse the United States. He said that payment would most likely emerge from his efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Mexican government.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be part of everything,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the cost of building the wall. \u201cWe are going to be making a much better deal. It\u2019s a deal that never should have been signed.\u201dBut he said that the trade negotiations would take time and that he supported the idea of using taxpayer money to begin construction of the border wall \u201cin order to speed up the process.\u201dThe full cost of a wall as described by Mr. Trump could be enormous. Attaching such a charged issue to annual, mandatory government funding measures could instigate a risky political fight. Those who want to block money for the wall by holding up the bills could find themselves accused of shutting down the government.The Government Accountability Office has estimated it could cost $6.5 million per mile to build a single-layer fence, with an additional $4.2 million per mile for roads and more fencing, according to congressional officials. Those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico.\u201cThe chairman and the committee have no interest in threatening a shutdown,\u201d said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, referring to Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the committee\u2019s new chairman.If funding for the border wall is included in spending bills this spring, it would provide money to begin construction on a barrier that was authorized by legislation passed in 2006, but was never completed.Ms. Hing said neither Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team nor Republican leaders had asked for funding to build a wall on the Mexican border.\u201cIf and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it,\u201d she said in an email on Friday.\u201cMexico will pay for the wall, believe me \u2014 100 percent \u2014 they don\u2019t know it yet, but they will pay for the wall,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re great people, and great leaders, but they will pay for the wall.\u201dIn a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump mocked news reports about the possible taxpayer funding of the border barrier, suggesting that Mexico would be forced to reimburse the American government for any costs incurred in building the wall.Vicente Fox, who was Mexico\u2019s president from 2000 until 2006, responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter message with a barrage of outraged posts that became an internet talking point on their own. In one of them, he made reference to the intelligence agency reports about Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s liaisons on Capitol Hill, said on Friday morning that members of his party in Congress were eager to get moving on construction of a border wall, even if that meant using taxpayer money to finance it.In an appearance on the CNN program \u201cNew Day,\u201d Mr. Collins said it should come as no surprise to anyone that the United States government would have to pay for building the wall. \u201cOf course, we have to pay the bills,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the wall.\u201dAs a candidate, Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico was one of his most powerful speaking points. He often used it at rallies to whip up his supporters and bolster his argument that illegal immigration was damaging the United States.His repeated pledge to make Mexico pay was in part a way to rebut one of the central criticisms of a border wall \u2014 that its cost could run into the many billions of dollars.Democrats slammed the reports that Mr. Trump would ask Congress to fund the project.\u201cIf President Trump asks Congress to approve taxpayer dollars to build a wall, which he has always said would not be paid for by U.S. taxpayers, we will carefully review the request to determine if these taxpayer dollars would be better spent on building hospitals to care for our veterans, roads and bridges to help taxpayers get to work, and for N.I.H. to find cures for cancer,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said she thought even Republicans might balk at spending what she said could be $14 billion on a wall.\u201cI think that\u2019s a heavy sell,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a tough sell for them.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Skip Votes, Delaying Confirmation of Trump Nominees", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee sought to stall the confirmations of Steven Mnuchin and Tom Price, President Trump\u2019s picks for Treasury secretary and secretary of health and human services, by refusing to attend scheduled votes on Tuesday.As Mr. Trump\u2019s dramatic firing of his acting attorney general threw the capital into tumult, Democrats on Tuesday also seized on the contentiousness to try to block Senator Jeff Sessions\u2019s nomination as attorney general because they said he was too close to Mr. Trump.In describing their tactic of boycotting the votes on nominees to Treasury and to health and human services, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said that recent news reports suggested Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Price had given false statements in their nomination hearings. He said more information was needed before making judgments about the nominees.\u201cWe have made clear that we need additional information,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, assailed the nominees for failing to be honest with the committee.\u201cThe truth matters,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what has been happening here.\u201dRepublicans expressed dismay at the delay. \u201cI think this is a completely unprecedented level of obstruction,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican from Pennsylvania.But with a Supreme Court vacancy nearing its 12-month point after a long blockade by Republicans, Democrats were not exactly feeling the heat, at least not yet.During a morning-long hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats painted Mr. Sessions as an extremist legal savant for Mr. Trump in support of right-wing ideologies, while Republicans portrayed him as a whip-smart lawyer and law-and-order prosecutor who would enforce the law as written.\u201cHow could we possibly conclude that this nominee will be independent?\u201d asked Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.She said that Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general fired late Monday, showed \u201cguts\u201d and independence in refusing to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order banning immigrants from seven largely Muslim countries.\u201cI have no confidence that Senator Sessions will do that,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said.Democrats hope to turn the tumult into a referendum on Mr. Sessions, an Alabama Republican, and whether he would have the independence to serve as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official after emerging as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers in the presidential campaign.Democrats are already calling it \u201cthe Monday night massacre\u201d after Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates, the acting attorney general, for refusing to defend his immigration order in court.Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in opening the hearing that there was still \u201cno mystery\u201d whether Mr. Sessions would be confirmed, since the Republicans hold a majority. He urged approval of Mr. Sessions as quickly as possible to restore leadership at the Justice Department.At Mr. Sessions\u2019s nomination hearing this month, Democrats challenged him repeatedly about whether he would have the independence to stand up to Mr. Trump if the president veered into legally questionable terrain. Mr. Sessions assured the lawmakers that he would be able to \u201csay no\u201d to the president and would not be a \u201cmere rubber stamp for the president.\u201dMr. Sessions said he was not involved in drafting the contentious executive order on immigration.Republicans showed no sign of breaking rank as they defended Mr. Sessions, a friend of many senators who served alongside a number of them on the committee.The hearing evolved into dueling portraits of what Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, called \u201ctwo different people.\u201dSenator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican, scoffed at the \u201cfaux outrage\u201d from Democrats who cast Ms. Yates\u2019s stance as a \u201ca Watergate-style act of political courage.\u201dDemocrats, he said, were unfairly making Mr. Sessions the target of their anger because they \u201cstill seem to be upset about the results of the election.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Synthego Raises $41 Million From Investors, Including a Top Biochemist", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The genetic engineering start-up Synthego may have been founded by two brothers with no formal background in the field. But it has won support from investors who now include one of the scientists who helped pioneer an important gene editing technique.The new financing round is meant to help Synthego expand its suite of products, which currently focuses on helping scientists in their Crispr research by providing important genetic material used in the process.But Synthego\u2019s founders, the brothers Paul and Michael Dabrowski, initially set out four years ago with a less specific goal: to help scientists better automate their research. Neither had a particular background in the field; they were engineers who previously worked at SpaceX, the private rocket company founded by Elon Musk.\u201cOur goal is, let\u2019s make it as easy to do biotech research as it is to program a computer,\u201d Paul Dabrowski said in a telephone interview.The Dabrowskis eventually began focusing on helping to improve the Crispr process by working on so-called synthetic RNA that helps speed up the technique. Mr. Dabrowski argued that Synthego\u2019s offering exceeds similar products from companies like General Electric, allowing scientists to shorten their work to a matter of days instead of weeks at a fraction of the cost.The company\u2019s efforts helped it garner support from a group of investors led by the venture firm 8VC.\u201cThe team\u2019s ability to execute on vision is truly impressive,\u201d Drew Oetting, a founding partner at 8VC, said in a statement. \u201cWe believe Synthego is positioned to push the bounds of genome engineering by providing the biotech industry with innovative solutions that make world-class research tools accessible to all scientists.\u201dSynthego also drew in Dr. Doudna, who had crossed paths with the company\u2019s head of synthetic biology at various industry conferences. According to Mr. Dabrowski, the money from her trust represents the single-biggest check from a non-institutional investor that the start-up has raised.\u201cSynthego\u2019s platform uniquely enables scientists to conduct genome engineering research in a highly efficient, affordable, and scalable way,\u201d Dr. Doudna said in a statement. \u201cThe RNA synthesis capabilities of Synthego\u2019s team represent a significant leap forward for synthetic biology.\u201dOther investors in the round include the venture firm led by the Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and previous investors Founders Fund, the firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, and Menlo Ventures.Synthego\u2019s new funds will help the company take its products to a more global customer base, as well as broaden its offerings. The longer-term goal, Mr. Dabrowski said, is to help fully automate biotech research and take care of much of the laboratory work that scientists currently handle themselves.The model is cloud technology, where companies rent out powerful remote server farms to handle their computing needs rather than rely on their own hardware.\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to do their full research workflow,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at how cloud computing developed, it used to be that every company handled their server farm.

{"Headline": "For Earned-Income Credit Filers, Refunds Will Be Later", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserMillions of families who claim certain tax credits now must wait several weeks longer to receive their federal income tax refunds because of a new law aimed at reducing fraud.The delay will affect people who claim the earned-income tax credit or the additional child tax credit, which benefit lower- and moderate-income working people.Eligibility for the earned-income credit depends on income and family size; for the 2016 tax year, married couples with two children can earn up to about $50,000 and be eligible for the credits.Typically, families claiming the credits count on getting their tax refunds as soon as possible to help pay down debt, pay bills or finance car repairs, according to a report from the Tax Policy Center. Families with children are especially vulnerable.Usually, the report said, the I.R.S. begins issuing refunds by the end of January. But with the new requirement, even someone who files as soon as tax season begins \u2014 this year, it starts on Jan. 23 \u2014 won\u2019t get their refund until mid- to late February.As a result, filers who were unaware of the delay may find themselves short of cash. \u201cThey are used to getting, and expect to get, their refunds at a certain time,\u201d said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center.Because of the delay in the refunds, Ms. Wu said, she expects there will be more demand for tax refund \u201cadvances,\u201d loans often offered by professional tax chains. As a result, she said, choosing a preparer carefully is very important, to make sure consumers aren\u2019t charged excessive fees or interest.John Breyault, vice president of public policy with the National Consumers League, said tax filers who are claiming the credits should be skeptical of preparers promising to get their refund early. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around this delay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the law.\u201dWhat\u2019s really being offered is a loan, he said, which may have unfavorable terms.Here are some questions and answers about the refund delay:Will the delay affect my entire refund, or just the part related to the credit?The law requires the I.R.S. to delay the entire refund, not just the portion related to the tax credits.Do I have to wait to file my tax return if I\u2019m claiming the credits?No. Ms. Wu said it was best to file tax returns as soon as possible to avoid extra delays from problems like incorrect math on a return. \u201cThey should still file as early as they can,\u201d she said.How can I check the status of my refund?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dow\u2019s Record Rise Sends a Former Wall Street Stock Broker Back in Time", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byI returned to January 4, 1982, the day I began my short but illuminating career as a Wall Street stockbroker.On that day, the Dow Jones, an average of 30 blue-chip stocks that are industry leaders, closed at 882.52. Not 8,000. Eight hundred.Yes, before I became a financial reporter, I was what they used to call a customer\u2019s man. That\u2019s Wall Street parlance \u2014 from the early 20th century anyway \u2014 for people who bought and sold securities for investors.A glance at the nearby photograph of my graduating class of fellow stockbrokers in late 1981 shows that \u201ccustomer\u2019s man\u201d was still a fairly accurate term even when I entered the industry. Fact is, most brokers were male.Taken on Dec. 18, 1981 at the World Trade Center headquarters of Dean Witter Reynolds, the photograph shows 59 people who had just passed their regulatory exams and training programs and were ready to become brokers. (I am seated on the floor in the front row, fifth from left.)Ten were women, or roughly 17 percent of the class. Only one was African-American.My classmates came from all over the country, but I worked in Midtown Manhattan at a big branch of Dean Witter, a 1920s-era brokerage firm whose name disappeared after being swallowed up by Morgan Stanley in 1997.I spent only two years as a customer\u2019s man, but in that short span I learned an immense amount about how the financial world works and doesn\u2019t. I witnessed both the wonders and the woes of capitalism. I saw firsthand how the stock market can create wealth and take it away.When I took my seat at Dean Witter I didn\u2019t know that United States stocks were about to take off on their longest bull run in history. It didn\u2019t happen right away, of course \u2014 by August 1982, the DJIA had fallen about 100 points from its January level. But after that, it was off to the races, churning its way to over 2,700 by 1987. My timing was pretty good.On October 19, 1987, came the scary 500-point drop. But that turned out to be a hiccup, and soon the Dow was back in positive territory. It hit the 10,000 milestone in 1999.By then, I was no longer on Wall Street. Instead, I was on the outside looking in and writing about what I saw for The New York Times. Thanks to my years as a broker, though, I understood what was going on behind the scenes and could explain it to readers. It didn\u2019t matter that my experience had come decades earlier because very little on Wall Street ever changes.Soon after Dow 10,000, the average began to stumble. In 2000, the internet bubble burst, hammering investors\u2019 portfolios; then came 9/11 and the devastating accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Adelphia. That was a chastening period.So was 2008 and 2009, when the mortgage meltdown drove the economy into the ditch and markets to steep declines. Once again, the markets rebounded.Now, with the Dow topping 20,000, it seems a worthwhile moment to compare what\u2018s happening in the economy and on Wall Street today versus when I first inhabited that planet. There are some similarities but many differences.Today, we have a president who is also pro-business. But this time interest rates are in the cellar and rising, the economy is robust and investors are tripping over themselves to buy stocks. The upside from here, therefore, seems more limited.What about the Wall Street culture? Are things different today for women than they were in the 1980s? Yes and no.As my class photo indicates, customers\u2019 women were in the minority at investment firms back then. Across the nation, Bureau of Labor Statistics show, women made up approximately 24 percent of sales representatives in the securities and financial services industry in 1983. Blacks made up 3 percent.By 1995, women accounted for one-third of securities and financial services sales representatives, BLS statistics show. African-Americans made up just 6 percent.Those figures would seem to indicate that women have made strides at infiltrating Wall Street. But whether they are truly welcomed on trading desks and in brokerage firm offices is another question entirely. I wonder, for example, if more women on Wall Street means none of them has to endure, as I did, performances by female strippers brought into the office to honor a colleague on his birthday.Ah, the good old days.The bottom line about my experience on Wall Street: I got a lot more out of it than it got out of me.Wall Street learned that I was O.K. at bringing in customers. But I wasn\u2019t much good at generating commissions. My name was usually at the bottom of my branch\u2019s monthly revenue runs.Be wary of initial public offerings of stock, often propelled by investor exuberance whipped up by sales representatives wearing rose-colored glasses.And what if a top company executive comes across as a dope or dishonest? Trust your judgment and sell the stock.These are lessons that remain useful as we look forward to Dow 30,000.Advertisement"}

Hundreds of Rohingya militants, armed mainly with knives and slingshots, killed nine police officers and seized weapons and ammunition.It was about time, Naing Lin, 28, said of the October attack near his village, Kyee Kan Pyin.\u201cThe government is torturing us,\u201d he said by phone this week. \u201cThe aim of the group is to protect our rights. That\u2019s all. They are doing what they should do.\u201dThe beginning of an armed resistance is just one of several developments that are reshaping the conflict over Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority with potentially far-reaching consequences.In addition, some analysts fear that turning the Rohingya into a transnational Muslim cause could draw foreign jihadists of varying stripes to Myanmar, adding terrorism to an already combustible mix and giving the Myanmar military a convenient excuse for a draconian response.But after decades of persecution and violence, to which the rest of the world largely responded with a shrug, some Rohingya say an armed response is overdue.\u201cThey are doing good things,\u201d Mr. Naing Lin said of the insurgents. \u201cThey are protecting our rights. If it\u2019s needed, I might join them.\u201dThe attack on the border posts in Rakhine State was a \u201cgame changer,\u201d according to the International Crisis Group report.Harakah al-Yaqin, Arabic for \u201cFaith Movement,\u201d is directed by about 20 Rohingya \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Saudi Arabia and led on the field by another 20 or so Rohingya with international training and experience in guerrilla warfare, the report said. It is well connected in Pakistan and Bangladesh and appears to be attracting financial backing from the Rohingya diaspora and major private donors in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, the report said.The militia enjoys growing support from many Rohingya in Myanmar who see it as the only alternative to government repression, the International Crisis Group said. The organization warned that a continued heavy-handed approach by the military would backfire, leading more Rohingya to back the militants and possibly inspiring foreign Islamic groups to join the conflict.This month, Malaysian authorities detained a man who the government said was an Islamic State follower heading to Myanmar to carry out attacks.\u201cAll this clearly demonstrates I.S. slowly and steadily making inroads to influence the Rohingya issue,\u201d said Rohan Gunaratna, a professor of security studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \u201cYou can even say it\u2019s an attempt to hijack the Rohingya agenda.\u201dThe government has barred journalists and aid workers from entering the conflict area, in northern Rakhine State just over the Naf River from Bangladesh, and accusations that the military is carrying out a campaign of murder, rape and arson have not been independently verified.But the reports and images of violence there have fueled the concern of other countries in the region, especially Bangladesh and Malaysia.At the same time, countries in the region are wary of escalating violence in their backyards.Bangladesh, struggling to contain the spread of Islamist extremist networks within its own borders, is concerned about the rise of an insurgency next door and the prospect of Rohingya militants using Bangladesh as a base to carry out attacks in Myanmar.Refugees fleeing the crackdown in Myanmar have been \u201cpouring over the border\u201d into makeshift settlements, said Shafqat Munir, a research fellow at the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. \u201cIf there is a risk of potentially radicalized people coming in, that presents quite a challenge.\u201dStill, in contrast to previous crises, there has been little effort to stem the flow by sending refugees back to Myanmar. About 65,000 Rohingya are believed to have arrived in Bangladesh since October, joining about a half-million already living in the refugee camps near Cox\u2019s Bazar.Islamist organizations, including the powerful Hefazat-e-Islam, organized large rallies in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, in November and December, urging the government to give the Rohingya shelter.Madrasa students have journeyed to the refugee camps from far-flung cities to help build temporary shelters. Others travel halfway across the country from Dhaka and beyond to hand small gifts of cash to the once-reviled Rohingya.Mohammad Yunus, 26, whose family fled to Bangladesh in 1992, is astonished by the change.\u201cBangladeshis once had hatred for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would call us names. They used to say we were Burmese, with a bad tone, and swear at us in different ways. But now they have the idea that we are persecuted.\u201dBangladeshi television is broadcasting sympathetic news coverage of Rohingya suffering in Myanmar, and images purported to be of atrocities carried out by the Myanmar military are circulating on social media, including on WhatsApp and Facebook.Mohammad Imam Hussein, whose mosque near the Myanmar border provides aid to hundreds of refugees, said the videos have brought the conflict home for Bangladeshis.\u201cThey\u2019re seeing with their own eyes what is happening to them,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier, there was no interaction between us, and I didn\u2019t have the same feeling. But now I have seen it with my own eyes. I have seen people being killed.\u201dThat Malaysia is taking a leading role in promoting the Rohingya cause is not entirely unexpected, given that it is the largest officially Muslim nation in Southeast Asia and that it has taken in tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees.But a rally led by Prime Minister Najib Razak in Kuala Lumpur in December to protest Myanmar\u2019s military crackdown was extraordinary in a region where leaders rarely criticize each other and countries largely mind their own business.Mr. Najib called the military campaign \u201cgenocide\u201d and called out Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate, for not doing enough to prevent the bloodshed. \u201cDoes she really have a Nobel Peace Prize?\u201d he asked.While his motives may have been less than pure \u2014 critics said he was trying to distract attention from allegations that he stole $1 billion in government funds and to rally voters in Malaysia\u2019s Muslim heartland ahead of coming elections \u2014 his voice has been strong.Malaysia, along with Saudi Arabia, is also home to Rohingya Vision, a satellite broadcaster and advocacy group that has helped circulate videos and news from Rakhine State.Muhammad Noor, its Saudi-born managing director, says the station has 30 paid citizen journalists in Myanmar and is financed by Rohingya donors from across Southeast Asia and the Middle East. He says the station reaches at least 150,000 viewers with its app, social media channels and websites in English, Arabic and Burmese.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to tell the story to the world that the amount of persecution is in a very extreme level,\u201d he said.Another Malaysian group, the Malaysian Consultative Council for Islamic Organization, is trying to organize an aid flotilla along the lines of the ill-fated one that tried to break an Israeli blockade of Gaza in 2010. The group, hoping to draw attention to the Rohingyas\u2019 plight, says it will set sail early next month.Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, a Rohingya rights organization, says that increased international attention may attract extremists but could also pressure the government to seek a long-term solution.\u201cWithout pressure,\u201d she said, \u201cnothing will happen.\u201dRichard C. Paddock reported from Bangkok; Ellen Barry from Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh; and Mike Ives from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "How Do You Sell a Work of Art Built Into the Earth?", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byRather than using chisels, mallets or welding torches, sculptors rented bulldozers, front-end loaders, backhoes and other heavy-duty vehicles to excavate and construct these behemoths. And they found patrons to subsidize them.The original earthworks were never meant to be sold like paintings or statues. That was partly in keeping with the hippie, yippie tenor of the times. They have never come up for auction, although one sculpture fetched as high as $4 million in 2008.Mr. de Boer told me he was contemplating the sale of his quarry business, along with the lake and surrounding property on which Smithson constructed \u201cBroken Circle/Spiral Hill.\u201d Since his own childhood home, now a mini-museum devoted to Smithson\u2019s earthwork, is still there, too, Mr. de Boer pictured the property possibly becoming an artist\u2019s retreat in the hands of a new custodian.To get to Emmen from Amsterdam, you change trains twice. The trip generally takes two and a half to three hours.Smithson constructed his earthwork at the invitation of Sonsbeek \u201971, a major outdoor sculpture exhibition. According to a news release from that year discovered in an archive in Amsterdam, \u201c\u2018Broken Circle/Spiral Hill\u2019 was originally commissioned as a temporary public artwork.\u201d At the time, \u201cNo (written) agreements were made concerning the ownership and future maintenance of the work.\u201dInstead of installing art in a park designed during the 18th century, the organizers invited participants to make large constructions in places outside Arnhem, which is about 60 miles from Amsterdam. Smithson applauded the idea of making something that was not a pastoral setting.\u201cIn a sense, a park is already a work of art,\u201d Smithson once explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a circumscribed area of land that already has a kind of cultivation involved in it.\u201dAt 6-foot-3 and often dressed all in black like a character in the B-movies he watched on West 42nd Street, Smithson cut a striking figure. His prescription aviator glasses, slicked-back brown hair, blue-gray eyes and pockmarked skin completed the persona he projected. Initially, he envisioned executing a \u201cpour piece,\u201d which involved having a dump truck pull up to the edge of a hill and release wet concrete or asphalt that would erratically stream down the incline. Once completed, these works resembled viscous interpretations of segments of the Great Falls of the Passaic River in Paterson, N.J. But Smithson, who was born in Passaic in 1938 and raised in Rutherford and Clifton, soon learned that there wasn\u2019t a site high enough in the Netherlands to execute this project properly.Sjouke Zijlstra, a geographer who ran a cultural center in Emmen, told Smithson, who was 33 at the time, about a sand quarry on a lake featuring green \u2014 mineral-enriched \u2014 water. Smithson had enjoyed working in quarries in the Garden State. Now, in Emmen, he could develop on a smaller scale some ideas that related to \u201cSpiral Jetty.\u201dAnd so Mr. de Boer, the current owner of Zand-en Exploitatie-Mij, the sand quarry, recently recalled how, when he was nearly six years old, Smithson \u201cliterally knocked on our door and asked my father if he could get permission to build an artwork in the quarry.\u201d Though his father wasn\u2019t interested in art, he immediately said yes. Smithson and his wife, the land-art sculptor Nancy Holt, were about the same age as Mr. de Boer\u2019s parents; and, according to Mr. de Boer, the two couples bonded immediately.Two weeks later, using Mr. de Boer\u2019s father\u2019s work force as well as his equipment, \u201cBroken Circle/Spiral Hill\u201d was completed. (Mr. de Boer\u2019s father provided everything to Smithson gratis.) \u201cBroken Circle\u201d combines a jetty with a canal and has a boulder in its center; \u201cSpiral Hill,\u201d carpeted with cotoneaster, a dense green plant, since 1972, was originally composed of black dirt with white sand paths. The section in the water is a centrifugal image; the path of its earthbound companion is centripetal.Unlike his colleagues, Smithson accompanied his earthworks with films, which made them accessible to people who couldn\u2019t travel to see them. But his death at age 35 in a plane crash in 1973 prevented the completion of the film of \u201cBroken Circle/Spiral Hill\u201d until 2011. In it, we learn how Smithson\u2019s artwork relates to both the prehistoric past as well as more recent times. The video opens with a sequence revealing a group of boulders that were transported by glaciers to their present locations during the ice age.In the narration, Smithson mentions, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in excavation,\u201d an operation that sets what he did apart from Mr. Heizer, who displaced 240,000 tons of rhyolite and sandstone when he created \u201cDouble Negative.\u201d It is so long and deep it could hold the Empire State Building on its side. Using draglines, Smithson \u201ccarved,\u201d as he put it, an earthwork \u201cout of a blunt peninsula in front of a boulder.\u201d After creating dikes, he flooded them. He wanted the water coursing through the openings to evoke the great North Sea flood of 1953 that devastated Holland, causing nearly 2,000 deaths and the evacuation of 70,000 people, and inundating 340,000 acres.\u201cBetween violence and calm is lucid understanding and perception,\u201d Smithson also said in Arts magazine in 1971. \u201cWhat goes on between the raging flood and the peaceful pond? I hope to make that an aspect of the film on \u2018Broken Circle/Spiral Hill.\u2019\u201dWith sequences shot from helicopters, Smithson also wanted people to be able to experience his art differently than if it were seen in person. In the video related to \u201cBroken Circle/Spiral Hill,\u201d Smithson runs on his earthworks while he\u2019s filmed from a distance. The painter Dorothea Rockburne recently recalled how her friend Smithson had admired the scene in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cNorth by Northwest\u201d where Cary Grant is buzzed by a crop duster in a cornfield.For an institution, the weather presents a problem. Many of Mr. Heizer\u2019s earliest works, for example, no longer exist. As for \u201cSpiral Jetty,\u201d for years, there was so much rain and runoff from snow in the mountains, the 1,500-foot coil of basalt rock and rock crystals was submerged. Then, for a while, it returned to optimum conditions. Because of a drought on the West Coast, the lake receded two years ago. Now you walk beside the earthwork rather than on top of it.Who could possibly become the guardians of \u201cBroken Circle/Spiral Hill\u201d? Dia has been mentioned. Melissa Parsoff, the spokeswoman for the foundation, said no talks had taken place. Jessica Morgan, its director, thinks it would be a good idea. And then there\u2019s the government of the Netherlands, which has a remarkable record for supporting the arts. It would be quite a coup to add this enchanting earthwork to the list of cultural properties it manages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hands Off the Consumer Finance Bureau", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byEditorialThis time around, however, Republican foes of the bureau are assuming they have a willing ally in the White House. While Mr. Trump has not fully disabused them of that notion, he has sent them a \u201cnot so fast\u201d signal: Last week, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters that \u201cno decision has been made at this time\u201d about Mr. Cordray\u2019s position.Mr. Trump would be smart to go against lawmakers and let Mr. Cordray serve out his term. That would be the right thing to do and consistent with his campaign promises to defend Americans against a system he says has \u201crobbed our working class.\u201dThe consumer bureau is the only federal agency with the sole mission of looking out for the interests of ordinary Americans in their dealings with banks and other lenders. Its investigations and enforcement actions have yielded fines and settlements that have returned nearly $12 billion to millions of Americans in the past five years \u2014 money that otherwise would have enriched lenders through high and hidden fees on bank accounts and credit cards, predatory mortgages, deceptive terms in student loans, illegal debt collection from military service members and unfair auto loans.But in the case of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a three-judge panel ruled 2 to 1 that limiting the president\u2019s power to remove the director made the position too powerful and thus breached the constitutional separation-of-powers doctrine. As a remedy, the judges ruled that the director must be removable at the president\u2019s will.That remedy, however, will only take effect if the ruling is upheld by the full Court of Appeals or if the full court declines the bureau\u2019s petition for a rehearing. If Mr. Trump were to fire Mr. Cordray now before the full court acted, the move would be needlessly antagonistic, probably illegal and likely to end up in the courts if Mr. Cordray challenged his removal.Even if the ruling were upheld, Mr. Trump would do well to let Mr. Cordray finish his term. After all, he has done a very good job protecting ordinary people from the powerful elites Mr. Trump spent much of his campaign raging against.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kroc\u2019s Giving, Like McDonald\u2019s Meals, Was Fast and Super-Sized", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersTHIS is a story of a twice-divorced businessman and his beautiful third wife.He is a man with a string of business failures to his name until he latches on to someone\u2019s else\u2019s idea and makes it a hit. He is a man who wiggles out of contracts, does anything to win and rewrites history to suit him.Eventually, his fortune is made by making his business synonymous with a now-famous last name that he unabashedly promotes far and wide. It just wasn\u2019t his last name.When it comes to their wealth and how they thought about it, the book\u2019s subtitle encapsulates the Kroc approach.Both the book and the film provide insight into the inner, overlooked \u2014 and sometimes mocked \u2014 lives of the mega-affluent. It is true for many self-made millionaires who becoming wealthy entails a good bit of luck and requires a myopic focus \u2014 often at the sacrifice of everything else. And then comes the question: What you do with all that money when you could never spend it all?How did the Krocs amass their fortune? First, the rise up the mountain. Mr. Kroc wasn\u2019t a failed salesman so much as one who had not hit on a huge idea. Indeed, he was selling milkshake mixers when he came across the McDonald brothers and their assembly-line system of serving burgers, fries and drinks at their walk-up stand in San Bernardino, Calif.Mr. Kroc saw the franchise potential in what the brothers had created. He pulled them along, often reluctantly, until he found a way to buy them out and make what they had created seem like it had been his all along.\u201cWhen\u2019s enough going to be enough for you?\u201d his first wife, Ethel, asks him in the film.\u201cHonestly, probably never,\u201d Mr. Kroc replies.What motivated him was more complex than money. It was a desire to build something revolutionary, which, for good or bad, is represented by McDonald\u2019s.\u201cHe was a man in his 50s in the 1950s when his contemporaries were looking for a soft landing, and he had yet to ring the bell,\u201d said John Lee Hancock, the film\u2019s director. \u201cHe felt he was owed. When he saw it, he knew it.\u201dMr. Kroc, as described in the film and the book, was a man with an entrepreneur\u2019s tireless energy.\u201cHe realized it was really about boots on the ground and owner-operators and being out there at night picking gum off the parking lot,\u201d Mr. Hancock said.But as the years passed, Mr. Kroc seemed to convince himself that he alone had started McDonald\u2019s. To him, the start of the company was the first restaurant he opened, in 1954, in Des Plaines, Ill., not the stand the brothers created in 1940. The more he told the story, the more he seemed to believe it.There was no question that Mr. Kroc was committed to the business. He mortgaged and nearly lost his home when the franchising payments he negotiated with the brothers were not enough to pay for his expenses as he traveled to expand the brand.When the company went public in 1965, he became a multimillionaire and ultimately a billionaire. Yet he still had the same entrepreneurial drive to extend the McDonald\u2019s brand as far as it could go.The picture that emerges of his third wife, Joan, is different. If you discount her leaving her first husband, a McDonald\u2019s franchisee, for the richer Mr. Kroc, she lived a life of decorum and public service.How she spent down that mountain Mr. Kroc had built was far more haphazard.Her giving started the way it does for many philanthropists, with an issue close to her heart: alcoholism and its impact on families. Mr. Kroc drank the cheap Early Times whiskey, regularly and steadily. Fueled by it, he could be irascible.But as Mrs. Kroc gave more money to finance research, make films about the effects of the disease and push for changes in medical school curriculums, she did not let on that Mr. Kroc was himself an alcoholic. Secrecy was a hallmark of her giving.When a flood wiped out parts of the area in South Dakota in 1972 where she had lived with her first husband, she gave $50,000 on the condition that her name not be linked to the gift. It led to decades of giving to organizations and people who came to her attention.Mrs. Kroc was more hands-on than most.\u201cShe preferred to toss money at a cause or concern that piqued her interest,\u201d Ms. Napoli wrote. \u201cWhat kind of impact the gift would have generally seemed less important than the investment itself \u2014 her trust in the act of giving.\u201dYet she had a sense that she still wasn\u2019t doing enough and was determined to find the causes that moved her. She was not one to sit back and read grant proposals. \u201cMost knew not to bother asking\u201d for a donation, Ms. Napoli writes. \u201cIf they did, they\u2019d be denied.\u201dBut much of the last rush of giving, the $2.7 billion that was dispensed through her estate, came together when she was told she had brain cancer and would not live longer than a few months.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like she made a Christmas list,\u201d said Ms. Napoli, a former technology reporter for The New York Times.\u201cYou give $1.5 billon to the Salvation Army. But then, oops, here\u2019s this $225 million in a charitable remainder trust the girls didn\u2019t want,\u201d Ms. Napoli said, referring to Mrs. Kroc and her four granddaughters.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like she said I love N.P.R. and I\u2019m going to give them all my money. It\u2019s more fantastic that she had no connection,\u201d she said.In her giving, Mrs. Kroc was unlike today\u2019s billionaires, assiduously planning and tracking their largess for perpetuity.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t thinking about her legacy,\u201d Ms. Napoli said. \u201cShe just wanted it gone instead of thinking about the hassle. I love what Gates and Buffett have done with the Giving Pledge, but she did the same thing without making a big deal about it.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Early \u2018Jersey Boys\u2019 Investors, Oh, What a Run", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 A local dentist put in $12,500. A venture capitalist was good for $1.4 million. There were a literary agent, a psychotherapist and a smattering of doctors, lawyers and academics, all investing together in a promising musical at their hometown theater that was seeking a shot at Broadway.That small posse from San Diego ended up pooling a significant portion of the $7.8 million necessary to deliver one of the most popular Broadway musicals in recent decades, \u201cJersey Boys.\u201dAnd these novices did something that most theater investors never do: Made big money. Roughly three out of four Broadway shows fail financially, even though many of them are backed by entertainment industry pros.\u201cI know every line of the show, and for a certain period of time, everything that would happen would remind me of a line in the show,\u201d said Kevin Kinsella, the San Diego venture capitalist who became the largest individual investor in \u201cJersey Boys,\u201d a jukebox biomusical that tells the story of the Four Seasons, the 1960s pop band fronted by Frankie Valli. Mr. Kinsella had never invested in Broadway, but had a personal interest: His father, Walter A. Kinsella, played the bugle in a 1924 Broadway play, \u201cWhat Price Glory,\u201d and went on to act in others.Many of the investors put money not only into the Broadway show but also into subsequent productions, rolling a portion of their profits from one production into the next and making it difficult to estimate with any precision how much they ultimately made.Dr. Richard Harmetz, the dentist who started with a $12,500 investment and continued to put money into subsequent productions, estimated his profit at $250,000 to $300,000. Edward and Martha Dennis, a biochemistry professor and venture capitalist who started with a $10,000 investment, estimated a similar return.\u201cWhen we tell people we\u2019ve made 22 times our investment, their eyes get big, like they did with tech investing,\u201d Ms. Dennis said. \u201cThey have to lose four or five small investments before they realize it\u2019s not so easy. \u2018Jersey Boys\u2019 is such a unicorn.\u201d\u201cJersey Boys\u201d is in some ways an example of how Broadway shows are financed: The industry is rooted in New York, but many plays and musicals have financial backers who live around the world \u2014 theater enthusiasts with an appetite for risk and a taste for show business.But \u201cJersey Boys\u201d stands out for the size of its success and the concentration of its support in an affluent village, La Jolla, that is about as far from the Garden State Parkway as one can get in the mainland United States. It appears that as much as 40 percent of the show\u2019s financing was raised in San Diego \u2014 almost all of it from people who had never previously invested in a Broadway show, and who encountered this one as patrons at the La Jolla Playhouse, where the musical was enormously popular and repeatedly extended.For the investors, the experience was transformative, and not just because it generated a nice profit.Many have traveled around the world to see productions of the show. The Dennises took 40 people from Mr. Dennis\u2019s Yale alumni class to see the show in London. Marsi and Eric Gardiner moved to New York and show up every year at a party for the anniversary of opening night. Several investors will be at the final show this weekend.Those who have gone on to back other Broadway shows have learned the hard way that \u201cJersey Boys\u201d was a rare exception. Mr. Kinsella sank $750,000 in a revival of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d which closed at a total loss three months after opening, and many others had similar experiences.\u201cWe got a little overconfident,\u201d said Margret McBride, a literary agent who invested in \u201cJersey Boys\u201d with her husband, Nevins, and then in a play that flopped. And Wanda Garner, a psychotherapist who invested in \u201cJersey Boys\u201d with her husband, Cam, offered this bit of advice to would-be Broadway backers: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to put your money down, you better be able to lose it all.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m done for a while \u2014 I\u2019m taking a rest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does show you how much of a crapshoot this thing is.\u201dDespite the odds of failure, a few of the San Diegans have become Broadway regulars.The Gardiners, for example, have supported a half-dozen shows, even decorating their home with Playbills. Some of their picks have flopped, including \u201cGigi\u201d and \u201cAllegiance,\u201d but they love supporting the art form and getting to know the players, and they were among the early producers of one of this season\u2019s most acclaimed new musicals, \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d which is shaping up to be a hit. \u201cBroadway is my passion and my hobby,\u201d Mr. Gardiner, who works in financial services, said. \u201cI\u2019m really into stories.\u201dThe individual investors, meanwhile, are philosophical as the show\u2019s Broadway run comes to a close. Dr. Harmetz, who invested $12,500 on his own behalf, as well as $12,500 for his mother, which helped finance her end-of-life care, cherishes the framed Playbills and tickets and press clips he has saved from opening-night performances of \u201cJersey Boys\u201d in New York, London and Las Vegas. He said the show had changed his life in small ways \u2014 he and his wife go to the theater more often, in San Diego and New York, and donate more to the arts. And when they go out to dinner, he said, \u201cMy wife will look at the menu, and I\u2019ll say: \u2018Pat, what are you worried about? We\u2019re Broadway producers!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Law Repeal Could Cost 18 Million Their Insurance, Study Finds", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Eighteen million people could lose their insurance within a year and individual insurance premiums would shoot upward if Congress repealed major provisions of the Affordable Care Act while leaving other parts in place, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said on Tuesday.A report by the office sharply increases pressure on Republicans to come up with a comprehensive plan to replace the health care law. It is likely to doom the idea of voting to dismantle the 2010 health law almost immediately, with an effective date set sometime in the future while Congress works toward a replacement.If nothing followed the gutting of President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, the budget office said, 32 million people could lose their health insurance by 2026, and premiums in the individual insurance market could double. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, showed the unease of some in her party when she said that repealing the health care law and delaying a replacement could send insurance markets into \u201ca death spiral.\u201dShe detected \u201ca growing consensus among members of both the Senate and the House that we must fix Obamacare and provide reforms at nearly the same time that we repeal the law,\u201d she said on the Senate floor on Tuesday.The new budget office report, issued after a weekend of protests against repeal, will only add to the headaches that President-elect Donald J. Trump and congressional Republicans face in their rush to take apart Mr. Obama\u2019s health law as they try to replace it with a health insurance law more to their liking.Republicans cautioned that the report painted only part of the picture \u2014 the impact of a fast repeal without a Republican replacement. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said the numbers represented \u201ca one-sided hypothetical scenario.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s report shows only part of the equation \u2014 a repeal of Obamacare without any transitional policies or reforms to address costs and empower patients,\u201d he said. \u201cRepublicans support repealing Obamacare and implementing step-by-step reforms so that Americans have access to affordable health care.\u201dBut Republicans have yet to agree on a replacement bill, and existing Republican plans, like one drafted by Representative Tom Price of Georgia, who was selected as Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of health and human services, have yet to be scrutinized by the budget office. The office provides Congress with the official projections of legislative costs and impact that lawmakers use to formulate policy.\u201cNo wonder President-elect Trump realizes that repeal without replace is the real disaster,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cNo wonder he has admonished the Congress not to do plain repeal.\u201dRepublicans now have two powerful reasons to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d together: They hope to protect about 20 million Americans who have gained coverage under the law. And they want a politically acceptable judgment from the Congressional Budget Office on the effects of their alternative.Republican congressional leaders are trying to put together a plan that could pass muster with the Trump team and also win approval in the Senate under fast-track procedures that would neutralize the threat of a Democratic filibuster.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, met last week with Mr. Price to hash out alternatives, and they have been in close contact with the relevant committee leaders and staff members to begin hammering out ideas that could come into relief at the end of the month, when Republicans have their annual policy retreat.Stephen Miller, a former Senate press aide and the incoming senior White House adviser for policy, who has been particularly aggressive in presenting himself as the voice of Mr. Trump on all policy matters, has pushed the notion that a plan should move quickly and in tandem with a replacement measure, rather than in a series of smaller bills, congressional aides said.The repeal legislation analyzed by the budget office would have eliminated tax penalties for people who go without insurance. It would also have eliminated spending for the expansion of Medicaid and subsidies that help lower-income people buy private insurance. But the bill preserved requirements for insurers to provide coverage, at standard rates, to any applicant, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions.\u201cEliminating the mandate penalties and the subsidies while retaining the market reforms would destabilize the nongroup market, and the effect would worsen over time,\u201d the budget office said.The office said the estimated increase of 32 million people without coverage by 2026 resulted from three changes: About 23 million fewer people would have coverage in the individual insurance market. Roughly 19 million fewer people would have Medicaid coverage. And there would be an increase in the number of people with employment-based insurance that would partially offset those losses.The estimates by the budget office are generally consistent with projections by the Obama administration and by insurance companies.In its report, the budget office said that repealing selected parts of the health care law \u2014 as specified in the earlier Republican bill \u2014 would have adverse effects on insurance markets.In the first full year after the enactment of such a bill, the office said, premiums would be 20 percent to 25 percent higher than under current law.Repealing the penalties that enforce the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d would \u201cboth reduce the number of people purchasing health insurance and change the mix of people with insurance,\u201d as younger and healthier people with low health costs would be more likely to go without insurance, the budget office said.The Republican bill would have eliminated the expansion of Medicaid eligibility and the subsidies for insurance purchased through Affordable Care Act marketplaces, after a transition period of about two years.Those changes could have immediately increased the number of uninsured by 27 million, a number that would gradually increase to 32 million in 2026, the budget office said.Without subsidies, the budget office said, enrollment in health plans would shrink, and the people who remained in the individual insurance market would be sicker, with higher average health costs. These trends, it said, would accelerate the exodus of insurers from the individual market and from the public marketplaces.As a result, it said, about half of the nation\u2019s population would be living in areas that had no insurer participating in the individual market in the first year after the repeal of marketplace subsidies took effect. And by 2026, it estimated, about three-quarters of the population would be living in such areas.While writing the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010, lawmakers continually consulted the Congressional Budget Office to understand the possible effects on spending, revenue and insurance coverage. The current director of the budget office, Keith Hall, who signed the report issued on Tuesday, was selected and appointed by Republican leaders of Congress in 2015.The latest report was requested by Mr. Schumer and two other Democrats, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Patty Murray of Washington.Jennifer Steinhauer and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mubi: A Streaming Service With a Ticking Clock", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byStreamingSpeaking as a user, I consider it an interesting, compelling and sometimes maddening strategy. Recently, while browsing the site\u2019s \u201cNow Showing\u201d page, I spotted a Russian science-fiction film from 2011, \u201cTarget,\u201d directed by Alexander Zeldovich. I saw a screening of it a couple of years ago and have wanted to revisit it ever since. The left-hand corner of the screen read \u201c6 Days Left.\u201d (It\u2019s off the site now, as you read this.) There\u2019s something about that ticking clock that produces anxiety.On the other hand, the diversity and the quality of the selections are exhilarating. Mubi is one of several first-rate sites that cater to cinephiles, and its mix of current and vintage films, the global scope of the selections, and the truly eclectic array of genres is great. (There are films from Australia, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, Israel, Italy and Britain as I write, and none from Senegal, Mali and Morocco, but there have been, and I\u2019m sure there will be others.) You could watch one movie a day and never feel aesthetically pigeonholed.Mubi started about 10 years ago under the name the Auteurs. It ran a small number of films and had a feisty editorial section called (then and now) the Notebook, which I know a bit about because I was one of its early regular contributors. Its social network component was vibrant, but its identity as a film provider in those early days struck me as a little murky. The site was founded by Efe Cakarel, a voluble entrepreneur who, in a recent phone conversation, described the process that led to Mubi\u2019s way of doing things. \u201cIn the beginning, we wanted to be like Netflix, but the unit economies of an \u2018all-you-can-eat\u2019 site is very capital intensive,\u201d Mr. Cakarel said. \u201cThe question becomes, how do you create a compelling experience? If you can\u2019t get 10,000 titles, how about a limited selection?\u201d\u201cAlthough we started as an online site, we have a consistent belief in cinema as a theatrical experience \u2014 films should be seen on a big screen \u2014 so this was a culmination of an ambition,\u201d Mr. Cakarel explained.A few years ago at the Cannes Film Festival, I was having a conversation with a revered veteran French film critic about a movie that had just screened, one that he jocularly wrote off as \u201ca film festival film \u2014 financed with festival money, aimed at festival audiences; no couple living on the Upper West Side is going to say, \u2018Let\u2019s see this film\u2019 on any weekend night.\u201d While I don\u2019t personally include a film such as \u201cBaden Baden\u201d in the category he so disdained, it is true that a lot of movies that do well with festival audiences don\u2019t get far enough out into the marketplace to even start to find a broader audience.Which is where Mubi hopes to offer something: Mr. Cakarel says he\u2019s going into the festival season this year with substantially more money than last year. As for \u201cBaden Baden,\u201d he says it will be available after its Mubi run, on different platforms.\u201cWhen some great film premieres at Cannes, and the rights are bought piecemeal, what typically happens is that after a theatrical run, the movie enters a transactional window \u2014 iTunes, DVD, Blu-ray and so on \u2014 and then a pay TV window, where it will stay exclusively for about 18 months,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring that time, Netflix, with all the money in the world, won\u2019t be able to stream that film. The only way to break this up is to get all the rights to the film, even to go into production.\u201d Netflix and Amazon have made strong impressions in film production, and Mr. Cakarel expressed an ambition to do the same.In February, Mubi will start a \u201cDiscoveries\u201d program, which, as its title implies, focuses on new films that have impressed its programmers at film festivals; it kicks off with \u201cLe Parc,\u201d directed by Damien Manivel, a surreal animated date movie. One film it has in the series for April is a short by the acclaimed French director Bertrand Bonello. Its next theatrical release, slated for spring, is \u201cThe Happiest Day in the Life of Olli M\u00e4ki,\u201d a boxing movie directed by Juho Kuosmanen, about a real-life Finnish fighter and his 1962 world featherweight championship match against the American Davey Moore. (Yes, that\u2019s the same Davey Moore who in 1963, a year after the events of the film, inspired songs by both Phil Ochs and Bob Dylan.)I mentioned to Mr. Cakarel that his approach to brand identity reminded me of certain record labels of the 1970s, specifically Island, which had an eclectic roster of artists and put out products of such consistent quality across the board that even if you bought one of its records without having heard a note of it, you were still likely to have gotten something interesting. He laughed. \u201cI was at a dinner last week where I met [the Island Records founder] Chris Blackwell, and he told me that Mubi reminded him of what he had tried to do with the label.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But a word of warning to the president-elect: This one could be different.When Paula Jones sued Bill Clinton, powerful conservative backers bankrolled and pressed her case until the sitting president of the United States was deposed under oath \u2014 and fatefully denied having sexual relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky. The result: the first and only impeachment of an elected president.Ms. Zervos could well have the same kind of political muscle behind her \u2014 from the left.A CNN-ORC poll on Tuesday also put Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating at 40 percent, \u201cthe lowest of any recent president and 44 points below that of President Barack Obama, the 44th president.\u201dNo doubt, many people from both sides of the Trumpian divide will sympathize with his antipathy for pre-election polling \u2014 although Hillary Clinton\u2019s two-percentage point win in the popular vote was about in line with national polling. The postelection polls are well outside the margin of sampling error in their comparisons to other presidents.Mr. Trump consoled himself with all the buses and airplanes heading to Washington this week for the inauguration weekend.Unmentioned: More than 200,000 of those people are going to protest the 45th president. Bikers for Trump has vowed to defend him.While on Twitter, the president-elect decided to again go after Mr. Lewis, Democrat of Georgia \u2014 even though last week\u2019s Twitter confrontation is still reverberating among African-Americans and beyond.It is, in fact, true that Mr. Lewis, a civil rights icon who had his skull cracked in Selma, Ala., questioned the legitimacy of President Bush, the last president elected despite losing the popular vote.It is also true that Mr. Lewis is just not someone easily attacked by either political party.The top Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have sent Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama a letter with two pointed questions: If confirmed as attorney general, will you commit to not shutting down any F.B.I. or Justice Department investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election? And will you recuse yourself from involvement in those investigations?Since his appearance before the committee, Democrats have made clear they do not trust that an Attorney General Sessions would be an independent law enforcement officer when it comes to the man he loyally backed for president, who then picked him to be the highest law enforcement official in the land.The painting, which had won its spot in a student art contest, was an abstract depiction of a conflict between the police and residents of St. Louis.The painting had been taken down a few times by Republican lawmakers and left at the office of Representative William Lacy Clay, Democrat of Missouri, who sponsored the piece, before finally appealing to the architect\u2019s office, which oversees the contest, in which student artwork is chosen to hang in a well-traveled hall between the Cannon House Office Building and the Capitol. The architect wrote a letter on Tuesday suggesting that the painting broke contest rules by being too political.\u201cBy his unprecedented and unconstitutional action, following criticism of the artwork by Speaker Ryan and several G.O.P. Members, the Architect of the Capitol acted to suppress the free speech rights of my constituent,\u201d Mr. Clay said, adding that he plans to seek reversal of the architect\u2019s determination.The architect\u2019s office, as is their wont, did not return emails requesting comment.In the new Golf Digest, the Trumps have a magazine cover that rises above the kibitzing.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, called for an investigation. \u201cThis new report makes clear that this isn\u2019t just a couple of questionable trades, but rather a clear and troubling pattern of Congressman Price trading stock and using his office to benefit the companies in which he is investing,\u201d he said.There may be no time for that. But Mr. Price\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings this week before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee, already set to be contentious, what with Medicare and the Affordable Care Act being hot topics, now promise to be scorching.For much of Tuesday, Democratic members of Congress have been proclaiming on social media that no, they will not be attending Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.And this flurry from the head of the Congressional Black Caucus:It is not unusual for members of Congress to skip the festivities, held outdoors on the steps of the Capitol in January. (This year, the weather forecast is for unseasonably warm temperatures, but rain.) What is unusual is the number proclaiming their truancy. If unity is what he wants, Mr. Trump has his work cut out for him.It may be one of the most contentious of the confirmation hearings.President-elect Trump \u2014 not exactly known for his piety \u2014 will be sworn in as the 45th president with not one Bible but two \u2014 the one that Abraham Lincoln used at his first inauguration and his own personal Good Book.Thomas Barrack Jr., who is leading the inaugural committee, said in a statement:In his first inaugural address, President Lincoln appealed to the \u2018better angels of our nature.\u2019 As he takes the same oath of office 156 years later, President-elect Trump is humbled to place his hand on Bibles that hold special meaning both to his family and to our country.Mr. Trump\u2019s Bible was apparently presented to him by his mother upon his graduation from the Sunday Church Primary School at First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, on Children\u2019s Day, June 12, 1955.The late-day confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, a billionaire and Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary, is expected to feature fierce questioning from Democrats over her still-incomplete ethics form.Ms. DeVos, the heiress to an automotive fortune who married into the even more vast fortune of the family that owns Amway, is one of few nominees to go before a Senate panel before completing an ethics questionnaire for the independent Office of Government Ethics addressing her financial holdings. According to prepared remarks, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, will say:I am going to want to learn more about your extensive financial entanglements and potential conflicts of interest. As a billionaire with hundreds, if not thousands, of investments made through complex financial instruments \u2014 many of which are made in ways that are not transparent and hard to track \u2014 you need to make it very clear how you will be avoiding conflicts of interest should you be confirmed. That goes for your investments, as well as the massive web of investments made by your immediate family.Mr. Trump had already upended Republican plans to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act, then replace it several years down the road, by demanding that a new health care law be ready within weeks.Now he is vexing them on taxes. Mr. Trump campaigned hard on a proposal to impose a 35 percent tariff on goods built by American companies abroad, then imported into the United States. Since Republicans are generally opposed to huge tax increases on corporations, congressional leaders had come up with an alternative: \u201cborder adjustment,\u201d under which companies would no longer be able to deduct the cost of goods they import from their taxes or exclude the revenue from exports when calculating taxable income. That would encourage companies to buy parts and materials from American suppliers.\u201cAnytime I hear border adjustment, I don\u2019t love it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBecause usually it means we\u2019re going to get adjusted into a bad deal. That\u2019s what happens.\u201dHe\u2019s not making it easy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The End of the World? In Brazil, It\u2019s Already Here", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 The end of the world has already arrived in Brazil.The government isn\u2019t backing down. The \u201cend of the world\u201d amendment is just one of many neoliberal measures being pushed through by Michel Temer, the president. It should be cause for concern that Mr. Temer can undertake so many such reforms, especially considering most of them, including the budget cap, go against the agenda of the person who \u2014 unlike Mr. Temer \u2014 was actually elected president.Mr. Alston added that the law would place Brazil in a \u201csocially retrogressive category all of its own.\u201d Which seems exactly where Mr. Temer and his allies want us to be.In addition to the spending cap, Mr. Temer has introduced a proposal to revamp Brazil\u2019s pension system. His proposal will set a minimum retirement age of 65, in a country where the average person retires at 54. The law will also require at least 25 years of contributions to the social security system by both men and women.Some of Mr. Temer\u2019s economic plans don\u2019t even have to do with the budget deficit. Also last month, shortly after the budget cap passed, the government proposed a labor bill that would allow deals between employers and trade unions to prevail over the labor laws. The new proposal also increases the maximum permitted working hours to 12 per day and reduces regulations on the employment of temporary workers. The business community has praised the plan. Labor unions are enraged.Given all of this, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that the Temer administration is deeply unpopular: a poll in December found that 51 percent of Brazilians rated it \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cterrible.\u201d (Only 10 percent of respondents said they approve of the government. Thirty-four percent called it \u201cregular.\u201d) Mr. Temer, who took power thanks to Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment, has also been found guilty of violating campaign finance limits and has been named in one of the many corruption scandals unfolding in the country.Nevertheless, the new government has already received full support from the following organizations: Brazilian Federation of Banks, the Agricultural Parliamentary Front, National Confederation of Industry, the World Trade Organization, the Federation of Industries of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Federation of Industries of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian Chamber of Construction Industry, National Federation of Motor Vehicle Distributors and several top executives.For some Brazilians, at least, the end of the world is the beginning of a golden opportunity.Vanessa Barbara is a columnist for the Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, the editor of the literary website A Hortali\u00e7a and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

(It had only 299 before a balcony was added.) And, among a collection of theaters that are mostly in the Beaux-Arts and classical styles, it is the rare Times Square playhouse in the neo-Colonial design.Now, Second Stage Theater, a nonprofit organization that has been presenting plays Off Broadway for nearly four decades, is in the midst of a top-to-bottom renovation of the building, which it purchased in 2015 and intends to use to present new Broadway plays and musicals.In the process, the theater company, which focuses on work by living American writers, is trying to figure out how best to use interior design to signal the organization\u2019s decidedly contemporary bent in a decidedly noncontemporary building.\u201cWe want it to look as modern as possible, but we have to honor the landmark element of it,\u201d said Casey Reitz, the executive director of Second Stage.The project\u2019s architect, David Rockwell, believes he has found a solution: He is planning to cover the theater\u2019s interior with a newfangled tribute to a set of tapestry reproductions that once adorned the walls. The original artworks, chosen by the building\u2019s first owner, the theater director and producer Winthrop Ames, were fabric installations intended to look like tapestries by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher; the new artwork recollects them, but in a novel fashion.\u201cWe said, since so much visual information now is digital, let\u2019s create a kind of pixelated approach,\u201d said Mr. Rockwell, a prolific Broadway set designer who won a Tony Award last year for a revival of the musical \u201cShe Loves Me.\u201dFor the walls of the Helen Hayes, Mr. Rockwell chose to pay tribute to the image that seemed most theatrical \u2014 the one depicting Bacchus and Ariadne. He is planning to cover the sides of the theater with the image, created entirely out of circles stenciled onto shaded blue walls that get darker as they near the stage.\u201cUp close it will be abstract, like an abstract painting, but as you move away and look across the theater, it all of a sudden appears,\u201d said Bill Mensching, the creative director of EverGreene Architectural Arts, the company that is executing the design. \u201cIt pulls all these layers of history of that theater together in a really cool way.\u201d\u201cWe made a deal with Jujamcyn that was beneficial to both parties,\u201d Mr. Reitz said. He declined to specify details.Second Stage is still hoping to sell naming rights to the building, which is one of six Broadway houses operated by a nonprofit theater company. In addition to its work on Broadway, Second Stage plans to continue presenting plays and musicals Off Broadway at its theaters on 43rd and 76th streets.The redesign will be extensive, as the building had become fairly shabby and outdated. There will be twice the number of dressing rooms, a new rigging system above the stage and a room for readings or donor meetings. The facade over the building\u2019s annex will be extended. There will be contemporary lobby and bar spaces, and, as is now de rigueur for theater renovation projects, expanded bathrooms.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the material used for the tapestry reproductions that once covered the interior of the Helen Hayes Theater. They were fabric installations, not paintings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SoftBank\u2019s $100 Billion Investment Fund Starts to Take Shape", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byMany business titans have made the trek to Trump Tower for a private audience with Donald J. Trump since he was elected president, but none have made a bigger splash than Masayoshi Son, the billionaire telecommunications entrepreneur.Yet bankers who are advising the SoftBank fund say that more than three-quarters of the fund\u2019s resources will be directed toward larger investments in private and public markets, rather than into start-ups.That could mean swooping in to grab a piece of an undervalued technology company trading on the stock exchange or doing a large-scale private equity deal.That\u2019s because investing in technology start-ups is usually constrained by the sector\u2019s ability to absorb large sums, with $1 billion generally considered the very upper limit. In the parlance of finance, money does not scale.These bankers say that the fund \u2014 which has $45 billion from Saudi Arabia, $25 billion from SoftBank and smaller contributions from Apple, Lawrence Ellison of Oracle and others \u2014 will also be looking at smaller venture capital forays in artificial intelligence, robotics and financial technology. But given the fund\u2019s size, the major bets will be on large companies.As the fund approaches its official start date later this month, a team of portfolio managers have emerged to get the investment process started. While Mr. Son will have the ultimate say, a small group of Deutsche Bank refugees \u2014 led by Rajeev Misra, one of Anshu Jain\u2019s most trusted (and unsung) deputies in the bank\u2019s glory years before the financial crisis \u2014 will take on a major role in putting this vast sum of money to work.To a degree, there is a bit of a start-up feel to the fund\u2019s investment team. With just weeks to go before the fund can start investing, the Deutsche Bank veterans \u2014 who will be supported by SoftBank analysts in San Francisco and Tokyo \u2014 are still settling into their new offices in London\u2019s exclusive Mayfair district.The team has already received a deluge of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, investor pitches and queries from bankers and lawyers \u2014 all looking to get a piece of the largest fund start in recent memory.Mr. Misra will be joined by Akshay Naheta, a former proprietary trader at Deutsche Bank and founder of Knight Assets, an activist investment firm based in London; and Saleh Romeih, another senior banker from Deutsche Bank.Working with Mr. Misra and his team will be a group of senior SoftBank deal makers who, over the years, have worked closely with Mr. Son as he has built up his portfolio of investments. They include Alok Sama, chief financial officer for SoftBank International; Ronald Fisher, a board member who has been deeply involved with SoftBank\u2019s Sprint stake; and Deep Nishar, a former top executive at Linkedin.Mr. Son, Mr. Misra and Mr. Fisher will be the key members of the investment committee. Bankers expect that the total investment staff will include about 100 people.From the outset, growth has been the common theme in regard to investment strategy.That means that when the SoftBank fund takes a company private, it will not be slashing thousands of jobs to claim efficiencies or to meet interest payments on the loans that backed the deal.Instead, buyouts will be largely cash, thus helping Mr. Son keep true to his vision \u2014 to say nothing of his promise to the president-elect \u2014 that SoftBank\u2019s investments will create thousands of jobs.And because the fund will not have to pay back investors for 12 years, it will be able to take a longer-term approach \u2014 for its private investments as well at its bets in the stock market, which are expected to follow an activist strategy.It is this combination of growth and adherence to the long view that has made Mr. Son, in effect, the Warren E. Buffett of technology investing.Said to be worth $17 billion, Mr. Son made his first entrepreneurial score (an electronic dictionary that he sold to Sharp Electronics) as a college student at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1970s. He returned to Japan in the 1980s and transformed SoftBank from a software distributor to a technology and telecommunications giant.Mr. Son would later found Yahoo Japan and take a large and early stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth. Through his holding company, he now controls large swaths of the telecommunications market in the United States and Japan.At a time in finance when the real measure of a leader has become the ability to attract large sums of money in a short period of time, Mr. Son\u2019s achievement is extraordinary.But the task of deploying such an amount will be a challenge.Which is where Mr. Misra comes in.As the head of Deutsche Bank\u2019s global credit trading during a time when SoftBank was hitting the market for loans, Mr. Misra came to know Mr. Son as a client.In mid 2008, Mr. Misra \u2014 who was also the ultimate boss of Greg Lippmann, the trader whose bets against the United States housing market became the subject of the book and movie, \u201cThe Big Short\u201d \u2014 left the bank.After stints at UBS and the Fortress Investment Group, the Indian-born Mr. Misra accepted an offer in 2014 from Mr. Son to bring his financial engineering skills to SoftBank.It was Mr. Misra, in fact, who came up with idea of having Sprint, SoftBank\u2019s debt-burdened wireless provider, reduce its punitive finance costs by issuing cheaper bonds that were secured by the company\u2019s access to spectrum airwaves.Sprint was able to issue more than $3 billion worth of these bonds, which, because they were secured, carried a much lower interest rate than the double-digit rates that the company had paid in the past.With a five-year deadline to invest the funds, Mr. Misra and his team of bankers will not be forced to chase every tech tip, or to jump desperately into the next investor round for an Uber, Airbnb or the hot online security play of the moment.Mr. Misra\u2019s team will take a broad view of technology, bankers say, focusing on how lightning-speed innovation is disrupting industries like media, telecommunications, health care and asset management.\u201cHe is superbly talented,\u201d Boaz Weinstein, a hedge fund executive who worked for Mr. Misra at Deutsche Bank, said of Mr. Misra\u2019s ability to reinvent himself on Wall Street. \u201cFirst it was credit derivatives and now it is technology. Those kinds of second acts are rare.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the trader who became the subject of the book and movie, \u201cThe Big Short.\u201d He is Greg Lippmann, not Lippman.Advertisement"}

Other ideas heard on Wednesday, like wide public financing of campaigns and closing the \u201cL.L.C. loophole,\u201d which allows limited liability companies to pour money, almost unchecked, into campaigns, have also repeatedly foundered in Albany.\u201cHe\u2019ll focus in on one or two big items,\u201d said Bill Lipton, the executive director of the Working Families Party, which has criticized the governor on some liberal issues. \u201cBut there will be so much more that doesn\u2019t get done because he\u2019s continued to allow the Republicans to control the State Senate.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Cuomo shot back, saying that the governor had campaigned for Democrats and that Mr. Lipton was living \u201cin a fantasyland.\u201dThe governor has used executive action to get around a skeptical Legislature. He can act on his own to establish a legal-defense fund aimed at ensuring legal representation for immigrants. Likewise, Mr. Cuomo announced that he had signed a pair of executive actions intended to narrow pay inequities between men and women.His proposals were particularly heartening to environmentalists pushing the state to fight climate change. In the words of Adrienne Esposito, the executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment, some advocates were \u201cpopping Champagne\u201d over the sheer height of the governor\u2019s goals \u2014 closing Indian Point by 2021 while also increasing the share of renewable energy in the state to 50 percent by 2030, and lowering the current cap on the state\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.Some tempered their praise with concern about how the state could hit its targets on renewable energy without nuclear power. Indian Point\u2019s closing would be \u201ca big step backwards,\u201d taking out a major source of low-carbon energy, said Jesse Jenkins, a graduate researcher and independent analyst at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.But Jackson Morris, the director for Eastern energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, was more confident, particularly after the governor proposed generating 2,400 megawatts of power from offshore wind projects by 2030 \u2014 the largest commitment in the country, something he called \u201cone of the single most ambitious climate and clean energy policies in the nation.\u201dBlair Horner, the executive director of New York Public Interest Research Group, said the multiple State of the State addresses had paid dividends for Mr. Cuomo. \u201cHe got a whole week\u2019s worth of public information out there,\u201d he said. But, Mr. Horner added, Mr. Cuomo still had to deal with his \u201ctoxic relationship\u201d with lawmakers.On Wednesday, however, Mr. Cuomo seemed to be basking in the final hours of his tour, closing his speech \u2014 as he had other speeches \u2014 by citing the state\u2019s cryptic one-word motto: \u201cExcelsior.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to take this state even higher,\u201d he said.Hours after the governor concluded, his helicopter nearly took the opposite trajectory, as Mr. Cuomo returned to New York City. It filled with fumes that smelled like smoke, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.No one was injured.An article on Thursday about Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s agenda for 2017 misstated part of his proposal for wind farms. He proposed generating 2,400 megawatts of power from wind projects off Long Island by 2030, not from an offshore wind farm near Montauk. (A proposed wind farm off Montauk would generate 90 megawatts of power.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sears Clings to Catalog Thinking in an Online World", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe Sears Holdings Corporation, which is projected to lose more than $2 billion this year, is in the retailing dead pool. As its prospects for a turnaround appear to grow dimmer, it may seem to be another morality tale for bricks-and-mortar retailers in the age of Amazon.Yet it is a lesson that even Sears recognizes. Like other retailers, the company is scrambling to adapt to today\u2019s internet market. The question is whether it can do so before its cash runs out and the deal-making of its hedge fund chief executive, Edward S. Lampert is not enough to create more.Everyone knows Sears, which has been around for over 130 years. It started as a catalog business, the Amazon of a century ago, where you could buy just about anything. And I mean anything. I lived for several years in a Sears catalog home, shipped to my town by Sears at the turn of the 20th century.But in recent years, Sears has struggled. The company has lost over $9 billion in the last five years. Since 2011, it has shut more than 150 of its big Sears stores and over 350 Kmart stores, and it has just announced the closing of another 150 stores. Its revenue has fallen to a projected $25 billion in 2016, from $42.6 billion in 2011, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.The outlook is grim for Sears. This month, the company said that comparable sales had declined by 12 to 13 percent over the holiday shopping season. Its stock price has fallen to $8.75, from a high of over $190.Amazon, in the meantime, has soared. Its revenue is on track to reach $136 billion in revenue this year, according to S.&P. Global Market Intelligence, up over 30 percent from the previous year. Amazon has a market value of $395 billion as it dominates internet retail. And Amazon is on a roll, not just with sales but also with new products like the Echo that are must-haves, at least if you want your children to be screaming for Alexa to play Disney tunes all day.Other bricks-and-mortar retailers are struggling as well because of the Amazon juggernaut. Macy\u2019s has announced store closures and a revenue decline. J. C. Penney has reported disappointing sales.Still, Sears is a special case. Since 2008, it has been directly run and at times aided by Mr. Lampert.Despite a decade of decline, Mr. Lampert \u2014 who is after all a person who can read numbers even if he seldom leaves his compound in Florida \u2014 still seems to believe in a future for Sears, whose headquarters is in the Chicago suburbs. What is he up to?Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund acquired Kmart out of bankruptcy and combined it with Sears. At first, it looked like a miracle as the stock and sales rose. But the financial crisis was grim for Sears.Over the years, Mr. Lampert has managed the company directly \u2014 some say micromanaged \u2014 by dividing managers into segments and pitting them against one another. In addition, he has tried to refocus Sears onto the internet. This has involved the Shop Your Way strategy, in which Sears is to become an \u201casset light\u201d company with \u201cmembers\u201d who can shop online and at more streamlined stores.Despite the conventional wisdom, though, it is not Amazon that is primarily to blame for Sears\u2019s plight. Sears is being squeezed by changing economies and technology. Shoppers go to Walmart for discount items or to Target for discount items with a touch of style. The high end stays at stores like Nordstrom. The middle is smaller and increasingly shops online.(Sears, when asked to comment, referred to recent news releases.)Lots of financing transactions have included a rights offering and letters of credit and loans from Mr. Lampert\u2019s own hedge fund. The financial engineering has been extreme, while the turnaround has been slow to realize.In all of this, Sears itself has declined in value while Mr. Lampert\u2019s net worth has fallen to $2 billion from about $3 billion.So why doesn\u2019t he just try to liquidate the company instead?After all, Sears has $5 billion in inventory alone, lots of real estate still to monetize and beloved brands like Kenmore and DieHard that it has yet to sell. This is a classic 1980s play; the breakup value is much more than that of the existing company.One explanation is that it would be expensive to liquidate Sears. Shutting down 1,600 stores would be chaotic, and selling $5 billion worth of inventory at liquidation value would yield much less. Seritage, which mostly holds Sears property, would be significantly affected.But another explanation is that whatever you think of the execution, Sears is onto something. Bricks-and-mortar retail is not going away\u2014 it still dominates online sales and most likely always will. But retail is fragmenting and shifting into branded stores.Sears was once the Amazon of its day through its catalogs, and it successfully migrated to stores. Companies like Allstate, Dean Witter and Discover were spun out of Sears. Back then the company was everything to all consumers. Now, at a time when Amazon is everything to all customers, $24 billion in sales is still nothing to sneeze at, and surely some Sears stores are still profitable.This is ultimately Mr. Lampert\u2019s strategy \u2014 leverage a huge ground footprint to extend into the internet. A ground footprint is valuable not just because people still mostly shop by ground but also as a delivery vehicle. Amazon itself is opening up some physical stores.Here, Mr. Lampert is betting that Sears can transform itself by leveraging its ground footprint and streamlining it. It has invested in a newer, more streamlined store format selling appliances. The first of these opened in Fort Collins, Colo.But that belies the question of whom Sears is marketing to: discount shoppers or a more upmarket crowd? In today\u2019s day and age it is impossible to be everything for everyone in a physical store when the internet is simply much better at it.All of this must be done when Amazon or Walmart could buy the retailer for pocket change at this point. If Sears intended to dominate the internet, it should have started 15 years ago when it had the brand recognition to do so.In the end, the problem with Sears may be that while Mr. Lampert may be sure of Sears\u2019s value, the public just isn\u2019t sure of where it stands in the hierarchy of retailers when a ground store selling everything just isn\u2019t what it used to be. No amount of Wall Street alchemy and deal-making can fix this problem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Mexico Pay for Border Wall: Ideas Abound, and So Do Obstacles", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWill President Trump be able to make Mexico pay for his \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d? Over the course of his campaign he offered a variety of ways to dip into pots of Mexican money.The latest, proposed on Thursday, was a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, which total roughly $300 billion in goods and services.Like other proposals Mr. Trump has floated \u2014 impounding remittances of Mexicans working in the United States, or charging Mexicans more for visas \u2014 it seems straightforward. But carrying it out would be another matter.For starters, a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico would violate the North American Free Trade Agreement and most likely the rules of the World Trade Organization, which frowns on punitive levies imposed arbitrarily on imports from specific countries. (It is hard to tell from the tangle of announcements from Mr. Trump and his advisers whether they are planning a broad new tax regime that would affect all exports and imports. That, too, would most likely invite challenges at the W.T.O.)Mr. Trump, of course, has also talked about taking the United States out of the global trade accord. But that might seem a bit too drastic just to get Mexico to pay perhaps $20 billion for a wall. It is likely to impose enormous costs on the American and world economies, opening the door for a free-for-all trade war. But if the president did it anyway, the people paying the 20 percent tariff would not be Mexicans, but American consumers. That 2017 Ford Fusion built in Hermosillo, Mexico? It would no longer cost $22,610. It would cost $27,132.So what about the other ideas? The big one Mr. Trump mentioned early on is remittances. Mexico receives about $25 billion a year from Mexicans living abroad, mostly in the United States, in myriad transfers of a few hundred dollars apiece channeled primarily through services like Western Union and MoneyGram.Mr. Trump originally threatened to simply impound remittances, a matter of dubious legal standing and some logistical complication. Later he suggested a more sophisticated strategy. He would just threaten to change rules under the Patriot Act antiterrorism law to prohibit immigrants who couldn\u2019t prove legal residence from wiring money abroad. Under threat of losing these resources, the reasoning went, the Mexican government would soon cave and offer to pay for the wall.Remittances are indeed a big deal for Mexico. In a foreign policy speech delivered on Monday, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said that ensuring \u201cthe free flow of remittances from our compatriots living in the United States\u201d was one of 10 core Mexican objectives in the renegotiation of its relationship with America.What Mr. Trump seems not to reckon with is that people find a way around barriers like these. Mexicans would come up with other conduits to send the $100 a week that their parents, children or siblings back home rely on to pay the bills. As the Government Accountability Office noted in a report published last year, these sorts of obstacles often have the effect of \u201cpushing remittances out of formal financial systems to less detectable methods.\u201dAnd it might be illegal, too. Kathleen Newland of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group, said that taxing remittances just to Mexico would probably be challenged as discriminatory on the basis of national origin. After all, many people who send remittances are American citizens or legal residents. Taxing remittances only by illegal immigrants would be, to say the least, implausible.What about charging Mexicans more for visas and border cards? It would take a lot of them to add up to the cost of Mr. Trump\u2019s barrier. What\u2019s more, visa fees are dedicated by statute to finance United States consular activities around the world.Mr. Trump could probably find some Mexican money somewhere. Twelve million Mexicans live in the United States. Mexican companies have invested nearly $20 billion in the country. There are tons of flows of money between the two. The question is whether Mr. Trump can get at it without breaking the law.Gordon Hanson of the University of California, San Diego, notes that the two countries have an income tax treaty. That means that Washington agrees to tax Mexican residents subject to United States income tax at a reduced rate.\u201cI suppose Trump could simply violate this treaty and subject Mexican residents in the United States at a higher rate and call this part of the payment,\u201d he said.Perhaps none of this matters. Mr. Trump has acknowledged that how Mexico pays might be complicated, which suggests he may be open to calling any flow of money part of this payment. Or as Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations suggests, Mr. Trump may not actually be looking for good ideas to subtly draw money from Mexico to pay for a wall, but instead to prove strength and to humiliate the United States\u2019 southern neighbor.\u201cTrump is focused on the optics,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is not in the market for clever schemes.\u201dMaybe cutting all aid to Mexico could help serve this purpose. It wouldn\u2019t pay for much. And it would amount to shooting oneself in the foot. What little aid Mexico gets from Washington is mostly destined to help finance Mexico\u2019s efforts to stop migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras from traveling across Mexico and into the United States.But that might not matter anymore. When the dust settles on Mr. Trump\u2019s rearrangement of relations with Mexico, Mexico is unlikely to keep lending a hand. The United States\u2019 most effective tool to curb illegal immigration will be lost. And then his wall might come in handy.The Economic Scene column on Friday, about President Trump\u2019s options for making Mexico pay for a border wall, referred incorrectly to Oklahoma\u2019s fee on money transfers abroad. The fees began in 2010 and continue; the state did not \u201cbriefly\u201d impose the fee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retired Big Apple Circus Animals Prepare for Their Second Act", "Date": "2017-01-22", "News": "Supported byWINDHAM, N.Y. \u2014 See the mailbox? This is hallowed starlet ground.Painted to imitate a big top circus tent, the mailbox on Jenny Vidbel\u2019s property hints at the lives she cares for on her farm in the Catskill Mountains. Down in the fields, a group of horses convened at the edge of woodland during a recent visit. From her house, Ms. Vidbel monitored them and a variety of the animals roaming about 70 acres. She is a third-generation circus trainer and the overseer of recently arrived retirees \u2014 more than two dozen horses, a few pigs and a rowdy cluster of dogs from the Big Apple Circus.It was on this farm more than three decades ago that Ms. Vidbel, 41, entered circus life, a result of her grandparents\u2019 love for performing in circuses and training animals. Ms. Vidbel performed with the animals at Big Apple for more than six years.\u201cThey retire, and that\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to give them this in return for their whole life and make sure they have a great retirement.\u201dIt won\u2019t be quite a full retirement, however, for either the animals or Ms. Vidbel. Many of the animals will become part of a therapy program being developed on the upstate retreat.The program will pair animals, mostly horses, with special-needs children, economically disadvantaged youngsters and older people. There will be instruction in basic grooming and animal care, and participants will work with horses in need of care to learn lessons in responsibility. But the benefits are meant to go both ways \u2014 the interaction and the relationships that develop are aimed at rehabilitating horses and participants.A centerpiece of the program will be an amphitheater, about 20,000 square feet, that Ms. Vidbel hopes to break ground on in the spring. The theater, which will be called the Windham Mountain Horse Theater, will be used for private sessions and eventually for circus performances with the horses as the main stars.Ms. Vidbel said that additional fund-raising would start after ground had been broken for the theater, and that she expected that the building and program could be operating by the end of 2018. So far, about $100,000 has been set aside for the programs, and Ms. Vidbel said she hoped to raise an additional $200,000.Ms. Vidbel also plans to take in animals that were not in the circus. \u201cWe have plenty of land, and I want to take in horses who need a home,\u201d she said.The programs will resemble projects that were sponsored by the Big Apple Circus, which included the Circus of the Senses, a performance for children with hearing, cognitive and visual impairments.\u201cI saw how the kids were affected by the animals, and I started thinking these animals need to be rehabilitated through a loving relationship,\u201d Ms. Vidbel said, referring to horses in shelters or neglected by their owners.\u201cThey need special attention,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not about bringing an animal in that will provide comfort. The animals need their help. It\u2019s about helping one another.\u201dMr. Dufresnoy said he was \u201c very passionate about the project and the area \u2014 life on the mountain is really something.\u201d He will oversee logistics, performers and the orchestration of modified shows for children with autism. The shows are truncated version of performances for general audiences, with significant modifications to sound, lighting and length. \u201cAlmost an unplugged version,\u201d Mr. Dufresnoy said.\u201cThere was a great demand that we could not accommodate,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cWe want to foster a bond between a human and an animal.\u201dJasper, a 10-year-old Friesian horse, did not come from the circus but arrived at the property after his trainer died. Like other animals that arrive under trying circumstances, Jasper will receive the emotional support he needs after the loss of his longtime companion, Ms. Vidbel said.\u201cI\u2019ve spent a lifetime on the road and performing, and I love it but I do want to give back,\u201d she said. \u201cMy grandparents were such a big influence, and I just became so passionate about sharing this amazing experience with the animals with other people. It fits, it just fits.\u201dAdjusting to retirement was not easy for some of those on the farm, including Ms. Vidbel. The horses would parade around in tight circles, so much so that they wore a rough path into the grass. The loss of the Big Apple Circus is still acutely felt on the farm.\u201cThe important thing is that I keep working with them every day,\u201d Ms. Vidbel said. \u201cWe need the interaction.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Plan Sows Confusion as Tensions With Mexico Soar", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 President Trump\u2019s decision to build a wall along the length of the United States\u2019 southern border with Mexico erupted into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday, leading to the cancellation of a White House visit by Mexico\u2019s president and sharply rising tensions over who would pay for the wall.With the conflict escalating, Mr. Trump appeared to embrace a proposal by House Republicans that would impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters that the proceeds would be used to pay for the border wall, estimated to cost as much as $20 billion.But a furious uproar prompted Mr. Spicer to temper his earlier remarks, saying the plan was simply \u201cone idea\u201d that might work to finance the wall. Mr. Spicer said it was not the job of the White House to \u201croll something out\u201d on tax policy, while Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said the administration was considering \u201ca buffet of options.\u201dIf Mr. Trump does eventually announce his support for the tax plan, it could have a broad impact on the American economy, and its consumers and workers, by sharply increasing the prices of imported goods or reducing profits for the companies that produce them. Other nations could retaliate, prompting a trade war that could hit consumers around the globe.Retail businesses could see their tax bills surge, said David French of the National Retail Federation, who predicted that those costs would be passed on to consumers. He called the idea \u201cvery counter to the way consumers are feeling at the moment.\u201dIf nothing else, the rapid-fire developments showed Mr. Trump that international diplomacy and a top-to-bottom overhaul of the tax code would not be as easy as an announcement before a campaign microphone. The events unfolded after Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to strengthen the nation\u2019s deportation force and start construction on a new wall along the border.Adding to Mexico\u2019s perception of an insult was the timing of the order: It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington, and just days before a scheduled meeting between Mr. Trump and the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.The sense of chaos and confusion about the tax issue added to the fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s conflict with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, his first direct clash with a world leader since becoming president a week ago. The Mexican peso bounced sharply with each new development.Tensions between the two have been simmering for months, despite comments by both men that they were trying to work together. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration and border-wall decisions on Wednesday appeared to shatter the remaining good will between them.\u201cI regret and condemn the United States\u2019 decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said.Mr. Trump responded on Twitter, \u201cIf Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.\u201dWithin hours, that is just what happened. Blasting Mr. Trump for sowing division between the countries, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto angrily backed out of the White House meeting, which had been scheduled for next week.In remarks at congressional Republicans\u2019 retreat in Philadelphia, Mr. Trump portrayed the decision to cancel the meeting as his own and issued a stern warning to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto about the consequences of refusing to cooperate with him on financing the wall.\u201cUnless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to go a different route,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have no choice.\u201dIn the same remarks, Mr. Trump alluded to the idea of a border tax, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports, and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route.\u201dAfter the speech, in a brief, impromptu news conference as Mr. Trump flew back to Washington, Mr. Spicer told reporters that the president now favored the plan to impose a 20 percent border tax as part of a sweeping overhaul of corporate taxation. Only last week, Mr. Trump had dismissed the tax as too complicated, favoring his own plan to impose a 35 percent tariff on manufactured goods made by American corporations in overseas factories.Mr. Spicer said that the plan for the tax was \u201ctaking shape\u201d and that it was \u201creally going to provide the funding\u201d for the wall.Mr. Spicer said that was a direct reference to the centerpiece of House Republicans\u2019 proposal to overhaul the tax code. They have been pushing the idea for months, but with little evidence, until Thursday, that Mr. Trump was interested in it.But by the time Mr. Spicer returned to the White House two hours later, he had already recanted. In another hastily arranged conversation with reporters, he called the proposal \u201cone idea\u201d that might work and said it was not the job of the White House to \u201croll something out\u201d on tax policy.\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked over and over again: \u2018How could you possibly do this? There\u2019s no way that Mexico will pay for it,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cHere\u2019s one way. Boom. Done. We could go in another direction. We could talk about tariffs. We could talk about other custom user fees. There are a hundred other things.\u201dThe White House and House Republicans have been hashing out their respective tax proposals as they press forward with Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda to revive American manufacturing and increase exports.The House proposal would replace the current system of corporate taxation with one that more closely resembles the approach taken by many other developed nations. The government would impose a 20 percent tax on corporate income earned in the United States, which would have the effect of taxing imports while exempting exports.The approach, known as border adjustment, creates the appearance of taxing trade deficits. The goods that the United States imported from Mexico in 2015 were worth about $60 billion more than the goods it exported to Mexico, so federal revenue in the short term would increase by roughly $12 billion.But the House plan would offset that revenue by reducing the 35 percent corporate income tax rate, and would thus generate no new federal revenue over all. It was unclear how that fit with Mr. Spicer\u2019s repeated contention Thursday afternoon that revenue from the tax adjustment would help finance construction of the border wall.By siphoning off that revenue, Mr. Trump would make it impossible to reduce the tax rate as far as Republicans wish. He is pressing for a 15 percent corporate tax rate.Moreover, the tax would not be paid by Mexico. It would be paid by companies selling Mexican goods in the United States. Some might raise prices, imposing the cost on consumers, while others might be forced by competitive pressures to absorb the tax, reducing their profits. Many economists also doubt that the change would end up penalizing imports or encouraging exports. They predict that the value of the dollar would rise, offsetting those effects.Nonetheless, many businesses in industries such as retail and energy, which rely heavily on imports, were in a panic.Representative Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who wrote the plan, told Fox News on Thursday afternoon that he was pleased that Mr. Trump appeared to be on board with it after his appearance in Philadelphia.\u201cWhat I heard today from this president was that in tax reform, that they would level the playing field for imports around the world and level it with the U.S. products here in America at the exact same rate,\u201d Mr. Brady said.Michael D. Shear reported from Philadelphia, and Binyamin Appelbaum and Alan Rappeport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Secret Jew, the New World, a Lost Book: Mystery Solved", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported byIt is perhaps the most significant artifact documenting the arrival of Jews in the New World: a small, tattered 16th-century manuscript written in an almost microscopic hand by Luis de Carvajal the Younger, the man whose life and pain it chronicled.Until 1932, the 180-page booklet by de Carvajal, a secret Jew who was burned at the stake by the Inquisition in Spain\u2019s colony of Mexico, resided in that country\u2019s National Archives.Then it vanished. The theft transformed the manuscript into an object of obsession, a kind of Maltese Falcon, for a coterie of Inquisition scholars and rare-book collectors. Almost nothing was heard about the document for more than 80 years \u2014 until it showed up 13 months ago at a London auction house. The manuscript was on sale for $1,500, because the house had little sense of its value.But last year the relic caught the eye of a prominent collector of Judaica, Leonard Milberg, when it showed up for resale at the Swann Galleries in Manhattan. It was now priced at more than 50 times what it had sold for just a few months earlier in England. Mr. Milberg consulted a variety of experts, who told him it might be the actual manuscript, and worth as much as $500,000. They also warned him to be careful \u2014 the original had been reported stolen.\u201cIt is the earliest surviving personal narrative by a New World Jew,\u201d said David Szewczyk, an expert in ancient books of the Americas, \u201cand the earliest surviving worship manuscript and account of coming to the New World.\u201dThe manuscript\u2019s odyssey \u2014 from its creation in Mexico to its recent arrival in Manhattan \u2014 is a tale laced with intrigue.De Carvajal was a Jew who posed as Catholic in New Spain, now Mexico, during a period when the Inquisition ruthlessly persecuted heretics and false converts with deportation, imprisonment, torture and grisly public executions.De Carvajal, a trader, was arrested around 1590 as a proselytizing Jew and, while in prison, began writing a sometimes messianic memoir, the \u201cMemorias,\u201d on pages roughly 4 inches by 3 inches. In it, he called himself Joseph Lumbroso \u2014 Joseph the Enlightened. It begins: \u201cSaved from terrible dangers by the Lord, I, Joseph Lumbroso of the Hebrew nation and of the pilgrims to the West Indies in appreciation of the mercies received from the hands of the Highest, address myself to all, who believe in the Holy of Holies and who hope for great mercies.\u201dThe memoir tells how he learned from his father that he was Jewish, circumcised himself with an old pair of scissors, secretly embraced the faith and persuaded siblings to embrace it.He was freed for a time \u2014 possibly so that the authorities could track his contacts with other secret Jews \u2014 and finished his autobiography, stitching it together with a set of prayers, the Ten Commandments and 13 principles of the Jewish philosopher Maimonides. Scholars believe he made it miniature so he could conceal it inside a coat or pocket. In 1596, after having been found guilty again of observing Jewish practices, he was burned at the stake. He was 30.His manuscript, discovered in his clothing, eventually ended up in the National Archives, which by the 1930s was located in a building adjacent to the presidential palace.How the book disappeared remains a matter of conjecture. At the time, at least three scholars were delving into the atlas-size volumes of the Inquisition\u2019s proceedings against de Carvajal. They have all been suspects of one kind or another over the years. One of them, a historian on the archives staff who was writing a book on the de Carvajal family, accused a rival of the theft. The rival, Jacob Nachbin, a Yiddish-speaking Polish and Jewish history professor who had taught at Northwestern University in Illinois and what is now New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, spent roughly three months in jail but was released for insufficient evidence. Some scholars think his accuser may have actually been guilty.The subsequent Bloomsbury buyer, described by a Swann official only as a rare-book dealer, brought the manuscript to Swann, which priced it at $50,000 to $75,000. Though some experts value it closer to $500,000, Swann thought the de Carvajal manuscript to be a transcript \u2014 a very old copy \u2014 not the original in de Carvajal\u2019s hand, and listed it as such in its catalog.That\u2019s where it was spotted last summer by Mr. Milberg, 85, the Flatbush, Brooklyn-reared owner of a Manhattan commercial finance company who collects Judaica and Irish poetry. He decided to buy the manuscript \u201ccopy\u201d and include it in the planned exhibition at the New-York Historical Society, which was to include many pieces from his Judaica collection. Then he was going to donate it to Princeton University, his alma mater.But experts he consulted, like Ilan Stavans, a professor of Latin American culture at Amherst College, convinced him that it was both authentic and stolen. (One reason Mr. Milberg believes it to be the original: No transcriber, he said, would have bothered to make the handwriting so tiny.)Swann ultimately pulled the manuscript from the sale, and Mexican curators confirmed its authenticity.Rick Stattler, head of Swann\u2019s rare-book department, said that when he realized he had de Carvajal\u2019s original, \u201cI actually had the hairs go up on my arm.\u201dMr. Milberg told Diego G\u00f3mez Pickering, Mexico\u2019s consul-general in New York, that he would try to arrange a return of the manuscript. But he needed a few months so that it could be displayed in New York. Mr. G\u00f3mez Pickering agreed.To avoid any argument over rightful possession, Mr. Milberg agreed to pay Swann\u2019s consignor $10,000 \u2014 still a tidy profit. Swann got $2,500 for its trouble from Mr. Milberg. And a dealer who helped him coordinate the transactions, William Reese, received $25,000 for his labors.Mr. Milberg also insisted that digital copies be made for Princeton and the Spanish-Portuguese Synagogue in Manhattan. He said that highlighting such objects is his way of \u201cgetting back at anti-Semitism.\u201d\u201cI wanted to show that Jews were part of the fabric of life in the New World,\u201d he said. \u201cThis book was written before the Pilgrims arrived.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Court Orders Justice Dept. to Release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Documents", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byCasting a ray of sunlight on a case that has been shrouded in secrecy, a federal appeals court ruled on Monday that the government must produce a raft of documents to plaintiffs suing over its decision to seize all the profits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants that were put into conservatorship in September 2008, at the depths of the financial crisis.As it has defended itself against Fairholme, the government has withheld more than 11,000 documents relating to the profit sweep decision, arguing that they should not be disclosed because they are subject to various claims of privilege, including the privilege covering presidential communications. Contending that those claims were an overreach, lawyers for Fairholme asked Margaret M. Sweeney, the judge hearing the case in the Court of Federal Claims in Washington, to review a representative sample of 56 documents.The government appealed. In Monday\u2019s opinion, three judges for the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled unanimously that 48 of the 56 documents were not privileged and should be released to the plaintiffs.\u201cThis is a sweeping victory for the plaintiffs and, more broadly, for the rule of law and transparency in our government,\u201d Charles J. Cooper, chairman of Cooper & Kirk, which is representing Fairholme Funds, said in a statement. \u201cIt is clear from the Court of Appeals\u2019 unanimous ruling that the vast bulk of the 11,000 documents withheld by the government will now have to be disclosed to the plaintiffs and the courts, and we are confident that these documents will further discredit the government\u2019s defense narrative.\u201dOfficials at the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, lawyers for the government have said that releasing the documents would roil the financial markets.In 2015, The New York Times filed an amicus curiae brief with the Court of Federal Claims asking for the release of some documents in the case.The 48 documents could be released in the coming weeks.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship, even though they have recovered. As of September, the companies had returned $63.1 billion more to the Treasury than they drew down during the recession.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Traffic Deaths Dip Again. It\u2019s Not Enough, Mayor\u2019s Critics Say.", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byAfter two years of major declines in New York City\u2019s traffic deaths, the number of people killed in crashes dropped slightly last year while pedestrian deaths rose, leading to questions about whether Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s ambitious campaign to eliminate traffic fatalities has stalled.Making streets safer has been near the top of the agenda for Mr. de Blasio, who pledged to cut traffic deaths to zero by 2024. While city officials said traffic deaths were at their lowest level in a century, the uneven results last year suggest that the mayor\u2019s goal will be very difficult to achieve.\u201cWe are very committed,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on the cable news channel NY1 this month. \u201cI believe in Vision Zero 110 percent, and now we have three years running where it\u2019s produced better results each year.\u201dThe early days of the new year have gotten off to a deadly start, with at least four fatal hit-and-run crashes in the city. On Monday, an 85-year-old man was hit and killed by a truck in Brooklyn, and the driver left the scene, the police said. A few hours later, a 43-year-old man was killed when a driver hit him and several parked cars in Brooklyn.The city has managed to make progress on Vision Zero even as there has been a sharp increase in traffic fatalities nationwide. \"I think it\u2019s remarkable that the city has seen three years in a row of reduced traffic fatalities, very much bucking the national trend,\u201d Ms. Trottenberg said.Mr. Rosekind blamed a strong economy, the persistent problem of drunken driving and distractions like smartphones, among other factors.\u201cMore people are working, and more people have money they can spend, and all of that puts more people on the road,\u201d Mr. Rosekind said. He praised New York for reducing traffic deaths.In New York City, the greatest drop in traffic fatalities last year involved people who were riding in motor vehicles; the number fell to 48 deaths, from 59 in 2015. Motorcyclist deaths also dropped last year to 19, from 22 in 2015.Paul Steely White, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group, said he was concerned about the increase in pedestrian and cyclist deaths. He called on Mr. de Blasio to include additional financing in his budget this year to improve dangerous streets.\u201cThat\u2019s really job No. 1 for the mayor \u2014 to fix those badly designed streets,\u201d Mr. White said.Austin Finan, a spokesman for the mayor, said the city would continue to make improvements. \u201cThe city is firmly committed to Vision Zero investments in street redesigns and enforcement that save lives,\u201d Mr. Finan said in a statement. \u201cNo legal decision will change that.\u201dAfter having grown disillusioned with former Police Commissioner William J. Bratton for not moving aggressively enough on Vision Zero, some safety advocates are hoping for a fresh start with Police Commissioner James P. O\u2019Neill. The Police Department is a critical partner on safety because officers handle traffic enforcement and investigate serious crashes.The department issued more than 40,000 summonses for failure to yield last year, and more than 135,000 summonses for speeding, city officials said. Both numbers are up slightly from 2015, but essentially flat. More than 1.3 million speed camera violations were issued last year from cameras stationed near schools \u2014 a program the city wants to expand.Mr. White said he was encouraged because Mr. O\u2019Neill was a bicycle rider and likely understands the perspective of New Yorkers who navigate the city outside of cars.\u201cPeople who only drive are more inclined to blame a pedestrian, or think they\u2019re always in the way,\u201d Mr. White said.\u201cThere are no words in the dictionary to explain it,\u201d Ms. Williams said in an interview. \u201cThis morning, I cried and cried. My whole life, my whole world, is upside down.\u201dIrene Lee, 57, of Queens, was charged with leaving the scene of the crash without reporting the death. She could face up to seven years in prison.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Infrastructure Delusions", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Notably, Bernanke, like yours truly, argues that the fiscal-stimulus case for deficit spending has gotten much weaker, but there\u2019s still a case for borrowing to build infrastructure:When I was Fed chair, I argued on a number of occasions against fiscal austerity (tax increases, spending cuts). The economy at the time was suffering from high unemployment, and with monetary policy operating close to its limits, I pushed (unsuccessfully) for fiscal policies to increase aggregate demand and job creation. Today, with the economy approaching full employment, the need for demand-side stimulus, while perhaps not entirely gone, is surely much less than it was three or four years ago. There is still a case for fiscal policy action today, but to increase output without unduly increasing inflation the focus should be on improving productivity and aggregate supply\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, through improved public infrastructure that makes our economy more efficient or tax reforms that promote private capital investment.But he gently expresses doubt that this kind of thing is actually going to happen:In particular, will Republicans be willing to support big increases in spending, including infrastructure spending? Alternatively, if Congress opts to reduce the deficit impact of an infrastructure program by financing it through tax credits and public-private partnerships, as candidate Trump proposed, the program might turn out to be relatively small.Let me be less gentle: there will be no significant public investment program, for two reasons.First, Congressional Republicans have no interest in such a program. They\u2019re hell-bent on depriving millions of health care and cutting taxes at the top; they aren\u2019t even talking about public investment, and would probably drag their feet even if Trump came forward with a detailed plan and made it a priority.But this then raises the obvious question: who really believes that this crew is going to come up with a serious plan? Trump has no policy shop, nor does he show any intention of creating one; he\u2019s too busy tweeting about perceived insults from celebrities, and he\u2019s creating a cabinet of people who know nothing about their responsibilities. Any substantive policy actions will be devised and turned into legislation by Congressional Republicans who, again, have zero interest in a public investment program.So investors betting on a big infrastructure push are almost surely deluding themselves. We may see some conspicuous privatizations, especially if they come with naming opportunities: maybe putting in new light fixtures will let him rename Hoover Dam as Trump Dam? But little or no real investment is coming.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As China Seeks Bigger Role on World Stage, Xi Jinping Will Go to Davos World Economic Forum", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byBut it is unclear whether Mr. Xi, who rarely ventures beyond platitudes in discussing the strategies of the world\u2019s second largest economy, can take advantage of this time of transition when the rest of the world is gauging whether the United States is pulling back from global leadership.Mr. Xi may sense an opening during a historic inflection point. He plans to deliver a speech at Davos at a moment when the incoming United States president, Donald J. Trump, has suggested that the United States should withdraw from the traditional superpower role it has played since World War II, including its leadership of a global free trade agenda.In recent years, Davos had come to embody that American-led agenda \u2014 a gathering at an Alpine ski resort of some of the world\u2019s most powerful figures in the realms of politics, media and technology. Discussions each year have been set by Western leaders, not Asian ones.But events of the past year brought into sharp focus a rise in populist denunciations of globalization, free trade and inequality in some Western nations, including the United States, with Davos frequently mentioned by critics as a symbol of the root causes of their countries\u2019 ailments.China has benefited greatly from access to international trade markets since its entry in 2001 into the World Trade Organization, and it could now become the most vocal proponent of that system. Mr. Trump campaigned on opposition to the existing global trade system and has denounced China for competing unfairly against the United States.People\u2019s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, published an article Wednesday that said China could become the \u201ctorchbearer of the open trade system\u201d and boasted that Mr. Xi\u2019s visit \u201cwill boost the world\u2019s confidence in global governance.\u201dHis appearance is a logical step in his country\u2019s evolution into a globe-spanning superpower, a rapid transformation that has been marked by bold symbolic gestures and events in the past decade, including the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing under President Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessor.Premiers of China, including the current one, Li Keqiang, have attended Davos before, but the nation\u2019s president \u2014 and head of the Communist Party \u2014 has never been to the gathering.\u201cClearly it signals that Xi Jinping is now interested in writing both China and himself in a grander way on the global diplomatic horizon,\u201d said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cHe feels it\u2019s time to really come out. Behind that probably is an assumption and wishful thinking that the U.S. is in disarray, Europe is feckless, and so on.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll be received almost as the number one citizen at Davos,\u201d Mr. Schell added.Mr. Xi plans to attend Davos on Jan. 17, during a state visit to Switzerland from Jan. 15 to 18, said Lu Kang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. Mr. Xi is expected to speak at the opening session of the forum, which runs from Jan. 17 to 20.Strong anti-globalization sentiments erupted last year in the movement in Britain that culminated in the popular vote by British citizens to leave the European Union. But it was Mr. Trump\u2019s election in November that was the apotheosis of the move in the West toward isolationism, and meetings and conversations at Davos \u2014 whose theme this year is \u201cresponsive and responsible leadership\u201d \u2014 will take place in the shadow of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises and rhetoric.Victor Shih, a scholar of China\u2019s political economy at the University of California, San Diego, said there are actually some global agenda matters on which China\u2019s influence \u201cmight have peaked in the medium term.\u201dHe pointed to China\u2019s push in recent years to have the renminbi counted as an international currency. That has been undermined in the past year by efforts of the Chinese central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, to withdraw large quantities of offshore renminbi from circulation. The bank has been doing that in order to try to prop up the value of the renminbi and limit capital flight from China, including the transfer of money to Hong Kong by wealthy Chinese.\u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China continues to claim that renminbi internationalization is important, and of course, at Davos, President Xi may continue to pay verbal homage to that agenda because it would be an important sign of China\u2019s ascendance on the world stage,\u201d Mr. Shih said. \u201cYet, in the past year, we have seen renminbi deposits outside of mainland China decline by hundreds of billions of renminbi.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio Seeks Small Donations to Fill War Chest Amid Inquiries", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byWith fewer than 10 months to Election Day, and no credible challenger having emerged, Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s path to re-election in New York City would seem fairly assured, buoyed by the benefits of incumbency: name recognition and fund-raising strength.Yet Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign team has attached some urgency and significance to the first fund-raising period of the year, which ended on Wednesday. Aides are hoping that a strong showing will ward off potential challengers and show the mayor\u2019s strength heading into the heart of the campaign.Last week, prominent supporters implored fellow admirers of his administration to make small donations to the mayor\u2019s re-election effort, a last-minute push to raise money before the deadline.On Monday, the mayor\u2019s campaign said it would report more than $1 million in contributions raised over the last half of 2016 from roughly 3,800 contributors, a majority of whom gave less than $100. (A campaign spokesman could not say if the total raised exceeded the $1.1 million brought in during the first half of 2016.)The official results must be made public by Tuesday.The mayoral race, especially on the Democratic side, has not really materialized, but that would change significantly if the investigations, now in their grand jury phase, led to an indictment of a city official.Mr. de Blasio has denied any wrongdoing.\u201cGetting close to midnight,\u201d read an email sent before the deadline. \u201cThere are no ultrarich special interests waiting in the wings to support us.\u201dFor larger donations, up to $4,950, from more established business figures, Mr. de Blasio himself has been making calls in recent weeks. The mayor cleared his public schedule last Tuesday and Wednesday and, according to his campaign, spent \u201ca few hours\u201d making calls.\u201cHe was doing this mano-a-mano, one at a time,\u201d said one Manhattan business person who received a direct call from the mayor, and who requested anonymity to discuss the private conversation. \u201cIt was very retail. Usually you get solicited by other people.\u201dMr. de Blasio also held six fund-raisers in three days, culminating in a gathering at a SoHo art gallery on Wednesday night. There, Mr. Ruffalo introduced Mr. Buscemi, who then brought up the mayor\u2019s wife, Chirlane McCray, to present her husband to what one attendee described as a sweltering room of roughly a hundred people.In his remarks, the mayor invoked the potential threat to liberal causes posed by President-elect Donald J. Trump and the \u201cpowerful forces\u201d that oppose Mr. de Blasio, both mainstays of his campaign talking points. Another common refrain in his argument for donations: that $13 million has been spent against him by special interests and those \u201cpowerful forces.\u201dThe figure, cited repeatedly in his emails seeking donations, comes from four groups: Uber; the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents landlords; and two pro-charter-school organizations, according to an analysis by the mayor\u2019s campaign of television ad spending. (Spending by the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, which represents rank-and-file city police officers and is embroiled in a contract dispute with City Hall, was not included in the report provided to The New York Times.)The $13 million figure, which his campaign says was spent to oppose universal prekindergarten, increases in the minimum wage and rent freezes, may hold a special resonance for Mr. de Blasio, who spent $13.5 million during his successful run for mayor.\u201cHedge fund billionaires and landlords have proven they are willing to spend millions against the mayor, and that is to be expected when you are trying to take on the status quo and make progressive change,\u201d said Dan Levitan, a spokesman for the de Blasio campaign. \u201cBut we have the power of thousands of grass-roots supporters multiplied by the best campaign finance system in the country.\u201dBut some of the groups singled out for spending against the mayor said much of their efforts were not aimed at him at all.Similarly, one of the charter groups, StudentsFirstNY, said its $2.5 million in ad spending did not target the mayor or residents of New York City.\u201cWe featured de Blasio in our ads for Senate candidates because he is so unpopular in areas across the state, but the ads weren\u2019t designed to weaken his re-election prospects,\u201d said the group\u2019s executive director, Jenny Sedlis, adding that targeting areas north and east of the city for broadcast ads inevitably leads to spillover onto New York City stations. But, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that we\u2019d prefer a mayor who is better on education and who is not in the pocket of the teachers\u2019 union.\u201dJoe Strasburg, the president of the landlord association, said his group had spent $2.2 million on ads opposing the rent freeze because he viewed it as a purely political gambit by the mayor that would hurt residents in the long run, as landlords prioritized paying rising tax bills over making repairs. \u201cWe\u2019re an easy target,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re spending money on advertising.\"\u201cIt bordered on political promotion,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s inauguration at far less than President Obama\u2019s in 2009.\u201cSome people think he is going to be bad because he is openly anti-Islam, but the truth is, America has always been against Islam,\u201d said Bashir Kashta, a Palestinian businessman, as he sipped mint tea on Friday at the historic El Fishawy Cafe in Cairo\u2019s old Islamic district.Samy Abdel Mageed, 56, an engineer smoking a water pipe at an adjacent table, said he had \u201cnot met a single person who is excited about Trump or thinks he will change anything for better or worse.\u201d\u201cAmerica is a country of institutions, and institutions are hard to change,\u201d he said.At the bookstore party in Bulgaria, Borislav Tsekov, another founder of the European Trump Society, proudly surveyed the crowd of about 75 people who had trudged through ankle-deep slush to attend the event at the Greenwich Book Center. He described the society as a scholarly organization dedicated to studying Mr. Trump\u2019s ideas.Mr. Tsekov, a former lawmaker who has been a member of several political parties, used the gathering to unveil his latest book, \u201cThe Trump Doctrine,\u201d a study of the new president\u2019s speeches and writings.Speaking before Mr. Trump was sworn in, Mr. Tsekov criticized the mainstream news media and the global political establishment, saying that they had unfairly portrayed Mr. Trump as a racist and xenophobe.\u201cWell, isn\u2019t he?\u201d cried a voice from the crowd that was then shouted down.Mr. Tsekov was not able to listen to Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on the big screen. He was too busy giving television interviews. But he said he looked forward to reading it and was certain he would approve.His co-founder, Mr. Angelov, was delighted with the turnout and looked forward to fresh branches sprouting across Europe.\u201cTrump is very popular in Bulgaria,\u201d Mr. Angelov said. \u201cHe is a brand, you know?

{"Headline": "Republicans\u2019 4-Step Plan to Repeal the Affordable Care Act", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President-elect Mike Pence and the top Republicans in Congress made clear on Wednesday, more powerfully and explicitly than ever, that they are dead serious about repealing the Affordable Care Act.How they can uproot a law deeply embedded in the nation\u2019s health care system without hurting some of the 20 million people who have gained coverage through it is not clear. Nor is it yet evident that millions of Americans with pre-existing medical conditions will be fully protected against disruptions in their health coverage.But a determined Republican president and Congress can gut the Affordable Care Act, and do it quickly: a step-by-step health care revolution in reverse that would undo many of the changes made since the law was signed by President Obama in March 2010.The Senate intends to pass a budget resolution next week that would shield repeal legislation from a Democratic filibuster. If the Senate completes its action, House Republican leaders hope that they, too, can approve a version of the budget resolution next week. Whether they can meet that goal is unclear.The resolution contains seemingly innocuous language, instructing four committees that control health care policy \u2014 two in the Senate, two in the House \u2014 to draft legislation within their jurisdiction that would cut at least $1 billion from the deficit over 10 years. But that language has real teeth. The legislation produced to meet those instructions can pass the Senate with a simple majority \u2014 51 votes if all senators are present \u2014 obliterating the power of the Democratic minority to block it.Those four committees would have just a few weeks, until Jan. 27, to produce legislation repealing major provisions of the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans have some practice at this, because they have voted more than 60 times since 2011 to repeal some or all of the law.The budget blueprint will guide Congress but will not be presented to the president for a signature or veto.The committees \u2014 House Energy and Commerce, House Ways and Means, Senate Finance, and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \u2014 will quickly assemble legislation intended to eviscerate the health care law.Instead, the legislation would:\u25a0 Eliminate the tax penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees.\u25a0 Eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid.\u25a0 Repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges.It could also repeal some of the taxes and fees that help pay for the expansion of coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But some Republicans have indicated that they may want to use some of that revenue for their as-yet-undetermined plan to replace the health care law.The 2010 law imposed taxes and fees on certain high-income people and on health insurers and manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and medical devices, among others. Republicans have not said for sure which taxes they will scrap and which they may keep.Within days of taking office, President-elect Donald J. Trump plans to announce executive actions on health care. Some may undo Obama administration policies. Others will be meant to stabilize health insurance markets and prevent them from collapsing in a vast sea of uncertainty.\u201cWe are working on a series of executive orders that the president-elect will put into effect to ensure that there is an orderly transition, during the period after we repeal Obamacare, to a market-based health care economy,\u201d Mr. Pence said at the Capitol on Wednesday.He did not provide details, and Trump transition aides said they had no information about the executive orders. But some options are apparent. The federal government could continue providing financial assistance to insurance companies to protect them against financial losses and to prevent consumers\u2019 premiums from soaring more than they have in the last few years.Even as they move full speed toward gutting the existing health law, Republicans are scrambling to find a replacement. At the moment, they have no consensus.Mr. Pence said on Wednesday that the replacement would probably encourage greater use of personal health savings accounts and make it easier for carriers to sell insurance across state lines. Also, he said, it would encourage small businesses to band together and buy insurance through \u201cassociation health plans\u201d sponsored by business and professional organizations.Some type of subsidy or tax credit for consumers, to help defray the cost of premiums, is also likely. States would have more authority to set insurance standards, and the federal government would have less.Mr. Trump has also endorsed the idea of state-run \u201chigh-risk pools\u201d for people with pre-existing conditions who would otherwise have difficulty finding affordable coverage.Many experts have said that repealing the health law without a clear plan to replace it could create havoc in insurance markets. Doctors, hospitals and insurance companies do not know what to expect.Without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance, and without subsidies to buy it, supporters of the law say many healthy people would go without coverage, knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it.Democrats in Congress say they will do everything they can to thwart Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. They plan to dramatize their case by publicizing the experiences of people whose lives have been saved or improved by the law.In the Senate next week, Democrats will demand votes intended to put Republicans on record against proposals that could protect consumers. Defenders of the law also hope to mobilize groups like the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association to speak up for patients.The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, are encouraging their colleagues to organize rallies around the country on Jan. 15 to oppose the Republicans\u2019 health care agenda.And to buttress their case, Democrats are compiling statistics from the White House and from researchers at liberal-leaning groups like the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Commonwealth Fund and the Urban Institute, which warn of catastrophic consequences if the law is repealed.Advertisement"}

Trump \u2014 performed show-tunes-with-a-message on Friday afternoon at Town Hall in Manhattan to raise money for social justice organizations. With Mr. Trump celebrating the start of his presidency, the singers celebrated art as a comfort, an inspiration and a rallying cry for the coming months and years.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something to lift people\u2019s spirits,\u201d he said, \u201cand to help these charities that are probably going to be hard hit.\u201dMusicians organized protest concerts in several cities, including an \u201cAnti-Inaugural Ball\u201d in Los Angeles that featured Rage Against the Machine. But others sought to honor Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration: The Newseum, a Washington museum dedicated to promoting and defending the First Amendment, organized a day of events billed as a \u201ccelebration experience\u201d \u2014 even though Mr. Trump has had a rocky relationship with the news media.So, how creative were artists in reckoning with the start of the Trump era? Here is a sampling of Inauguration Day in culture.Glen Roven is no stranger to presidential inaugurations. He was the conductor of the opening ceremonies for Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, gathering performers like Barbra Streisand, Fleetwood Mac and, yes, the Rockettes. Earlier this year, he thought he might get the call for Hillary Clinton\u2019s, too.When Mrs. Clinton lost, Mr. Roven decided to draw on her candidacy to create a counterpoint to the actual inauguration. At National Sawdust in Brooklyn on Friday, Mr. Roven presented the premiere of \u201cThe Hillary Speeches,\u201d a 25-minute video recital that featured two of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches set to music. The video includes a diverse group of artists \u2014 including the opera singers Isabel Leonard, Nathan Gunn and Lawrence Brownlee, the actress Annie Potts and Chilina Kennedy (currently starring in \u201cBeautiful\u201d on Broadway) \u2014 singing excerpts from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s initial declaration of candidacy and recent concession speech. The video was also livestreamed.The music largely conveyed optimism and empowerment instead of failure. \u201cHillary\u2019s words are beautiful \u2014 they should live on in music,\u201d Mr. Roven said before the event, which drew Ms. Potts, Ms. Kennedy and the soprano Camille Zamora, among others.A funereal feeling hung in the crisp mountain air in Park City, Utah, as attendees at the ardently liberal Sundance Film Festival trudged into the 1,300-seat Eccles Theater for Friday\u2019s first big screening. At least they would be in a darkened movie theater when Mr. Trump took the oath of office.Two hours later, many of the same people came tumbling out of the Eccles with grins on their faces, having just received an unlikely message of optimism \u2014 from none other than Al Gore, a guy who knows a thing or two about losing elections.\u201cAn Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,\u201d about the former vice president\u2019s ongoing crusade focused on climate change, would not seem like much of a picker-upper. But the documentary has surprisingly upbeat messages both personal (when you are dealt a blow, regroup and keep going) and political (Mr. Trump will have a difficult time wreaking environmental havoc because of the economic momentum behind clean energy).\u201cNobody will be able to stop the sustainability revolution,\u201d Mr. Gore, wearing a blue sweater, said afterward from the stage, as the crowd hooted. \u201cWe are going to win this.\u201dBROOKS BARNESMr. Trump campaigned on threats to limit First Amendment protections for the news media while also routinely criticizing the press, singling out and insulting journalists, and rarely holding news conferences. The Newseum shrugged that off, though, as it held a $500-a-head party, a more expensive affair than the similar events it had held during the past two inaugurations.\u201cLike now, and then, it\u2019s not about the person,\u201d Jeffrey Herbst, president of the Newseum, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s about celebrating something all too rare in the world, which is the peaceful transfer of power.\u201dThe sold-out event included big-screen viewing of the inauguration ceremony and parade, access to the full museum and panels throughout the day \u2014 including two Trump-specific discussions, both called \u201cAn Insider\u2019s View of the Trump Administration.\u201dSOPAN DEB\u201cBad presidents make for great music,\u201d the veteran rabble-rousing guitarist Tom Morello has said. Fortunately for Mr. Morello\u2019s career, then, he is never quite satisfied with those in power.In an interview before the concert, Mr. Morello listed five \u201cconcrete suggestions\u201d for action under President Trump: Show up, join up (\u201ca union, a band\u201d), stand up (\u201cfor those who are targets of bigotry\u201d), read up (\u201cdon\u2019t just pick a news channel that confirms your prejudices\u201d) and rise up.\u201cNow is not the time to agonize,\u201d he added. \u201cNow is the time to organize.\u201dJOE COSCARELLIThe call by artists and critics for an \u201cArt Strike\u201d on Inauguration Day led to so many galleries being closed in Los Angeles that one of the city\u2019s busiest art destinations, the block of La Cienega Boulevard south of Venice Boulevard, looked like a ghost town late Friday morning.The parking lot of Blum & Poe, the city\u2019s only homegrown mega-gallery, was empty. Across the street, most gallery lights were off. And the facade of the Walter Maciel Gallery was covered with a large silver banner reading \u201cNOT OUR PRESIDENT.\u201dIn all, 11 of the 15 galleries on the block were closed, including Luis de Jesus, Anat Egbi, Cherry and Martin, Edward Cella Art+Architecture, Samuel Freeman, Paul Kopeikin and Zevitas Marcus.About two miles north, from his home office near La Cienega, the contrarian private collector-dealer Stefan Simchowitz vowed to continue business \u201cper usual,\u201d which often involves heavy Instagram and Facebook use to promote artists. He also used Facebook this week to criticize the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of galleries planning to close.\u201cWe sell art to the wealthy shareholder and leisure classes of the world, and this protest just sounds like a penny in an empty cup to me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cContribute your profits from the day to financing local and state elections with representatives who can run the platform you believe in.\u201dJORI FINKELAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Dakota Legislators Seek Hasty Repeal of Ethics Law Voters Passed", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byBut the state\u2019s overwhelmingly Republican legislature is racing this week to set aside that new law by using its emergency powers, prompting cries of protest from voters and critics, who are calling the hasty efforts an antidemocratic power grab.In effect, they say, the state\u2019s voters are being told that their votes don\u2019t matter.\u201cYou have usurped the right of the people to make a decision that\u2019s fully within their power,\u201d Roxanne Weber, a software engineer from Pierre, told a state Senate committee on Wednesday, before the panel voted to send the plan to repeal the ethics package to the full Senate \u2014 a final step before it can go to the governor.\u201cAllow the people to have their voice,\u201d Ms. Weber pleaded. \u201cAllow them to give you suggestions. Allow them to be a part of the process.\u201dLawmakers demanding repeal say the ethics regulations are irretrievably flawed and include provisions that may be unconstitutional.The only difference in Pierre, critics say, is that Mr. Trump has not intervened, and a deluge of emails, phone calls and national media attention seems not to be slowing the lawmakers.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an unprecedented effort here by Republicans at the federal level, in Congress, and in South Dakota to swim in the swamp instead of draining the swamp,\u201d said Aaron Scherb, director of legislative affairs for Common Cause, which has encouraged its South Dakota members to contact lawmakers there.Some organizations that oppose restrictions on political spending in the name of free speech said that the South Dakota initiative was poorly drafted and overly broad. David Keating, the president of the Center for Competitive Politics, said the measure as written was likely to be mired in state and federal litigation for years.\u201cIt was one of the most poorly written proposals we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Mr. Keating said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a legitimate worry that the legislature has and the governor has, which is that this could be in the courts for a long time, and it could cost a lot of money to litigate it. So why not start with a clean sheet?\u201dThe Republicans seeking a repeal say their concerns are not about the broad principles of the ethics package approved by South Dakota voters, which limited lobbyists\u2019 gifts to politicians and barred public officials from quickly becoming lobbyists, required more frequent reporting of campaign contributions, lowered contribution limits and created public funding for campaigns.\u201cEvery discussion that we have had in the Capitol is about putting some of these ideas into place,\u201d R. Blake Curd, a Republican state senator, said on Wednesday. But the particulars of the package passed by voters in November, he said, have raised all sorts of concerns about possible violations of the state and federal constitutions. He said that those concerns were what had prompted the rush to repeal it, and that an end to these regulations was not intended to be an end to ethics reform in the state. In fact, he said, new ethics legislation has already been drafted.Republicans in Washington have steadfastly blocked efforts to place tighter regulations on campaign money, arguing that it would stifle free speech, and the Federal Election Commission has been virtually frozen by disagreements between Democratic and Republican appointees over whether to punish or investigate possible election violations.Those efforts have spurred waves of litigation and legislative countermaneuvering, with national groups on both sides of the debate providing money and legal expertise. The South Dakota measure is already facing a legal challenge from a group of Republicans and others, and has been put on hold by a judge as the lawsuit proceeds.Supporters of the ballot measure said these were exactly the reasons more than 180,000 voters approved it in November. But opponents argued that the measures had been led largely by out-of-state interests and said, in extensive advertising over the course of the campaign season, that suggestions that South Dakota politics was rife with scandal were absurd and overstated.A Senate committee approved the repeal in a vote on Wednesday that fell along partisan lines, with all Republicans agreeing to it. The repeal is expected to go to the full Senate floor, where Democrats hold only six of 35 seats, as early as Thursday, and Gov. Dennis Daugaard, a Republican, has indicated that he will sign it.\u201cThey were hoodwinked by scam artists who grossly misrepresented these proposed measures,\u201d Mr. Daugaard said of how the ethics package was presented to voters.But some voters saw it differently.Rochelle Rogers, a web editor at a nonprofit in Rapid City, said she had written to three lawmakers from her part of the state, asking why they were trying to gut the measure. Only one wrote back, she said: Senator Jeffrey D. Partridge, who told her the measure would raise her taxes and asked if she had actually read the details.\u201cI find it so frustrating that they think we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about,\u201d Ms. Rogers said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not the case.\u201dChris Phillips, 43, who lives in Yankton, said he was skeptical of the public financing aspect of the measure, because South Dakota already had a relatively limited tax base. But he liked the idea of forcing lobbyists to disclose more of their work, and of having an independent monitor of the legislature. It was arrogant, he said, for lawmakers to propose scrapping the entire thing.\u201cThis is such a deep red state, they figure that they\u2019ll be able to get by and get re-elected regardless,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cThey feel very secure in their office.\u201dMonica Davey reported from Chicago, and Nicholas Confessore from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Start-Ups Hope Couples Say \u2018I Do\u2019 to Online Wedding Planning", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipPlanning a wedding remains a largely traditional pursuit. For many couples, it is a frustrating monthslong project that requires sifting through masses of details and costs on venues, services and products. Now, a variety of start-ups are trying to cut down on that information overload by harnessing new technologies to capture a slice of a multibillion-dollar industry \u2014 what some have called the wedding-industrial complex.Although sectors like food delivery and personal finance have found much success by providing services online, the wedding industry and its vendors remain highly segmented. The field is crowded with small, local businesses that are predominantly low tech and survive on word-of-mouth recommendations. And the nature of wedding planning (typically) means few repeat customers.The overall industry, however, is large, with $58 billion in revenue in 2016 and projections of $63 billion by 2021, according to the market research company IBISWorld. Couples spent an average of $26,500 last year on their weddings, according to the Wedding Report, which analyzes the field.Those factors led Kellee Khalil, who had worked in finance and at her sister\u2019s wedding-focused public-relations firm, to jump into the business. For one, it is relatively easy to identify consumers, who tend to spend thousands of dollars in a short amount of time.\u201cThey have a 12- to 18-month buying timeline so you know they\u2019re going to spend that money, and it\u2019s a really frustrating process,\u201d Ms. Khalil said. Performing maid-of-honor planning duties for her sister\u2019s wedding prompted Ms. Khalil to start her company in 2012.\u201cThere\u2019s completely no transparency on pricing so you don\u2019t know how much things cost, everything is dynamic, and you never know if vendors are available,\u201d Ms. Khalil said.She soon learned that couples who visited weren\u2019t interested in buying the products she was selling \u2014 but they were asking for advice. That prompted a change in 2015 to the next version, a platform that replicates two of a planner\u2019s main tasks: helping to set a budget and suggesting wedding professionals. Ms. Khalil started with $75,000 of her own money, and has since raised $7 million from investors.The average fee for a full-service wedding planner is $3,000; many cost much more. It is an expense many couples tend to forgo. About 18 percent hire a planner, according to the Wedding Report.Lover.ly is one of numerous start-ups using technology to try to make planning easier for the remaining 82 percent who do it themselves.These companies are moving beyond the traditional listing, inspiration and content services, which often have an overwhelming number of vendors, to offer personalized suggestions. And as texting and online chat become so integral to communication, those formats have been harnessed for wedding planning.But persuading wedding service professionals to adopt new platforms and technology can be challenging. Many are hesitant to invest the time and resources, and the industry remains stubbornly offline. About 12 percent of transactions are done online, Ms. Khalil said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of few industries yet to be fully digitized,\u201d she said.Still, Ms. Khalil has been able to build a database of 65,000 vendors, who are linked via a \u201crelationship map\u201d to venues. One of the company\u2019s virtual wedding planners assembles a list of vendors based on a couple\u2019s criteria, and the couples receive it within 48 hours of purchasing a service. Couples are charged from $10 to $399, and vendors $10 per client lead.The website serves to drive traffic to the company\u2019s app, a platform for interacting with the virtual wedding planners. Testing showed that brides prefer texting over phone calls or email.It has attracted users such as Heather Marie and Aniekan Udo, who live in New York and are planning a small wedding in Tuscany, in Italy, in June. Ms. Marie, a tech entrepreneur, was attracted by the efficiency and convenience of planning by app.\u201cThe amount of time it takes to research the different vendors would be every single weekend of my life until the wedding and it\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d said Ms. Marie, who initially did her own comparisons against Lover.ly\u2019s results and was impressed by the app\u2019s suggestions. \u201cI kind of wasted my time,\u201d she said.Lover.ly is beta testing its chatbot, nicknamed EVA (Expert Virtual Assistant), which gathers basic information from couples. It\u2019s currently used when none of Lover.ly\u2019s human planners are available online. The model is being refined, and it\u2019s becoming more sophisticated as more couples use it.The competition includes big, established sites, like WeddingWire and the Knot, which was founded in 1996 and introduced its first app in 2013.It\u2019s not surprising that entrepreneurs are swarming into the wedding space, said Michael Steib, the chief executive and president of the Knot\u2019s parent company, XO Group. But for many start-ups, getting a foothold in the market remains a challenge, he said. The Knot has acquired several start-ups that had good ideas within their niches. \u201cWe always have our ear to the ground,\u201d Mr. Steib said.\u201cIn this industry, you send emails to vendors. It takes forever to get a response,\u201d Ms. Jiang said. \u201cYou really want instant feedback. You\u2019re just so exhausted and just want to get things done, but there\u2019s no one replying to you.\u201dMs. Jiang said LadyMarry had been used to plan 90,000 weddings. It is free for couples; the company charges vendors a percentage, ranging from 15 to 45 percent, depending on the location and service. LadyMarry has six full-time employees, plus consultants.While she knows LadyMarry is one start-up in a multitude, Ms. Jiang sees room for growth. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can be a big player in the service provider segment.\u201d\u201cI really from the get-go wanted to offer the service as a complimentary matchmaker service,\u201d said Ms. Wilmot, who started the company in Portland, Ore., in 2014. She said the site, which is free for couples, has 3,400 registered vendors, and charges businesses a $5 monthly or $50 annual membership fee.Ms. Wilmot said the idea came about when she encountered difficulty getting bids from vendors for her own, out-of-state wedding. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about folks trying to get a sense of what the marketplace is like for a particular service,\u201d she said.Ms. Conroy started the company in 2012 with a focus on business owners. \u201cFor us, the thought process is, the better we can serve that local entrepreneur, the better we can serve the end consumer,\u201d she said.The site does not charge couples; revenue comes from charging wedding professionals for add-on services like payment processing because many vendors still rely largely on cash and check transactions.Carats & Cake partnered with the payment platform Stripe to offer online invoicing and bill paying. It has five full-time employees and 20,000 member businesses; about 300,000 couples used the site in 2016. The company had revenue in its second year of operation, and reached profitability by the fourth, Ms. Conroy said.The aim is to replicate offline professional networks by creating a visual record from vendors\u2019 previous clients. Couples post images from their weddings, along with a list of service providers, which are linked to the providers\u2019 profiles.As with many other online sectors, there is a risk of saturation. As members of a tech-savvy generation begin to plan their own weddings, it\u2019s not surprising that many think they can improve the process, Lover.ly\u2019s Ms. Khalil said.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing people experience the pain firsthand and they do the research, see this is a big market, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, I think I can do this one piece better.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "MoneyGram Deal May Test Trump\u2019s View on Chinese Investment", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe first test of the Trump administration\u2019s stance on Chinese investment is approaching: Ant Financial\u2019s $880 million acquisition of the United States payment processor MoneyGram.The company has moved into many other areas of Chinese finance, even running an app that allows a small investor to buy bonds online with one click. (More on that later.) With rocket-like growth, Ant Financial recently took in venture capital valuing the company to $60 billion \u2014 nearly as much as the market value of American Express. Ant Financial is aiming for an initial public offering, possibly later this year.The company has global ambitions and recently bought the mobile wallet company Paytm in India, but it is now aiming for the United States with its agreement to buy MoneyGram. The reason for the acquisition is breadth. MoneyGram has been slow to go online, but it has more than 350,000 partners and locations in 200 countries. And as new online entrants like Venmo arise, the market is ripe for disruption.MoneyGram is thus an aging service in need of a shine, a fact reflected in the small 11.5 percent premium to the stock market price that Ant Financial is paying. MoneyGram is also dwarfed by the No. 1 money transfer service, Western Union. But Ant Financial\u2019s acquisition is about leveraging MoneyGram\u2019s ground presence to service the 100 million-plus Chinese who travel abroad every year and use the company.The idea is pretty simple. Plug those travelers into Ant\u2019s huge network and MoneyGram instantly has an enormous digital presence. At the same time, Ant achieves global reach \u2014 and entry into the United States \u2014 for less than $1 billion.The deal sets up an interesting test for the new administration.President Trump has repeatedly accused Beijing of devaluing its currency to put the United States at a disadvantage, but his administration has not yet honored his promise to name China a currency manipulator.The question is whether heated political talk will translate into actions that affect all Chinese investment in the United States. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump said he would block Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group\u2019s acquisition of the Chicago Stock Exchange even though it was a small deal for an exchange that has little of the market in trading.If Mr. Trump wants to deal with Chinese investment and the Ant Financial deal, he has the existing apparatus. The MoneyGram acquisition will be reviewed under the Exon-Florio Amendment. Exon-Florio is the touchstone law that lets the president block foreign acquisitions that threaten national security.Under the law, the president has delegated his review ability to a group representing nine agencies \u2014 the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. The MoneyGram deal will be reviewed by Cfius.In Ant\u2019s case, the company is not affiliated with the military. The Chinese government, however, is represented among its largest shareholders, including China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, a large state-owned bank and a social security fund.So how will Washington look at this acquisition? In a basic sense, the threat to national security is tangential \u2014 this is a payment service with many competitors. Yet MoneyGram is part of the backbone of domestic and international wire transfer.Still, these approvals are likely to come, leaving Cfius as the big hurdle. The Trump administration may come to view the case as a way to show it is opposed to Chinese investment in the United States.The matter may also provide a test case for the reach of banks and payments services. Ant Financial has been rattled by the fallout in China over the default of the telephone maker Cosun on $166 million in bonds that were sold to retail investors on Ant\u2019s financial marketplace.The default shows how quickly finance in China has grown and spread to small investors. It also highlights that new products and new technologies in finance can sometimes arise with a lack of consumer protections. Ant Financial may bring innovative practices to the United States, but some officials in the administration may be wary of the change that could result.So far, Ant Financial has gotten off on the right foot with the new administration. Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s founder, who controls Ant Financial, met with Mr. Trump in January, before the inauguration.\u201cIt was a great meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump said after the meeting. \u201cJack and I are going to do some great things.\u201dDespite those friendly words, Mr. Trump the deal maker may try to seek some concession from Ant Financial as a condition for approval (putting aside the legal questions of such requests). Or the administration could decide that Ant Financial and Mr. Ma are not where they want to take a larger stand against China.The stark alternatives are dizzying in their implications, like many things coming out of Washington.So watch this deal, as the administration\u2019s actions will say a lot about the tone on investment in the United States for years to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Banker Inspired by Western Novelists Seeks to Build Asia", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileBEIJING \u2014 As China was opening up 40 years ago, Jin Liqun was an ambitious young academic fascinated by 20th-century American literature and other Western works. In the fragile era after Mao\u2019s death, the freedom to indulge in such texts was a heady experience.\u201cI look at the literature of the U.S. to get a sense of humanity\u2019s adaptation to nature \u2014 conquering is a wrong term,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot conquer nature; you have to come to terms with nature, you have to cohabit with nature, and you have to cohabit with other species in this world.\u201dYet Mr. Jin seems prepared to maneuver in the treacherous terrain between Beijing and Washington. His goal, he said, is to steer the bank toward building infrastructure across Asia in a way that is environmentally friendly and free of corruption.Mr. Jin, 67, gray-haired and slightly rumpled, was at ease in a recent interview at the bank\u2019s temporary headquarters in Beijing\u2019s financial district.In his sparsely furnished office, guests are seated at the head of a long table, with the host alongside them. That makes meetings seem more like affairs of equals, rather than a hierarchy with China at the top, as some bank members fear.It doesn\u2019t hurt relations with outsiders, particularly Europeans, that Mr. Jin has edited a two-volume anthology of English verse that starts with Chaucer and concludes with Seamus Heaney. Asked his favorites, he chooses T. S. Eliot, Ted Hughes and Dylan Thomas. Then he adds one more. \u201cEzra Pound is great, though he is a little bit controversial.\u201dDelicately, Mr. Jin chose another interpretation. \u201cI think he was giving me a warning: \u2018You have to do your job well because all eyes are on this bank.\u2019\u201dMr. Jin has tried to persuade skeptics in Washington that the bank is not a Chinese hegemon, at least not for now. He has smoothed prickly attitudes by agreeing to cooperate with the workhorses of the 70-year-old American-dominated Bretton Woods system \u2014 the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.Still, he seems aware that the China-led bank is likely to prosper under a Trump administration that has shown little signs of interest in the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.He pointed to an article he wrote before Donald J. Trump won the presidency. \u201cThe U.S. risks forfeiting its international relevance while stuck in its domestic political quagmire,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cHistory has never set any precedent that an empire is capable of governing the world forever.\u201dBut he likes to stress that he was born at a propitious moment for the Communist Party. The Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek had fled China\u2019s east coast and the Communists were in control by the time he was born in Changsu, a river port city in Jiangsu Province, in August 1949.\u201cI was born under the red flag,\u201d he said with a big smile.His father was an accountant, his mother a textile worker, and his grandfather, who lived with the family, was disabled from a work accident. The eldest child of five, he was left to handle the household while still in primary school.\u201cI tried to be a little leader of my siblings,\u201d he said. \u201cI never beat my brothers or sisters. I started to learn to cook when I was 9.\u201dHe was still in high school when the chaos of the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, and like all students at the time, he was corralled to become a Red Guard. After a brief stint, he retreated to the countryside, a decade-long journey that left an indelible impression.He joined the peasants in the fields during the day. At night, he studied at a makeshift desk forged from a discarded blackboard and four bamboo sticks. He devised a strict curriculum for himself, and devoted himself to mastering written and spoken English, via BBC radio.At the end of the Cultural Revolution, he enrolled in the postgraduate English literature program at the Beijing Foreign Studies University in 1978.China had just joined the World Bank. Because Mr. Jin was fluent in English, the Finance Ministry plucked him out of academia to join the office of the executive director for China at the World Bank in Washington. He had translated five chapters of White\u2019s book, but dropped everything to serve his country.The stint in Washington led to a career at the top echelons of China\u2019s financial machinery: He was vice minister of finance, and later chairman of the supervisory board of the China Investment Corporation.All the while he kept up his interest in things Western. In 1998, his daughter, Keyu, asked to leave home at 14 to live with an American family in New York and attend school there \u2014 a revolutionary idea for a Chinese family at the time. Mr. Jin\u2019s experience abroad prepared him for sending his only child away, Keyu Jin said.\u201cMy father was able to let me go,\u201d said Ms. Jin, 33, now a tenured assistant professor of economics at the London School of Economics, and a popular figure on China\u2019s social media. He set an example, she said, by always \u201creading and writing and listening to classical music after work. We never watched television.\u201dBeneath his diplomatic finesse, Mr. Jin is fiercely patriotic. Under the bank\u2019s rules, a Chinese does not automatically succeed him.But his expectations are clear.\u201cI would hope a Chinese can succeed me, and I hope we have competent Chinese people to succeed me in the future,\u201d he said, before heading off to a meeting with a delegation that was too big to fit around the table in his office.Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New England Patriots\u2019 Owner, Still Sore at N.F.L., Has Payback in Sight", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byFOXBOROUGH, Mass. \u2014 The N.F.L. likes portraying itself as one big family of owners, players and fans who, despite their differences, come together on game days.In spite \u2014 or, perhaps, because \u2014 of it all, New England went 14-2 this season and throttled the Houston Texans last week in its playoff opener.Kraft largely kept quiet while the Brady case played out. But in a recent interview, he made clear that he remains annoyed by how his best player and team were pilloried.\u201cSometimes, the league really messes up, and I think they really messed this up badly,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging discussion in his Gillette Stadium office here. \u201cBut we\u2019ve all agreed to subjugate our right to disrupt everything\u201d \u2014 the Patriots declined to fight the league over financial penalties it levied on the team \u2014 \u201cI mean, we can, but we\u2019re a partnership. There\u2019s jealousy, there\u2019s envy, there\u2019s stupidity. Sometimes, life is unfair, and you have to suck it up and move on and not use it as an excuse.\u201dLet bygones be bygones? Not quite. Goodell has not been seen at a Patriots home game in two years, and on Sunday, rather than face the wrath of Patriots fans, he will, for the second consecutive week, travel to Atlanta for the N.F.C. Championship game instead.This relationship may have evolved into one of the biggest tests of the diplomatic skills \u2014 in football and in his larger world of finance and philanthropy \u2014 that Kraft prides himself on.Never mind that he owns one of the most polarizing teams, one that, while certainly beloved in New England, has failed to attract the kind of passionate national following of the Cowboys or the Packers.Some of the distaste, of course, reflects a jealousy created by their four Super Bowl titles \u2014 and six appearances in the title game \u2014 over the last 15 years.And Brady and those footballs.Kraft, a native of Brookline, Mass., who bought the Patriots 23 years ago for a then-record $172 million, chalks up such animosity to the team\u2019s success. He has an apartment in Manhattan, and in the years after he bought the team, he would get razzed by people on the street.\u201cThey used to be aggressive and nasty, and now they\u2019re more respectful because I think we\u2019ve been able to do pretty well and sustained it,\u201d Kraft said.Still, the friction cuts against the image of affability and reason that Kraft, 75, likes to project.When a New York Times reporter stepped into his office, the first thing Kraft did was hand him two small cartons of eggs from his family farm, assuring him they would be the best he had ever eaten. On his desk facing visitors was a small plaque with the greeting \u201cShalom Y\u2019all!\u201dThe 30 minutes allotted for the interview went on way longer, though some of it was given to asides and stem-winding tangents.Kraft, whose billions come primarily from a packaging and paper empire and an assortment of other investments, sidestepped questions about whether winning a Super Bowl would have any extra meaning this year.Until Deflategate, he and Goodell publicly got along well, and Kraft takes pride in his facility for building relationships with a wide range of sports figures, celebrities, politicians and business leaders. One week, Secretary of State John Kerry might join him in his suite, and the next it\u2019s media titans like Rupert Murdoch and Leslie Moonves.Among N.F.L. owners, whose politics tilt Republican, Kraft is among the most loyal donors to Democratic candidates. Yet he, as well as Brady and Belichick, considers President-elect Donald J. Trump a good friend, a tricky relationship in heavily Democratic Massachusetts, which voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin.Kraft said they met 20 years ago when Trump invited him to play golf at his club in West Palm Beach, Fla.\u201cLoyalty is important to me, and he has been a wonderful friend,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cI think one of the great problems in the country today is the working poor, the middle class, that there hasn\u2019t been growth in income on an equal basis, and I really think the policies he\u2019s going to bring to bear are going to be great for the economic side of America.\u201dIt is hard to tell if his association with Trump is costing the team fans, but then, as a team owner and businessman, he is used to being a target.He has had legal fights with business partners, including those with a stake in the land where Gillette Stadium now stands.Patriots fans, too, lashed out at Kraft for not doing more to fight the N.F.L. during Deflategate.Yet he is influential enough in the league that owners and officials prefer to keep their criticisms of him to private conversations.When Kraft and other team owners clash over league issues, it is usually behind closed doors.\u201cWe do have dissent and do have things I think you couldn\u2019t help but have,\u201d said the Dallas Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, who rivals Kraft for influence in the league. \u201cI think Bob has exhibited disagreement, but he\u2019s also very capable of making and influencing change. I\u2019m someone, if he has ideas, I would certainly be a good listener.\u201dKraft is still a very hands-on owner, but three of his sons have taken on greater responsibilities with the Patriots and the family\u2019s portfolio of company investments, including a Major League Soccer team, the New England Revolution.More and more, Kraft said, he is focusing on strategizing and bringing people together. Like Arabs and Jews.He has sought to broker Middle East conciliation through sports and investments, citing economic interdependence as a unifying agent. Several years ago, Kraft, who is Jewish, operated a packaging company that employed Israelis and Palestinians. He has taken dozens of Christian friends to Israel, including Brady and, in 2015, 19 former N.F.L. players, some of whom were baptized in the Jordan River.Still, though he often portrays himself as a unifier, some people \u2014 or teams \u2014 do irk him. Like the Indianapolis Colts.McGinest said he understood how Kraft could still be offended.\u201cWhen you take away from somebody\u2019s hard work or everything that goes into winning those types of games, it\u2019s pretty upsetting,\u201d said McGinest, now an analyst for NFL Network. \u201cThat\u2019s his baby. Those players are all his. That team, it\u2019s his baby.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t deem it as normal,\u201d Martin, who also traveled to Israel with Kraft, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI thought it was something that was very rare.\u201dNow a businessman himself, Martin cherishes the day during his rookie season, in 1995, when Kraft invited him to a cardboard-box plant he owned.\u201cEverything has a process to it,\u201d Martin said, explaining the lesson he learned. \u201cAnd when you neglect the process, you ultimately neglect your ability to be successful at whatever you\u2019re striving for. That\u2019s an experience I\u2019ll never forget.\u201dKraft, former players say, is a regular presence in the locker room, where front-office personnel rarely tread, greeting players, even those who are not stars, by name. Sometimes, he can show a playful, self-deprecating side.During receiver Donte Stallworth\u2019s first stint in New England, in 2007, he and Randy Moss were leaving the cafeteria on their way to the receivers meeting room when Kraft stopped them in the hallway and handed them a manila folder. Opening it, Moss and Stallworth burst into laughter: Inside was a photograph of Kraft and the rapper 50 Cent sipping mai tais on a beach.\u201cI know you two young men are pretty cool and you guys are young studs,\u201d Kraft told them, according to Stallworth. \u201cI\u2019m an old guy, but I\u2019m not too bad myself.\u201dStallworth added: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t walk around like he owns the place, even though he does.\u201dIndeed, Kraft was very at home in his office, which is stuffed with photos, memorabilia and knickknacks.Cradling a big cup of Dunkin Donuts coffee, Kraft spoke about how he had managed to maintain consistent success at the Patriots, whether they win the Super Bowl this year or not.\u201cMy job is to keep everyone together, strong big egos, and keep the peace in the family,\u201d he said.Looming large near his desk, propped against a wall, was a painting of Brady.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Head of Veterans Health System Is Trump\u2019s Pick to Lead Veterans Affairs", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byIn a move that left many veterans groups breathing a sigh of relief, President-elect Donald J. Trump on Wednesday selected the current head of the nation\u2019s sprawling veterans health care system, Dr. David J. Shulkin, an appointee of President Obama\u2019s, to become secretary of veterans affairs.If confirmed, he will be the first secretary to lead the department who is not a veteran.While Mr. Trump\u2019s chosen cabinet is largely made up of Washington outsiders, Dr. Shulkin, 57, is a relative insider. He has helped lead several private health care systems, including Beth Israel Medical Center in New York and the University of Pennsylvania Health System. In 2015, he was appointed under secretary for health by Mr. Obama and told to cut wait times in the troubled health care system, which includes 1,700 hospitals and clinics that serve nearly nine million veterans.In that time, Dr. Shulkin has nearly doubled the amount of health care that veterans receive through private doctors. But he has also rejected calls for broader privatization, saying that it would cost untold billions and undermine the hospital system \u2014 a stance that puts him at odds with Mr. Trump.While campaigning, the president-elect regularly criticized the department as hopelessly corrupt and incompetent, and said he would allow all veterans to choose to go to private doctors. But the selection of Dr. Shulkin may signal that Mr. Trump plans to take a more measured approach.\u201cThe Trump campaign made a big deal of what a sucking chest wound the V.A. was,\u201d said Phillip Carter, an Iraq veteran who studies the agency for the Center for a New American Security, a research organization that focuses on the military and veterans. \u201cThen they realized how hard it would be to turn around, and decided they needed to continue with the reforms that are already taking effect.\u201dA list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Mr. Carter, who advised Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign on veterans issues, called Dr. Shulkin a smart choice, saying he was among a very small group with the expertise to run a large, complicated health care system.\u201cHe knows the V.A. but he is not of the V.A.,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cHe comes from the private sector and knows how to blend private and public care.\u201dMr. Trump praised Dr. Shulkin on Wednesday, saying in a statement, \u201cI have no doubt Dr. Shulkin will be able to lead the turnaround.\u201dThe pick came after weeks of scrambling by the Trump transition team, which the president-elect said had considered \u201cat least 100\u201d candidates to lead the troubled agency. Names under consideration included former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and former Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, as well as a few generals and admirals.Three weeks ago, the team settled on Toby Cosgrove, the chief executive of the Cleveland Clinic and a former Air Force surgeon, but he turned down the offer, according to a person close to the transition team who was not authorized to speak publicly.That left the team divided. Some favored one of the few remaining candidates, Pete Hegseth, an Iraq veteran and Fox News commentator. But others saw him as too extreme because for years he ran Concerned Veterans for America, a small advocacy group financed by the Koch brothers\u2019 network that seeks to discredit and privatize the veterans health care system.The news, announced by Mr. Trump at a news conference on Wednesday, left many veterans groups bewildered but pleased.\u201cThis is a very surprising pick, but he is the best out of all the candidates,\u201d Paul Rieckhoff, the executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said of Dr. Shulkin. The group\u2019s membership would have preferred a veteran, Mr. Rieckhoff said, but added that Dr. Shulkin was well respected. \u201cWe know him, we trust him and we can work with him,\u201d he said.Dr. Shulkin will inherit a thicket of challenges in the aging and overburdened veterans health care system. Its hospitals often do not pay enough to attract new staff members, even as demand rises. Waits for appointments have not fallen since a scandal over the delays in 2014 prompted Eric Shinseki to resign as secretary.The department\u2019s computerized records system is obsolete and unable to communicate with outside doctors. And though its buildings are on average more than 50 years old, closing underused centers is often politically impossible.\u201cSomeone new coming in could take a year just to understand the issues,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone like David Shulkin really provides continuity that can get reforms moving forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Skip the G.M.O.s: Park Slope Food Co-op Fights Over Its Pension Fund", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported bySo it came as a shock last November when the co-op\u2019s 17,100 members learned that its pension fund was stuffed with speculative microcap stocks \u2014 like Intrexon, a company hoping to fight the Zika virus by unleashing genetically modified mosquitoes in the Florida Keys.The pensions are not for co-op members; members must, in fact, work at no pay in exchange for access to the co-op\u2019s much-publicized low prices. The pension plan is for the co-op\u2019s roughly 90 paid employees, including about 20 retirees. It appears to have gone into hedge fund mode years ago, when one co-op member, also a hedge fund investor, made stock-picking his unpaid job.The other members were unaware of this until last summer, when an auditor let fly a bolt from the blue: The fund had racked up two straight years of losses, and the co-op had to pour in more than $1 million to keep it flush.Laid-back co-op members reacted to this news like shareholders stung by an unexplained dividend cut. Some feared a wag-the-dog effect, in which the pension fund would keep losing money and sucking more and more cash away from the co-op as more people retired. Labor costs would rise, and that would be the end of the benefit that drew them all to the co-op in the first place: food prices 20 to 40 percent below those in supermarkets.\u201cDoes the co-op wish to continue on this rather hair-raising course?\u201d asked Mark Kuzmack, a member who aired his views in the co-op\u2019s newspaper, The Linewaiters Gazette, so named because members read it while waiting in line at the registers.The members will vote on a reform proposal on Tuesday evening, at what is expected to be a stormy meeting. The proposal calls for oversight of the co-op\u2019s two pension trustees, who have until now operated on their own. Some of the 90 paid employees suspect \u201coversight\u201d is just a code word for the real agenda: getting rid of their pensions.The co-op\u2019s founding member and general coordinator, Joseph L. Holtz, who is also a trustee, said in an interview that a new layer of oversight was unnecessary. The stocks were recovering nicely from their swoon, he said, and in any case they were all being liquidated and replaced with safer investments.\u201cThe members have clearly spoken, either through their letters or their statements at general meetings, that they\u2019re not interested in investing in that much volatility,\u201d he said.In addition, he said, the pension trustees will stop wearing two hats, serving both as fiduciaries and stock pickers. The trustee responsible for the biotech stocks will step down, once he finishes liquidating the portfolio, a process that will take months.\u201cYou don\u2019t just sell $7 million of stocks overnight,\u201d Mr. Holtz said.The other trustee is George W. Haywood, a professional investor who worked in the past as a hedge fund manager and Lehman Brothers bond trader. He is also a Brooklyn native and a member of the co-op, though now he lives in Washington. Mr. Haywood did not respond to messages requesting comment.\u201cGeorge Haywood is a high-profile Beltway insider,\u201d said Avi Fisher, another of the many co-op members who aired their views in The Linewaiters Gazette. \u201cI am curious why and how we have a relationship with him. It certainly isn\u2019t because there\u2019s a dearth of financial acumen in New York City.\u201dMr. Haywood is the biggest holder of a stock in the pension fund, that of Neptune Technologies and Bioressources. Neptune makes edible oil from krill, a small, shrimplike crustacean, and promotes it as a nutrition supplement superior to fish oil.Some co-op members see a conflict of interest in Mr. Haywood\u2019s roles as a pension trustee, a pension stock picker and the biggest holder of one of those stocks.In December, with controversy swirling around the pension fund, Mr. Haywood told The Linewaiters Gazette that no conflict of interest existed.\u201cOwning stock,\u201d he said at the time, \u201cdoesn\u2019t make you an insider. We\u2019re not trading on any insider information.\u201dHe said he had traded the shares on a public exchange and did not charge any fee for his services.Mr. Holtz recalled that when the pension plan was established, in 1993, there had also been worries about the risks it might pose to the co-op. He said an actuary had set up a schedule of funding and benefit accruals that would make it safe and sustainable, as long as the co-op put in 1 percent of its sales every year. Projected annual growth, of both the co-op\u2019s sales and the pension fund\u2019s investments, would take care of the rest.The academic papers have won respect from specialists, but not much understanding by the public at large.In Park Slope, however, gentrification turns out to have brought not only craft beers, man buns and deluxe baby buggies, but also a cohort of sophisticated finance professionals who still join the co-op for its cheap food.One of them, Jonathan Hessney, went to a recent general meeting armed with his own analysis of the pension investments. He showed that the investments had zigzagged up and down since the crash of 2008 \u2014 but that in the end, the fund would have been better off just holding cash.Mr. Hessney also showed that the co-op had not put in the actuary\u2019s recommended 1 percent of sales every year, presumably because the trustees thought aggressive investments would make the whole plan cheaper. Many people still do.Members at the meeting did not seem to know whom to believe, Mr. Hessney or Mr. Holtz, who is widely revered at Park Slope for devising its free-work-for-cheap-food business model.Mr. Holtz said he predicted that his confidence in the old investment strategy would be borne out on Tuesday, when he plans to reveal the fund\u2019s average annual return from 1993 to the present, a period that includes the biggest bull market in American history.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be over 9 percent,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Golfs?", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "After years of supporting work and high-profile Prada campaigns, an actor known for his translucent eyes and angsty roles headlines two major films.Supported byGolf?\u201cI always say if I could do anything, I would be a professional golfer,\u201d said Mr. DeHaan, whose handicap is a country-club respectable 12, on a windy December morning at the driving range at Chelsea Piers in New York. \u201cBut I\u2019m not good enough, so I\u2019m an actor.\u201d He reared back and drove into a golf ball with a satisfying thwack, and it sailed out toward the Hudson River.Finding one of American film\u2019s favorite young interpreters of subcutaneous roil on the links (or the range, barring that) was not what I expected, I told Mr. DeHaan.\u201cNo one expects me to golf,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are so many moody, brooding people on golf courses. But I always say that golfing and acting are very similar to me. I think they\u2019re both singular practices. It\u2019s something that no matter how hard I work at, or practice, I will never be as good as I want to be.\u201d (There\u2019s that roil.)That break has been primed by independent films like \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines\u201d and the studio-system imprimatur of a key role as the Green Goblin in \u201cThe Amazing Spiderman 2.\u201dMr. DeHaan is, unlike many young actors, untroubled by his slow and steady ascent. He lives a not-particularly-starry and personal-assistant-free life in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, after an unhappy two-and-a-half-year stint in Los Angeles.\u201cI feel like Hollywood can really take people, take a hold of them and make them feel pressure that doesn\u2019t need to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want Hollywood to influence me, I want to influence Hollywood.\u201dHe now shuttles there a week or two a year for meetings. (He also admits he takes himself too seriously \u201calmost all the time.\u201d)\u201cI think a lot of people put that pressure on themselves,\u201d he said, gazing out over the driving range. \u201cI think people feel like this is their moment and they have to capitalize on it, or whatever. I want to do this forever. So I\u2019m more than happy to just kind of let things happen.\u201dMr. DeHaan looks younger than his 30 years, and his delicate, almost alien handsomeness makes him an unusual fit for a Hollywood megastar. He had to adopt a \u201cbro lifestyle\u201d to bulk up for \u201cValerian.\u201d But he has always found support among directors, including Steven Spielberg, who cast him in a small part in \u201cLincoln,\u201d and Mr. Cianfrance.\u201cMovie stars have this charisma to them, this undeniable thing where you can\u2019t stop looking at them,\u201d Mr. Cianfrance said. With Mr. DeHaan, he said, \u201cI felt that same kind of magic as when I met Ryan or Bradley for the first time.\u201d (Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper were co-stars in \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines.\u201d)At the time of his casting in that film, Mr. DeHaan was not well known; Mr. Cianfrance had not seen any of his other films. \u201cThere was discussion of other more established actors for that role, and actors that would have secured financing in an easier way in that time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut across the board, he was undeniable.\u201dMr. DeHaan has an intensity that holds the screen, whether he is uncovering the sinister truth about a Swiss spa in \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d (\u201cWe want to do what \u2018Jaws\u2019 did to a day at the beach to the health spa,\u201d Mr. Verbinski said) or battling aliens as a time-traveling special agent in \u201cValerian.\u201d\u201cWith Dane, 30 seconds after I sat down at the bar with him, the restaurant, I knew that it was him, for sure,\u201d said Mr. Besson, the director of \u201cValerian.\u201d \u201cAfter one minute, my problem is, if he says no, I\u2019m in trouble. It was already printed in my head.\u201d\u201cValerian\u201d is a different kind of film, and a different kind of acting, for Mr. DeHaan, who is classically trained and speaks reverently of \u201cdoing\u201d rather than \u201cacting.\u201d (On the inside of his forearm, \u201ci do.\u201d is tattooed in tiny letters, as a reminder.) \u201cValerian\u201d was shot largely in front of a blue screen, for the visual effects to be added in later. And yet, Mr. Besson said, \u201cyou can see what he\u2019s seeing. He\u2019s watching the alien or the spaceship. You have no doubt about it.\u201dAfter five months shooting \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d in Germany, and six months shooting \u201cValerian\u201d in Paris, Mr. DeHaan returned to Brooklyn for a break. His wife, the actress Anna Wood, is pregnant; their first child is due in the spring.\u201cUnless I make an effort to be home, I would probably never be home,\u201d he said.So he has lolled for a few months enjoying what may be the twilight of his mostly anonymous life, trying to separate himself from stardom and all the oddities it entails. Golf, now a more occasional hobby than the everyday obsession it was when he was a young boy in Allentown, Pa., helps.\u201cOne of the reasons I still love it is that when I\u2019m golfing, all I think about is golfing,\u201d he said, as I lobbed questions about his first trip to the Cannes Film Festival and the roles that got away. At the mention of an agent, his swing, once balletic and effective, fell out of joint.\u201cSee?\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cStart bringing up business, and I start spraying balls all over the place.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Trillion-Dollar Question: Why Don\u2019t More Women Run Mutual Funds?", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byIf you stop to consider who runs the thousands of mutual funds in America, you might conjure up an image of offices full of men. Then your brain might auto-correct to include some fund managers who are women.Equally astounding: Whether here or overseas, the numbers have scarcely budged since 2008.So, in a field where every fraction of a percentage point counts, why would this disparity persist?\u201cWe think of ourselves as a meritocracy in finance, but this begs some hard questions,\u201d said Katherine Collins, chief executive of Honeybee Capital, an independent research firm in Boston.You may be tempted to blame the usual suspects (like industry bias and old-boys\u2019 networks), but there\u2019s no single culprit here. For women, the pipeline into investment management needs repairs and upgrades from start to finish.Based on extensive interviews with people in the industry, it appears that women in college and graduate school would benefit from: greater awareness of asset management jobs and what they entail; better recruitment, clearer entry points; and a culture that supports and rewards the talents women bring to the table.There may even be ways that women can put on their hard hats and help with the pipeline\u2019s construction.Let\u2019s start with awareness. If you\u2019re a young woman in college or getting your M.B.A., how do you set your sights on investment management as a career?Many women simply don\u2019t know these roles are open to them. Men may lack that awareness as well, but there is a specific domino effect here that has an impact on women: The dearth of women in asset management means there are very few role models for young women, which means there are few connections to bring women into these roles, which perpetuates a lack of visibility.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to say, \u2018I want to get my M.B.A. and then go into asset management,\u2019 when you don\u2019t know that option exists,\u201d said Mandana Hormozi, co-manager of the Franklin Mutual Beacon Fund at Franklin Mutual Series, an investment group under Franklin Templeton Investments.Like many women, Ms. Hormozi got her M.B.A. assuming she\u2019d go into investment banking, a field that tends to loom large on the business school radar. Although she eventually made the shift into asset management, she says it is easy for women to miss these opportunities. \u201cThe lack of awareness is huge,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really have to shine a light on it.\u201dMany people are trying. Lakshmi Bhojraj, executive director of the Parker Center for Investment Research at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell, started a Women in Investing conference for M.B.A. students and a similar conference last year for undergraduates. \u201cWe just weren\u2019t seeing enough applicants for our investment management track,\u201d she said.When women realize how male-dominated investment management is, she said, \u201cit can be a bit daunting for them.\u201d The Cornell conferences are meant to give women the opportunity to talk to other women about these jobs, without feeling self-conscious.Why are some women daunted by the idea of pursuing a career in asset management? One possible reason: Few people know what asset managers do. Women in particular may be surprised to learn that the job is just as much about seeing the world, as it is sitting at a desk crunching numbers, said Noriko H. Chen, an equity portfolio manager with the Capital Group in San Francisco. She co-manages its American Funds New Perspective Fund and the American Funds Developing World Growth and Income Fund.Ms. Chen entered college with a nonfinancial career in mind; she was a pre-med major. But her father had always encouraged her to invest, she says, and she had a natural interest in picking stocks. With the money she earned from a part-time job, Ms. Chen invested small amounts in companies whose products she knew well, like computers and ice cream. She gravitated toward jobs with financial companies during the summer. After she graduated, Ms. Chen decided to forgo medicine and move into finance.Many portfolio managers start as research analysts, where they\u2019re assigned to a cover a specific industry. At Capital Group, Ms. Chen began as an infrastructure analyst in Asia, evaluating companies that produced building materials. \u201cI saw a lot of cement plants,\u201d she said, laughing, but said she found the details of the work fascinating. She walked through factories, talked to workers, and met with management teams, distributors and customers to decide whether to recommend buying shares of a company.\u201cYou really have to get out there and kick the tires,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a relationship job.\u201d Analysts can cover an industry for years, she said, building connections that help them dig up insights about a company.Back at her desk, Ms. Chen would build a financial model of each company, helping her decide whether to recommend that portfolio managers invest in it. Once she became a portfolio manager herself, she relied on similar skills, but took on more responsibility. \u201cYou become more of a generalist,\u201d Ms. Chen said, often overseeing many industries and evaluating the recommendations of different research analysts in deciding whether to buy stock for a fund.Some of the work may sound glamorous: traveling the world and pulling the trigger on big investments. But it\u2019s that last part \u2014 actually sinking money into stocks \u2014 where the intimidation factor kicks in for many women. \u201cWhen you buy, you have to put your money where your mouth is,\u201d Ms. Chen said, \u201cand you have to be willing to be wrong.\u201dIn one sense, running an active stock portfolio is a bit like baseball: Winning is important, yes, but winners don\u2019t hit every ball, and portfolio managers don\u2019t always pick winning stocks. \u201cMistakes can be about 40 percent of your job,\u201d Ms. Chen said, \u201cand that can be harder for women, who often want to do things perfectly.\u201d Good portfolio managers typically try to take the long view, she said. They need to assess risk, make choices, endure their mistakes \u2014 and from these, learn to make better choices, Ms. Chen said. \u201cIt\u2019s about resilience.\u201dUnfortunately, many women seem reluctant to enter a field that constantly tests their ability to weather setbacks \u2014 or perhaps they need practice. Stock-picking contests are common at the M.B.A. level. They\u2019re designed to help students practice quantitative assessment in a low-stakes environment. Yet many women just won\u2019t do them, Ms. Chen said.Elissa Sangster, executive director of the Fort\u00e9 Foundation, a nonprofit that helps women start careers in business and finance, speculated that some women may harbor \u201cconcerns about their quantitative readiness,\u201d and thus avoid not only stock-picking competitions, but the financial track altogether.About 36 percent of M.B.A. students are women, up from 32 percent in 2011, according to Fort\u00e9. \u201cBut when you drill down, you see a discrepancy between those pursuing marketing versus finance,\u201d Ms. Sangster said. \u201cOnly about 15 to 20 percent of women M.B.A.s go into finance.\u201dOne of Fort\u00e9\u2019s missions is to encourage women to flex their quantitative muscles. \u201cWe want women managing more capital, and we know that results are being left on the table because they aren\u2019t pursuing these careers,\u201d she said.In addition to building more entry points into the job pipeline, some companies are striving to improve recruitment \u2014 a wonky process in asset management. Because companies in this field typically do not hire as many candidates annually as investment banks do, asset management firms often lack a strong presence on M.B.A. campuses, or start their recruiting after students have already accepted other jobs. So even if you\u2019re interested in asset management, it can be tricky to figure out how to land a job.Again, men may face the same hurdles here, but they are more likely to have an established network of contacts to help them find jobs, says Adrienne R. Martinez, director of corporate and foundation relations at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Ms. Martinez started out on the asset management track in the Cornell M.B.A. program, but says she didn\u2019t see a clear path to a job. In contrast, her fellow investment-banking students, most of them men, had a well-worn road map. \u201cEvery Friday they were on the bus to New York, to network on Wall Street,\u201d she said. \u201cThe second-years told the first-years what to do. It was like a conveyor belt.\u201dAlthough Ms. Martinez did land an asset management job in New York in 2008, she says it was difficult to find a similar job when she relocated to North Carolina in 2013.To remedy the erratic recruitment process that women in particular face, Capital Group, Franklin Templeton, Vanguard and other companies have created programs to attract undergrads, mentor women transitioning from other fields and reach out to female M.B.A.s several years after they graduate.The CFA Institute, which offers the chartered financial analyst credential held by many portfolio managers, started the Alpha and Gender Diversity conference in 2015; it\u2019s now an annual event. Vanguard even offers an onsite internship program with portfolio management groups \u201cso an employee can try it on for size,\u201d Tim Buckley, chief investment officer at Vanguard, wrote in an email.But there is still that elephant in the middle of all this: the reputation of Wall Street itself as a culture that\u2019s unfriendly to women. \u201cHistorically, money management has had a reputation for being a tough environment for women,\u201d Mr. Buckley said.Is it particularly hard on women? Ms. Hormozi doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cIt depends on your personality,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see any reason for intimidation. If you\u2019re in a room with six guys, you have an advantage. I always get my questions answered. But I\u2019m not a wallflower.\u201dStill, many people say that the boys\u2019 club of Wall Street is alive and well, and \u2014 despite all the research on women\u2019s investing acumen \u2014 the financial world isn\u2019t always set up to value women\u2019s skills. \u201cThere is a tendency to reward aggression,\u201d said Ms. Collins of Honeybee Capital, formerly a top portfolio manager at Fidelity for 11 years.For men and women, these are high-paying jobs. The starting salary for a portfolio manager can be in the mid six figures, but a significant chunk of a fund manager\u2019s compensation is paid as a bonus, and that\u2019s where big differences can emerge. Many fund managers are paid on the basis of one-year performance, which can reinforce short-term strategies that go for the big win.In effect, some of the qualities that may make many women successful asset managers \u2014 keeping a cool head, being calculated about taking on risk, taking a long-term view \u2014 can work against them. \u201cWomen often get left out of the limelight, and the dollars follow,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Some companies, like Capital Group, have set up new bonus parameters so that fund managers are rewarded based on one-, three- and eight-year performance. The aim is to provide a greater incentive for all fund managers to think long-term, and to make compensation more \u201cmeritocratic,\u201d Ms. Chen said. Otherwise, she said, some women grow frustrated when they believe they have to \u201cplay the same games or embrace the same hobbies\u201d as male colleagues in order to be recognized. \u201cI like playing golf,\u201d Ms. Chen said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t have time to play golf.\u201dThere\u2019s an issue of attrition as well. Many women shy away from starting financial careers because of the lack of \u201cflexibility,\u201d often a code word for having children. Once you have your M.B.A., you\u2019re likely in your mid-20s or later. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pivotal time, when women want to start a family,\u201d said Ms. Bhojraj of Cornell. \u201cMany women worry that they can\u2019t balance it all, and they\u2019ll want to step off. Firms need to be more creative in coming up with ways to retain them.\u201dThe program places college sophomores and juniors in a 10-week summer training program in asset management that builds awareness of the field, allowing them to make connections, acquire technical investment knowledge and get a feel for what these careers are like.Ultimately, the bottom line is truly about the bottom line \u2014 for financial companies and investors. All-female and mixed-gender teams combined now oversee nearly $3 trillion of mutual fund assets in America, Morningstar says. Considering that greater gender diversity seems to improve performance, it appears that closing the gender gap isn\u2019t just good for women. It\u2019s a potentially terrific investment for everyone.Follow M.P. Dunleavey on Twitter @mpdunleavey.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s below freezing here. She\u2019s been up for an hour already, checking emails and sending a quick note to her husband, who is looking after their two boys, but mostly, she admits, blow-drying her hair. This is her first observation of the day: Davos Woman gets less sleep than Davos Man because of her hair.Ms. Bohnet studies gender inequality. A behavioral economist at the Harvard Kennedy School, she is one of about 600 female participants at this year\u2019s World Economic Forum. There are about 2,400 men \u2014 that\u2019s 80 percent of all participants. The gender imbalance here very much reflects the dearth of female leaders in the real world. As one female American executive put it: \u201cWho do they think they are? The Senate?\u201dI was curious: What is it like to be Davos Woman for a day?We step into the Davos dawn and start walking down the icy sidewalk. Ms. Bohnet\u2019s first appointment is a breakfast panel on how to increase gender diversity in companies. She recently wrote a book on the subject and will be one of the speakers.Ms. Bohnet arrived the day before and caught the end of the conference\u2019s annual women\u2019s reception. This is where female newcomers to Davos receive advice from the regulars \u2014 a sort of survivors\u2019 guide for the 20 percent. Bring sturdy shoes. Expect long security lines. Don\u2019t be intimidated, but if you are, don\u2019t show it.Judging from the stories here, Davos Man is still coming to terms with the presence of Davos Woman. High-powered women getting mistaken for the \u201cplus one.\u201d The confusion of men when they meet with female executives.Ms. Bohnet knows the drill. This is her fourth year as Davos Woman. She is wearing sturdy shoes and carries her high heels in a spare bag.There are quite a few men in the line at the Morosani Schweizerhof hotel. \u201cThat\u2019s encouraging,\u201d Ms. Bohnet whispers.Have they all gotten up this early to learn about gender equality? We quickly discover that there is a finance breakfast scheduled for the same time.Still, of the roughly 200 people who have come for the gender discussion, perhaps a third are men. And half of the speakers are women. This is good, in my thinking.The first time I came to Davos, in 2002, it was pretty standard to have a panel with four middle-aged men. A \u201cmanel,\u201d as women here call it.The setup for the rare female speaker was often awkward. Microphones that interfered with earrings. Barstool-like chairs that made legs dangle, skirts ride up and high heels fall off.Not today.Over the next hour and a half, it almost seems as if the corporate world could be on the cusp of a gender revolution. Unilever and Mercer are using a gender-neutral assessment test to hire employees. SAP is using a big data tool to evaluate employees and job ads that avoid adjectives like \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201ccompetitive\u201d that have been shown to put off women. The number of female managers has risen at all three companies.This is all in Ms. Bohnet\u2019s book, \u201cWhat Works,\u201d a blueprint for how to de-bias organizations rather than human beings. We are all biased, she explains. \u201cEven if you have the best intentions, it\u2019s hard to overcome your unconscious biases.\u201dHer favorite example is about the top orchestras in the United States, which began having auditions behind curtains in the 1970s. At the time only 5 percent of their musicians were women. Orchestra directors were confident that they did not need the curtain and that they had been choosing candidates purely on sound.But with the curtain, the proportion of female musicians in American orchestras started to rise. It\u2019s nearly 40 percent today.It\u2019s not even lunchtime and I\u2019m beat. Ms. Bohnet pops an acetaminophen. Nine out of 10 panels have female speakers \u2014 so the 20 percent are in hot demand.We\u2019re walking down the Promenade, Davos\u2019s main street, passing Russia House (usually a coffee shop); the HSBC cafe (a shoe shop the rest of the year); the Salesforce Lounge (a bookstore); and the Facebook building, a two-story pop-up that will be dismantled after the conference.Ms. Bohnet is heading into a McKinsey studio, normally an office building, for an interview about her book.McKinsey has done extensive research to prove that gender diversity is good for business. It recently piloted an algorithm built to recruit employees without bias. The formula picked more women.\u201cWow,\u201d Ms. Bohnet says. \u201cAfter a morning like this, you really think something is happening.\u201dBack in reality, we are at an event on artificial intelligence run by two male presenters. There are 12 men in the audience and four women.When they open up the session for questions, two women in the back row raise their hands first, followed by a man in the front row.\u201cUm, shall we start with the front row?\u201d the speaker says, his eyes darting up and down.\u201cNo, let\u2019s start with a lady,\u201d the man in the front row quickly says. It\u2019s awkward.A woman asks about the impact of artificial intelligence on education and children. The man asks about the impact of the technology on the bottom line of his business.\u201cThat was cringy,\u201d Ms. Bohnet says later. \u201cI mean, it was good to call him out on wanting to pick the guy. But then the whole \u2018ladies first\u2019 thing.\u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t seem natural.\u201dWhat would she have done?\u201cUse a generic description: \u2018Let\u2019s start with the person in the blue scarf,\u2019 something like that,\u201d she offers.On our way out, we meet Sophia. She has beautiful soft features, clear skin, lightly made-up eyes and a winning smile.Sophia is an android, basically a hot female robot. Ms. Bohnet and I stop to take a closer look. \u201cHi,\u201d I say. Sophia nods and her smile deepens. She is pretty good at animating human expressions but is only beginning to learn about emotions, explains her maker, a lanky young man.It suddenly occurs to me that every android I\u2019ve ever seen is female. I ask Bob Goodson, the founder of Quid and an artificial intelligence specialist, whether he has ever come across any hot male androids made by women.\u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now that you mention it, yeah, all the androids I\u2019ve ever seen are females made by men.\u201dIt\u2019s a little creepy, I think. What does it mean for the next technological revolution if most smart machines are made by men? I remember something that was said in a session earlier: \u201cAlgorithms are only as unbiased as those who program them.\u201dBias is a big theme today. At a session that Ms. Bohnet moderates on forecasting bias, two professors \u2014 one male, one female \u2014 present together. He presents first; she doesn\u2019t interrupt him once. When she speaks, he interrupts her six times \u2014 once, as he puts it, to clarify, before repeating what she said just 30 seconds earlier.I\u2019m beginning to understand what women here mean when they tell me they\u2019re \u201cin the room but not in the conversation.\u201dNext on the schedule: a Harvard reception at the Steigenberger Grand Hotel Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, the poshest hotel in town. At the cloakroom we are told that bags with shoes now cost 5 Swiss francs to check. Call it a tax on women.I stop at the bathroom to freshen up.

The women\u2019s bathroom is quiet \u2014 one advantage of being among the 20 percent.The World Economic Forum actually has a female quota of sorts. Big companies are allowed to bring five people as long as one of them is a woman. Otherwise, the maximum is four.Whether the guys notice the imbalance is another question. \u201cWhen men see a room full of people and 20 percent are women, they see 50 percent,\u201d says Laura Liswood, secretary general of the Council of Women World Leaders, citing social science research.The guys think we\u2019re already there. Is 20 percent the new glass ceiling?Not among the millennials, it seems. The Global Shapers, the under-30 cohort of leaders in Davos, have a 50-50 gender split. Young women like Gianina Caviezel, 29, the founder of Student Impact, a management consultancy, tell me that gender equality is not a major focus for them, at least in the West. They care about climate change and youth unemployment and refugees. I remember feeling the same way \u2014 until I had children.I catch up with Ms. Bohnet after dinner. It\u2019s 11:20 p.m., early by Davos standards. But it\u2019s been a long day. We have changed shoes 10 times and gone through security eight times.

{"Headline": "Steven Mnuchin, Treasury Nominee, Failed to Disclose $100 Million in Assets", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe revelation came hours before Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, began testifying on Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee, which has historically been bipartisan in its demands for transparency from nominees. Mr. Mnuchin was ready to outline his vision for the economy and defend himself against claims that he headed a bank that ran a \u201cforeclosure machine\u201d during the financial crisis.\u201cThe Treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all Americans, including those who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the committee. \u201cWhen I look at Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s background, it\u2019s a stretch to find evidence he\u2019d be that kind of Treasury secretary.\u201dIn a hearing marked by sharp exchanges, Mr. Mnuchin struggled to answer questions about his use of tax havens as a hedge fund manager and whether he thought such loopholes should be closed.Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, pointedly asked Mr. Mnuchin if he was using Cayman Islands corporations to avoid taxation. He responded that he was working on behalf of his clients, in accordance with the law.\u201cLet me just be clear again: I did not use a Cayman Islands entity in any way to avoid paying taxes for myself,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cI would love to work with the I.R.S. to close these tax issues that make no sense.\u201dHe added: \u201cI would support changing the tax laws to make sure they are simpler and more effective.\u201dRepublicans came to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s defense, suggesting that none of his omissions were willful, and they gave strong indications that they would vote for him.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, defended Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s business record and described him as extremely qualified for the job.\u201cObjectively speaking, I don\u2019t believe anyone can reasonably argue that Mr. Mnuchin is unqualified for the position,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cIf the confirmation process focused mainly on the question of a nominee\u2019s qualifications, there would be little, if any, opposition to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s nomination.\u201dBut the process was also focused on Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s financial disclosure form, and that prompted intense scrutiny.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.\u201cIn his revised questionnaire, Mr. Mnuchin disclosed several additional financial assets, including $95 million worth of real estate \u2014 a co-op in New York City, a residence in Southampton, New York, a residence in Los Angeles, California, and $15 million in real estate holdings in Mexico,\u201d Democratic staff members of the Senate Finance Committee wrote in a memo on Thursday. \u201cMr. Mnuchin has claimed these omissions were due to a misunderstanding of the questionnaire.\u201dAccording to the memo, Mr. Mnuchin also initially failed to disclose that he is the director of Dune Capital International, an investment fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands, along with management posts in seven other investment funds.And he belatedly disclosed that his children own nearly $1 million in artwork.Asked about the omissions at the hearing, Mr. Mnuchin described them as a simple mistake made amid a mountain of bureaucracy.\u201cI think as you all can appreciate, filling out these government forms is quite complicated,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, noting that he had handed over 5,000 pages of disclosures. \u201cLet me first say, any oversight, it was unintentional.\u201dBut Democrats pounced and tied Mr. Mnuchin to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington.Pressed as to whether his failure to disclose the information was an ethical lapse, Mr. Mnuchin insisted that he was following the guidance of his lawyers and made an innocent error.\u201cI assure you that these forms were very complicated,\u201d he said, explaining that he had pledged to be forthcoming to \u201cthe best of my knowledge.\u201dSenator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, was unsatisfied with the response and shot back, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to understand the words \u2018list all positions.\u2019\u201dTo that, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, added: \u201cNever before has the Senate considered such an ethically challenged slate of nominees for key cabinet positions. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s failure to disclose his Cayman Islands holdings just reeks of the swamp that the president-elect promised to drain on the campaign trail.\u201dAnd American Bridge, the so-called Democratic super PAC, said Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s holdings were a sign that Mr. Trump\u2019s government would not look out for working class Americans.\u201cBy slamming through Mnuchin, Senate Republicans are becoming accessories to Trump\u2019s future corruption, helping him stack his cabinet with shady billionaires who, like Trump, will rig the government to serve their own interests at the expense of the American people,\u201d said Shripal Shah, vice president of American Bridge.Advertisement"}

Trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office, congressional Republicans treated his policy pronouncements \u2014 largely out of step with Republican dogma \u2014 as essentially a distraction. He would talk. They would drive the policies.But now, the question of whether congressional Republicans would change President Trump or Mr. Trump would change them has an early answer. Mr. Trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on Thursday, and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed.Mr. Trump said he could not wait for lawmakers to get to work on their newfound common ground. \u201cThis Congress is going to be the busiest Congress we\u2019ve had in decades, maybe ever,\u201d Mr. Trump said. In an apparent reference to forthcoming bills, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to sign the stuff that you\u2019re writing. You\u2019re not wasting your time.\u201dMany Republicans in Congress say his presidency is off to a substantive start, delivering on campaign promises to quell illegal immigration, reduce regulations, start the rollback of the health care law and reverse the Obama administration\u2019s decisions to halt the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects.\u201cI think he\u2019s completely winning the expectation game,\u201d said Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois. \u201cI think he\u2019s a genius at lowering expectations and overperforming,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s really remarkable.\u201d\u201cWe are in a very good place on tax reform,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cIt can get complicated when you get into the details of tax reform, but once we go through how tax reform works and what it\u2019s going to take to get the kind of competitive tax system, the kind of competitive tax rates, I think most people agree that this is the right approach.\u201dCongressional Republicans are also struggling to keep up with Mr. Trump\u2019s rapid-fire announcements, let alone push their agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s fast-paced stuff,\u201d said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. Investigating voter fraud, for instance, is not something he would like to see Congress take on. \u201cOur priorities are the ones we laid out,\u201d he said.They are also eager to get on with the rest of that agenda \u2014 specifically a repeal and, ostensibly, a replacement of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe are on the same page with the White House,\u201d Mr. Ryan insisted Thursday. \u201cThe president agrees with this agenda.\u201dBut it is the sudden embrace of federal spending that represents perhaps the most striking departure, with Republicans backing the concept of starting the financing for the border wall with a new appropriation.And the list is much longer. By contrast, last year, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, called Democrats\u2019 request for $600 million in aid to Flint added to an energy bill \u201ca huge earmark,\u201d adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s not something I could support,\u201d in keeping with most of his colleagues. Republicans also pushed for and partly succeeded in offsetting a bill to fight Zika last year.The talk of a spending surge has left some Republicans worried about an exploding deficit. \u201cThere are going to have to be some cuts,\u201d said Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah. \u201cI am not interested in raising our spending levels.\u201dSenator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, seemed tense when asked about the open checkbook. \u201cWe\u2019re a fiscally conservative group,\u201d he said of the committee. \u201cWe\u2019re going to want to see things paid for.\u201dRepublicans are also at times confused about what Mr. Trump is actually seeking when he makes policy declarations on Twitter. \u201c\u2018Appears\u2019 I think is the big word,\u201d said Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in the House of Representatives on the Republican side of the aisle wants to go through the legislative process,\u201d only to have the Trump administration send a bill back, he said.Republicans had expected to reveal great progress on their plans to replace the health care act here, but instead seemed stuck in a perpetual debate over the timeline of coming up with a replacement. Senators in large part made a strong argument for making sure that a replacement plan had been fashioned before repealing the law, while many in the House continue to push for a repeal with replacement coming much later.\u201cWhat you do by the pen can be dismantled by the pen,\u201d said Representative Tom Reed of New York.Mr. Trump is also trying to work his will on how the Senate operates. In an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, Mr. Trump said he thought Mr. McConnell should get rid of the Senate filibuster rule for Supreme Court nominees, calling those who would oppose his coming pick \u201cobstructionists.\u201dAbout three blocks from where Mr. Trump spoke, hundreds of protesters packed a plaza just across from City Hall to rally against the president. While the demonstration was organized around preserving the health care law, protesters showed up for a variety of causes. \u201cI don\u2019t trust anything he says,\u201d said Ken Snyder, 62.Emmarie Huetteman and John Eligon contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The G.O.P.\u2019s Health Care Death Spiral", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe proportion of uninsured Americans, which has dropped to less than 9 percent, the lowest on record, will at least double. By April, when filings from insurance company plans and premiums for 2018 are due, there will be a sizable exit \u2014 of insurers running away from the greatly increased and unpredictable risk and of individuals not able to afford insurance without the subsidies.Of course, the A.C.A. has a number of flaws, and repair is critical. But delay is not an option if the replacers really want to use private insurers to meet society\u2019s goals of access, affordability and quality in health care. All known Republican alternatives envision heavy reliance on the same insurers that are now ready to bolt and leave a total mess rather than a defective but repairable market.After they leave, the damage will spread to doctors and hospitals, whose bad debt will skyrocket when patients miss copays and drop coverage while providers and hospitals still must continue care.This is not speculation but based on my experience in the industry and as a member of the board of a public hospital that stands to lose substantial Medicaid payments if the state expansions are rolled back.Let\u2019s go back for a moment to pre-Obamacare days. Why did insurers refuse to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions, cancel policies if customers used them too much, set high premiums for women and old people, and so forth? These tools were the only way to limit risk when insurers didn\u2019t have a ready-made pool of sufficient size to balance the sick and well as employer-sponsored plans do.Refusing coverage and the like was good business, but it did not serve small businesses, the self-employed or other people unable to get the insurance they wanted. The Obamacare exchanges tried to fix this by requiring everyone to join the pool, providing premium and cost-sharing subsidies geared to income (the \u201caffordable\u201d in the law\u2019s name) and limiting risk to insurers to entice them to offer policies.It\u2019s a tricky business to fine-tune a market and encourage buyers and sellers to do the right thing \u2014 both providing access to individuals in need and encouraging enough insurers to join to make competition work. But George W. Bush, with some bipartisan support, did it not so long ago with the Medicare drug plans.But unfortunately, the A.C.A. law created by Democrats in Congress had several big flaws. Pricing restrictions \u2014 which essentially mandated that insurers overcharge younger customers relative to older ones \u2014 created the wrong incentives, and so too many older, sicker individuals joined, and younger, healthy people were discouraged.If you\u2019re wondering why insurers substantially increased premiums for this year, even far beyond the underlying health care inflation rate \u2014 now at around 4 percent \u2014 this shell game with risk is your answer.Ultimately, if the risk is too high, exit is inevitable. That is what my top-rated plan, Qualchoice, did in Ohio in the late 1990s to stem multimillion-dollar losses from its participation in the Medicaid Advantage managed care program. It\u2019s also what United Healthcare did and most others will do this spring when faced with the uncertainty of delay.Finally, none of the participants, in government or business, want to recognize that in many parts of the country, only one insurer or a highly consolidated health system dominates, which eliminates meaningful competition and choice.Since 2010, Republicans have made political hay by demonizing the mandate to buy insurance, subsidies to make it affordable and taxes on employers, suppliers, insurers and especially the wealthy to finance it. But now they own the problem and must fix it or do something better.Obamacare, or any plan that replaces it that is reliant on private insurers and individual enrollment, will succeed only under the following conditions: a meaningful incentive to purchase insurance (the individual mandate or equivalent); help to make it affordable; risk reduction for insurers to stabilize premiums; and enough funding to pay for it all.If any replacement plan doesn\u2019t include these elements, private insurance will revert to the chaos of the pre-A.C.A. market. In business, managing risk is important; in insurance, it is everything. Whoever plays games with it \u2014 knowingly or inadvertently \u2014 is playing with fire.If we manage this risk badly through repeal and delay, the damage to insurers, individuals, hospitals and professionals will be profound.J. B. Silvers is a professor of health finance at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Threat to U.S. Democracy: Political Dysfunction", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIs American democracy broken?There are precedents around the world for the kind of political jolt the United States experienced in November. They usually include a political firebrand who promises to sweep away a system rigged to serve the powerful rather than the interests of ordinary people. They usually end badly, when the popular champion decides to read electoral victory as an invitation to bend the institutions of democracy to the force of his will.I\u2019m skeptical that the United States is about to careen down the path taken by, say, Venezuela, governed by the whim of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2014 the handpicked successor of the populist champion Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who was elected in the late 1990s on a promise to sweep away an entrenched ruling class and proceeded to battle any democratic institution that stood in his way.Still, the embrace by millions of American voters of a billionaire authoritarian who argues that the \u201csystem\u201d has been rigged to serve a cosmopolitan ruling class against the interests of ordinary people does suggest that American democracy has a unique credibility problem.The United States resisted the temptations of Nazism, fascism and communism that beguiled Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Extreme parties like France\u2019s National Front or the United Kingdom Independence Party never established an American toehold. Populist candidates running as outsiders \u2014 Pat Buchanan, Ross Perot, Ralph Nader \u2014 could only tip the balance between the two parties of the establishment.And yet, when the 21st century brought about a populist insurrection, the United States government was quick to cave.But for all the reasons Americans may have to rebel against the status quo, what made the political system so vulnerable to a populist insurrection in November was that \u2014 for all its institutional strengths \u2014 the political system itself has come to be seen by too many voters as illegitimate.\u201cThere is persistent lack of confidence in U.S. political institutions which allows populists to make hay,\u201d said Pippa Norris, a political scientist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the University of Sydney in Australia. \u201cAnd the institutions need a major overhaul because some, like elections, are badly broken.\u201dThis is not just about the Electoral College system, which awarded the presidency to the candidate who lost the popular vote. It is not just about money\u2019s growing influence in politics, though that plays a part, too.The problems are embedded in the design of America\u2019s political institutions \u2014 with all their checks and balances ostensibly designed to slow down policy-making and prevent political extremists from swiftly taking over the gears of government. These institutions have produced a polarized government, paralyzed by partisan gridlock, unable to govern effectively. They have built a system easy to demonize as rigged.Based on the average evaluations of the elections in 2012 and 2014, the United States\u2019 electoral integrity was ranked 52nd among the 153 countries in the survey \u2014 behind all the rich Western democracies and also countries like Costa Rica and Uruguay, the Baltic states, and Cape Verde and Benin in Africa.The fact that each state has its own set of electoral regulations \u2014 covering things like the type of technology used and opening hours of the polls \u2014 means that Americans\u2019 voting rights can change substantially from state to state. And the party polarization that has gripped statehouses across the country has stymied attempts to build sensible, effective electoral regulations and bred mistrust.The patchwork of electoral systems \u2014 run by politically appointed local officials managing part-time workers \u2014 is hardly a recipe for competence. \u201cAmong mature democracies, the nuts and bolts of American contests seem notoriously vulnerable to incompetence and simple human errors,\u201d Ms. Norris notes.And there is little upon which to build consensual, bipartisan solutions. A system of political finance in which many candidates are funded by deep-pocketed single-interest groups like gun rights advocates and environmentalists will increase political polarization, even as it reduces public confidence in the system. So will electoral districts gerrymandered so narrowly for partisan benefit that even holding elections can seem pointless.Independent studies have found almost no instances of voter fraud in American elections. Still, Republicans consistently assert that it remains a clear and present danger. A consequence is that the number of states requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls has increased to 32, from 14 in 2000, making it more difficult for poorer, less educated voters to cast their ballots.Professor Norris says she believes that American political institutions can be fixed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t rocket science,\u201d she told me. For instance, to move the drawing of electoral districts out of partisan hands, as California has done, would greatly improve the nature of political contests.The difficult question, though, is whether the American political system can overcome political gridlock to fix itself. Here\u2019s hoping it can be done before the United States takes another turn down the path blazed by Venezuela.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Wrote to Carlos the Jackal, and an Israeli\u2019s Assassination Case Was Revived", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byReporter's NotebookAt the time, I was curious about why the F.B.I. had not found Colonel Alon\u2019s killers. The cold case was extraordinary: No Israeli official had ever before been assassinated in the United States. It was, at that point, the largest investigation the bureau had ever conducted.Acting on a hunch, I sent a copy to a man who might have known something about the murder: Ilich Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez, the Venezuelan terrorist and Muslim convert better known as Carlos the Jackal. He was not hard to find. He was in a French prison, serving a life sentence for killing two French security agents in 1975.To my surprise, Mr. Ram\u00edrez wrote back the next year. He claimed to have information about the murder. \u201cContact with the volunteers who executed the operation in Washington was lost long ago,\u201d he wrote. Given that distance, he added, he could \u201cdisclose the unusual manner in which \u2018Operation Alon\u2019 came to be.\u201dThere was one catch: Mr. Ram\u00edrez wanted money in exchange for information. I declined to pay him and moved on to other stories. The F.B.I. had other plans.Last month, the F.B.I. revealed that it had reopened its investigation into the killing of Colonel Alon. Why? An F.B.I. agent based in Paris, Eugene Casey, had learned about Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s letter to me.Mr. Ram\u00edrez, the F.B.I. agent said, told him everything he knew about the killing of the Israeli.Colonel Alon was a decorated pilot who had flown dozens of missions in Israel\u2019s 1948 War of Independence and helped found the country\u2019s formidable air force. He had been sent to Washington in 1970 for a three-year stint to help make sure that his country had the most up-to-date military weapons, such as F-4 Phantoms, that Israel needed.Colonel Alon, 43, a father to three daughters, was killed a month before his tour was to end.On the day of his death, a Palestine Liberation Organization radio broadcast from Cairo announced that Colonel Alon had been shot as payback for the killing by Israel of the leader of Black September, the Palestinian terrorist group.In 1978, the F.B.I. closed the investigation into Colonel Alon\u2019s death, called \u201cMurda,\u201d or \u201cMurder of Assistant Air Attach\u00e9 Col. Joseph Alon.\u201d There was scant evidence, some of it lost forever, and there were no witnesses. I interviewed agents who had investigated the murder and contacted former C.I.A. officials who might know something.I learned that the C.I.A. thought that a two-man Black September hit team had entered the country and left after the killing. But the F.B.I. was never able to confirm that.Although the murder had been long forgotten, the Police Department in Montgomery County, Md., still had an interest in the case. There was no statute of limitations on murder. I reached out to a detective on the cold-case squad, Ed Golian, who was digging into what happened to Colonel Alon.I sent Detective Golian a copy of Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s letter. I wanted his opinion. Detective Golian thought the claims in the letter were worth checking out. But who knew if the Jackal was telling the truth?Detective Golian then contacted the F.B.I. about the letter, though I was unaware of this. In 2011, the county police, working with state prosecutors, the Justice Department and the F.B.I., began the process of seeking permission from the French authorities to speak with Mr. Ram\u00edrez. F.B.I. agents in Paris would conduct the interview. But, because of retirements and bureaucracy, the paperwork fell through the cracks, and the request was not made.Then, in the summer of 2011, Mr. Casey landed in Paris as the bureau\u2019s assistant legal attach\u00e9. Mr. Casey, who was born in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and joined the bureau in 1996, liked hard-to-crack cases. He had made his bones investigating high-profile cases of bribery and money laundering, as well as gangs and drugs. He also spent time in Saudi Arabia investigating terrorism financing.Months after he arrived in Paris, another F.B.I. agent told him about the attempt to interview Mr. Ram\u00edrez. Mr. Casey then reopened the investigation and submitted a request to the French authorities to interview the terrorist in 2013.In February 2014, Mr. Casey, along with his translator, walked into the prison where Mr. Ram\u00edrez, then 64, was being held. Mr. Ram\u00edrez, clad in a leather jacket and wearing no handcuffs, later pulled out a Cuban cigar, a Cohiba, and offered it to the agent. Then the two men got down to business.In the early 1970s, Mr. Ram\u00edrez said, several Americans living in Paris frequented a bookstore run by a Palestinian. The Americans, Vietnam War veterans, sympathized with the plight of the Palestinians and wanted to make a statement on their behalf.The bookstore\u2019s owner put the Americans in touch with Kamal Kheir Beik, a suspected member of Black September. Mr. Beik met with the Americans at a cafe in the Latin Quarter of Paris sometime after 1970, Mr. Ram\u00edrez said.The Americans asked Mr. Beik, a Syrian, what they could do to further the Palestinian cause. Mr. Beik told them to kill Colonel Alon.Mr. Ram\u00edrez said that Mr. Beik had told him afterward what happened, and that Mr. Beik had never believed the Americans would actually mount an operation.\u201cWhen Alon was killed, we all wondered who had done it,\u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez told the F.B.I. agent. \u201cWe were obviously all very happy.\u201dMr. Casey was skeptical, but he came to believe that Mr. Ram\u00edrez was telling the truth. Mr. Beik had helped Mr. Ram\u00edrez plan an attack on a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1975 in Vienna, an operation that made Mr. Ram\u00edrez famous. Mr. Beik was later killed in Beirut, Lebanon.In addition, the French have conducted several interviews of people with ties to the bookstore, and security officials in Switzerland and Australia have provided assistance to the F.B.I. All to no avail.The Israelis have also been silent about the killing. In a 2011 book, \u201cChasing Shadows,\u201d a former State Department security official speculated that the Israelis had identified and killed whoever shot Colonel Alon. Mr. Casey said that spy tale had never been verified.Mr. Casey, who is now an interrogation instructor at the F.B.I. Academy at Quantico in Virginia, is determined to try to solve the case before he retires this year. He thinks there is at least one more promising lead to run down. Agents who worked on the original investigation narrowed down the murder weapon to a .38-caliber revolver \u2014 specifically, one of two models that were made overseas. The F.B.I. then traced every one of those guns sold east of the Mississippi River.The list of purchasers was long, and the identifying information varied. But among them, Mr. Casey said, were people who had served in the military or had links to black militants or violent crimes. They were never interviewed.It\u2019s a long shot, for sure. If it does not pan out, I\u2019ll still be around. Perhaps someone will send me another letter.Advertisement"}

Bergman, P.C., $99,000.In the federal investigation, prosecutors are looking into whether Mr. de Blasio or other officials and aides provided beneficial action for donors in exchange for contributions to the mayor\u2019s 2013 campaign or the Campaign for One New York, his now-shuttered political nonprofit.One of the contracts, with Carter Ledyard, mentions providing legal services in response to investigations into the removal by the city of a deed restriction on Rivington House, a Manhattan nursing home, that allowed for its sale to luxury condominium developers.Eric F. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s press secretary, referred a request for comment to the Law Department, which said in a statement that the firms \u201care providing expertise and additional resources to address ongoing reviews not normally handled by the Law Department.\u201dMr. de Blasio has denied any wrongdoing by his administration. When asked about the cost of outside lawyers in November, he said that the mounting fees were a result of his administration\u2019s being \u201cvery, very cooperative\u201d with investigators , and that \u201ceach time requires preparation and representation.\u201dBy contrast, the state comptroller in December approved a $950,000 contract for outside legal services for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo related to a federal investigation into the Buffalo Billion project and the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute.So far, the city has accounted for more than $6.5 million in spending on the outside counsel. The city allocated another $6.6 million for the Law Department in the most recent budget revision for the current fiscal year, and some portion of that was expected to be redirected to outside lawyers, though the precise amount was not clear. City Hall officials offered to provide a breakdown of the spending but have yet to do so.That amount does not include spending on Barry H. Berke, a partner at Kramer Levin and his 2013 campaign treasurer, who is representing Mr. de Blasio as well.Vivian Yee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Key Moments From Today\u2019s Confirmation Hearings", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byHearing BriefingWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats continue their rigorous questioning of President Trump\u2019s nominees for cabinet positions and other important posts. Here are key moments from today:\u25a0 Representative Tom Price of Georgia, nominated to be health and human services secretary, defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company during his time in Congress. \u201cThe reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,\u201d he said.\u25a0 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, lamented \u201cthe hyper-politicization of the nomination process.\u201d\u25a0 Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the nominee for budget director, said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities.\u25a0 The toughest questions that Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending and appeared to be shocked when Mr. Mulvaney could not remember those votes.\u25a0 Linda E. McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment and Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Small Business Administration, said her entrepreneurial background suited her for the job.\u25a0 Ms. McMahon assured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations.The findings emerged from a review of Mr. Price\u2019s tax returns and other official documents by committee staff members from both parties.In a questionnaire in December, the committee staff said, Mr. Price understated the value of 400,613 shares of the Australian company that he purchased in August 2016 through \u201ca private placement offering.\u201dThe value of the shares was listed on the questionnaire as $50,000 to $100,000, but that reflected the purchase price, the staff reported. At the request of the committee, Mr. Price recalculated the value of his holdings to reflect their market price. The revised value was $100,000 to $250,000.In addition, the committee staff said, Mr. Price \u201ctook improper deductions on his 2016 tax returns\u201d for the depreciation of land associated with condominiums that he owns in Washington and Nashville.Moreover, the staff said, Mr. Price and his wife, both physicians, claimed \u201cmiscellaneous employment deductions totaling $19,034\u201d for various expenses in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Neither Mr. Price nor his wife work as a physician, the staff report said, and \u201cproper documentation could not be located,\u201d so Mr. Price\u2019s tax returns will be amended to remove the $19,034 in deductions.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, questioned Mr. Price over his trades of health care stocks during his time in Congress.\u201cIt is hard to see this as anything but a conflict of interest and an abuse of position,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.In particular, Mr. Wyden pressed Mr. Price over his investments in Innate Immunotherapeutics, which the senator said could be affected by legislation that comes before Congress.Mr. Price said he had done nothing wrong.\u201cThe reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,\u201d he said.Just how involved is Mr. Price as the Trump administration plots how it will replace the Affordable Care Act?Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, tried to find out.\u201cPresident Trump said he\u2019s working with you on a replacement plan for the A.C.A., which is nearly finished and will be revealed after your confirmation,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that he said that, yes,\u201d Mr. Price responded, drawing laughter in the hearing room.\u201cNot that he\u2019s ever done this before, but did the president lie?\u201d Mr. Brown asked. He added: \u201cI know we don\u2019t use the word lie here, because we\u2019re polite, when presidents say statements that aren\u2019t true. But did he lie to the public about working with you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with the president about health care, yes,\u201d Mr. Price replied.Senator Hatch lamented \u201cthe hyper-politicization of the nomination process.\u201d He said Democrats\u2019 attacks on Mr. Price\u2019s ethics were \u201cspecious and distorted.\u201dHe said lawmakers should not \u201cinvent new standards for finances, ethics and disclosure that are different from those that have generally applied in the past.\u201d\u201cNone of those who say they oppose Dr. Price\u2019s nomination seem to be talking about whether he is qualified,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, also came to Mr. Price\u2019s defense. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been asked to be a character witness in a felony trial in the sentencing phase of a conviction,\u201d he said. He called Mr. Price \u201can honorable man.\u201dMr. Mulvaney said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities if he were confirmed as Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director.\u201cI believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said in prepared remarks to be delivered to the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cI also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy.\u201dWhile Mr. Mulvaney is a big believer in spending cuts, he made it clear that he wanted to protect America\u2019s social safety nets. \u201cA strong, healthy economy allows us to protect our most vulnerable,\u201d he said.Mr. Mulvaney was asked about his failure to pay nanny taxes in his opening question, and said that it had been an innocent mistake.\u201cIn 2000, we had triplets. When we came home, we hired someone to help my wife, to help take care of the children,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cIn my mind, she was a babysitter.\u201dHe added, \u201cI did not consider her a household employee for purposes of withholding.\u201dMr. Mulvaney said he had realized his error when filling out a questionnaire related to his nomination to be Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director. He said that he had quickly notified his accountant, the president and his colleagues so that he could correct the mistake.The toughest questions Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came not from a Democrat but from Senator McCain.He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending, and appeared shocked when he could not remember those votes.\u201cBoy, I\u2019ll tell you, I would remember if I voted to cut our defenses the way you did, congressman,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t take it with the seriousness that it deserves.\u201dMr. McCain was also unimpressed with Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s explanation for wanting to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan. After giving the congressman a history lesson on the roots of the Sept. 11 attacks, he offered a final note of disapproval.\u201cI am deeply concerned about your lack of support for our military,\u201d he said.Mr. Mulvaney was forced to address suggestions he had made in the past that Social Security was akin to a Ponzi scheme, and he played down that characterization.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t read too much into it, as describing it as a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he said, explaining that he had merely been referring to the fact that the program takes money from people and gives it to other people.As for keeping the program solvent, Mr. Mulvaney said he would not recommend cuts that would cause current retirees to lose benefits. However, he said that he could see raising the age for receiving benefits in the future.Ms. McMahon reassured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations, promising to work to put in place \u201cthe right regulations\u201d to spur economic growth if she is confirmed as head of the Small Business Administration.Senator Jim Risch, the Idaho Republican who leads the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said the regulatory structure of government today was \u201cstrangling businesses.\u201dMs. McMahon presented herself not as the billionaire former chief executive of W.W.E. but instead as an entrepreneur who had weathered the most difficult moments of building a business from the ground up.\u201cSmall businesses want to feel they can take a risk on expansion or a new hire without fearing onerous new regulations or unexpected taxes, fees and fines that will make such growth unaffordable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to renew optimism in our economy.\u201dIntroduced and endorsed by the two Democrats who defeated her in her failed Senate bids in Connecticut \u2014 Senators Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy \u2014 Ms. McMahon seems likely to sail to confirmation, with the committee expected to approve her next week. The introduction and endorsement of a Republican nominee by two Democratic senators is unusual at the outset of a confirmation hearing.Mr. Murphy, who defeated Ms. McMahon in 2012, expressed \u201cconfidence that she is going to give good, sound counsel to President Trump.\u201d\u201cI saw firsthand the fight that Linda brings to any endeavor she takes on,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anshu Jain to Join Cantor Fitzgerald as President", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byAnshu Jain, who was forced to step down from the top job at Deutsche Bank after a series of regulatory mishaps, will join the private trading firm Cantor Fitzgerald this month as group president.The appointment, which was announced in an internal email on New Year\u2019s Day by Cantor\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Howard Lutnick, comes 18 months after Mr. Jain resigned under pressure from his job as co-chief executive of Germany\u2019s largest bank as concerns mounted over Deutsche\u2019s financial health and the many investigations it was facing. A Cantor spokeswoman confirmed the appointment on Monday.Deutsche\u2019s global markets division would do exactly that during its first 10 years in existence, becoming a market leader in derivatives, fixed income and foreign currency sales and trading.But its hard-charging culture of pursuing profits and risk \u2014 and paying its bankers and traders magnificent sums along the way \u2014 proved to be the division\u2019s undoing in the years after the financial crisis.Deutsche Bank became one of the primary targets of regulators worldwide, and it was penalized as a primary offender in two of the largest financial scandals of the era \u2014 selling toxic mortgages to investors and manipulating for profit benchmark interest rates in London.Many other businesses at Deutsche that Mr. Jain had broad oversight for have paid penalties or are under investigation for charges that include misstating derivatives positions and money laundering activities in Russia.As group president, Mr. Jain will, in effect, become a partner to Mr. Lutnick, helping him oversee Cantor\u2019s various businesses and, crucially, providing strategic insights. According to a Cantor spokeswoman, Mr. Jain will not have a group of executives reporting to him. Instead, he will strategize and engage with clients at a senior level.Mr. Lutnick called the hiring of Mr. Jain \u201ca strong next step in broadening our franchise.\u201d\u201cHe will work alongside me as my partner as we expand our global footprint and drive the firm\u2019s momentum,\u201d Mr. Lutnick said.The two men have been friends for years and have on occasion even spent vacations together.People who know Mr. Jain well say they are not surprised that he would soon return to the front lines of finance. From an early point in his career, he had seen himself as a Wall Street chief executive \u2014 in the classic style of wielding unchallenged power and influence.Deutsche was the focus of that dream, and along the way, he declined many offers to leave and join rival banks.But his three-year tenure as the bank\u2019s leader was marked by repeated setbacks in a new environment that favored financial rectitude, damaging the reputations of both Deutsche and Mr. Jain.Although his successor, John Cryan, has kept in place the basic structure of the investment bank that Mr. Jain helped form, he has said that Deutsche will be a different institution, culturally and ethically, under him.In many ways, becoming president of Cantor Fitzgerald will be a step down of sorts for Mr. Jain.A private company with an expertise in trading fixed-income securities and servicing hedge funds, Cantor is not the global colossus that Deutsche was during its heyday \u2014 or is even today in its diminished form.Born in India, Mr. Jain built his reputation at Deutsche on his expertise in selling complex, high-margin securities to hedge funds and other risk-loving investors. In that regard, his talents will be a good fit for Cantor\u2019s trading and hedge fund businesses.There may be questions, however, about Mr. Jain\u2019s capacity to serve for a long period as a No. 2 executive. He has always seen himself as having chief executive timber and has a history of champing at the bit when it comes to waiting for the top job, as he did with Josef Ackermann, who was chief executive of Deutsche from 2002 to 2012.Mr. Lutnick is a strong-willed leader who has been chairman of the firm since 1996. He became well known for his efforts to keep his firm going after it lost about two thirds of its employees during the attacks of Sept. 11. Cantor had its offices on the top floors of the World Trade Center\u2019s north tower.Advertisement"}

Break them, and you risk causing family rifts.Typically, only married relatives hand out envelopes, and only unmarried, younger family members receive them. At work, they are usually given to subordinates as a sign of recognition.Sometimes, giving too much can be as disrespectful as giving too little.Ideally, the money inside should be unused.

The practice is increasingly popular.On the eve of Lunar New Year in 2016, eight billion cash gifts were swapped via the app.More traditionally, in parts of China, real coins are hidden in dumplings served at family parties.

{"Headline": "Sensing Gains Ahead Under Trump, the Kochs Court Minorities", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byThe crowd that thronged a gospel concert last month in Richmond, Va., was in for an unusual Christmas treat.The concert flier was adorned with a red car bearing Christmas gifts. \u201cThankful for the fuels and innovation that make modern life possible,\u201d it read.The Kochs, whose use of their fortune to promote climate-change denial research has angered environmentalists, are quietly courting new allies in their quest for a fossil fuel resurgence: minorities.Since its start in the spring of 2016, Fueling U.S. Forward has sent delegates to, or hosted, at least three events aimed at black voters, arguing that they benefit most from cheap and abundant fossil fuels and have the most to lose if energy costs rise.Fueling U.S. Forward is \u201cdedicated to educating the public about the value and potential of American energy, the vast majority of which comes from fossil fuels,\u201d the group says on its website. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk to people of diverse backgrounds \u2014 industry employees, small-business owners, community leaders and low-income families \u2014 and share their stories.\u201dThe group has seen early results from its outreach.A Koch Industries spokesman, David Dziok, did not respond to a request for comment.The Kochs\u2019 public relations drive takes a page from minority outreach by other industry lobbies, like those representing tobacco and soft drinks. Those industries have long argued that stiffer regulations or taxes on cigarettes or sodas would disproportionately affect low-income and minority communities.It also adds a new dimension to the Kochs\u2019 more traditional approach to climate and the environment, which has mainly involved financing research skeptical of climate change, backing pro-oil politicians and ballot initiatives, and fighting incentives for renewable energy, all through a network of charitable and political organizations.In recent years, the industry has increased its sway among Republicans, supporting a rightward shift toward sharp cutbacks of Social Security and Medicare and the rollback of environmental protections. And the Kochs find themselves well positioned to influence the Trump administration, with many allies in important cabinet and transition posts.But numerous polls show that a majority of American voters continue to support many environmental regulations, including those that govern carbon dioxide emissions. And there is significant support among voters, even in red states, for renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which the Kochs have long worked to quash.We got here, the ad says, by \u201charnessing the power of the earth and the natural fuels of soil and rock.\u201dIt remains unclear who else, apart from the Kochs, is financing Fueling U.S. Forward. It is registered as a nonprofit business association, a designation that allows its involvement in both lobbying and political activities. But because it is so new, it has not yet made public filings detailing its financial and other activities.The group has even experimented with outreach to the kind of left-wing audience that has long vilified the Kochs. In his Facebook Live broadcast, Mr. Drevna specifically addressed those critics, inviting them to see fossil fuels as part of a progressive worldview.\u201cEnergy security means economic security,\u201d Mr. Drevna said. \u201cEconomic security means an increased, progressive lifestyle.\u201dThe group\u2019s outreach to African-Americans has been more overt, and involved multiple members of the Kochs\u2019 network.He discussed what high energy costs could mean for households in Richmond, which has a large African-American population. And he encouraged audience members to contact their legislators to lodge concerns about energy costs, said Clovia Lawrence, a local journalist and radio personality who helped host the show.Then four lucky people picked from the crowd of about 300 were told that their latest monthly electricity bills would be paid, up to $250, she said.\u201cEveryone was so excited,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was dancing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information provided by the American Energy Alliance, misstated Hubbel Relat\u2019s position with the organization.

{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Blacklist of Artists Adds to Outrage Over Presidential Scandal", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported bySoon after the painting\u2019s completion in August 2014, the retaliation began as planned in the aide\u2019s diary, which surfaced in November in the investigation into the corruption scandal that has led to Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment trial.The retaliation did not stop there, Mr. Hong said. \u201cDozens of conservative activists showed up in front of my apartment like a goon squad, shaking my photographs and calling me a \u2018Communist painter,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI received death threats on the phone.\u201dOn Thursday, three of Ms. Park\u2019s former aides, including one of her former culture ministers, Kim Jong-deok, were arrested on charges of blacklisting cultural figures deemed unfriendly and barring them from government-controlled support programs.So far, two versions of the blacklist have been reported by the news media, citing anonymous sources. Officials, including the special prosecutor in the case, Park Young-soo, have confirmed the existence of the blacklist but have not released it.Officially, Ms. Park has made promoting movies and other cultural products one of her key priorities. But secretly, her government has blackballed artists, reviving a practice of past military dictators like her father, Park Chung-hee, and in so doing has \u201cseriously undermined the freedom of thought and expression,\u201d the special prosecutor\u2019s office said.The revelations about the cultural blacklist added a new layer of notoriety to the scandal surrounding Ms. Park, and prosecutors planned to use the list to help strengthen the impeachment charges against her.The special prosecutor is investigating whether Ms. Park and Kim Ki-choon \u2014 her former chief of staff, who was depicted as one of the dark forces in Mr. Hong\u2019s painting \u2014 were involved in the blacklisting of artists.Both Ms. Park and Mr. Kim, her former chief of staff, have denied involvement. However, another of Ms. Park\u2019s former culture ministers, Yoo Jin-ryong, said the list was dictated by the president\u2019s office.On Monday, the current culture minister, Cho Yoon-sun, said, \u201cI understand how pained artists must have felt when excluded from government support just because of their political and ideological beliefs.\u201dFor many South Koreans, news of the blacklisting of artists reawakened memories from the nation\u2019s dictatorial past.Ms. Park\u2019s father, who ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979, censored newspapers and imprisoned dissident writers and publishers. Chun Doo-hwan, a military dictator during the 1980s, banished a comedian from TV after people compared the appearances of the two men. (Both were bald.) Subsequent governments were accused of favoring pro-government scholars and civic groups when doling out research projects and subsidies.Under Ms. Park\u2019s conservative predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, some celebrities and journalists deemed progressive were barred from state-controlled broadcasters.But the latest revelations marked the first time the existence of an extensive government blacklist was revealed since South Korea moved toward democracy in the late 1980s.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be on the list,\u201d Ko Un, one of South Korea\u2019s best-known poets, told the broadcaster SBS last month, when it reported on another version of the list. \u201cThis shows how disgusting the government is.\u201dThe rumors intensified after two award-winning theatrical directors were mysteriously booted from government subsidy programs: one had campaigned for Ms. Park\u2019s main opponent in the 2012 election; another had produced a play spoofing Ms. Park and her father.Mr. Yoo, the former culture minister, said Mr. Kim, Ms. Park\u2019s chief of staff at the time, began ordering the culture ministry to blacklist certain artists in 2013. Last month, a former aide to Ms. Park was indicted on charges of colluding with her in an attempt to blackmail a vice chairwoman of CJ, which runs South Korea\u2019s biggest film studio, into retiring in 2013. The company had angered Ms. Park\u2019s office by financing a movie about her ideological enemy, the former President Roh Moo-hyun, Mr. Yoo said in a radio interview last month.\u201cI thought this kind of thing happened only under the past military rule,\u201d CJ\u2019s chairman, Sohn Kyung-shik, told a parliamentary hearing last month.Mr. Yoo said that an early version of the blacklist he saw in June 2014 included hundreds of artists. Shortly before he was replaced a month later, Mr. Yoo said he met Ms. Park to warn against the list. (Ms. Park has denied being warned.)By 2015, the list had ballooned to include more than 9,000 visual artists, musicians, actors, film and musical directors, and writers deemed critical of Ms. Park, particularly those who took aim at her handling of the ferry disaster or who were suspected of supporting her rivals, according to the Hankook Ilbo newspaper, which published what it claimed was the list in October.Ms. Park\u2019s office zealously pursued her opponents after the ferry disaster, according to the diary of Kim Young-han, the former presidential aide who detailed the retaliation against Mr. Hong. The ferry tragedy is a central motif in Mr. Hong\u2019s painting.During a meeting of senior presidential aides in 2014, Mr. Kim, Ms. Park\u2019s chief of staff at the time, called for a \u201ccombative response to leftists in the cultural and art circles\u201d and ordered the aides to \u201cdiscover their networks,\u201d according to the diary. He compared progressive teachers and journalists \u201cto poisonous mushrooms.\u201d The diary also recorded instructions to punish artists who satirized Ms. Park, conduct a \u201cloyalty check\u201d of senior government officials, \u201cintimidate\u201d courts of law and \u201cinduce\u201d scholars to write pro-government newspaper columns.\u201cMake them afraid to challenge the president,\u201d Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in a diary entry dated July 4, 2014.He has denied giving such an order and said that the diary did not faithfully record what was actually discussed during the aides\u2019 meetings.The author of the diary, Kim Young-han, died in August, but prosecutors said they found it useful in building their case against Ms. Park.Mr. Hong, the painter, said that for poor artists, being cut off from travel and other government support programs could be crushing.In 2015, Mr. Hong was invited to show his painting at a Berlin arts festival. But no domestic logistics company would transport the work for fear of government retaliation. Mr. Hong had to travel alone and hurriedly repaint a copy of the original in Berlin. He also suspected the government was behind a tax audit of his wife\u2019s clinic last year.\u201cIt makes me shudder that Park Geun-hye and her cronies tried to tame artists by holding back a pittance of government support while they themselves pocket millions,\u201d Mr. Hong said. \u201cThey showed how depraved political power can be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Still Faces Pushback", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byToday is Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday, the federal holiday that honors the assassinated civil rights leader.Well, not everywhere.State-by-state naming differences are remnants of fierce opposition to a holiday that was not officially recognized by all states until 1999. Here is a brief history of how Martin Luther King Jr. Day came to be.How Did Martin Luther King Jr. Day Become a Holiday?A federal holiday honoring Dr. King was first proposed four days after he was assassinated, in 1968, but it took almost two decades of campaigning for it to be approved and designated at the national level.But state-level momentum slowed and Congress did not act. Advocates led by Dr. King\u2019s widow, Coretta Scott King, spent years lobbying for the holiday, testifying before Congress and gathering millions of signatures on petitions.President Jimmy Carter expressed support for the federal holiday in 1979. The singer Stevie Wonder became a prominent supporter, too, financing a Washington lobbying office and releasing a hit 1980 song in support, \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201dThe campaign finally succeeded in 1983, when Congress passed the King Holiday Bill and President Ronald Reagan signed it into law. The third Monday in January would be celebrated as Martin Luther King Jr. Day starting in 1986.Who Opposed It?When the proposal to create the holiday was debated in Congress in 1979, Republicans led the charge against it. The strongest opposition came from lawmakers in the Deep South, such as Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, who ran for president in 1948 on a segregationist platform.When the measure failed in 1979, Representative Cardiss Collins, Democrat of Illinois and leader of the Congressional Black Caucus at the time, said she believed that racism had played a role.But by 1983, many Republicans in Congress had changed their minds. The King Holiday Bill passed the House and the Senate with bipartisan support and was signed by a Republican president.Where Does the Holiday Stand Today?Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day is commemorated by the federal government and, in some form, by all 50 states, some, like Arizona and Idaho, combine commemorations of Dr. King\u2019s birthday with a holiday to honor civil rights.A release by Nueces County, Tex., referred to the day as a \u201cCounty Civil Rights Holiday.\u201dAnd then there are a few states in the Deep South \u2014 Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi \u2014 that combine celebrations of the civil rights icon and that of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general.Critics have decried those arrangements as an unholy merger that commemorate both freedom and slavery \u2014 a combination that is nonsensical at best and inflammatory at worst.Arkansas lawmakers have tried in recent years to separate the two holidays, but the measures have been opposed from constituents who call the effort an affront to Southern heritage or by lawmakers who say they have better things to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant Could Close by 2021", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byIndian Point, the nuclear power plant closest to New York City, could be shut as soon as April 2021 under an agreement New York state officials reached this week with Entergy, the utility company that owns the plant, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal.\u201cWhy you would allow Indian Point to continue to operate defies common sense, planning and basic sanity,\u201d Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters in June.Despite the political opposition to Indian Point, which is perched at the edge of the Hudson River in Buchanan, N.Y., the plant is an important supplier of inexpensive power to the metropolitan area. It can generate more than 2,000 megawatts, or about one-fourth of the power consumed in New York City and Westchester County. The prospects for replacing that power are unclear, but potential options include hydropower from Quebec and power from wind farms that already operate or could open across New York, according to the person.State officials believe the Entergy agreement will help convince renewable energy providers that the state is serious about looking for new sources of energy, the person said. But without a viable replacement source, ratepayers in New York City could be burdened with higher energy prices for years.Entergy has agreed to make repairs and safety upgrades, including transferring spent fuel to what the state says is a safer storage system. The company will also allow safety inspections starting this year, bowing to longtime demands from the Cuomo administration, the office of the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, and Riverkeeper, the nonprofit environmental group, all of which participated in the deal.\u201cFor years, my office has been fighting to address the serious risks posed by Indian Point to the surrounding communities and the environment,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said on Friday. \u201c If we can shut down Indian Point under an agreement that enhances public safety and kick-starts investment into safer and more reliable renewable energy sources, that will be a major victory for the millions of New Yorkers who live in the region.\u201dIn exchange, the state and Riverkeeper will drop safety and environmental claims against Indian Point they had filed with federal regulatory agencies.In 2011, a report commissioned under then-Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg concluded that if Indian Point were shut within five years, there would not be enough reliable substitutes to meet the city\u2019s needs. Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Consolidated Edison, said that utilities and state regulators had worked since then to develop a contingency plan.\u201cSteps have been taken to replace that power in the event it does close,\u201d Mr. Clendenin said. \u201cStill more needs to be done, but there\u2019s more transmission and supply expected in the next few years.\u201dHe said he could not estimate what effect the proposed shutdown would have on the electric bills of Con Edison customers in the city and Westchester County, which already are among the highest in the nation. Con Ed has a contract to buy 500 megawatts of electricity from Indian Point, or nearly one-fourth of the plant\u2019s capacity.Jerry Nappi, a spokesman for Entergy in Westchester County, declined to comment on the proposed shutdown. He said that Indian Point has nearly 1,000 workers, about 550 of whom are union members.John Melia, a spokesman for the Utility Workers Union of America, said Entergy had not informed the union of the plan, which he called a \u201cheadstrong, headlong rush into nowhere.\u201d He asked, \u201cDid Governor Cuomo think about the people who are going to lose their jobs?\u201dNegotiations between the company and the Cuomo administration began in early December, according to the person with direct knowledge of the deal.The attorney general\u2019s office and Entergy have each signed off on the agreement, but the governor\u2019s office has indicated to the other parties that the administration will wait until Monday to sign it, the person said. The deal has shifted several times during negotiations, but the person said all that remained to complete it was an administration signature.Nonetheless, Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said that nothing was final. \u201cThere is no agreement \u2014 Governor Cuomo has been working on a possible agreement for 15 years and until it\u2019s done, it\u2019s not done,\u201d he said. \u201cClose only counts for horseshoes, not for nuclear plants.\u201dUnder the agreement with the state, the person with knowledge of it said, Entergy has committed to applying for a six-year renewal of the licenses, which were scheduled to expire in 2013 and 2015. The agreement may help clear the way for approval.But a six-year renewal would be a first, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. He said no nuclear plant license had ever been renewed for less than 20 years.The agreement would also require Entergy to establish an emergency operations center in Fishkill, in Dutchess County, and to create a $15 million fund to finance projects related to environmental protection and other community benefits. Entergy would be obligated to consult regularly with Riverkeeper and other local groups.The agreement also provides for flexibility if the state cannot find a replacement for Indian Point\u2019s energy: The deadlines in 2020 and 2021 can be delayed to 2024 and 2025 if the state and Entergy agree.The agreement is reminiscent of one arranged by Mr. Cuomo\u2019s father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, in 1989. Mario Cuomo negotiated a decommissioning of the Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island, which was never put into service. Its owner, the Long Island Lighting Company, sold the plant to the state for $1, but Long Island ratepayers bore the cost of building that plant in the form of higher utility bills for many years.Nuclear power has posed a dilemma for Mr. Cuomo. Since long before he was governor, as early as 1992, he has called for closing Indian Point. As the state\u2019s attorney general, he took legal action to try to do so.But while he has characterized nuclear reactors as dangerous downstate, he has said they are critical upstate.When Entergy announced in late 2015 that it planned to shut a nuclear plant on Lake Ontario in Oswego County, Mr. Cuomo objected. He argued that the plant was vital to the local economy and to his goal of having half of the state\u2019s power produced by renewable sources.To avert the shutdown of Entergy\u2019s James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant and a nearby plant that was also scheduled for closing, Mr. Cuomo offered huge subsidies to the operators to keep them open.Critics of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal to subsidize nuclear power plants upstate wondered why he would demand the closing of Indian Point, but insist on keeping the others open.\u201cWe happen to think people upstate deserve the same protections as New Yorkers who happen to live downstate do,\u201d said Alex Beauchamp, the northeast regional director for Food & Water Watch, a consumer protection watchdog. \u201cTo me, it makes no sense why the governor thinks nuclear power\u2019s unsafe downstate, but it is safe upstate.\u201dCiting various leaks and delayed repairs at the three upstate plants, Mr. Beauchamp said that they had problems similar to those at Indian Point, and pose similar risks to local residents.An earlier version of this article misstated the county where Fishkill, N.Y., is located. It is Dutchess County, not Westchester.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tom Price\u2019s Heated Hearing Is Unlikely to Derail His Nomination", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a heated confirmation hearing that focused on ethical issues, President Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, defended his trading of medical and pharmaceutical stocks on Tuesday, saying, \u201cEverything that I did was ethical, aboveboard, legal and transparent.\u201dDemocrats accused Mr. Price of a potential conflict of interest at a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee, saying he held more than $100,000 in stock in companies that could have benefited from legislation he promoted. Mr. Price, a Georgia Republican, denied any wrongdoing.He also avoided being pinned down on the future of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid, programs that insure more than 100 million people.While Mr. Price faced vigorous questioning from Democrats, he and other cabinet nominees have benefited from solid support among Republicans, who hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate.But some nominees had bipartisan support. By a vote of 96 to 4, the Senate approved the nomination of Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina to be ambassador to the United Nations.Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, praised Ms. Haley for \u201cmoral clarity,\u201d noting that she had declared that the Russians were guilty of war crimes in bombing the Syrian city of Aleppo \u2014 an assertion that Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of state, declined to make.Senate committees endorsed other nominations on Tuesday: Elaine L. Chao for transportation secretary, Wilbur L. Ross for commerce secretary and Ben Carson for secretary of housing and urban development.Linda McMahon, selected by Mr. Trump to lead the Small Business Administration, also sailed through her confirmation hearing. She was introduced and endorsed by the senators from her home state, Connecticut: Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy, both Democrats.The endorsements were notable because Ms. McMahon ran for the Senate and was defeated by Mr. Blumenthal in 2010 and Mr. Murphy in 2012.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Even as some nominees advanced, Republicans were becoming frustrated and angry. They said Democrats were delaying and prolonging the reviews, raising procedural objections without changing the likely outcome.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, accused the Democrats of \u201cobstruction and foot-dragging\u201d and said they were \u201cattempting to litigate or re-litigate the election.\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said: \u201cThe president won an election. He deserves to get his people in place.\u201dThe hard feelings felt to some like payback. Democrats noted that Republicans had stalled many of President Barack Obama\u2019s picks and refused to act on his nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court.In the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Democrats held up confirmation votes for two nominees: Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana for interior secretary and former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas for energy secretary. The Democrats said they had unanswered questions about important research programs at the Energy Department.Democrats on the Finance Committee put Mr. Price through three and a half hours of grueling interrogation. But they appeared unlikely to block his confirmation unless other damaging information comes to light.\u201cWe\u2019ve always known where the votes are,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the committee. The panel could vote next week on whether to recommend confirmation, with its Republican majority strongly supporting Mr. Price.Mr. Wyden asked Mr. Price if he would promise that no one would be worse off and no one would lose coverage as a result of the order. Mr. Price declined to provide an explicit assurance. He promised instead to work with Congress to \u201cmake certain that we have the highest-quality health care and that every single American has access to affordable coverage.\u201dSenator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said the administration appeared to be planning a \u201cwar on Medicaid.\u201d Mr. Price rejected that description, saying he wanted to give states more control over Medicaid, which covers more than 70 million low-income people.Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, asked Mr. Price for a commitment that any replacement for the Affordable Care Act would allow states to continue the expansion of Medicaid eligibility already approved by Nevada and 30 other states.Mr. Price deferred to Congress, saying, \u201cThis is a policy question that needs to be worked out through both the House and the Senate.\u201d He said he wanted to ensure that people \u201cwho are currently covered through Medicaid expansion either retain that coverage or in some way have coverage through a different vehicle.\u201dIn any event, he said, \u201cevery single individual ought to be able to have access to coverage.\u201dHe added that many people had Medicaid coverage but could not find doctors to treat them.\u201cOne out of three physicians who ought to be able to see Medicaid patients in this nation do not take any Medicaid patients\u201d because of low reimbursement rates, burdensome regulations or the \u201chassle factor,\u201d Mr. Price said.That answer did not satisfy Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, which is home to more than four million Medicare beneficiaries. \u201cIf I gave them that answer,\u201d Mr. Nelson said, \u201cI would get run out of the room with a group of senior citizens.\u201dA background investigation of Mr. Price found that he had understated the value of his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company and claimed income tax deductions that he could not substantiate. The findings emerged from a review of his tax returns and other official documents by Finance Committee staff members from both parties.In a questionnaire in December, the staff said, Mr. Price understated the value of 400,613 shares of the Australian company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, that he purchased in August through \u201ca private placement offering.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how this can be anything but a conflict of interest and an abuse of his position,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. But Mr. Price said that he did not have any \u201cnonpublic information\u201d about the company. And the committee chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said the Democrats\u2019 attacks on Mr. Price\u2019s ethics were \u201cspecious and distorted.\u201dThe committee staff added that Mr. Price had taken \u201cimproper deductions on his 2016 tax returns\u201d for the depreciation of land associated with condominiums he owns in Washington and Nashville. He and his wife, both physicians, also claimed \u201cmiscellaneous employment deductions totaling $19,034\u201d for expenses in 2013, 2014 and 2015, the staff said. But \u201cproper documentation could not be located,\u201d so his returns will be amended.Thomas Kaplan and Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "HNA Seeking Direct Bridge to Washington", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsHNA Group, a Chinese aviation and shipping conglomerate, is hoping to buy a bridge directly to the White House with its latest deal. HNA is taking a stake in SkyBridge Capital, the hedge fund of the newly minted presidential adviser Anthony Scaramucci. The business fit is a stretch, but the rationale of HNA making a friend on Donald J. Trump\u2019s team as it tries to expand in the United States is hard to avoid.Neither SkyBridge nor HNA nor RON Transatlantic, its partner in taking a majority stake, has revealed the terms of the deal. HNA probably paid less than $200 million, making it little more than an amuse-bouche for the deal-hungry company. It gobbled up more than $17 billion in overseas assets in 2016, including hotels, golf courses and the American cloud-computing company Ingram Micro, according to Thomson Reuters data.Last week, HNA spent $460 million on the New Zealand-based leasing and investment company UDC Finance. That will help expand its nascent financial empire, which domestically spans asset management, life insurance and peer-to-peer lending as well as aircraft leasing.There\u2019s a big difference, though, between the services offered by its fledgling finance unit and the fund of hedge funds business for which SkyBridge is best known. And it\u2019s not as if HNA can suddenly offer its new acquisition\u2019s services to Chinese investors: Beijing\u2019s recent imposition of tighter capital controls, including limiting outflows, has put that to rest, possibly for several years.The potential return on the SkyBridge deal looks far more political than financial. Congress has long been wary of Chinese deal makers; of late, even private companies like HNA have been tarred with the same brush as state-run concerns. President-elect Trump has raised the ante by courting Taiwan and threatening to brand China a currency manipulator.If buying a chunk of Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s business has even a chance of offsetting that, HNA may consider it money well spent. Using government connections, after all, is how Chinese businesses often get their deals over the finish line at home. Granted, currying favor with one presidential adviser won\u2019t suddenly clear a path through Congress, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and a host of other regulators, but every advantage helps.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs Completes Return From Wilderness to the White House", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byCommon Sense\u201cGovernment Sachs\u201d is back.After eight years in the political wilderness, its name synonymous with the supposedly undue and self-serving influence in Washington that brought us the financial crisis and the Wall Street bailout, Goldman Sachs is again making its presence felt. In the Trump administration, to an unprecedented degree, economic policy making is largely being handed over to people with Goldman ties.The Goldman influx has so far drawn little criticism, perhaps because worries about what once would have been deemed undue influence now mix with relief that there is some adult supervision in the executive branch.On balance, \u201cit\u2019s a plus,\u201d Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who built his fortune on Wall Street, told me this week. \u201cWhatever you may think of them individually, you can\u2019t get to be a Goldman partner and survive if you\u2019re stupid, lazy or unprofessional.\u201d (Mr. Bloomberg is co-chairman of Goldman\u2019s \u201c10,000 Small Businesses\u201d initiative, which provides support to fledgling entrepreneurs.)Whatever bricks Mr. Trump threw at Wall Street during the campaign, investors have cheered his victory, driving the stock market to new highs. And Goldman has been a particular beneficiary, with its shares gaining 35 percent since Election Day \u2014 the top-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average in that time.Mr. Trump, a spokeswoman of his told me, sees no contradiction here. There\u2019s a difference between individuals who happen to have worked at Goldman Sachs, at some point in their careers, and Goldman Sachs itself. \u201cHe\u2019s said from the beginning that he\u2019ll hire the very best people for the job regardless of where they worked before, which is what he\u2019s done throughout his career,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Hope Hicks.While the firm\u2019s influence in a Trump administration may reach a new apex, Goldman alumni have long been fixtures in both Republican and Democratic administrations. The Goldman legend Sidney J. Weinberg headed Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s influential Business Advisory and Planning Council.Recent Treasury secretaries with Goldman roots include Robert E. Rubin, a former co-chairman, under Bill Clinton; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former chairman and chief executive, under George W. Bush.Even in the Obama administration, where a Goldman pedigree was something akin to a scarlet letter, Gary Gensler was credited with reviving a moribund Commodity Futures Trading Commission and might have been Treasury secretary had Mrs. Clinton won in November.Which raises the question: Why would such a disproportionate number of the \u201cbest people,\u201d in Mr. Trump\u2019s view, come from just one bank? After all, Goldman is hardly the only large bank, and it is also far from the biggest. It employs roughly 33,000 people; JPMorgan Chase\u2019s work force is many times as large.Many point to a unique Goldman culture that has long encouraged public service and philanthropy as integral to its business model.Goldman \u201cdoes seem to produce people who are very smart and have valuable experience,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said. \u201cAnd they have a culture and a long tradition of leaving the firm for public service. The firm pushes them to do that.\u201dMr. Cohn would seem to be a good example. After 26 years at the firm, most recently as president and chief operating officer, he sought out Mr. Trump once it became clear that Goldman\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, had no immediate plans to step down.Mr. Cohn would hardly seem an obvious choice for the Trump administration \u2014 he is a registered Democrat and had no past relationship with Mr. Trump. But he knew Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and after several face-to-face meetings, Mr. Trump was won over by Mr. Cohn\u2019s innovative ideas for financing infrastructure projects and his up-by-the-bootstraps biography: Mr. Cohn, the son of an Ohio electrician, overcame dyslexia and taught himself options trading before talking his way into a position at the New York Mercantile Exchange. (Mr. Cohn declined to comment.)Mr. Blankfein told me this week that public service is deeply embedded in Goldman\u2019s culture. \u201cWhen I became a partner in 1988, you were expected to manage your career so that when they wrote your obituary, no more than three paragraphs would be about Goldman Sachs,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people leave by age 48 or 50. By then you\u2019ve made enough money. The expectation was you\u2019d turn to philanthropy or government service.\u201dHe said the acculturation process begins in recruiting. \u201cWe tend to recruit people who are very public service-minded,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people who are interesting and have diverse interests, people you\u2019d want to engage with. I\u2019ve always been a proponent of a liberal arts education for undergraduates. To develop breadth, to be interesting to yourself and other people, take a lab course or read Shakespeare. Don\u2019t become a human calculator.\u201dWhile Goldman partners take pride in the good works of their colleagues and employees \u2014 and were badly stung by the questioning of their motives after the financial crisis \u2014 the emphasis on public service isn\u2019t driven entirely by altruism. Goldman\u2019s business model has traditionally stressed long-term relationships in both the private and public sectors.High-profile government service by its alumni has largely burnished the firm\u2019s reputation within the business community and, accurately or not, enhanced the perception that Goldman partners are just a phone call away from the executive branch. Already, chief executives have been calling Goldman partners seeking access to Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin.Mr. Blankfein dismisses the notion that the firm has any undue influence in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s an imprimatur on our firm that we have such good people that the administration wants to hire them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt pains me to lose some of them. But the perception that they\u2019ll go to Washington and then favor us is false. The reverse is true. They\u2019ll bend over backwards to avoid that. They\u2019re not going to serve the interests of Goldman Sachs. They have their own careers and reputations to worry about.\u201dExhibit A in that regard may be Mr. Gensler, at the time the youngest person to be made partner at Goldman (when he was 30). Two liberal senators tried to block his nomination to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on the grounds that he was too close to Wall Street. But by the time he left the agency, it had filed a record number of cases against major Wall Street banks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Passport Stamp Gives Dreamers Hope as the Trump Era Looms", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byWhen the customs agent at Kennedy International Airport stamped Jenifer Guzman Gonzalez\u2019s Mexican passport on Monday, Ms. Guzman was too anxious to look at it.Back at her family\u2019s apartment in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Ms. Guzman started crying as she flipped to Page 5.\u201cPAROLED,\u201d read the blue-ink stamp from the United States Department of Homeland Security. On the line under the word \u201cPurpose\u201d was the acronym: \u201cDACA.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to look at it until I got home to savor the moment,\u201d she said.Ms. Guzman came from Mexico to New York at age 4, arriving by night hidden in a van. Now 21 and a sophomore at Hunter College, she had joined 66 others covered by DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, on a six-day trip to her homeland organized by the City University of New York. The 2012 federal program allows young, undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States temporarily and work legally. It also enables them to apply to travel abroad for humanitarian, educational or employment reasons, and then re-enter the United States, a benefit known as \u201cadvance parole.\u201dThe stamp in her passport is proof that Ms. Guzman has entered the country legally, which she and others like her are hoping could one day be inoculation against whatever actions Donald J. Trump takes against undocumented immigrants after his inauguration on Friday. He has vowed to end the DACA program.While DACA may be fleeting, the stamp is forever, and for some, it might offer a small future benefit as well: If Ms. Guzman were ever to apply for a green card after marrying an American citizen, she would not have to return to Mexico and risk being turned down, as most immigrants who entered the country illegally currently must do. Adjusting her legal status would be far easier.\u201cThere\u2019s not a rush to do anything right now,\u201d Ms. Guzman said on Tuesday, after returning from a conference that also allowed her to visit relatives she left behind in Mexico. Marriage is not on the table. \u201cJust seeing my family was enough for me.\u201dTo go on the trip, students had to first apply for advance parole. CUNY Citizenship Now, a nonprofit legal organization, helped expedite the applications; since November, Citizenship Now has helped 122 students with DACA get this benefit. Nearly 300 people across the country applied for CUNY\u2019s program, spurred by their fear that the window of opportunity would close.Of the estimated 713,300 individuals covered by the DACA program through Dec. 31, 2015, 22,340 have been approved for advance parole. The immigration agency said those are the most updated statistics.Days after the presidential election, Israel Sanchez applied for a separate trip run by a City College of New York education professor, Tatyana Kleyn. That class spent two weeks in Oaxaca, Mexico.\u201cI just saw it as me taking a step and doing something, instead of just waiting to see what can happen,\u201d said Mr. Sanchez, 20, a Baruch College student who also works for City Councilman Ritchie Torres in the Bronx. He came to New York as a 2-year-old. \u201cI knew that with advance parole, it could open options down the road.\u201dDr. Kleyn\u2019s long-scheduled course could accommodate only 18 students, and had to turn away applicants. Jos\u00e9 Higuera L\u00f3pez, the interim director of the CUNY Mexican Studies Institute, said that City University wanted to find a way to meet the demand. So in November, he devised the curriculum, prepared an application with an essay asking why students wanted to attend and enlisted CUNY Citizenship Now to help with government approval.The intent was to get students to reconnect with their home country, he said. \u201cWe never focused on the advance parole. For us it was, we needed to take them just in case there was no opportunity later on.\u201dThe program was organized in such a frenzy in the weeks after the election that it received funding, from an outside nonprofit organization, only in the second week of December, Mr. Higuera said. The grant covered travel, lodging and government application fees for students, while the State Government of Puebla also offered financial assistance.Alumni from CUNY were allowed to participate, too. Ivan Guzman, 35, who graduated from Baruch College with a degree in finance, recently opened a restaurant and works at the Mexican Consulate in New York advising immigrants on starting businesses. He had not been back to Mexico for 20 years. He was unsettled by the trip at first.\u201cFor the most part, if you\u2019ve lived here undocumented, you don\u2019t feel like you belong here,\u201d Mr. Guzman said, referring to New York. \u201cAnd once you go back, you don\u2019t belong there, either.\u201dMs. Guzman liked that. Especially when she finally admired her passport and saw that her entry stamps were on the same page, the United States stamp on top of the Mexican one.\u201cYes, I\u2019m from here and I\u2019m from there,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though I am not a U.S. citizen or resident, I was allowed back in because this is my home.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Museum Trustee, a Trump Donor, Supports Groups That Deny Climate Change", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byThe depth of that mission is evident in the numerous exhibitions at this Manhattan museum, like the film \u201cWonders of the Arctic,\u201d which is on view through March 2. \u201cThe polar bear has always been the symbol of the Arctic,\u201d the narrator intones. \u201cNow it\u2019s become the face of climate change and the threat it poses.\u201dIn recent years the Mercer Family Foundation \u2014 which Ms. Mercer operates with her father, the New York investor Robert Mercer \u2014 has given nearly $8 million to organizations including the Heartland Institute in Illinois, a group that rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. She is also on the board of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that is skeptical of whether human behavior causes climate change.The connection of Ms. Mercer, the museum and the Mercer Family Foundation\u2019s donation history came to light during an analysis by The New York Times of activities by cultural leaders who donated to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Several of them are board members at New York City arts organizations, including John Paulson at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Mercedes T. Bass at the Metropolitan Opera. But none are as unusual a fit as Ms. Mercer and the American Museum of Natural History.On one level, she is the sort of trustee museums and other nonprofit arts groups compete for: a deep-pocketed donor whose board membership could lead to more contributions. Museums regularly ask major donors to become trustees \u2014 particularly those as generous as Ms. Mercer, whose foundation has donated at least $3 million to the museum over the past few years.Museum leaders generally do not vet donors and trustees for their personal or political views or apply ideological litmus tests. But more often than not, trustees champion the missions and philosophical underpinnings of their museums.Since Ms. Mercer has only recently emerged as a high-profile player in the Republican Party, bringing her charitable giving new public attention, it\u2019s likely that the museum\u2019s trustees were unaware of her philanthropic history \u2014 and specifically, her generous funding of organizations on the forefront of climate change skepticism \u2014 when she joined the board in 2013. About a dozen other trustees at the American Museum of Natural History contacted for comment declined or did not respond.Moreover, institutions with boards as large as the museum\u2019s (which numbers 49) are typically run by a core group of highly active trustees, with others often being less knowledgeable about the detailed backgrounds of fellow members.It is unclear what, if any, influence Ms. Mercer has had at the museum beyond her financial leverage and her power as a board member. Ms. Mercer did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and Ellen V. Futter, the museum\u2019s president, declined to comment about Ms. Mercer. But Ms. Futter was emphatic that it is the museum\u2019s scientists, not its trustees, who make decisions about the substance of what is presented at the museum.\u201cThe scientists at the museum are the ones who are responsible for the interpretation and presentation of scientific content,\u201d she said.\u201cWe\u2019ve done several exhibits on climate change, we\u2019ve done numerous education offerings on climate change,\u201d she added, \u201cand it is the scientists who make all of the decisions about science.\u201dMs. Futter would not comment on the calls for Ms. Mercer to step down or what brought her to the board, declining to discuss the activities of a specific trustee.Told of Ms. Mercer\u2019s role on the museum board, several scientists and environmental organizations said that she should resign or be removed from her position because, they said, she was working at cross purposes with its mission.\u201cThere is no room for promoters of anti-science on the board of a science museum, let alone arguably the greatest science museum in the world,\u201d said Michael E. Mann, a leader in the climate field who directs the Earth System Science Center at Penn State. He added that Ms. Mercer \u201chas actively funded the climate change denial and disinformation campaign.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s certainly a force,\u201d the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a top Trump adviser, said. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the people whose phone calls get taken.\u201dEnvironmental concerns prompted climate scientists and other groups last year to call for removal of the conservative philanthropist David H. Koch from the museum\u2019s board. He stepped down, though the museum said the reasons were unrelated to the protests.Ms. Mercer is not known for publicly speaking out on the climate change issue. But her generous support of organizations that raise doubts about global warming drew criticism from environmental groups like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace.\u201cTo politicize science is shameful; to politicize the institutions that are designed to foster greater learning is even worse,\u201d Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said. The museum\u2019s executives \u201cshould acknowledge that they have a healthy endowment \u2014 a steady stream of funding \u2014 and they should thank Ms. Mercer for her service and talk about a reasonable plan for her to resign,\u201d he said.Jesse Coleman, a researcher with Greenpeace, called Ms. Mercer\u2019s role on the board troubling. \u201cThey\u2019re an educational institution and they are trying to present the truth,\u201d he said, \u201cand now they have people in important positions on their board who are actively funding misinformation and they know that.\u201dIn addition to the Heartland Institute and the Heritage Foundation, the Mercer foundation has made significant donations to the Cato Institute and the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, both of which also challenge aspects of climate change.The Oregon Institute, which does research on biochemistry and diagnostic medicine, was co-founded by Arthur B. Robinson, a chemistry professor who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in Oregon and received $15,000 in campaign contributions from Ms Mercer. In 1997, Mr. Robinson was co-author of an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal, \u201cGlobal Warming Is a Myth,\u201d which called rising levels of carbon dioxide \u201ca boon for the environment.\u201dThe article was a rebuttal to the Kyoto Protocol, which embraced the existence of human-caused global warming and set goals for worldwide emissions reductions. \u201cThere is not a shred of persuasive evidence that humans have been responsible for increasing global temperatures,\u201d the piece said, adding, \u201cSo we needn\u2019t worry about human use of hydrocarbons warming the Earth.\u201dMr. Robinson also directed the Oregon Institute\u2019s Petition Project, which said \u201cthat the human-caused global warming hypothesis is without scientific validity and that government action on the basis of this hypothesis would unnecessarily and counterproductively damage both human prosperity and the natural environment.\u201dMs. Mercer has science bona fides, having earned a master\u2019s degree in management science and engineering from Stanford University, where she studied biology and math as an undergraduate.During the recent presidential campaign, Ms. Mercer started as a leading supporter of Ted Cruz, who also argued that the threat of global warming was overstated. She and her husband, Sylvain Mirochnikoff, a managing director at Morgan Stanley \u2014 they have four children \u2014 hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Cruz in 2015 at their Upper West Side triplex in Heritage at Trump Place.Among the biggest Mercer beneficiaries is the Heartland Institute, to which their foundation has given nearly $5 million. In 2011, Joseph Bast, president and chief executive of the institute, wrote that liberals accept global warming as true because stopping it \u201crequires higher taxes, more income redistribution\u201d and other \u201cpolicies already on the liberal political agenda.\u201d\u201cLiberals have no reason to \u2018look under the hood\u2019 of the global warming scare, to see what the real science says,\u201d he added. \u201cThey believe in global warming because they feel it justifies their ideological convictions.\u201d\u201cHow can a science museum reconcile placing a climate denier in a leadership position?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s incomprehensible.\u201d\u201cIn the anti-knowledge era,\u201d Ms. Economopoulos added, \u201cthe role of our most trusted institutions of science is more important than ever.\u201dColin Moynihan and Agustin Armendariz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Navient Lawsuits, Unsettling Echoes of Past Lending Crisis", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byA man in Boston rolled several student loans into one, and his balance doubled overnight, with no explanation.Near Chicago, a 39-year-old former graduate student who had a financial windfall sent in a $10,000 check to pay off his loans \u2014 and the payment was promptly lost.The same thing happened to a woman in Maryland, who uncovered the problem three years later, after her loan had grown by $11,000.And in New York City, a 41-year-old homeless man, who should qualify for reduced monthly payments, has been pleading for a break on his loan payments but says that no one is listening.Sound familiar?State and federal lawsuits filed this week accused Navient, the largest collector of student loan payments in the nation, of the kind of sloppiness and misleading tactics that emerged in the mortgage market in the years after the financial crisis.The company, which is fighting the lawsuits, has denied wrongdoing.\u201cNavient has a well-established, superior track record of helping student loan borrowers succeed in repayment,\u201d Patricia Nash Christel, a company spokeswoman, said in a written statement. \u201cWe will vigorously defend against these false allegations.\u201dThe accusations against Navient, by the nation\u2019s consumer watchdog agency and attorneys general in two states, are aggravating a student loan crisis that has swept the United States. Student loan debt has surged to $1.4 trillion, eclipsing the totals for auto loans and credit cards, and burdening a generation with a mountain of debt just as its members try to find their financial footing.Navient, which services the loans of roughly 12 million current and former students across the country, is responsible for keeping track of monthly payments on more than $300 billion in loans. It also has tremendous power \u2014 and leeway \u2014 in shepherding struggling borrowers through the process of either capping their monthly payments based on income or finding other ways of reducing those payments.Guiding these borrowers takes time and training. Navient, the lawsuits say, steered clients toward options that were simpler for the company.Anna Nepomuceno, 40, who lives in Tacoma, Wash., has been trying for years to get help from Navient. Around a decade ago, her partner, Andrew Brittell, 46, took out multiple loans totaling tens of thousands of dollars to attend DeVry, a for-profit school. Mr. Brittell now works in the billing department of a telecommunications company and takes home around $3,000 a month after taxes, barely covering the basic living expenses for their family of five.Mr. Brittell\u2019s federal loans would probably qualify him for an income-based repayment plan, and he has repeatedly applied to Navient to participate in such a program. The company has repeatedly lost his paperwork, Ms. Nepomuceno said \u2014 and each time, Navient suggested that Mr. Brittell instead apply for yet another loan forbearance, a program that suspends payments while interest continues to accrue.Several of Mr. Brittell\u2019s loans have been in forbearance for more than five years, Ms. Nepomuceno said. He has made no payments on them, and the balance due has ballooned to more than $90,000.Mr. Brittel \u201cwill put in the paperwork, and then they\u2019ll tell us that it never went through, or that they lost it, and we should go on forbearance,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThis has happened over and over again. It\u2019s like a vicious cycle.\u201dNavient declined to comment on individual customers\u2019 cases. But Mr. Brittell\u2019s story is not unique, according to the suits filed this week, including one by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency created under the 2010 financial reform laws that increased regulation of the financial industry.It took more than six years, Ms. Vitakauskas, 43, said, to get her monthly payments lowered.In the meantime, her loan balance \u2014 money she took out to earn a graduate degree in English \u2014 grew to more than $100,000, nearly double what she originally borrowed.\u201cI just felt like I was treading water,\u201d she said.Half of Navient\u2019s borrowers who were struggling and met the criteria for income-based repayment plans would qualify for a $0 monthly payment, the consumer bureau found in its analysis.But since 2010, Navient has enrolled some 1.5 million borrowers in at least two consecutive forbearances lasting 12 months or longer. Many of those borrowers would have been better off with an income-based plan, the bureau said.Adam S. Minsky, a lawyer in Boston, has worked with hundreds of clients trying to resolve problems with Navient.A guide to student loans at various universities, and what it takes after graduation to repay that debt.\u201cThey\u2019re not providing blatant misinformation, but they\u2019re not providing the borrower with the full spectrum of what their rights and options are,\u201d Mr. Minsky said. \u201cThat in itself is a form of misrepresentation.\u201dMore than half of Navient\u2019s customers who did manage to enroll in income-based plans fell out of them because they did not complete the annual renewal paperwork \u2014 a key step that Navient failed to prominently alert borrowers to, the lawsuits say.Navient also routinely lost or misapplied its customers\u2019 payments, according to the suits.In December 2012, Rahat Khan of Rockville, Md., tried to make a dent in the loans she had taken out to finance her daughter\u2019s education, going online to pay $38,000 she had borrowed against her house. Relieved, Ms. Khan, 62, thought she was done.But in 2015, she started to get collection calls on the student loan that she thought had been paid. \u201cWhat loan, I remember asking,\u201d she said. Swollen with interest and late fees, the loan had grown by $11,419.\u201cI went through circles and circles,\u201d said Ms. Khan, whose credit was tarnished because of the loan. It took Kathleen Hyland, a lawyer in Baltimore, to straighten it out.Scott Kenemore, 39, who lives in Evanston Ill., had no such help.Mr. Kenemore, a writer, sent Navient a check in August 2015 to pay off a balance of around $10,000 remaining on his graduate school student loans. Navient lost it, so he made a payment by phone instead. Then Navient apparently found the check \u2014 and tried to deposit it. Repeatedly.\u201cI had to close my bank account over it, because Navient would just not stop and their customer service was absolutely useless,\u201d Mr. Kenemore said.\u201cComplaints reported to C.F.P.B. represent fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent of Navient customers and have been consistent with or below the market share of the loans we service,\u201d said Ms. Christel, of Navient.Unless Navient agrees to settle, the lawsuits are likely to take years. The consumer bureau, and the attorneys general, said they were seeking restitution and a change in the company\u2019s practices.\u201cEvery single one of the borrowers who is having their loan serviced by Navient or one of Navient\u2019s companies is a borrower that\u2019s impacted,\u201d said Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general, who filed one of the state cases. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to put a price tag on that, it\u2019s billions of dollars.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Programs That Are Predatory: It\u2019s Not Just at For-Profit Colleges", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byCost of CollegeThe failing-program list included ITT Tech, which filed for bankruptcy under federal pressure late last year, as well as industry leaders like Kaplan University and the University of Phoenix. And there \u2014 among a host of local graphic design, fashion, cosmetology and barber schools \u2014 is Harvard University.The fact that such a world-famous institution of higher learning was caught in a regulatory net devised to protect students from exploitative trade schools suggests that even the most prestigious colleges may not be paying enough attention to whether their degrees are worth the price of admission.The Obama administration\u2019s rules on for-profit colleges are based on two statistical measures of individual programs: how much money typical program graduates are required to spend on student loan payments every year, and how much they earn in the job market two years after graduation. If this \u201cdebt-to-earnings ratio\u201d is too high for multiple years \u2014 if graduates need to spend too much of their income paying down loans \u2014 then the program is ruled ineligible to receive federal financial aid.Republican members of Congress and people working with the incoming Trump administration have called for rolling back the for-profit college regulations. Harvard\u2019s inclusion suggests it might make sense to expand the rules to include nonprofit programs with similar problems.The problem, from a regulatory standpoint, is that they borrow a lot of money to obtain the degree \u2014 over $78,000 on average, according to the university. The two-year tuition total is around $63,000. And because it\u2019s a graduate program, students can also borrow the full cost of their living expenses from the federal government, regardless of their credit history.After accounting for basic living expenses, the average Harvard A.R.T. Institute graduate has to pay 44 percent of discretionary income just to make the minimum loan payment.Because the regulations put the program\u2019s federal aid eligibility at risk, the A.R.T. Institute will not be enrolling any new students this fall, said David Cameron, a spokesman from Harvard. This temporary pause in enrollment will be used to \u201cevaluate the program and undertake vital strategic planning to address, among other things, student funding mechanisms.\u201dThe for-profit Art Institutes programs that failed the federal test trained students in fields including commercial photography, video production, radio broadcasting, culinary arts, interior decorating and video game design. Other programs that crop up frequently on the failing list include cosmetology and barbering, acupuncture and massage therapy, criminal justice studies and low-level jobs in health care fields.What these programs have in common is a combination of marketing appeal to young people \u2014 design video games for a living! \u2014 and little or no outside pressure to ensure that the education is both of high quality and leads to jobs that pay enough to finance the cost of student loans. Sure, there are good programs in all of these fields, including some offered by for-profit schools. But it can be very hard for the average consumer to know the difference beforehand.Running a sound program can be done. The Department of Education regulations were used to evaluate over 600 licensed practical nursing programs. Not one of them failed the debt-to-earnings-ratio test. That\u2019s because most are offered at affordable prices by public community colleges, and the L.P.N. field is carefully monitored by health care regulators and the nursing profession itself. Program graduates usually leave with little debt and consistently earn salaries of $30,000 to $50,000 a year.So while some failing programs are simply bad programs, providing slipshod training and credentials with little value in the labor market, others may be very good, but are just too expensive. Presumably, that was the case with the A.R.T. Institute at Harvard, which was also caught by a quirk in the regulation. It was evaluated in the first place only because its two-year graduate degree was classified as a \u201ccertificate,\u201d not a traditional master\u2019s degree.There are hundreds of master\u2019s of fine arts programs out there, training people for careers as writers, actors and artists. Many of them also charge hefty tuition and leave graduates with substantial debt. Nobody tracks how much students borrow to attend these programs, or how much they earn after graduation. The same is true for most other master\u2019s programs, law schools and more. But because they happen to be located at nonprofit colleges, they\u2019re not subject to the Department of Education regulations.Many Republicans have criticized the for-profit regulations for singling out one sector in a larger industry. Virginia Foxx, the North Carolina congresswoman who leads the House of Representatives education committee, has introduced legislation that would repeal the rules.But it might make more sense to expand the regulations to include for-profit and nonprofit colleges alike. Higher education is a market, and markets function only if consumers have adequate information. Harvard is the world\u2019s richest university and spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on financial aid. If it needed a nudge from the government to re-evaluate its affordability policies, that suggests that many other colleges need one, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Says Accusations in Trump Dossier Are \u2018Clearly Fake\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia declared on Tuesday that the political memo alleging that the Kremlin had sought for years to influence President-elect Donald J. Trump was \u201cfake,\u201d and he said that the effort to compile such a dossier was further evidence of the political decay of the West \u2014 one of the Russian leader\u2019s favorite themes.Mr. Putin also accused the departing United States administration of trying to undermine President Obama\u2019s successor, saying that Russian spies had better things to do than chase rich American businessmen and try to catch them in compromising situations.\u201cThese bogus stories are clearly fake,\u201d Mr. Putin said at a news conference of allegations that included Mr. Trump cavorting with prostitutes while visiting Russia.\u201cHe is a grown man, somebody who for many years has been organizing beauty contests, interacted with the most beautiful women in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cYou know, it is difficult for me to imagine that he ran to a hotel to meet with our young women with lowered social responsibility.\u201dWhile calling prostitution a \u201chorrible social phenomenon,\u201d Mr. Putin also boasted about Russian exceptionalism, adding: \u201cEven though they are undoubtedly the best in the world, too. I doubt that Trump would go for that.\u201dThere is a frenzy of attention in Russia focused on the change in administration in Washington, even by the standards of state-run television, which generally devotes more time covering the United States than it does the rest of the world.Rossiya 24, a cable news station, is broadcasting a countdown to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday, featuring a new segment daily on some slice of the president-elect\u2019s biography. \u201cNews of the Week,\u201d Russian state television\u2019s flagship program, devoted most of its 21/2 hours Sunday to bashing the Obama administration and lauding the pending Trump presidency.The tone of some of the public statements in Russia has been gleeful. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and an outspoken ally of Mr. Putin, called Friday a historic day. \u201cI ask everyone to shave themselves, put on their best suits, sit down to tables at 8 p.m. and lift a glass of champagne,\u201d he said.Other figures were more sober. Sergey Stankevich, the head of the international affairs committee for the Party of Growth, another political party, said that Mr. Trump might prove to be \u201cno picnic,\u201d and that someone predictable like Hillary Clinton might have been better for Russia.Russia had no reason to pursue Mr. Trump when he visited Moscow, Mr. Putin said.\u201cHe was not a political figure, we didn\u2019t even know about his political ambitions, simply a businessman, one of the rich Americans,\u201d the Russian president said in what seemed to be a carefully worded response to a reporter\u2019s question. \u201cDo people really think that our special services are chasing every American billionaire? This is complete nonsense.\u201dMr. Putin called the memo sign of a crumbling West. \u201cThe fact that such methods are used against the elected U.S. president is a unique case,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cThis demonstrates a serious degradation of the political elites in the West, including in the U.S.\u201dWhile expressing hopes that a Trump administration would repair ties with Russia and balance relations with Europe through \u201ccommon sense,\u201d Mr. Putin said that the new president\u2019s agenda was unclear: \u201cLook, I never met Mr. Trump, I don\u2019t know what he will do on the international arena.\u201dForeign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov also dismissed the memo compiled by American political operatives as an invention, calling the former British spy who wrote it \u201csome runaway crook from MI-6.\u201dMr. Lavrov, speaking at an extended news conference, accused American agents of working hard to both recruit Russian diplomats as spies and to help foment public demonstrations in Russia.He also made overtures toward improved ties with the United States, saying the fact that Mr. Trump had spoken about nuclear weapons in the context of Russian relations was perfectly natural. A day earlier, however, one of his deputies rejected the idea suggested by Mr. Trump that lifting economic sanctions could be linked to a new arms control deal.On Syria, however, Mr. Lavrov said that Russia had invited the United States to participate in peace talks focused on Syrian military commanders that are due to convene Monday in Kazakhstan .The current crisis in relations between the Kremlin and Washington was prompted by Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and attempts to destabilize Ukraine.Advertisement"}

They are making contingency plans to move thousands of jobs elsewhere. Other European Union members are eager to get those jobs. Their leaders also have suggested that Britain must be penalized economically to discourage further defections from the bloc.The country that came to symbolize Europe\u2019s economic travails a few years ago has receded from the headlines somewhat, obscured by Brexit, fears of terrorist attacks in European cities and coming elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. But Greece\u2019s economy remains anemic and in need of more debt relief.Negotiations for further restructuring of Greece\u2019s debts, involving Germany and the International Monetary Fund, also have encountered difficulties. \u201cIf the I.M.F. and Germany cannot find a way out, this is a serious problem,\u201d said Dimitrios Argyroulis, a political economics scholar at the University of Sheffield.While Mr. Trump\u2019s subordinates have sought to reassure European Union leaders that the United States remains a reliable ally, doubts have been planted. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the foreign minister of Germany at the time Trump made those remarks, said they had \u201ccaused astonishment.\u201dEmboldened by the momentum of Brexit and Mr. Trump, nationalist politicians espousing hostility toward the European Union and Muslim immigrants have made strong gains in campaigns for coming elections in three European countries, including the two largest.Even if Ms. Merkel survives to win a fourth term as chancellor, political analysts see her as a weakened figure, and at the worst possible time.An article last Sunday about challenges facing Europe in 2017 misidentified the party of Geert Wilders, a populist lawmaker in the Netherlands who wants to slash immigration and lead the country out of the European Union. It is the Freedom Party, not the Party for Freedom and Democracy. (The latter is Prime Minister Mark Rutte\u2019s party.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Address, Cuomo Posits New York\u2019s Policies as an Answer to Trump", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byDelivering the first of six State of the State addresses planned around the state this week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Monday located the cure to the nation\u2019s political fever in New York State, implicitly offering himself as an antidote to a president-elect whose name went unmentioned.\u201cNew York knows that our progressive principles of acceptance and diversity are not the enemy of our middle class, and we know that middle-class success is not the enemy of our progressive beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, it was the progressive policies that created the nation\u2019s middle class in the first place.\u201dAhead of his scheduled stops in western and central New York, on Long Island, in Westchester County and in Albany, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s remarks in a light-filled room at 1 World Trade Center colored largely within state lines.But remarkably for a politician who has avoided even the appearance of White House ambitions since entering the governor\u2019s mansion in 2011, his speech also seemed aimed at an audience outside New York.Mr. Cuomo reiterated his promise to upgrade Queens\u2019s two major airports, but he dwelled far longer on the reality on Queens\u2019s streets. There, he said, the economic recovery trumpeted by the Obama administration had somehow never gotten around to the Hillside Avenue gas station where he worked as a teenager or the \u201cpizzeria where we hung out.\u201d\u201cIt is not what they feel,\u201d he said, referring to the white middle-class voters who proved so receptive to Donald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201cIt is not their reality.\u201dLines drawn from the Elizabeth Warren syllabus got the Cuomo treatment (at one point, he noted that the Wall Street executives who presided over the financial crisis were never punished). One of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s chief proposals on Monday was a \u201cmiddle-class recovery act\u201d that he said would provide jobs and erect infrastructure, expand access to education and lower taxes.Lest anybody miss the point, the governor\u2019s staff circulated \u201ckey takeaways\u201d and quotations from the speech, billing the address as a groundbreaking blueprint for moving forward in the Trump era.There were blink-and-you\u2019d-miss-it proposals covering what seemed like the whole spectrum of liberal causes. Doubling the child-care tax credit for more than 200,000 families. Executive orders intended to reduce a wage gap for women working for the state. Criminal justice reforms affecting the state\u2019s bail system, recordings of police interrogations, the age of criminal liability and access to a speedy trial. Same-day voter registration and early voting.But there was someone present who wanted to air the legislators\u2019 grievances, however lonely the quest.About 64 floors below the pristine white room in which Mr. Cuomo spoke, Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the state Republican Party and a Trump supporter who had been denied entrance, monitored the proceedings from a Joe & the Juice shop.\u201cHe\u2019s afraid to face them,\u201d Mr. Cox said outside afterward, referring to state legislators. \u201cSo he\u2019s running around the state giving great speeches that really sound like speeches for someone who\u2019d like to be president of the United States, rather than someone who\u2019s governor of New York State.\u201dIn the cold wind, Mr. Cox fended off a shiver. He planned to follow the governor to his afternoon speech in Buffalo, where Mr. Cox would be, doubtless, equally unwelcome.Advertisement"}

Will Congress approve his plan to eliminate the full range of programs \u2014 from grants that have drawn criticism to those that have been more widely embraced?Here is a tour of the debate that reignited this winter when The Hill newspaper reported that the Trump administration was considering eliminating the art and humanities agencies and defunding the nonprofit public broadcasting corporation as part of a wider program of federal budget cuts.A raft of organizations immediately condemned the idea, including the Association of Art Museum Directors, the American Alliance of Museums, Americans for the Arts and PEN America. Others have long applauded any effort to strip the funds, suggesting, among other things, that public television and radio promoted agendas out of step with much of America.Here are some of the

and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be the size of the period in this sentence.Annual funding for the two endowments lags behind where it was in the early 1990s after controversies over money for provocative arts projects like Andres Serrano\u2019s urine-immersed crucifix created a climate that led to budget cuts. The two endowment agencies each receive about $148 million a year now. The budget for public broadcasting, currently $445 million, has been more consistent over the years.Together they still account for only $741 million, or much less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the United States\u2019 annual federal spending, an amount supporters say is too small to make a difference. Conservatives suggest it will take many small cuts to roll back uncontrolled federal spending.\u201cA radical virus of multiculturalism,\u201d the foundation wrote,\u201d has permanently infected the agency, causing artistic efforts to be evaluated by race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation instead of artistic merit.\u201dThe National Endowment for the Arts said that the plays were worthy on their merits, regardless of their stance on issues. It has emphasized the extent to which its support for projects is apolitical and meant for all kinds of people. The agencies are particularly proud of programs they run to benefit veterans, such as the National Endowment for the Arts\u2019 creative arts therapy project for military personnel at a hospital at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. In the program, which is expanding to 12 centers around the country, patients use exercises, like painting masks, to overcome traumatic brain injuries and psychological problems. \u201cThe patient is the one controlling it,\u201d said Jackie Jones, a creative arts therapist who has worked with 270 military personnel since the project began three years ago. \u201cThey wind up gaining control over what used to control them.\u201d\u201cAppalshop serves the rural and underrepresented population of central Appalachia,\u201d Ms. Rubens said.Supporters of public arts funding point, on the other hand, to a host of educational and economic benefits, like tourism, that are often fostered by the projects they finance. Beyond that, they say, for every Metropolitan Museum of Art, where federal support is minimal, there are many other organizations that simply could not survive without public funding.\u201cWithout C.P.B. funding, I don\u2019t have a staff,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt pays for our staff and programming. They are the glue for us.\u201d To be sure, most of the 1,500 radio and television stations that receive some funding from the corporation do not rely on federal subsidies to anywhere near that extent. But the corporation said that dozens of stations did rely on the federal money for 40 percent or more of their operating revenues.\u201cThe federal investment in public media is vital seed money \u2014 especially for stations located in rural America,\u201d the corporation said in a statement last week amid the speculation about its future.Similarly endangered, advocates say, would be many art exhibitions that entertain the country, sometimes stopping at small and large museums. The cost of insuring the art shown in these exhibitions can be offset by a federal indemnity program administered by the National Endowment for the Arts. So when the Taft Museum of Art in Cincinnati staged \u201cDaubigny, Monet, Van Gogh: Impressions of Landscape,\u201d the most expensive project it had ever put on, the indemnity program paid for most of the insurance cost of bringing 54 on-loan paintings (out of 55 in the entire exhibition) to Cincinnati.Visitors from 44 states and eight foreign countries visited the show, said Deborah Emont Scott, the museum\u2019s director, and without the federal financing, \u201cIt would not have happened.\u201dOf course, the shuttering of some other arts organizations does not seem a looming catastrophe if you view the art they are producing as hopelessly banal.\u201cI am even more concerned about federal funding and political intervention leading to mediocrity,\u201d said Romina Boccia, of the Heritage Foundation, \u201cthan I am about potentially controversial art being funded with taxpayer dollars.If you last visited the Washington headquarters of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts in 2014 and returned to say hello today you might be surprised. Both agencies moved out of the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue to make way for a new tenant: the Trump International Hotel. It opened last fall after a renovation that cost more than $200 million, which, of course, is more than the budget of either of those agencies.Robin Pogrebin contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "What Does Vladimir Putin See in Donald Trump?", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byAt noon on Friday, Donald Trump will become the 45th president of the United States. Millions of Americans will rejoice at the sight, and millions more will not. As a rule, foreign leaders don\u2019t attend the inauguration of American presidents, but Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, will be there in spirit. To understand why and to understand what\u2019s happening as Trump takes over the White House, we need to go back two weeks.ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.The intelligence assessment raises the question: what made Trump an attractive vehicle through which to attempt to weaken the liberal democratic order. Why him?Trump has flouted the norms of American elections and governance at every turn, including calling for the jailing of an opposing candidate, encouraging violence against protesters, endorsing the torture of prisoners, suggesting he might not respect the results of the election, falsely claiming that millions of illegal votes were cast, failing to resolve unprecedented conflicts of interest or to even disclose his tax returns, and attacking a federal judge based on his ethnicity (and that\u2019s of course a highly incomplete list). I can\u2019t directly assess the IC report, but it\u2019s fair to say that the liberal democratic order is being disrupted both in the U.S. and around the world.incendiary talk is an affront to elementary democratic decency and a breach of the boundaries of American political discourse.\u201d Krauthammer added: \u201cIt takes decades, centuries, to develop ingrained norms of political restraint and self-control. But they can be undone in short order by a demagogue feeding a vengeful populism.Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, sent me his thoughts:One, the Russians have known for a long time that Trump was susceptible to flattery, especially from major authority figures. Two, he had a significant following in the US as a mega-celebrity. Three, if he got engaged in politics, it would be divisive \u2014 a good early example being his birther efforts. Four, he would perplex, frustrate and divide Republican establishment figures, most of whom were hostile to Russia, but a divided major party serves to disrupt the democracy. I doubt they thought he would win, but he would encourage or exacerbate divisions in the society, challenge many fundamental norms over his own narcissistic sociopathic views of himself and his entitlements, and break a lot of crockery without a second\u2019s misgiving. His victories, with the GOP nomination and the election were unexpected icing on the cake.One of our conclusions was that the Kremlin seeks out political and economic forces which weaken the \u201cWest\u2019s desirability, credibility and moral authority.\u201d It does this to make Russia\u2019s neighbors less interested in seeking to cooperate and integrate with Europe or the U.S., making them more dependent on Russia. It seeks to undermine NATO\u2019s unity in the hopes of seeking a new grand bargain with the U.S. in which the U.S. will recognize Russia\u2019s sphere of influence and will not interfere in its internal issues.Conley continued:Against this backdrop, during the presidential campaign Mr. Trump was the only candidate that openly questioned America\u2019s commitment to NATO and its commitment to defend the Baltic States. He was the only candidate who was not very critical of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine and Syria and chose to reframe them in ways that were in sync with Russian policy. He has proposed a new relationship with Russia. In other words, based on Mr. Trump\u2019s statements, his views appear to align with Russian interests.There are those who dispute the conclusions of the government\u2019s intelligence report.\u201cInstead of wasting more time\u201d debating the contents of the report, Applebaum wrote on Jan. 13, \u201cmaybe we ought to abandon our obsession with \u2018secrets\u2019 and \u2018spies\u2019 and look at what is sitting in front of us.\u201dHere is Applebaum\u2019s case.First, \u201cTrump\u2019s real estate empire relies, though we don\u2019t know how much, on Russian money.\u201dSecond, Applebaum writes,Fourth:Finally, Applebaum argues as evidence of Trump\u2019s pro-Russia tilt thatTrump is willing to risk serious conflict with China, to destroy U.S. relations with Mexico, to dismiss America\u2019s closest allies in Europe and to downgrade NATO, our most important military alliance.All this provides the basis for Applebaum\u2019s conclusion:Trump doesn\u2019t have to be a Manchurian candidate who has been hypnotized or recruited by foreign intelligence. It\u2019s enough that he has direct and indirect links to a profoundly corrupt and violent foreign dictator, whose policies he admires, whose advisers he shares and whose slogans he uses. That\u2019s kompromat enough for me.Many of the domestic and foreign policy experts I contacted suggested that Russia would not need to blackmail Trump to get what it wanted \u2014 that Trump\u2019s susceptibility to praise has made him vulnerable to manipulation.David Leege, a professor emeritus of political science at Notre Dame, wrote me:Trump was a willing but unwitting accomplice because he loved the flattery, saw it only as a business opportunity, and had so little understanding of international relations to recognize how affairs of state could be caught up in it.Along similar lines, Sandy Maisel, a political scientist at Colby, argued that Trump\u2019sego is such that he never asked, nor does he ask yet, what playing into the Russians needs and desires meant for our system. An unwitting \u2014 ego-driven \u2014 tool of Putin\u2019s goal to undermine faith in our system and in the Clinton candidacy.Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, was outspoken in his response to my question asking why the Russians favored Trump:His shameless mendacity, narcissism, authoritarian instincts, inability to tolerate opposition or criticism, hostility to formal institutions and the media, vast ignorance of foreign and domestic issues, indifference to constitutional restraints and eagerness to whip up and exploit xenophobia and (barely disguised) racism. We might add his affection for authoritarian leaders and other tough guys. Have I left anything out? Probably. All of these characteristics lead him to say things and propose actions antithetical to democratic norms and standards.Putin sees in Trump someone who is enormously susceptible to flattery, which Putin is perfectly happy to provide in order to achieve his national objectives.Putin\u2019s major objective, Wertheimer wrote by email, isto break up the Western alliance and he appears to see Trump as an excellent vehicle to achieve this goal.Vladimir Putin has seized the momentum of this unraveling, exacting critical damage to the underpinnings of the liberal world order in a shockingly short time.This threat, McKew warns, should not be taken lightly:The West is already at war, whether it wants to be or not. It may not be a war we recognize, but it is a war. This war seeks, at home and abroad, to erode our values, our democracy, and our institutional strength; to dilute our ability to sort fact from fiction, or moral right from wrong; and to convince us to make decisions against our own best interests.Specific leaks may take aim at powerful individuals, but in the longer term, kompromat serves the interests of the powerful, which is why it is often a tool of autocrats. By eroding the very idea of a shared reality, and by spreading apathy and confusion among a public that learns to distrust leaders and institutions alike, kompromat undermines a society\u2019s ability to hold the powerful to account and ensure the proper functioning of government.Mr. Trump\u2019s version of reality got a boost: There was no such thing as truth, only a battle of opinions proffered by different actors, each of whom strives to be loudest.This means that we are facing the prospect of a renegade commander in chief armed with the considerable powers of the executive branch and a seemingly compliant legislature. Trump has already dealt a body blow to the political process. We will soon learn how much harm he can inflict once in office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Trump Hotel in Washington, Champagne Toasts in an Ethical \u2018Minefield\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byBut he was not heading to the White House. He was going to Trump International Hotel.It was a telling destination for those visits Wednesday night and Thursday afternoon. Perhaps more than any other location in Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate empire, this 263-room hotel epitomizes the convergence of Donald Trump the global businessman and Donald Trump the president-elect.Conflicts that for months have been theoretical are now about to become real \u2014 most immediately a possible challenge by the federal government. It owns the building that houses Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel and has granted him a 60-year lease. From the moment he is sworn in as president at noon Friday, Mr. Trump may be in violation of that lease, given a provision that appears to prohibit federal elected officials from renting the Old Post Office building, the Pennsylvania Avenue landmark that houses the hotel, from the government.Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and Duke Buchan III, a Florida money manager, were there this week.The minimum nightly rate at the hotel will be $735. One suite during inauguration week was offered for $500,000, with various perks. On Thursday, the president-elect attended a lunch with Republican leaders of Congress, cabinet members and hundreds of others in the hotel\u2019s enormous Presidential Ballroom, which features nine glass chandeliers and gold and white walls. \u201cThis is a gorgeous room,\u201d Mr. Trump told the gathering. \u201cA total genius must have built this place.\u201dNearby, in the lobby bar, guests drank Champagne and ordered expensive cocktails off a drink menu that includes a $100 libation called the Benjamin, made of vodka, raw oysters and caviar. Guests wore red and white \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats.By continuing to own the Trump Organization, conflict of interest accusations will persist.\u201cThat building is symbolic of the minefield that President-elect Trump has decided to walk through,\u201d said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, who is the ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is charged with investigating any potential wrongdoing by government officials. \u201cWe are going now from the hypothetical to reality \u2014 and I myself am not sure where it is going to lead.\u201dSean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, defended Mr. Trump\u2019s continued close ties to the hotel. \u201cThat he\u2019s going to his own hotel? I mean, I think that\u2019s pretty smart,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cI think the idea that he\u2019s going to his own hotel shouldn\u2019t be a shocker. It\u2019s a beautiful place. It\u2019s a place that he\u2019s very proud of.\u201dMr. Spicer added: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely stunning hotel. I encourage you all to go there if you haven\u2019t been by.\u201dThe story of Mr. Trump and the Old Post Office began in August 2013, when the General Services Administration awarded Mr. Trump the contract that would allow him to develop the landmark tower.His children Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. each have a small stake in the company that holds the lease. Mr. Trump, who owns the vast majority of the company, is the only family member with a financial interest in the project, however, investing roughly $2.4 million of his own money, records show.The Post Office project is valued at roughly $200 million, much of it financed by Deutsche Bank, a favorite lender of the Trump Organization. The bank agreed to lend up to $170 million. The deal requires a Trump company to pay the government $3 million a year in rent from the hotel\u2019s opening date.At the time, however, few could have foreseen it would be Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration Washington would be celebrating, and the headache that would create.The lease between the General Services Administration and the Trump company includes a clause \u2014 \u201cno member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom\u201d \u2014 that federal contract experts say makes clear that Mr. Trump will be in violation of the deal as soon as he is sworn in.\u201cThe basic integrity and credibility of the president of the United States of the federal procurement and contracting regime is at risk,\u201d said Steven L. Schooner, a professor specializing in government procurement law at George Washington University. \u201cWe are about to have a legitimate scandal on our hands.\u201dRepresentative Cummings, the Maryland Democrat, said he expected the G.S.A. to declare the Trump Organization in breach of the contract. Renee Kelly, a spokeswoman for the agency, would not confirm that it intends to take such a move, saying only in a written statement that the \u201cG.S.A. won\u2019t have an update until Friday after the inauguration.\u201dThat a company Mr. Trump controls is a prominent tenant of the federal government is just the beginning of it.His administration will assume oversight of Wall Street regulation, which includes policing Deutsche Bank\u2019s activities.The Trump administration will also direct American foreign policy and will probably be in regular contact with the diplomats sent by other countries to the United States. For Washington hotels, those diplomats\u2019 visits are big business, and Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington hotel has been actively courting them in recent months.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said he would donate any profit derived from foreign government hotel guests to the United States Treasury. But Mr. Trump\u2019s critics say that would not eliminate the risk he would be violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which some legal experts say prohibits federal employees from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments.Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of University of California, Irvine, School of Law, said, \u201cThere is no doubt he will be benefiting financially from foreign government officials who are patronizing the Trump Hotel in Washington and other facilities around the world.\u201dEmployees at the hotel \u2014 the bellhops, bartenders, restaurant servers and housekeeping aides \u2014 are deciding if they will join the local hotel workers union, a process Mr. Trump recently agreed to allow without protest. Signature cards are being distributed to new employees at the hotel who will decide if they want to be organized.Labor disputes have ended up before the National Labor Relations Board, including one at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. Members of the board will be picked by Mr. Trump.\u201cWe want to get workers at the hotel organized, into a union and then negotiate a contract,\u201d said John Boardman, the president of the local, which represents about 7,000 hotel and casino workers in the Washington area.Employees at the hotel who might have discrimination claims or claims related to overtime pay, worker safety or health could end up having them investigated by federal agencies overseen by people Mr. Trump appoints.\u201cHim being an employer can only lead to complications,\u201d said Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization that studies labor issues. \u201cIt is inherent in owning a business.\u201dOver the last week, the Trump Organization and some of its marketing partners have been removing imagery of Mr. Trump and Ms. Trump from their websites.Even the marketing of the hotel is sure to draw scrutiny. Earlier this year Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel offered a $500,000 \u201cinauguration package\u201d to its wealthy clients, which included the opportunity to stay in a 6,300-square-foot suite, according to Travel Market Report, a news report that caters to travel professionals. Doug Gollan, a contributing editor and the author of the article, said hotel management told him that it had been sold.The hotel has certainly had a rush of business this week from the inauguration festivities. The lobby has turned into the social center for Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, who lounged at the dozens of tables set up in the lobby, washing down bottles of wine and offerings from the bar menu, including the $120 Trump tower seafood platter.Gentry Beach, 41, a prominent fund-raiser and friend of the Trump family, roamed the floor, greeting friends as they arrived for the big celebration on Friday. \u201cHow are you?\u201d Mr. Beach, a hedge fund manager from Dallas, said again and again, as he worked the room. \u201cHow are you?\u201dThe hotel was sold out and the restaurant was booked.\u201cWe are very busy,\u201d said Patricia Tang, the director of sales and marketing for the property. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can say.\u201dSteven Eder contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Short Stories", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byThe ShortlistEach of the 12 stories in Barkan\u2019s collection unfolds in a corner of Mexico City or a district close by. The settings include a fusion restaurant in the capital\u2019s Polanco neighborhood, a wooden trailer at the famed Vazquez Hermanos Circus, a dusty f\u00fatbol field in Iztapalapa and a sock factory turned art studio in Puebla.The stories hinge on a comical yet eerie matter-of-factness. We meet a chef tasked with preparing a mind-blowing meal for the drug lord Joaqu\u00edn (El Chapo) Guzm\u00e1n using only two ingredients (and no salt, no pepper); a closeted employee of U.S. Wheat who comes out to his co-workers after being forced to enact a lewd confrontation with a dwarf; a bass player for \u201cthe best orchestras\u201d who, as a 12-year-old, almost lost his arm as punishment for failing to keep track of a local gang leader\u2019s watch; and a deeply troubled professor of painting who commits a brutal act in his home that accidentally yields his greatest masterpiece. Under the perhaps not-so-coincidental guise of a writer in \u201cThe Prison Breakout,\u201d Barkan ends up debating the merits of fiction and journalism, and which practice might result in more meaningful epiphanies.A particularly unsavory antagonist announces, in no uncertain terms: \u201cI\u2019m like the ghost of the barrio. I\u2019m everywhere and nowhere. I lurk in the shadows.\u201d Add to this appearances by real-life figures like El Chapo; the business magnate Carlos Slim; and the pseudonymous \u201cPaco,\u201d a plastic-surgery-seeking gangster reminiscent of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, and \u201cMexico\u201d comes to occupy a surreal space, described bluntly by Paco\u2019s surgeon: \u201cOne minute you\u2019re in your practice with Botox patients, the next a narco is threatening to kill you.\u201d\u201cI kind of think the purpose of life is to sing,\u201d muses an American picked up by thugs in \u201cThe Kidnapping.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mean, literally, always to sing, but to sing metaphorically, to sing in some way of beauty, to raise the spirits of our voices in hope.\u201d In that sense, \u201cMexico\u201d is an ensemble performance for which Barkan composed all of the parts.Miller\u2019s story \u201cUphill\u201d opens as most of the others in this book do: focused on a nameless couple (who remain anonymous for the duration) in an unspecified Southern town (this one is somewhere in Mississippi). In the case of \u201cUphill,\u201d the man tells his on-again-off-again girlfriend that he\u2019s been asked by a dope dealer to drive to Biloxi and \u201ctake a picture of a lady.\u201d The couple soon find themselves traveling down U.S. Route 49 after negotiating a higher fee.The action advances through the girlfriend\u2019s staccato narration (\u201cI open a beer and he takes it out of my hand. I open another\u201d). Her mind doesn\u2019t rest, and her prattle is arguably pathetic, albeit relatable: \u201cI\u2019ll never have a baby with him but I like the idea of it, having a small version of him that I could control, who would listen to me and obey me and tell me every thought that popped into his head.\u201d Reading a puffy quote from Cameron Diaz in an old issue of Cosmopolitan, she remarks, \u201cI wonder if her answer would be different in 2013, if she would say something so embarrassing and unfeminist-like.\u201dAll of the innominate girlfriends, wives, roommates, teachers and even a children\u2019s shelter worker offer similarly unfettered commentary. The stories begin to flow together through recurring objects \u2014 \u201cUphill\u201d ends with the girlfriend asking about her camera, and the next story begins with a camera trained on a woman; the boyfriend in \u201cUphill\u201d says he\u2019d like to buy the narrator a white bikini, an item worn by the narrator in the title story. Diaz, too, makes a second cameo, when the couple in \u201cHamilton Pool\u201d put on a DVD of \u201cThe Box.\u201dThere are recurring characters as well. The title story revisits the same threesome described in \u201cAt One Time This Was the Longest Covered Walkway in the World,\u201d though the reprise is more lucid, as though the protagonist hasn\u2019t had as much to drink. Taken as a whole, this harrowing yet ultimately enjoyable collection is less about the conventions of storytelling \u2014 exposition, climax, denouement \u2014 and more of a meditation on the stories a person tells herself.The first sentence of \u201cCrossbar,\u201d one of the 16 short stories in Novakovich\u2019s latest volume, plops us into the middle of a semifinal UEFA cup match between Zagreb and Belgrade on the precise and future date of May 25, 2018. The narrator describes the last 10 minutes of play and how Hodzic, a Bosnian-born Zagreb newbie, repeatedly fails to land the ball inside the goal, causing the crowd to erupt in violence (there\u2019s fleeting mention of the referee\u2019s beheading). The narrator then follows a group of hooligans on an impromptu trip to the zoo.Novakovich was born in the former Yugoslavia, and he has a fine ear for the tragic and the absurd. In \u201cCrossbar,\u201d after failing to toss Hodzic into the Siberian tiger cage at the zoo (the large cats are a present from Vladimir Putin, a recent retiree in Croatia), the protagonist and his fellow hooligans leave the athlete with a pair of grizzly bears gifted by President Obama, named Bill and Hillary. Hodzic, already in bad shape, is at last spared, though the narrator loses his right calf to Bill; once the men heal, the narrator tends to the paralyzed Hodzic for a year, yet doesn\u2019t acknowledge he was one of the hooligans. Eventually, Hodzic reveals that he knows the truth about his caretaker, and what seems like an allegorical farce becomes a rumination on friendship and trust.The other stories are equally brilliant and strange. Novakovich\u2019s \u201cDutch Treat\u201d builds up to the arrest of a former U.N. peacekeeper for inadvertently financing the 9/11 hijackers. In \u201cRemote Love,\u201d two of the characters have sexual intercourse via electromagnetic field. \u201cIn the Same Boat\u201d culminates in an act of cannibalism and a change of identity. The title story tells of a man named Jovan waiting in a Belgrade cafe for his cousin to bring him some inheritance money. It\u2019s also a master class in the short story form, particularly Jovan\u2019s breakdown of his mental state from 2:15 to 5:07 p.m. (time stamps include \u201c???\u201d and \u201c4:something\u201d), in which he thinks about cigarettes and Slobodan Milosevic, and asks some big questions too: \u201c4:32.

{"Headline": "Trump and Mexican President Speak by Phone Amid Dispute Over Wall", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byThe presidents made an effort to say that the call had been productive, implying that tensions had cooled, but they stood their ground on their positions, with no suggestion that the conversation had resolved their disagreement over fundamental issues, most notably the payment for construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico.\u201cWith respect to payment for the border wall, both presidents recognized their clear and very public differences in their stances on this very sensitive issue, and agreed to solve these differences as part of a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of the bilateral relationship,\u201d according to a statement issued by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s office.The statement added: \u201cThe presidents also agreed for now not to speak publicly about this controversial issue.\u201dThe White House issued an almost identical statement, calling it \u201ca joint statement.\u201d But it differed in one key respect: It did not include any mention of an agreement to refrain from speaking publicly about the wall or its financing.The standoff with Mexico\u2019s president was the first full-blown foreign policy clash with a foreign leader of the Trump administration, and was the culmination of months of tension between the two men surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to build the wall and renegotiate Nafta, the trade accord.\u201cWe had a very good call,\u201d Mr. Trump said Friday at a news conference in Washington. \u201cThe border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, and I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d\u201cI have great respect for Mexico,\u201d he continued. \u201cI love the Mexican people.\u201d But he added that Mexico \u201chas outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve made us look foolish,\u201d he added.Neither side disclosed who had initiated the phone conversation.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto did not comment beyond the statement issued by his office. But a Mexican government official described the conversation as \u201ccordial\u201d and said it went \u201crelatively well.\u201dThe presidents did not set another date to meet, in part to allow the relationship to \u201ccool off,\u201d said the official, who asked not to be identified to discuss a diplomatic issue.But they agreed to allow their teams to push forward with negotiations on an array of bilateral issues, including trade, immigration and the cross-border trafficking of drugs and weapons, the official said.They also agreed to leave discussion about the wall and its funding out of the negotiations, in effect quarantining it so that it did not contaminate conversations about other issues, the official said.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was widely applauded in Mexico for canceling the meeting \u2014 a rare moment of public approval for a wildly unpopular leader.\u201cWe have to support the president of Mexico to defend the national interest,\u201d Mr. Slim told a packed news conference at his business headquarters in Mexico City.Mr. Slim said \u201cthere are those\u201d who \u201capparently don\u2019t have pluralism, diversity, liberty, human rights, globalization, productivity, the environment, competition, on their radar,\u201d in a clear reference to Mr. Trump, whom he dined with in Palm Beach last month.The White House team, he continued, is \u201cnegotiating from a position of strength to see if we weaken.\u201d Like a growing number of Mexican business leaders and policy makers, Mr. Slim said that Mexico should be prepared to allow the United States to withdraw from Nafta if the Americans\u2019 demands were too high.But he said that Mexican negotiators must try to convince the Americans that \u201cit\u2019s better to do more business with us.\u201dThe relationship between Presidents Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Trump \u2014 not to mention Mr. Trump\u2019s with the rest of Mexico \u2014 had been on a downward trajectory since Mr. Trump took aim at Mexican immigrants during the 2015 speech that kicked off his campaign, and proceeded to build his White House run on promises to build a border wall, deport millions of Mexicans and pull out of Nafta.On Monday, in advance of the meeting between the presidents that had been scheduled for next week, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto released a set of principles that he said would guide any negotiations between the two countries. \u201cMexico doesn\u2019t believe in walls,\u201d he said.The next day, however, Mr. Trump issued a Twitter message reaffirming his vow to build the wall, to which the Mexican president, responding in a televised speech distributed on social media, once again criticized the project and reiterated his longstanding vow that Mexico would never pay for it.But on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump seemed to escalate the matter further with a threat to cancel the meeting should Mexico not be willing to pay for the wall, immediately prompting Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s cancellation of the meeting, a gambit that was widely applauded here by a population that has been clamoring for him to take a forcible stand against Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations.Mr. Slim, in his rambling 90-minute news conference, extolled the national unity he witnessed this week as Mexicans overwhelmingly rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of Mexico.\u201cThis national unity is very important to allow the government to go with dignity and strength to negotiate,\u201d he said.Elisabeth Malkin and Paulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Prendergast, has been the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. With an unassuming style, he has received broad praise from elected officials and transit advocates.\u201cShe was the strongest candidate, and she was chosen for that job, so that tells you what my level of confidence is in her,\u201d he said.Some transit advocates have raised concerns about the growing influence of Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, at the authority. He has announced headline-grabbing proposals like removing tollbooths from bridges and tunnels, pressuring board members to approve the plans even when their effect on the authority\u2019s finances is unclear.Richard Ravitch, a former authority chairman who is credited with turning the subway system around in the 1980s, said Mr. Prendergast had a difficult job.\u201cUnder the circumstances in which the authority was treated as an agency of the state, he did unbelievably and remarkably well,\u201d Mr. Ravitch said.Mr. Prendergast started at the authority in 1982, a time when the subway was performing so poorly that a colleague suggested that he take any train headed in the general direction of home in case he had to get out and walk. He thought he would stay for six months and ended up working at the agency for 25 years.But he also faced difficult moments, including two fatal crashes on the Metro-North Railroad and a recent crash of a Long Island Rail Road train at Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn. He said he was confident that the authority was addressing some of the safety problems highlighted by those episodes, including installing safety technology to automatically stop or slow a train.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to blame the delays on the increased ridership,\u201d said Mr. Prendergast, who uses the subway and railroad to commute to his home in Putnam County. \u201cIs it one of the factors? Yes. But we have to be able to manage it better.\u201dThere is also uncertainty over the financing for the $29.5 billion capital plan, which pays for maintenance and expansion projects on the aging network. Mr. Cuomo agreed that the state would pay about $8 billion for the plan, and Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, agreed that the city would contribute about $2.5 billion, but most of that money has not been allotted. The rest would come from the federal government and other sources. Mr. Prendergast said that he was confident that the governor and mayor would follow through on their promises.While Mr. Prendergast said that Mr. Cuomo had become more involved at the authority since he became chairman, he said that the agency was still an independent entity and that the governor had not interfered in operational decisions, like when to restart service after a snowstorm. Mr. Cuomo had \u201capplied pressure,\u201d Mr. Prendergast said, on projects like opening the Second Avenue subway on time.Mr. Cuomo has said he wants the next person to lead the authority to have development experience, but Gene Russianoff, the longtime leader of the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group, said that experience running train systems was more important.\u201cYou can pick up the other stuff, even real estate and financing if you have credibility,\u201d Mr. Russianoff said. \u201cTom had credibility, even when he was not the most independent person under the sun. His credibility counted for a lot.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Millennials, It\u2019s Never Too Early to Save for Retirement", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byRetiringYou have probably heard it yourself: the impression that millennials are financial freewheelers. The theory goes that today\u2019s 20- or 30-somethings spend with little regard for savings and even less regard for retiring.Retirement planning experts say that this assumption isn\u2019t entirely accurate \u2014 though it is perennially true that most young adults don\u2019t make retirement savings a financial priority. But, as the experts point out, millennials are in an ideal position to get started, because whatever they set aside will grow and accrue interest greatly over time.\u201cThe value of compounding means you\u2019ll have to contribute less later,\u201d said Maria Bruno, a senior investment strategist at Vanguard, the investment management company. She recommends that people open retirement accounts as early as they can \u2014 that way, the savings have more time to build and be reinvested. Eventually, the interest an account accrues will begin to earn interest of its own.The New York Times spoke to five people in the 20- to 35-year-old age group, a small sample of millennial savers. Two experts from the retirement division of Prudential Financial offered advice and feedback on each person\u2019s profile. Though advice differed based on the individual situation, advisers across the spectrum were consistent on two broader points:\u25a0 Young investors should take advantage of Roth retirement fund options. Roth funds, which include individual retirement accounts and 401(k)\u2019s, differ from traditional retirement accounts in that contributions are made after tax; once money is invested, earnings and withdrawals are tax-free.\u25a0 Younger workers should contribute at least as much as an employer is willing to match in a 401(k) or similar program.With this advice in mind, read a snapshot of millennials at various stages of retirement planning.Mr. LaCasse doesn\u2019t see himself jetting off to exotic destinations at the end of his career, but he does hope to have some financial security and independence. He makes about $52,000 a year and contributes 4 percent of every paycheck to a 403(b) account \u2014 a retirement account primarily for teachers. His school does not match his contributions, but he did receive an initial, one-time contribution of $1,200. He currently has about $6,000 in a savings account he doesn\u2019t touch, and he puts away a little from every paycheck.Though he would like to save more, Mr. LaCasse worries that he is not in a secure enough position to do so. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a feeling of short term versus long term, and unfortunately the short term comes first \u2014 I need to cover my day-to-day expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cThe long term takes a major back seat.\u201dFor one thing, student loan repayments (of nearly $500 a month) represent about a fifth of his monthly expenses and hinder his ability to squirrel away more.Mr. LaCasse said he had already considered refinancing and was thinking about it more seriously after hearing Ms. Sherman\u2019s advice. \u201cThe process seems so daunting, and it keeps getting pushed aside,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I feel more motivated to do it.\u201dIf she is able to break into theater or film, Ms. Craven would like to keep working for a lifetime. \u201cAs an actor, I\u2019m going to want to tell stories and do that as long as I can,\u201d she said.Even so, she hopes by her late 60s or early 70s to prioritize family time and traveling.Though she has never had a job with retirement benefits, she would be comfortable putting aside 5 to 10 percent of her $45,000 income on her own. She already has $7,500 in savings, but not in a formal retirement account. Her main concern is seasonal fluctuations in her salary that could derail a long-term savings plan. \u201cI\u2019m in a very busy season for work right now, so I\u2019m making more money, but once the tourists go away, it\u2019ll be back to scraping by,\u201d Ms. Craven said.She suggested that Ms. Craven find a financial adviser to develop a personalized strategy and perhaps open an independent retirement account. Ms. Sherman also explained that many people in the entertainment field built retirement benefit credits through organizations that they worked for, but that these benefits were not always well advertised to contractors.Ms. Craven said that she was fairly certain she had not accrued retirement credits through her performances, but was interested in finding an adviser and considering a formal retirement account. \u201cIt does seem disheartening that the savings account that I have just sits there and doesn\u2019t grow hardly at all, maybe a cent every month or so,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d love to put some of that away and not touch it.\u201dAlthough he has worked at his current company, Redwood Logistics, for more than three years, Mr. Ruger has been hesitant to invest in its 401(k). \u201cIt\u2019s such a millennial thing, but I don\u2019t want to have to commit to a job,\u201d he said.His career goal is to wind up on Broadway. And while he does some singing gigs on the side, the older he gets, the less likely he figures he is to start a full-time acting career.He doesn\u2019t have a definite vision for his retirement, either. \u201cIf I\u2019m being totally honest, I never saw myself as having that option,\u201d Mr. Ruger said.He has a few thousand dollars in a checking account, but no specific savings. He also has a lot of college debt. \u201cWe\u2019re paying off these crazy student loans with these crazy interest rates,\u201d Mr. Ruger said. \u201cStuff that requires money \u2014 like houses and cars and retirement \u2014 are not in the cards. We can just pay off the interest on our student loans and our rent, and work until we die.\u201dFurther on the topic of his company\u2019s 401(k), Mr. Ruger said he was unsure how the plan worked and worried about losing his investment if he ever left the job.Mr. Ruger particularly liked Mrs. Vacura\u2019s suggestion of investing the money he earned from singing, and said that if he had to choose between a 401(k) and an I.R.A., \u201cI\u2019d go with getting my act together and opening a retirement account through my job, because they offer one, and it\u2019s ridiculous that I haven\u2019t done that yet.\u201dAs a state employee, Ms. King is eligible to invest in the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, and she anticipates staying with her employer for the duration. \u201cI hope to retire at some point \u2014 my expectation is, after 30 years of service,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I am working for a public institution, 30 years is pretty much the standard.\u201dShe has been in her current role for only three years, but was able to start contributing to Opers (the acronym for the Ohio retirement system) as a student employee and already has $15,000 in her account. Though she has no other formal savings, Ms. King owns a house and contributes 10 percent of her $39,200-a-year salary to the account, with the university contributing an additional 14 percent. Ms. King is paying off student loans but expects to be debt-free by the end of the winter, at which point she will be able to diversify her savings plan and increase her contributions by as much as 25 or 50 percent.Ms. King said the rainy day fund was her next priority after paying off her student loans. And she was happy her efforts had won good reviews. \u201cIt\u2019s validating to hear that people who know about finance are saying I\u2019m on the right track,\u201d she said.Ms. Hamilton has been planning for her retirement since she was 17. \u201cI took a class in high school, and they showed me the building of compounding interest,\u201d she said.That prompted her to get a weekend job and put her earnings into an I.R.A., which has grown to about $30,000. She also has a separate 401(k) through her employer, with a similar amount invested. \u201cI want to work really hard now and save really hard so I can travel the world and not have to worry about finances\u201d in retirement, Ms. Hamilton said.Her husband is a strong partner in her savings plan. When they married last year, they agreed to live on a single income and put the rest into savings: They already have more than $100,000.Ms. Hamilton is very reluctant to touch her primary income for anything beyond basic necessities. When the time came to buy new furniture, she got a weekend job at Restoration Hardware to cover the expense.Ms. Hamilton said that her personal financial adviser gave similar feedback and that she was encouraged to be receiving such consistent advice about reaching her goals. \u201cI may not make a million dollars a year, but I feel like I can one day hopefully have a retirement that\u2019s comparable,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War May Have Already Begun", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 America\u2019s traditional allies are on the lookout for new friends.Some allies are shifting focus to other potential partners for new sources of trade and investment, relationships that could influence political, diplomatic and military ties. Many are looking to China, which has adroitly capitalized on a leadership vacuum in world affairs by offering itself \u2014 ironies notwithstanding \u2014 as a champion for global engagement.\u201cWe\u2019ve always said that America is our best friend,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup \u2014 comprising finance ministers from countries sharing the euro currency \u2014 said in an interview with The New York Times on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this month. \u201cIf that\u2019s no longer the case, if that\u2019s what we need to understand from Donald Trump, then of course Europe will look for new friends.\u201d\u201cChina is a very strong candidate for that,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Chinese involvement in Europe in terms of investment is already very high and expanding. If you push away your friends, you mustn\u2019t be surprised if the friends start looking for new friends.\u201dOn Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany spoke by telephone with Premier Li Keqiang of China. \u201cThe two spoke in favor of free trade and a stable world trade order,\u201d a German government spokesman later said in a written statement.The swift reassessment of trade relations \u2014 a realm in which Mr. Trump is directly threatening the order that has prevailed since the end of World War II \u2014 only amplifies the potential for a shake-up of the broader geopolitical framework.Through the fractious campaign, weary sophisticates dismissed the extreme talk from the Trump camp as political bluster. Even if he won, he would never follow through on his threats, particularly in trade where his business sensibilities would prevail.But that conventional wisdom looks to be crumbling. First, Mr. Trump delivered on a promise to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China\u2019s growing influence.\u201cI\u2019m incredibly concerned that the Trump people mean what they say,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cOne would hope that they are using this as a negotiating tactic. But even if you are, that\u2019s an extraordinarily dangerous game to play, because, right now, the communication to the world is not flowing clearly.\u201dThe communication on Thursday came through Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who during the administration of George W. Bush, promoted the job-creating magic of free trade as a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative.Pressed to explain how Mr. Trump would force Mexico to pay for the wall, Mr. Spicer said an import tax would do the trick. He soon clarified the tax was merely one option on a crowded buffet table.At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trump reported having had \u201ca very good call\u201d with the Mexican president. But he did not sound conciliatory. Mexico \u201chas outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201dWithin the business world, the prospect of substantial tariffs seems so damaging that many assume it will never happen.Three decades ago, Alan Russell, a former commercial airline pilot, set up the Tecma Group of Companies, which runs factory operations for multinationals in Mexico. Today, the company employs some 7,000 Mexican laborers, most of them in factories clustered around Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. They make components for the automotive, electronics, aerospace and medical device industries.Mr. Trump\u2019s words have provoked fear among the members of Mr. Russell\u2019s work force. \u201cThey hear the administration is going to shut down Nafta and deport everyone, and it scares them,\u201d he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement.But in the end, he said, business will carry on.\u201cIn 31 years, I\u2019ve been through rapid inflation, devaluations, three major recessions, the violence period and multiple presidential administrations, and every year trade has increased,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through worse. Trade is like life itself. It will figure a way.\u201dMost experts have similarly assumed the responsibilities of governance would temper Mr. Trump\u2019s trade posture. Given that nearly one-third of all American trade is conducted with China and Mexico, a rupture risks severe economic damage.\u201cThe idea of trade wars these days, what politicians have in mind is really a 19th-century or early 20th-century conception of trade,\u201d said Gianmarco I.P. Ottaviano, a trade economist at the London School of Economics. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know who you\u2019re going to hurt with these kind of things. You\u2019re probably going to destroy American jobs in the end.\u201dBeyond the economic effects, Mr. Trump\u2019s refashioning of trade has already altered global alignments.On Friday, as Mr. Trump hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May, he only increased the sense that he disdains Europe.\u201cBrexit\u2019s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,\u201d he told Ms. May at a news conference, before recounting his frustrations with the union\u2019s bureaucracy. \u201cGetting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough.\u201dWith both countries pursuing nationalist aspirations and multilateral institutions seemingly endangered, the world suddenly seems short of responsible supervision.China does not have free elections. China jails labor organizers, while lavishing credit on state-owned enterprises. All of this makes Mr. Xi an ironic choice as an icon for free trade. Yet Mr. Xi\u2019s speech was so successful that it won the embrace of business people and world leaders alike.At a lunch in Davos two days after Mr. Xi\u2019s address, a Berlin-based private equity fund manager, Andr\u00e9 Loesekrug-Pietri, stood in a dining room full of more than 100 people and predicted the dawning of a new era.\u201cWe heard a Chinese president becoming the leader of the free world,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Port Authority 10-Year Plan, $3.5 Billion Is Seen as Pittance", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byThree Democratic state legislators from New Jersey argued that the commissioners were shortchanging commuters from their state by including only $3.5 billion for a new bus terminal in Manhattan in their long-term capital plan. The bus terminal is expected to cost much more than that, possibly twice as much.But Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York wanted more of the budget for big projects to go toward improving the airports in New York City, so the commissioners were pressed to accept what one of them, Kenneth Lipper, called a \u201cgrand compromise.\u201dThat arrangement resulted in an allocation of about $1 billion for a plan to revamp Kennedy International Airport that Mr. Cuomo unveiled a day earlier. It also included about $1.5 billion for a train link between La Guardia Airport and the city\u2019s subway system that Mr. Lipper, who represents New York, said was \u201cill-conceived.\u201dDividing up the funds of the Port Authority, which collects tolls at bridges and tunnels and fees and rents at the metropolitan area\u2019s three major airports, has long been a perquisite of the governors of the two states. But the horse-trading has received intense scrutiny in recent months as demands on the agency\u2019s cash flow have grown.The agency\u2019s chairman, John J. Degnan, said there were no plans for toll increases above the rate of inflation over the next 10 years. That decision left the commissioners wrestling over which big projects to finance and to what extent.\u201cThe constraint is financial,\u201d said Hamilton E. James, a commissioner appointed in 2015 by Mr. Cuomo. \u201cSomething has to give. That\u2019s just reality.\u201dThe choices also included new train tunnels under the Hudson, an extension of the PATH train to Newark Liberty International Airport, an overhaul of Terminal A at Newark Liberty and the replacement of Terminals C and D at La Guardia.The commissioners agreed to include all of those projects, but not to the tune that the New Jersey lawmakers wanted to hear. The lawmakers said they feared that budgeting only a portion of the estimated cost of a replacement for the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Eighth Avenue would reduce its chances of timely completion.\u201cThe 115,000 commuters who go through that bus terminal twice a day should not have to wait 12 to 15 years for a new terminal to be built,\u201d said Loretta Weinberg, a Democratic state senator from Bergen County. Bob Gordon, a Democrat who is the chairman the State Senate Legislative Oversight Committee, said his committee would hold a hearing on the capital plan in Trenton on Jan. 17. He said the committee had invited several Port Authority executives to testify, including Steven Plate, the chief of major capital projects.That hearing will come before the Port Authority holds two public hearings on the capital plan \u2014 on Jan. 31 in Lower Manhattan and Feb. 7 in Jersey City \u2014 and before its board takes a final vote on it on Feb. 16.For now, the plan includes two train lines that Mr. Lipper tried to toss out. He suggested amending the plan to eliminate the AirTrain link to La Guardia and the PATH extension to Newark Liberty until their value could be tested, saying they were \u201camongst the most ill-conceived projects\u201d he had seen.\u201cI was asked to vote for this because it\u2019s part of a grand compromise,\u201d Mr. Lipper said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that good government means that I\u2019ll let you waste $2 billion if you let me waste $2 billion.None of the other commissioners supported Mr. Lipper\u2019s suggestion.After the board met at the agency\u2019s headquarters, Mr. Cuomo issued a statement praising the balance between spending in the two states. \u201cFrom the beginning, our position has been that financial parity is essential, and today, that goal has been realized,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.But the New Jersey lawmakers said the board\u2019s duty was to decide how best to serve the region\u2019s transportation needs, not how to appease both Mr. Cuomo and Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican.\u201cIt\u2019s become very parochial,\u201d said John Wisniewski, a Democratic assemblyman from Sayreville. \u201cIt\u2019s become a badge of honor for each governor to say, \u2018Look what I got the Port Authority to do for us.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s New Foreign Minister Was Advocate of Visit by Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byThe appointment was a remarkable political resurrection for the man, Luis Videgaray, a longtime confidant of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s. He replaces Claudia Ruiz Massieu, who had been the foreign minister since 2015 and reportedly opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s August visit.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, in announcing the change during a news conference in Mexico City, said he had ordered Mr. Videgaray, who stepped down as Mexico\u2019s finance minister in September after Mr. Trump\u2019s trip, \u201cto accelerate dialogue and contacts so that from Day 1 of the new administration, the basis of a constructive working relationship can be established.\u201dIn the two months since the presidential election, Ms. Ruiz Massieu has shuttled between Mexico City and the United States, meeting with American government officials to emphasize the importance of the trade agreement, and she prepared her diplomatic corps in the United States to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration threats.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who was flanked at the news conference by both Mr. Videgaray and Ms. Ruiz Massieu, highlighted Mr. Videgaray\u2019s experience in the realm of finance and economics, particularly his work in relation to the G-20 nations, as \u201cfoundations of this new mission.\u201dRaul Benitez Manaut, a professor of international relations at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, called the cabinet shuffle \u201ca completely pragmatic decision given the new political circumstances in the United States.\u201d\u201cIt is clear the dialogue has shifted from security issues to commerce, which is new since this used to be a conflict-free issue in the past,\u201d he continued.Until the fallout from the Trump visit, Mr. Videgaray, who is a former investment banker and holds a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had been a power player in the administration of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto and was considered a possible contender for the 2018 presidential election. He also coordinated Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. As finance minister, he was instrumental in Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s efforts to open the nation\u2019s oil industry, a state-run monopoly since the 1930s, and overhaul the telecommunications and energy industries. Critically, Mr. Videgaray also sided with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto in championing the idea of the Trump visit.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto staunchly defended the visit, saying he had sent invitations to both of the leading presidential candidates to come to discuss bilateral issues. Mr. Trump cast his trip as an effort to reach out to a country he had alienated during his campaign.But hours after leaving Mexico, Mr. Trump delivered a combative speech in Phoenix that struck many of the anti-immigrant themes that defined his candidacy. The episode was widely criticized by the Mexican public and many politicians, and it embarrassed Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who watched his already abysmal approval ratings sink even lower after the visit. On Sept. 7, after a week of blistering criticism, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto announced the resignation of Mr. Videgaray. Though he did not give a reason for the departure, it was widely viewed as an effort by the president to try to put the Trump visit in the past.Yet in the light of the American presidential election results, the decision to invite Mr. Trump suddenly looked a little different, and rumors almost immediately started circulating among politicians and political observers that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto might bushwhack a path back to his cabinet for his friend Mr. Videgaray.There was no immediate comment from the Trump transition team about the appointment, but a day after Mr. Videgaray\u2019s resignation in September, the candidate said on Twitter: \u201cMexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Avoids Answering Whether He Will Lift Sanctions on Russia", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byFirst 100 Days Briefing\u25a0 President Trump would not say whether he favors lifting sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and meddling in the election, as his British counterpart rejected such a move.\u25a0 Battle lines are forming within the Republican Party ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call Saturday with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin.\u25a0 The commander in chief said his defense secretary will \u201coverride\u201d his views in favor of torture.President Trump said on Friday that it was \u201cvery early\u201d to be talking about lifting sanctions on Russia, deflecting a question about whether he would raise the issue with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin on Saturday morning even as his British counterpart flatly rejected such a move.Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Theresa May, the British prime minister, Mr. Trump did not say whether he supports keeping sanctions that were put in place following Russia\u2019s military involvement in Ukraine and its interference in the 2016 election. But he said he hoped to have a good relationship with Mr. Putin.\u201cIf we could have a great relationship with Russia and with China and with all countries, I\u2019m all for that,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a brief answer to the question.Ms. May was more direct in her answer to the question about sanctions on Russia. She said the United Kingdom \u201cbelieves that the sanctions should continue.\u201dThe answers highlight what could be one of the differences between the two leaders, even as both of them insisted Friday that they plan to continue the close working relationship that has long existed between the two nations.President Trump\u2019s phone call scheduled on Saturday with Russia\u2019s president \u2014 their first conversation since Mr. Trump took office \u2014 has Republicans on edge. As one of his last acts as president, Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering in the election to help install Mr. Trump in the Oval Office.Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned Mr. Trump on Friday against lifting the sanctions.\u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s call with Vladimir Putin is scheduled to take place amid widespread speculation that the White House is considering lifting sanctions against Russia. For the sake of America\u2019s national security and that of our allies, I hope President Trump will put an end to this speculation and reject such a reckless course. If he does not, I will work with my colleagues to codify sanctions against Russia into law.\u201dWhat came next was a list of Russian abuses: its invasion of Ukraine, its annexation of Crimea and its support of \u201cthe murderous Assad regime as it has waged war on the Syrian people and killed more than 400,000 civilians.\u201dThen came this: \u201cAnd in the most flagrant demonstration of Putin\u2019s disdain and disrespect for our nation, Russia deliberately interfered in our recent election with cyberattacks and a disinformation campaign designed to weaken America and discredit Western values.\u201dUPDATE: Another Republican senator, Rob Portman of Ohio, joins in:\u201cI am deeply concerned about reports suggesting that sanctions imposed on Russia may be lifted without resolving the unacceptable and hostile actions that caused the sanctions to be imposed by the U.S. and our allies. I would encourage the president to reject this course of action. To lift the sanctions on Russia for any reason other than a change in the behavior that led to those sanctions in the first place would send a dangerous message to a world already questioning the value of American leadership and the credibility of our commitments after eight years of Obama administration policies.\u201dPresident Trump said Friday that he will let his secretary of defense \u201coverride\u201d him by banning torture even though he believes the tactics do work in getting information out of terror suspects.In a remarkable show of deference to his own subordinate, Mr. Trump noted that Jim Mattis, the Pentagon chief, does not believe torture is effective. The president, who serves as the commander in chief and usually makes the final call on military action, said he will let Mr. Mattis decide.\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree, but I will tell you that he will override because I\u2019m giving him that power,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m going to rely on him. I happen to feel that it does work.\u201dMr. Trump appeared to be struggling about the issue even as he spoke, returning several times to his own belief in torture\u2019s effectiveness even as he stated several times that he would let Mr. Mattis would decide.\u201cBut I\u2019m going with our leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to win, with or without.\u201dThen he added: \u201cBut I do disagree.\u201dPresident Trump spoke by phone on Friday with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the president of Mexico, White House officials said, less than 24 hours after the Mexican president canceled a White House meeting over anger about Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions to build a border wall.A senior White House official confirmed Friday that the call had taken place and said that an official description of what the two leaders said will be released soon.In the wake of the deepening diplomatic tensions on Thurdsday, aides to Mr. Trump had said they still intended to keep lines of communications between the two governments open. The call suggests that the two leaders may be attempting to reschedule the planned meeting.That could begin to repair the relationship in the short term, though differences will likely remain about construction of the border wall and who will finance it.Then again, Mr. Trump tweeted another salvo on Friday morning.Mr. Mattis on Friday ordered the review of the controversial F-35 fighter jet program, which has been criticized by President Trump for its cost overruns.Mr. Mattis also ordered that plans for a new Air Force One \u2014 which has also come under fire from Mr. Trump \u2014should be reviewed, \u201cwith the specific objective of identifying means to substantially reduce the programs costs while delivering needed capabilities.\u201dThe F-35 review, Mr. Mattis said in a memo, will also look at how to reduce costs while still meeting requirements set out for the fighter jet program.During his confirmation hearings earlier this month, Mr. Mattis defended tweets from Mr. Trump criticizing the F-35 program. Mr. Mattis said at the time that Mr. Trump had \u201cin no way shown a lack of support for the program. He just wants more bang for the buck.\u201dThe cost of building the next-generation fighter jet, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, has been an issue at the Pentagon for several years. At an estimated $400 billion over 15 years for 2,443 planes, the fighter jet is the military largest weapons project.Mr. Trump is just not going to give up his claim that 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants voted for Hillary Clinton, but he\u2019s grasping for evidence.The president seemed to be responding to an interview with Mr. Phillips on CNN Friday morning that was, shall we say, inconclusive. Mr. Phillips at once said 3 million illegal immigrants voted and said he is still working to prove that.\u201cYou can reach a conclusion and still verify it,\u201d he maintained.Mr. Phillips has been adamant on Twitter of course.And that is not all Mr. Phillips has asserted.He now has an endorsement from the president of the United States.Mr. Trump\u2019s fallacious argument that he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million because of illegal immigrant ballots started as the stuff of wonderment and ridicule.Now that the Trump administration has shifted to an investigation of the voter rolls, things have gotten serious.Democrats appear to be girding for battle, but if, as is likely, Senator Jeff Sessions, a conservative from Alabama, becomes the attorney general, it does not appear to be a fight that the minority can win. The Democrats fear the hunt for illegal voters will become a pretext to tighten voting requirements nationwide and bar many minority voters who tend to side with the Democrats.Even moderate Democrats are alarmed.\u201cInstead of the president himself, a squadron of senior administration officials and Trump family will attend, including Vice President Mike Pence, Ivanka Trump and her husband and senior adviser Jared Kushner, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway.\u201dLest we get too excited \u2014 could the White House Correspondents Association dinner be next? Please? \u2014 we should wait and see. It is true that every president since Mr. Reagan has attended the annual roast and silly cabaret dinner of the Alfalfa Club, a century-old, invitation-only Washington clique that seems like it was hatched from a bygone era. But not many of those presidents have attended each year.Mr. Trump may yet keep the soiree alive.Mr. Trump traveled to the City of Brotherly Love on Thursday to decry Philadelphia\u2019s rising murder rate \u2014 \u201cI mean, just terribly increasing.\u201dBut it isn\u2019t.Last year\u2019s 277 homicides was down from 280 in 2015. That is up from 2014, when 248 were murdered, and in 2013, when 246 were killed. But recent years are markedly down from 2007 to 2012 when Philadelphia had more than 300 killings, 391 in 2007 alone.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s false statements today were an insult to the men and women of the Philadelphia police force \u2014 the very same men and women who are working long hours today to ensure his safety,\u201d Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement Thursday.Of course, in the era of alternative facts, Mayor Kenney may be spitting in the wind.\u201cThis is sabotage, pure and simple,\u201d fumed Leslie Dach, a senior official in President Barack Obama\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services who now heads a coalition to save the law. \u201cThis proves that this administration doesn\u2019t care about people who need health coverage. And it clearly shows that they now own the consequences of their efforts to undermine the health care system.\u201dThe ads were to have run only for a few more days, until the annual open enrollment period ends on Tuesday. In the last few years, large numbers of consumers signed up just before the deadline.But Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress are determined to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement.Since Nov. 1, more than 11.5 million people have signed up for insurance or had their coverage automatically renewed. And when the enrollment period ends, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who will announce the total number of people who would lose their insurance if the law is repealed.The leading candidate to be the Pentagon\u2019s new spokesman is John Ullyot, a former Marine Corps intelligence officer and veteran of Capitol Hill.Mr. Ullyot served as spokesman and deputy chief of staff for two Republican senators, John W. Warner of Virginia and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, and as spokesman for the Senate Armed Services Committee from 2003 to 2007.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Port Authority Will Pay $400,000 to Settle Federal Securities Charges", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey violated federal securities laws when it borrowed money to repair a bridge and roads in New Jersey that its lawyers thought were beyond its bounds, securities regulators said on Tuesday.The agency, which operates bridges, tunnels and airports in and around New York City, agreed to pay a $400,000 fine in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The commission, which polices sales of stocks and bonds, said the Port Authority had admitted to wrongdoing in the matter, making it the first issuer of municipal bonds to do so.But John J. Degnan, the chairman of the Port Authority, said the agency had not admitted to willful wrongdoing, only to negligence in its failure to disclose all of the risks faced by buyers of its bonds. \u201cI was shocked when I saw the release,\u201d Mr. Degnan said, referring to the commission\u2019s announcement of the settlement.A lawyer representing the Port Authority, James Sottile, sent a letter to the commission demanding a retraction of its news release.Mr. Degnan also questioned the timing of the announcement, which came just as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was delivering his State of the State address in Trenton. For Mr. Christie, it was another case of intrigue involving a bridge that could tarnish his legacy.A spokesman for the governor referred a request for comment to the Port Authority.But Port Authority lawyers were leery of that proposed shift, saying the alternative projects did not fall within the agency\u2019s purview. An internal Port Authority memo at the time said, \u201cThere is no clear path to legislative authority to undertake such projects.\u201dOne big problem was that the projects involved roadways that carry vehicles to and from the Holland Tunnel, which connects New Jersey to Lower Manhattan. The Port Authority operates the tunnel, but according to one of its internal memos, there was no law that allowed it to \u201cconstruct, own, maintain or operate any of the approaches to the Holland Tunnel.\u201dHowever, it was permitted to work on roads leading to the Lincoln Tunnel, which connects New Jersey to Midtown Manhattan and which the agency also operates.So, before the Port Authority\u2019s commissioners voted in March 2011 to authorize the road projects, the agency adopted the view that the roads in question also led to the Lincoln Tunnel. An internal memo proposed a \u201ctraffic study\u201d to bolster that position.That was more than two years before allies of Mr. Christie at the Port Authority told tales of another traffic study. That study was the purported reason for the September 2013 closing of lanes of traffic that led to tollbooths at the George Washington Bridge.Neither the commissioners of the Port Authority nor investors were ever informed of the internal debate over the legality of using Port Authority money for the road projects, the securities commission said. From 2012 to 2014, the Port Authority raised $116 million through bond sales whose proceeds were intended for the road projects, the commission added.\u201cThe Port Authority represented to investors that it was authorized to issue bonds while not disclosing significant known risks that its actions were not legally permitted,\u201d said Andrew M. Calamari, director of the commission\u2019s New York office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quicken Loans, the New Mortgage Machine", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported by8 PhotosDETROIT \u2014 A low buzz fills the air as an army of mortgage bankers, perched below floating canopies in a kaleidoscope of vivid pinks, blues, purples and greens, works the phones, promising borrowers easy financing and low rates for home loans.By the elevators, nobody blinks when an employee wearing a pink tutu bustles past. On any given day, a company mascot, Simon, a bespectacled mouse, goes on the hunt for \u201cgouda,\u201d or good ideas, from the work force.A visit to the headquarters of Quicken Loans in downtown Detroit may seem like a trip to a place where \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d meets Seussville. But the whimsical, irreverent atmosphere sits atop a fast-growing business in a field \u2014 the selling of the American dream \u2014 that has changed drastically since an earlier generation of mortgage lenders propelled the economy to near collapse in 2008 by issuing risky and even fraudulent loans.In the years since the crisis, many of the nation\u2019s largest banks pulled back their mortgage-lending activities. Quicken Loans pushed in. Today, it is the second-largest retail mortgage lender, originating $96 billion in mortgages last year \u2014 an eightfold increase from 2008.Privately held Quicken, like some of America\u2019s largest banks before it, has also landed in regulators\u2019 cross hairs. In a federal false-claims lawsuit filed in 2015, the Department of Justice charged that, among other things, the company misrepresented borrowers\u2019 income or credit scores, or inflated appraisals, in order to qualify for Federal Housing Administration insurance. As a result, when those loans soured, the government says that taxpayers \u2014 not Quicken loans \u2014 suffered millions of dollars in losses.Quicken Loans today is the F.H.A. insurance program\u2019s largest participant.Executives at Quicken Loans deny the charges, maintaining, among other things, that the government \u201ccherry-picked\u201d a small number of examples to build its case. In an aggressive move, the company pre-emptively sued the Department of Justice, demanding a blanket ruling that all of the loans it had originated met requirements and \u201cpose no undue risks to the F.H.A. insurance fund.\u201dMr. Gilbert, who founded the company in 1985, sold it to the business software company Intuit in 1999, before buying it back with other investors in 2002.He is working to rectify the city\u2019s downtrodden image with streetcars, upscale cafes and boutiques, and fiber-optic data, making him a hometown hero. Late last year, Quicken Loans won a motion to move the Department of Justice case to a federal courthouse roughly three blocks from its Detroit headquarters.Sitting on the edge of a chair in his office, the Motor City\u2019s skyline a steel gray in the late-afternoon November sun, Mr. Gilbert said that his company has been unfairly targeted. \u201cYou want to know what this case is about?\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody probably put up a whiteboard and said, \u2018Here are the 10 largest F.H.A. lenders, now go and collect settlements from them, regardless of whether they did anything wrong.\u2019\u201dIn court documents, Quicken argues it has the lowest default rates in the F.H.A. program. It projects the government will reap $5.7 billion in net profits from the insurance premiums for loans made from 2007 to 2013, after paying out any claims.A spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is home to the F.H.A. program at the center of the case against Quicken, declined to speak about the lawsuit.Late last year, Donald J. Trump named a former Quicken Loans lobbyist, Shawn Krause, to his H.U.D. transition team. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to an email asking about potential conflicts of interest. In an emailed statement, Quicken Loans said the fact that Ms. Krause had come from the largest F.H.A. lender in the country \u201cbodes well for the positive impact she has, and will, make on H.U.D.\u201dIn the years since the financial crisis, Quicken has emerged as a leader in the nation\u2019s shadow-banking system, a network of nonbank financial institutions that has gained significant ground against its more heavily regulated bank counterparts in providing home loans to Americans. Increased regulation and decreased profits sent the nation\u2019s banks packing.Nonbanks, like Quicken, have filled that gap. Today, Quicken is the nation\u2019s second-largest retail residential mortgage lender, behind Wells Fargo, but ahead of banking giants like J. P. Morgan, Bank of America and Citigroup, according to Mortgage Daily.Mr. James is again playing for the Cavaliers. A call to his agent seeking comment was not returned.The year before, Mr. Gilbert got into an altercation at a bar mitzvah, punching a former colleague, David Hall, in the head before he was escorted out by security, according to interviews conducted by the Birmingham Police Department in Michigan. In police documents, Mr. Gilbert\u2019s lawyer said Mr. Hall filed the complaint in order to pressure Mr. Gilbert into paying $2 million to buy out Mr. Hall\u2019s investments in Mr. Gilbert\u2019s companies. The Birmingham city attorney ultimately denied a warrant in the case on the grounds that the charges were not \u201csupported by probable cause.\u201dMr. Hall did not return an email seeking comment. In an email statement, a Quicken Loans spokesman said Mr. Gilbert \u201cdefended himself in a minor confrontation that was instigated by a former employee who was the aggressor.\u201dOn a more trifling scale, after sending text messages about this article to a reporter at The New York Times but not receiving a response \u2014 Mr. Gilbert was texting her landline number by accident \u2014 he followed up with an email accusing the reporter of disconnecting her mobile phone to avoid him. The phone \u201clikely is one of your temporary numbers that you deploy for the surreptitious work that you do,\u201d he wrote.When alerted to the misunderstanding, Mr. Gilbert apologized \u201cfor any of it that was caused on my end.\u201dWhen Mr. Gilbert was asked in an email if he \u201coften strikes a \u2018combative stance\u2019 or \u2018frequently attacks his critics,\u2019\u201d a Quicken Loans spokesman responded in an email, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that when someone with as long and successful career as Mr. Gilbert is forced to defend his integrity and honor from old and/or insignificant already rehashed incidents and accusations from a media source as credible as The NY Times, you would imply that doing such is \u2018frequently attacking\u2019 his critics.\u201dThese days, Mr. Gilbert appears to be itching for a fight with the Justice Department. In court filings, Quicken argued that the three-year government investigation was based on 55 \u201ccherry-picked\u201d loans out of nearly 250,000.Quicken also argued that a longstanding F.H.A. process to resolve loans that did not meet its requirements, through either the repurchase of the loan or by indemnifying F.H.A. from any losses, was retroactively discontinued for Quicken.Since 2011, Mr. Gilbert has spent more than $2.2 billion on downtown Detroit, buying up 95 decrepit properties and rehabilitating them in an effort to lure new tenants. Nike opened a store there last year. The New York burger chain Shake Shack is coming in 2017, as is the sports retailer Under Armour. Mr. Gilbert also notes that he has leased space downtown to several local minority-owned start-up businesses.That sort of presence makes downtown Detroit today seem a bit like a company town, a sort of Quickenville. That\u2019s because Quicken Loans is just one of more than 100 closely knit companies that is owned or controlled by Mr. Gilbert with a footprint in the area. Through his commercial real estate properties, Mr. Gilbert can decide which tenants fit into his vision for downtown Detroit, and which don\u2019t.Lines of bicycles in downtown Detroit are available free for all employees of Mr. Gilbert\u2019s companies. And visitors can bet at the tables at Jack Detroit Casino-Hotel Greektown, a gambling venture controlled by Mr. Gilbert.The Quicken Loans family also includes one of the largest title companies in the United States, an appraisal firm, a call center and In-House Realty, which says on its website that it is the \u201cpreferred real estate partner\u201d of Quicken Loans.With Quicken Loans, Mr. Gilbert has built a game-changing company in the once-staid mortgage-lending industry.Former executives describe Quicken Loans as a technology company that sells mortgages. But the heart that keeps Quicken\u2019s blood moving is the 3,500 mortgage bankers who work its phones. Many new employees come in with little to no background in financial services. One employee joined after delivering pizzas to the Quicken Loans office and becoming interested in working there.Entry-level employees typically make hundreds of calls a day, trying to get potential customers on the phone. Not unlike the assembly lines that put together cars in Detroit, the call is immediately handed off to a licensed mortgage banker, who completes the loan application, then quickly passes it to processing so that he or she can focus on the next loan application.Mr. Gilbert said clients are able to close more quickly on loans when specialists focus on each stage of the loan process. He and other Quicken executives note that the company has repeatedly made Fortune magazine\u2019s list of Best Places to Work For and has earned top marks in J. D. Power client satisfaction surveys.Quicken defines its culture and philosophy through a number of so-called \u201cisms,\u201d created and curated over the years by Mr. Gilbert: \u201cYes before no.\u201d \u201cA penny saved is a penny.\u201d \u201cWe eat our own dog food.\u201dAt the same time, several former employees and executives in interviews described a demanding work environment, with staff members expected to work long hours and weekends to hit targets. In recent years, Quicken and its affiliated companies have faced at least four lawsuits filed by former mortgage bankers seeking overtime.Quicken won one of the overtime cases, but court documents indicate others were directed into settlement negotiations. An email to the various plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers was not returned.And in early 2016, a National Labor Relations Board judge ruled that Quicken and five of its related companies issued an employee handbook with rules that violated workers\u2019 right to engage in various activities, including union-related ones. Quicken has appealed the ruling, calling the policies \u201ccommon, rational and sensible.\u201dWhen asked about criticisms of the work environment, Mr. Gilbert and other executives defended the company, noting that mortgage bankers work an average of 44 hours per week and are compensated well. It is possible for team members, Mr. Gilbert said, to earn over $85,000 in their second year, more than double the median household income for Wayne County, Mich.Quicken Loans\u2019 growing role in parts of the mortgage market may make it a lightning rod for critics.Proponents say that nonbanks like Quicken or PennyMac in California \u2014 which was started by former executives of Countrywide, the mortgage machine in Southern California that was a hotbed of toxic mortgages in the 2008 crisis \u2014 are filling an important void. They argue that they serve people with low to moderate incomes or lower credit scores whom the big banks shun. The big banks, they say, focus instead on so-called jumbo mortgages, or mortgages of more than $424,100, the maximum amount that can be backed by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\u201cThe large banks want to go after the higher-end business,\u201d said Guy D. Cecala, the chief executive and publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.Thanks to low interest rates, home sales are booming and the mortgage market was expected to top $2 trillion in originations in 2016. That\u2019s a far cry from the frothy height of $3.8 trillion that was hit in 2003.Moreover, many other parts of the mortgage machine that were in place leading up to the financial crisis have been dismantled.Still, critics say today\u2019s shadow banks, by focusing on the riskier end of the mortgage market, may be revving up the same parts of the engine that resulted in defaults and foreclosures in the past. Nonbanks, which are typically less capitalized and may have more difficulty reimbursing the government for bad loans, now dominate F.H.A.-insured mortgage loans, according to data from the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s International Center on Housing Risk.In September 2012, banks originated 65 percent of the purchase-mortgage loans insured by the F.H.A., according to the data. Today, that number has more than flipped: Nonbanks originate 73 percent of the loans, with banks\u2019 share dropping to 18 percent.The figures are more spectacular for refinanced mortgages, where nonbanks now make up 93 percent of loans.\u201cThe market has moved to the nonbanks because the nonbanks\u2019 appetite for risk is much higher,\u201d said Edward J. Pinto, a director of the Center on Housing Risk. He has argued that the F.H.A. is not only failing to help low-income communities with its programs, but is actually weakening them with imprudent loans.Mr. Gilbert disputed any \u201cfalse narrative\u201d that claims Quicken faces less regulatory scrutiny, is lightly capitalized or makes risky loans. He said that the average credit score of a Quicken borrower is one of the highest in the nation; that the parent company\u2019s assets \u201care larger than that of 93 percent of all F.D.I.C.-insured depositories\u201d; and that the company is regulated by 50 states, multiple municipalities and numerous federal agencies. Quicken Loans is privately held, and it is unclear what its assets are worth.In an email response to follow-up questions, Mr. Gilbert added, \u201cQuicken Loans underwriting and production is one of the highest, if not the highest, quality production in the entire country.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the growth of Quicken Loans as a retail mortgage lender misidentified Dan Gilbert\u2019s position at the company. He is the founder and chairman, not the chief executive. A capsule summary of the article repeated the error. The article also described the history of Quicken Loans incorrectly. Mr. Gilbert founded the company today known as Quicken in 1985, sold it to Intuit in 1999 and then bought it back with other investors in 2002; he and other investors did not first buy Quicken in 2002 from Intuit, nor had Intuit owned it for about a decade. \u0081Advertisement"}

From Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia to Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Turkey, illiberal governments regularly use imprisonment, threats and nationalist language to repress nongovernmental organizations. Here in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government is going after their money.The Lawyers Collective, an advocacy group in New Delhi run by the prominent lawyers Indira Jaising and Anand Grover, has for three decades provided legal assistance to women, nonunion workers, activists and other marginalized groups, often without charge. In December, the Modi government barred it from receiving foreign grants. The political reasons were obvious: The Collective had represented critics of Mr. Modi\u2019s sectarian record and environmental vision.Under Indian law, nongovernmental groups that seek foreign donations have to register under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act, which prohibits the use of overseas funds for \u201cactivities detrimental to the national interest.\u201d Although accountability in the nongovernmental sector is necessary to control malpractice, the foreign funding law is better known as a tool of political retribution than transparent auditing.It\u2019s not just the Collective that has been punished. The Home Affairs Ministry recently revoked the licenses of around 10,000 other nongovernmental organizations. Even groups whose funding licenses were renewed are worried about the future. \u201cIt is activism on thinning ice from now on,\u201d an education activist told me.The funding law is rooted in Cold War fears about foreign interference in domestic politics. In 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi raised the specter of the \u201cforeign hand,\u201d suspended civil liberties, arrested political opponents, and censored the press for an almost two-year dictatorial stretch known as the Emergency.The new law prohibited political parties, the news media and organizations \u201cof a political nature\u201d from receiving foreign contributions. Social, religious and educational organizations with foreign donors were required to obtain a permit.India has moved away from the paranoid 1970s to a liberalized economy and is embracing the United States and global financial institutions. But the foreign funding law remains a handy weapon whose vague vocabulary (\u201cpublic interest\u201d and \u201cnational interest\u201d) gives the state immense discretionary powers against critics.Mr. Modi\u2019s government has been even more openly hostile to civil society groups. It repeatedly denounces human rights and environmental activism as \u201canti-national\u201d \u2014 a phrase that carries connotations of treason. The patriotic rage is a mask for a more pedestrian motive: punishing pesky critics. In 2016, what is normally a routine license renewal process was used to punish groups that have been critical of Mr. Modi or his policies.The Lawyers Collective has been prominent among such groups. In 2015, Priya Pillai, a campaigner from Greenpeace India, was traveling to London to testify in the British Parliament about coal mining in central Indian forests by Essar Energy, a corporation registered in Britain. Federal officers pulled Ms. Pillai off her flight, arguing that her deposition would have hurt India\u2019s \u201cnational interest.\u201d Ms. Pillai went to court; the Lawyers Collective represented her.Some of these groups are seeking redress in Indian courts, which have largely been fair. But legal battles exact a cost: With bank accounts frozen for months during investigations, bills for rent, electricity and lawyers mount. People\u2019s Watch, a human rights group, was unable to pay salaries for 23 months. Many Greenpeace India employees took pay cuts in 2014. As court duels drag on, campaigns lag, research comes to a standstill and years of community mobilization dissipate.Yet neither Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party nor the Congress Party has had any qualms about accepting campaign funding from foreign businesses. In May 2014, a New Delhi court held both the B.J.P. and the Congress Party guilty of receiving donations from a London-listed company in violation of the foreign funding law.Civil society groups do try hard to raise funds within the country, but Indian philanthropists remain tightfisted when it comes to issues like land or labor rights, health care access, quality of education, or resource exploitation by corporations.\u201cOur rich guys will feed poor kids but won\u2019t question governments,\u201d a fund-raising manager in New Delhi explained.By yanking foreign funding licenses, the Indian government is doing just what it accuses civil society organizations of: working against public interest.Rohini Mohan is the author of \u201cThe Seasons of Trouble: Life Amid the Ruins of Sri Lanka\u2019s Civil War.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In New Jersey, Only a Few Media Watchdogs Are Left", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byTRENTON \u2014 When New Jersey lawmakers blocked a vote last month on a bill backed by Gov. Chris Christie that would have ended the requirement that legal notices be published in newspapers, it was a rare good news story for the state\u2019s press corps.Publishers said the bill, which would have let the notices move online, would have cost newspapers $20 million in revenue and perhaps hundreds of journalists\u2019 jobs.That was in addition to the cutbacks and layoffs that have left the industry feeling as if it were \u201crunning up a down escalator,\u201d as Tom Moran, editorial page editor of The Star-Ledger, the state\u2019s largest newspaper, put it.The Wall Street Journal, which built upon Bridgegate, a political scandal uncovered by The Record, now has one New Jersey beat reporter churning out shorter articles. And after operating bureaus in Trenton, Newark and Hackensack as recently as 10 years ago, The New York Times does not have a New Jersey beat reporter.The declining fortunes of the state\u2019s newspapers are part of a retrenchment in newspaper publishing across the country, but they have been acutely felt because of New Jersey newspapers\u2019 role in holding powerful institutions and people accountable in a state that lacks a major independent television station.The timing also could not be worse, given all the news in the past year related to Mr. Christie, terrorism, crumbling infrastructure and the sizable local presence of President-elect Donald J. Trump.\u201cIt feels like an abridged newspaper,\u201d said Anna Marie Fanelli, an interior designer and co-owner of Floor and Decor in downtown Tenafly. \u201cEverything is dying a slow death.\u201dThe Record\u2019s portfolio of weeklies has also been affected. Several, including ones in Tenafly and Cresskill, have merged into a regional paper called The Northern Valley Suburbanite. And in Montclair, there was palpable anger when a new and thinner version of The Montclair Times contained mostly news from other towns.\u201cOn the masthead it states \u2018Serving Our Community Since 1877,\u2019\u201d one commenter wrote on a Montclair community website. \u201cApparently that stopped on Nov. 17, 2016.\u201dWhen asked about the changes, Rick Green, The Record\u2019s new editor and vice president for content, said that the company would not have any comment.But Martin Gottlieb, who retired in January as the editor of The Record, before the paper was sold by the Borg family, said that financial pressures always loomed.\u201cNew Jersey is a microcosm of the whole country,\u201d Mr. Gottlieb said. \u201cWe were always coming up with ways to economize, and you couldn\u2019t expect the paper to continue to exist the way it did. It was like Wile E. Coyote running halfway across the canyon and realizing that his footing was a little suspect.\u201dGoing back to the 1990s, Mr. Lee wrote in his dissertation, \u201cthe drive to turn a profit became a higher priority for media companies and their corporate owners,\u201d leading to mergers and cost-cutting. So when the financial downturn hit in 2008, Gannett\u2019s New Jersey dailies, then numbering six, suffered through what Bob Ingle, a former senior political columnist for Gannett NJ, called a \u201cmassacre,\u201d shedding more than 400 jobs in 2008 and 2009. The Trenton bureau became a two-person operation, down from nine.Another Advance paper, The Times of Trenton, slashed its newsroom to 30 from 90 between 2007 and 2009, and closed its statehouse bureau, according to Mr. Lee.These days, most Star-Ledger reporters and editors are employed by a new corporate entity, NJ Advance Media, and work out of an office park in Woodbridge. Supervisors\u2019 titles reflect a digital orientation that management says is crucial to the company\u2019s long-term viability, with terms like producers and directors replacing ones like editors and bureau chiefs.\u201cI was a content hamster, basically,\u201d said one reporter who recently left the paper. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I was contributing anything of value, so when I had a review, I expected my producer to be harsh. But there was no critique. It was like, \u2018Your numbers are good, keep doing a great job.\u2019\u201dThen again, many reporters and editors say the transformation has forced complacent journalists to work faster, use social media and interact more with readers.Kevin Whitmer, who was The Star-Ledger\u2019s editor but is now called the vice president for content, said he understood that \u201cthe idea of growing your digital audience comes with a lot of adjustments for everyone.\u201d He also said the company was \u201cconsistently looking at our incentives and reviewing ways to make it better.\u201d\u201cOur business is about growing audience,\u201d he said. \u201cThat we can do that and still deliver the level of journalism we do is why I\u2019m quite bullish on our future.\u201dEven so, with fewer beat reporters working for major publications, topics like education, transportation and the environment are not being covered as rigorously, Mr. Lee said.Reporters may also lack institutional muscle when fighting for access to public records.\u201cWith fewer well-financed organizations, it becomes more likely that the government withholds documents and other information, knowing that it\u2019s less likely to be challenged,\u201d said Ed Barocas, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.During my stint in Trenton, as many as 30 newspaper, wire service, television and radio journalists would be working on press row. This time, I counted six: two Bloomberg reporters, three for The Record and one from New Jersey 101.5 FM.When finished, Mr. Albright typically hands his copy to a reporter down the hall. She converts it into a PDF on her phone, then emails it to his editors.An article on Wednesday about the political ramifications of drastic changes to the newspaper industry in New Jersey referred incorrectly to the journalist Bob Ingle. At the time he retired in 2015, he was a senior political columnist for Gannett NJ, not a columnist for The Asbury Park Press. (Mr. Ingle\u2019s column appeared in the Asbury paper, which is owned by Gannett.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Thiel, Trump\u2019s Tech Pal, Explains Himself", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byWith ... Peter ThielLet others tremble at the thought that Donald J. Trump may go too far. Peter Thiel worries that Mr. Trump may not go far enough.\u201cEveryone says Trump is going to change everything way too much,\u201d says the famed venture capitalist, contrarian and member of the Trump transition team. \u201cWell, maybe Trump is going to change everything way too little. That seems like the much more plausible risk to me.\u201dMr. Thiel is comfortable being a walking oxymoron: He is driven to save the world from the apocalypse. Yet he helped boost the man regarded by many as a danger to the planet.\u201cThe election had an apocalyptic feel to it,\u201d says Mr. Thiel, wearing a gray Zegna suit and sipping white wine in a red leather booth at the Monkey Bar in Manhattan. \u201cThere was a way in which Trump was funny, so you could be apocalyptic and funny at the same time. It\u2019s a strange combination, but it\u2019s somehow very powerful psychologically.\u201d\u201cI was thinking, \u2018I hope this doesn\u2019t look too weird on TV,\u2019\u201d he says.I ask if he had to twist arms to lure some of the anti-Trump tech titans, like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.\u201cI think, early on, everybody was worried that they would be the only person to show up,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cAt the end, everybody was worried they would be the only person not to show up. I think the bigger tech companies all wanted to get a little bit off the ledge that they had gotten on.\u201cNormally, if you\u2019re a C.E.O. of a big company, you tend to be somewhat apolitical or politically pretty bland. But this year, it was this competition for who could be more anti-Trump. \u2018If Trump wins, I will eat my sock.\u2019 \u2018I will eat my shoe.\u2019 \u2018I will eat my shoe, and then I will walk barefoot to Mexico to emigrate and leave the country.\u2019\u201cSomehow, I think Silicon Valley got even more spun up than Manhattan. There were hedge fund people I spoke to about a week after the election. They hadn\u2019t supported Trump. But all of a sudden, they sort of changed their minds. The stock market went up, and they were like, \u2018Yes, actually, I don\u2019t understand why I was against him all year long.\u2019\u201dTalking about how the Billy Bush tape was not so shocking if you\u2019ve worked on the Wall Street trading floor, Mr. Thiel says: \u201cOn the one hand, the tape was clearly offensive and inappropriate. At the same time, I worry there\u2019s a part of Silicon Valley that is hyper-politically correct about sex. One of my friends has a theory that the rest of the country tolerates Silicon Valley because people there just don\u2019t have that much sex. They\u2019re not having that much fun.\u201dI note that several Silicon Valley companies have pre-emptively said they will not help build a Muslim registry for the Trump administration. Will Palantir, the data-mining company of which Mr. Thiel was a founder, and whose clients include the N.S.A., the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., be involved in that? (Palantir\u2019s C.E.O., Alex Karp, sat in at the Trump tech meeting.)\u201cWe would not do that,\u201d Mr. Thiel says flatly.When I ask him if he can explain to Mr. Trump that climate change is not a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, he offers a Chinese box of an answer: \u201cDoes he really think that? If he really thinks that, how would you influence that? If he really thinks that and you could influence him, what would be the best way to do it?\u201dHis critics demanded to know how someone who immigrated from Frankfurt to Cleveland as a child could support a campaign so bristling with intolerance. How could a gay man back someone who will probably nominate Supreme Court justices inclined to limit rights for gays and women? How could a futurist support a cave man who champions fossil fuels, puts profits over environmental protection and insists that we can turn back the clock on the effects of globalization on American workers?\u201cThere are reduced expectations for the younger generation, and this is the first time this has happened in American history,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cEven if there are aspects of Trump that are retro and that seem to be going back to the past, I think a lot of people want to go back to a past that was futuristic \u2014 \u2018The Jetsons,\u2019 \u2018Star Trek.\u2019 They\u2019re dated but futuristic.\u201dIt is a theme he has struck before, that Silicon Valley has not fulfilled the old dreams for bigger things. \u201cCellphones distract us from the fact that the subways are 100 years old,\u201d he says.He says he isn\u2019t. Yet the billionaire views the visceral torrent against him with his usual rationality, surveying the scene deliberately, like the chess prodigy he once was. \u201cI was surprised that it generated as much controversy as it did,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a push to remove me from the board of Facebook, which is kind of crazy, since I\u2019m the longest-serving director there after Zuckerberg.\u201dHe recalls that he went through a lot of \u201cmeta\u201d debates about Mr. Trump in Silicon Valley. \u201cOne of my good friends said, \u2018Peter, do you realize how crazy this is, how everybody thinks this is crazy?\u2019 I was like: \u2018Well, why am I wrong? What\u2019s substantively wrong with this?\u2019 And it all got referred back to \u2018Everybody thinks Trump\u2019s really crazy.\u2019 So it\u2019s like there\u2019s a shortcut, which is: \u2018I don\u2019t need to explain it. It\u2019s good enough that everybody thinks something. If everybody thinks this is crazy, I don\u2019t even have to explain to you why it\u2019s crazy. You should just change your mind.\u2019\u201dOn the Russian hacking, Mr. Thiel says: \u201cThere\u2019s a strong circumstantial case that Russia did this thing. On the other hand, I was totally convinced that there were W.M.D.s in Iraq in 2002, 2003.\u201dThe reaction from the gay community has been harsh, with one writer in The Advocate going so far as to suggest that Mr. Thiel was not even a gay man, because he did not \u201cembrace the struggle.\u201d\u201cI think Trump is very good on gay rights,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will reverse anything. I would obviously be concerned if I thought otherwise.\u201dI ask if he\u2019s comfortable with the idea that Vice President-elect Mike Pence, regarded in the gay community as an unreconstructed homophobe, is a heartbeat away from the presidency.\u201cYou know, maybe I should be worried but I\u2019m not that worried about it,\u201d he replies. \u201cI don\u2019t know. People know too many gay people. There are just all these ways I think stuff has just shifted. For speaking at the Republican convention, I got attacked way more by liberal gay people than by conservative Christian people.\u201cI don\u2019t think these things will particularly change. It\u2019s like, even if you appointed a whole series of conservative Supreme Court justices, I\u2019m not sure that Roe v. Wade would get overturned, ever. I don\u2019t know if people even care about the Supreme Court. You know, you\u2019d have thought the failure to have a vote on Merrick [Garland] would be a massive issue. And somehow it mattered to Democrats, but it didn\u2019t matter to the public at large.\u201dWould he like to get married and have kids?He looks a bit startled by the question, then says: \u201cMaybe.\u201dI ask him if he worries about the bromance with Vladimir V. Putin and Mr. Trump\u2019s bizarre affinity for dictators. \u201cBut should Russia be allied with the West or with China?\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cThere are these really bad dictators in the Middle East, and we got rid of them and in many cases there\u2019s even worse chaos.\u201dSo he doesn\u2019t worry about Mr. Trump sending an intemperate tweet and spurring a war with North Korea?\u201cA Twitter war is not a real war,\u201d Mr. Thiel says.If the worst fears of annihilation seem plausible, Mr. Thiel can always invest more in his libertarian fantasy of a new society of Seasteads: islands at sea with their own rules, starting with a French Polynesian lagoon. \u201cThey\u2019re not quite feasible from an engineering perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s still very far in the future.\u201dHe does think, though, that human violence is more of a risk than a pandemic or robot army. \u201cIt\u2019s the people behind the red-eyed robots that you need to be scared of,\u201d he says.Mr. Thiel is focused on ways to prolong life. He was intrigued by parabiosis, a blood regeneration trial in which people over 35 would receive transfusions from people aged 16 to 25 \u2014 an experiment that Anne Rice gave a thumbs up to.\u201cOut of all the crazy things in this campaign, the vampire accusations were the craziest,\u201d he says, adding that while blood transfusions may be helpful, there may be harmful factors and \u201cwe have to be very careful.\u201dMr. Thiel has, however, used human growth hormones and he has signed up for cryogenics. \u201cWe have to be more experimental in all our medical procedures,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should not go gently into that good night.\u201dI ask why everyone in Silicon Valley seemed so obsessed with immortality.\u201cWhy is everyone else so indifferent about their mortality?\u201d he replies.He has invested in many biotech companies and has been advising the Trump transition team on science. \u201cScience is technology\u2019s older brother who has fallen on hard times,\u201d he says. \u201cI have some strong opinions on this. At the F.D.A. today, aging is still not an indication for disease. And you\u2019re not allowed to develop drugs that could stop aging. We have not even started yet.\u201dGiven the passion of his friend Mr. Musk for colonizing Mars, has he influenced Trump\u2019s thinking about NASA?\u201cIt\u2019s this very large agency that has kind of lost its way over the last 30 to 40 years,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cWhen we went to the moon, it took less than a decade from the time Kennedy announced it to the time we got there. Mars is harder but surely possible.\u201dHe says Mr. Trump\u2019s foes want to cast the president-elect \u201cas this uniquely evil person, Trump as Hitler; that doesn\u2019t strike me as remotely plausible.\u201dOver a four-hour dinner of duck and chocolate dessert \u2014 a surprisingly sybaritic meal for a man who admits he is prone to weird diets \u2014 Mr. Thiel shows, again and again, how he likes to \u201cflip around\u201d issues to see if conventional wisdom is wrong, a technique he calls Pyrrhonian skepticism.\u201cMaybe I do always have this background program running where I\u2019m trying to think of, \u2018O.K., what\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019re saying?\u2019 and then I\u2019ll try that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt works surprisingly often.\u201d He has even wondered if his most famous investment, Facebook, contributes to herd mentality.When I remark that President Obama had eight years without any ethical shadiness, Mr. Thiel flips it, noting: \u201cBut there\u2019s a point where no corruption can be a bad thing. It can mean that things are too boring.\u201dWhen I ask if he is concerned about conflicts of interest, either for himself or the Trump children, who sat in on the tech meeting, he flips that one, too: \u201cI don\u2019t want to dismiss ethical concerns here, but I worry that \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 gets overly weaponized in our politics. I think in many cases, when there\u2019s a conflict of interest, it\u2019s an indication that someone understands something way better than if there\u2019s no conflict of interest. If there\u2019s no conflict of interest, it\u2019s often because you\u2019re just not interested.\u201dWhen I ask if Mr. Trump is \u201ccasting\u201d cabinet members based on looks, Mr. Thiel challenges me: \u201cYou\u2019re assuming that Trump thinks they matter too much. And maybe everyone else thinks they matter too little. Do you want America\u2019s leading diplomat to look like a diplomat? Do you want the secretary of defense to look like a tough general, so maybe we don\u2019t have to go on offense and we can stay on defense? I don\u2019t know.\u201dWhen I ask about the incestuous amplification of the Facebook news feed, he muses: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody you know who knows anybody. There\u2019s nobody you know who knows anybody who knows anybody, ad infinitum.\u201dMr. Thiel and Mr. Trump are strange bedfellows, given that much of Mr. Thiel\u2019s billions came from being one of the original investors in Facebook and Mr. Trump recently said it\u2019s better to send important messages by courier. (\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Thiel notes, \u201cone does have to be very careful with what one says in an email.\u201d)The 70-year-old president-elect rose by wildly lunging with his Twitter rapier in an \u201cunpresidented\u201d way in the first campaign that blended politics, social media and reality. But the 49-year-old social-media visionary rarely updates his Facebook page and doesn\u2019t tweet, \u201cbecause you always want to get things exactly right\u201d and \u201cif you start doing it, you have to do it a lot.\u201dAs Silicon Valley has devolved into a place that produces apps like one that sends the word \u201cYo,\u201d Mr. Thiel worries its thinking is \u201cnot big enough to take our civilization to the next level.\u201dWhen I ask if it is true that Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, wasn\u2019t invited to the Trump tech meeting because the Trump camp was angry that Twitter wouldn\u2019t let the Republican nominee create a \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d emoji, Mr. Thiel replies that \u201cthere were people upset about that,\u201d but that he set up the meeting according to the market caps of the bigger tech companies.\u201cI think the crazy thing is,\u201d he says, \u201cat a place like Twitter, they were all working for Trump this whole year even though they thought they were working for Sanders.\u201dMr. Thiel says he fell into his role in the Trump candidacy.\u201cIt was one of my friends who called me up and said, \u2018Hey, would you like to be a delegate at the Republican convention?\u201d\u2019 he recalls. \u201cI said: \u2018Actually, I kind of would. I think it would be fun to go.\u2019 Then, two weeks before the election, they talked to me about speaking at the convention.\u201dI note that the audience in his hometown, Cleveland, gave him a great reception when he appeared as only the third openly gay speaker at a Republican convention.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that my speech was that good,\u201d he says. \u201cI do think a lot of other speeches were just very bad.\u201dHe had his first conversation with the man whom he sometimes calls \u201cMr. Trump\u201d at the convention, when the Manhattan mogul told the San Francisco mogul, \u201cYou were terrific. We\u2019re friends for life.\u201d Mr. Thiel never did go to a Trump rally or watch a whole video of one. \u201cI would think they were very repetitive,\u201d he says.He says that at the tech meeting, Mr. Trump showed \u201ca phenomenal understanding of people. He\u2019s very charismatic, but it\u2019s because he sort of knows exactly what to say to different people to put them at ease.\u201dI ask him if Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk are similar.\u201cI\u2019m going to get in trouble, but they are, actually. They\u2019re both grandmaster-level salespeople and these very much larger-than-life figures.\u201dHe recalls a story from his and Mr. Musk\u2019s PayPal days, when Mr. Musk joined the engineering team\u2019s poker game and bet everything on every hand, admitting only afterward that it was his first time playing poker. Then there was the time they were driving in Mr. Musk\u2019s McLaren F1 car, \u201cthe fastest car in the world.\u201d It hit an embankment, achieved liftoff, made a 360-degree horizontal turn, crashed and was destroyed.\u201cIt was a miracle neither of us were hurt,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt, which is not advisable. Elon\u2019s first comment was, \u2018Wow, Peter, that was really intense.\u2019 And then it was: \u2018You know, I had read all these stories about people who made money and bought sports cars and crashed them. But I knew it would never happen to me, so I didn\u2019t get any insurance.\u2019 And then we hitchhiked the rest of the way to the meeting.\u201dMr. Trump, with his litigious streak and his pugilistic attitude toward the press and his threat to change the libel laws, naturally admired Mr. Thiel\u2019s legal smackdown of Gawker. The tech titan was disturbed by the \u201cpainful and paralyzing\u201d stories published on the gossipy website and other blogs under the Gawker banner, including a 2007 post that originally appeared on Valleywag blithely headlined \u201cPeter Thiel Is Totally Gay, People.\u201dSo he secretly financed the lawsuit filed by Terry Bollea (the real name of the wrestler Hulk Hogan) against Gawker for posting an excerpt from a sex tape showing Mr. Hogan with a friend\u2019s wife. A court ruled in Mr. Bollea\u2019s favor, in a judgment of $140 million, which drove the site into bankruptcy. (The Gawker founder Nick Denton, who is also gay, described Mr. Thiel to Vanity Fair as \u201cinteresting \u2014 and scary.\u201d)\u201cIt basically stands for the narrow proposition that you should not publish a sex tape,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cI think that\u2019s an insult to journalists to suggest that\u2019s journalism now. Transparency is good, but at some point it can go in this very toxic direction.\u201dJust as there was \u201ca self-fulfilling Hillary bubble\u201d where \u201ceverybody was just too scared to say this was a really bad idea\u201d to support this \u201cvery weak candidate,\u201d Mr. Thiel believes Gawker manufactured \u201ca totally insane bubble full of somewhat sociopathic people in New York.\u201d When the case went to court in Florida, he contends, the culture that \u201cyou could do whatever you wanted and there were no consequences\u201d was exposed.\u201cThere\u2019s some resonances between Hogan beating Gawker and Trump beating the establishment in this country,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. Hulk Hogan was \u201cthis crazy person\u201d who didn\u2019t seem like the best plaintiff, but \u201che didn\u2019t give up.\u201dUsing two wrestling terms he learned, Mr. Thiel says that many people assumed Mr. Trump was \u201ckayfabe\u201d \u2014 a move that looks real but is fake. But then his campaign turned into a \u201cshoot\u201d \u2014 the word for an unscripted move that suddenly becomes real.\u201cPeople thought the whole Trump thing was fake, that it wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere, that it was the most ridiculous thing imaginable, and then somehow he won, like Hogan did,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cAnd what I wonder is, whether maybe pro wrestling is one of the most real things we have in our society and what\u2019s really disturbing is that the other stuff is much more fake. And whatever the superficialities of Mr. Trump might be, he was more authentic than the other politicians. He sort of talked in a way like ordinary people talk. It was not sort of this Orwellian newspeak jargon that so many of the candidates use. So he was sort of real. He actually wanted to win.\u201dI ask Mr. Thiel about a prescient theory he proffered when I had dinner with him at the convention \u2014 again, flipping conventional wisdom \u2014 that Hillary was making a mistake by being too optimistic.\u201cIf you\u2019re too optimistic, it sounds like you\u2019re out of touch,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Republicans needed a far more pessimistic candidate. Somehow, what was unusual about Trump is, he was very pessimistic but it still had an energizing aspect to it.\u201dHe says he has no plans to buy a place in Washington. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s striking about talking to people who are politically working in D.C. is, it\u2019s so hard to tell what any of them actually do,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of place where people measure input, not output. You have a 15-minute monologue describing a 15-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9, starting in seventh grade.\u201dWhile many predict that Mr. Trump will crash and burn, Mr. Thiel does not think he will regret his role.\u201cI always have very low expectations, so I\u2019m rarely disappointed,\u201d he says.I ask him how Mr. Trump, who is still putting out a lot of wacky, childish tweets, has struck him during the transition. Isn\u2019t he running around with his hair on fire?\u201cThe hair seems fine,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cMr. Trump seems fine.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australian Drug Maker Has Low Profile but Powerful Backers in Washington", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Innate Immunotherapeutics is a tiny pharmaceutical company from Australia that has no approved drugs and no backing from flashy venture capital firms, and trades for just over a dollar a share on the Australian Stock Exchange. More than once, the company has run out of money and nearly closed its doors.Other Washington power players with investments in the company include Michael Hook, Mr. Collins\u2019s chief of staff, who is a top shareholder, and Bill Paxon, a Washington lobbyist and former congressman, according to company filings and congressional financial disclosures. Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon bought the stock at a discount as part of a private offering organized by Innate aimed at \u201csophisticated U.S. investors.\u201d They have since quintupled their money, at least on paper.Representatives of Mr. Price and Mr. Collins say they have not broken any rules, but what has puzzled Washington and industry insiders alike is how a no-name Australian biotech, with only one experimental multiple sclerosis drug under development, attracted a coterie of Washington investors, including the man who is likely to become the next health secretary.A spokesman for Mr. Collins said the congressman had followed all ethical guidelines and said Innate was one of many companies he had been involved in. \u201cHe is very proud of the progress the company has made over the years and hopeful it will be able to develop a potentially lifesaving treatment for the millions of individuals suffering from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,\u201d said the spokesman, Michael McAdams.In an interview this week in San Francisco, Innate\u2019s chief executive, Simon Wilkinson, seemed amused at all of the attention now being paid to what he described as his \u201clittle biotech at the wrong end of the world.\u201dTheir goal, they said, is to sell the company to a larger pharmaceutical company.\u201cIt won\u2019t be up to us to seek approval for the drug,\u201d Mr. Wilkinson said in the interview, which took place at his hotel on a rundown block in San Francisco, where he was pitching the company to potential buyers at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference.Like many biotech start-ups, Innate has had ups and downs, Mr. Wilkinson said. \u201cBut sometimes, things happen,\u201d he added. In his case, he said, \u201cI met Chris.\u201dMr. Wilkinson said he was on a fund-raising trip to the United States in 2005 when the two met, and he made his pitch to Mr. Collins, who was then a businessman with a reputation for turning around struggling companies. Mr. Collins decided to invest in the company, eventually joining its board.In 2007, Mr. Collins was elected county executive of Erie County, which includes Buffalo, and in 2012, he won election to Congress. He remained on Innate\u2019s board, and Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Quinn said his new political career has had little impact.\u201cIf anything, I suspect it\u2019s probably a negative,\u201d Mr. Quinn said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s a bit harder to access \u2014 he\u2019s just busy.\u201dMr. Collins remained one of the company\u2019s top cheerleaders, enlisting many of his associates as investors and even lending the company money a handful of times when it was at risk of going out of business.Today, many of Innate\u2019s biggest shareholders have ties to Mr. Collins. They include two of his adult children, Caitlin and Cameron, who are the company\u2019s third- and fourth-biggest shareholders, as well as several Buffalo businessmen who have donated to his political campaigns, according to company filings and campaign finance disclosures. Lindy Ruff, the head coach of the Dallas Stars hockey team and a former player and coach for the Buffalo Sabres, is also an investor.Innate\u2019s sole drug in development, MIS416, is in clinical trials in Australia and New Zealand to evaluate whether it works in people with an advanced form of multiple sclerosis. A midlevel trial is underway, and results are due in the middle of this year.Experts in congressional ethics and trading rules said there did not appear to be evidence that Mr. Collins or Mr. Price used nonpublic information to steer their investment activities, a practice that would violate what is known as the Stock Act, which bans insider trading by members of Congress. But, said Donna M. Nagy, a law professor at Indiana University who has written on the financial investments by members of Congress, \u201cOne needs facts in order to get answers to those questions, and coming up with the facts for that is going to be difficult.\u201dMr. Holman of Public Citizen said Mr. Collins\u2019s recruiting efforts among Washington power players created the opportunity for \u201cinfluence peddling.\u201d For example, Mr. Paxon, who represented Mr. Collins\u2019s congressional district in the 1990s, could appear before Mr. Collins as both a lobbyist and a fellow investor in Innate.\u201cIt\u2019s a very effective means of buying access and hopefully influencing politicians,\u201d Mr. Holman said.Mr. Collins\u2019s spokesman said Mr. Paxon and Mr. Collins had never discussed Innate and noted that, because they are both from the Buffalo area, he might have become aware of Innate through other investors in the region. Mr. Paxon did not respond to emails and a call for comment.Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon were among 16 entities that took part in the private American placement, as did several other of Mr. Collins\u2019s associates and donors, according to the company filing. Mr. Price and Mr. Hook also participated in a second offering in the summer, the filings show. Mr. Price purchased between $50,000 and $100,000 in Innate shares in August, which was among the largest stock buys he had made since 2012, according to congressional financial disclosures. The investment was larger than his trades in more established pharmaceutical stocks like Pfizer and Merck.With his discount from the private placements, Mr. Price would have purchased some stock at 25 Australian cents per share in August and some at 34 cents. The stock closed on Friday at $1.31.Mr. McAdams, Mr. Collins\u2019s spokesman, said the private placement was available to qualified American investors and said Mr. Hook had previously invested in a private placement with the company in 2009, before Mr. Collins was a congressman. Several other investors were longtime friends of Mr. Collins, Mr. McAdams said, and their investment predates his time in Congress.Mr. Quinn dismissed questions about whether anyone engaged in insider trading and said the company\u2019s stock had been rising in anticipation of the results of the clinical trial later this year. The outcome of such trials is typically kept secret from investors and even company executives.\u201cRight now the whole value of this thing swings on a bet on the study results,\u201d he said.In San Francisco this week, Mr. Wilkinson said he had received interest in a possible acquisition from about 20 \u201chigh grade\u201d pharmaceutical companies. The drug, if approved, would be the first to treat a progressive form of multiple sclerosis.But he was also self-deprecating, noting wryly that Innate was such a \u201cbottom feeder\u201d at the JPMorgan conference that the company had not even qualified for an invitation to attend the main event.Abby Goodnough contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s News Conference: Full Transcript and Video", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byAfter the president-elect makes some remarks, he will introduce Ms. Sheri Dillon, a prominent attorney in Washington, D.C., with the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who will \u2014 who structured the agreements pursuant to the president\u2019s business arrangements and she will give brief remarks.Before we start, I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night. It\u2019s frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elect\u2019s campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office.According to BuzzFeed\u2019s own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report. The executive editor of The New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, \u201cTotally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet.\u201dCarter Page is an individual who the president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign. Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time. We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague.In fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague. A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at \u2014 at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game. One report now suggested apparently it\u2019s another Michael Cohen. For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful.With that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today, but I\u2019m even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again.(APPLAUSE)Now, the president-elect\u2019s leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive. But as the chairman of the transition effort, I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring. To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet.Nineteen of the 21 cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a \u2014 it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward. Perhaps that\u2019s why there\u2019s been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration.You know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be. But with freedom comes responsibility. And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it.(APPLAUSE)But today, we\u2019ll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again. And we\u2019ll hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today.So, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the president-elect of the United States of America, Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis. I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it\u2019s good to be with you.But I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years \u2014 a couple in particular \u2014 and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station.So, I just want to compliment many of the people in the room. I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that. But I will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional \u2014 so incredibly professional, that I\u2019ve just gone up a notch as to what I think of you. OK?All right. We\u2019ve had some great news over the last couple of weeks. I\u2019ve been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country. A lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies \u2014 big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest.You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they\u2019re going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant.I appreciate that from Ford. I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler. I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be. I think a lot of people will be following. I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back.We\u2019ve got to get our drug industry back. Our drug industry has been disastrous. They\u2019re leaving left and right. They supply our drugs, but they don\u2019t make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they\u2019re getting away with murder.Pharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there\u2019s very little bidding on drugs. We\u2019re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don\u2019t bid properly and we\u2019re going to start bidding and we\u2019re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.And we\u2019re going to do that with a lot of other industries. I\u2019m very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the F-35, you\u2019ve been reading about it. And it\u2019s way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget. I don\u2019t like that. And the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic. I\u2019ve really gotten to know them well. And we\u2019re going to do some big things on the F-35 program, and perhaps the F-18 program. And we\u2019re going to get those costs way down and we\u2019re going to get the plane to be even better. And we\u2019re going to have some competition and it\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing.So, we\u2019ve been very, very much involved, and other things. We had Jack Ma, we had so many incredible people coming here. There are no \u2014 they\u2019re going to do tremendous things \u2014 tremendous things in this country. And they\u2019re very excited.And I will say, if the election didn\u2019t turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here. They would not be in my office. They would not be in anybody else\u2019s office. They\u2019d be building and doing things in other countries. So, there\u2019s a great spirit going on right now. A spirit that many people have told me they\u2019ve never seen before, ever.We\u2019re going to create jobs. I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. And I mean that, I really \u2014 I\u2019m going to work very hard on that. We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we\u2019re going to do a real job. And I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve done.And we haven\u2019t even gotten there yet. I look very much forward to the inauguration. It\u2019s going to be a beautiful event. We have great talent, tremendous talent. And we have the \u2014 all of the bands \u2014 or most of the bands are from the different \u2014 from the different segments of the military. And I\u2019ve heard some of these bands over the years, they\u2019re incredible.We\u2019re going to have a very, very elegant day. The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special; very beautiful. And I think we\u2019re going to have massive crowds because we have a movement.And we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they\u2019re gonna have a lot of security. They\u2019re going to have a lot of good news for their veterans.And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we\u2019ll do a news release in a little while. Tell you about David, he\u2019s fantastic \u2014 he\u2019s fantastic. He will do a truly great job.One of the commitments I made is that we\u2019re gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans. Our veterans have been treated horribly. They\u2019re waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they can\u2019t see a doctor. By the time they get to the doctor, they\u2019re terminal. Not gonna happen, it\u2019s not gonna happen.So, David is going to do a fantastic job. We\u2019re going to be talking to a few people also to help David. And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more than we have. And we\u2019re gonna set up a \u2014 a group.These are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line. And they\u2019re going to get together with their great doctors \u2014 Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved.Ike Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business. And we\u2019re gonna straighten out the V.A. for our veterans. I\u2019ve been promising that for a long time and it\u2019s something I feel very, very strongly.So, you\u2019ll get the information on David. And I think you\u2019ll be very impressed with the job he does. We looked long and hard. We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good. But we had a lot of talent. And we think this election will be something that will, with time \u2014 with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good \u2018cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly.OK, questions? Yes, John (ph)?A couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we\u2019re looking for further clarification on.And if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States?And \u2014 but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. And I will say, again, I think it\u2019s a disgrace that information would be let out.I saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting. It\u2019s all fake news. It\u2019s phony stuff. It didn\u2019t happen. And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. It was a group of opponents that got together \u2014 sick people \u2014 and they put that crap together.So, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. It should have never been \u2014 number one, shouldn\u2019t have even entered paper. But it should have never have been released. But I read what was released and I think it\u2019s a disgrace. I think it\u2019s an absolute disgrace.As far as hacking, I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. And I \u2014 I can say that you know when \u2014 when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China.We had \u2014 we had much hacking going on. And one of the things we\u2019re gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we\u2019ve assembled. You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world \u2014 they were never in the same room together as a group. And we\u2019re gonna put those minds together and we\u2019re going to form a defense.And I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense.And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through.We have to do that for our country. It\u2019s very important.(CROSSTALK)Now, somebody would say, \u201cOh, of course he\u2019s gonna say that.\u201dI respected the fact that he said that.And I \u2014 I\u2019ll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would\u2019ve released it; they would\u2019ve been glad to release it.I think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would\u2019ve released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her. I mean what he said about her was horrible.If somebody said about me, what Podesta said about Hillary, I was the boss, I would\u2019ve fired him immediately or that person. Because what he said about her was horrible.But remember this: We talk about the hacking and hacking\u2019s bad and it shouldn\u2019t be done. But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking.That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn\u2019t report it? That\u2019s a horrible thing. That\u2019s a horrible thing.Can you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate \u2014 it would\u2019ve been the biggest story in the history of stories. And they would\u2019ve said immediately, \u201cYou have to get out of the race.\u201d Nobody even talked about it. It\u2019s a very terrible thing.Yeah?(CROSSTALK)On that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election.Do you accept that part of the finding? And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place?If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That\u2019s called an asset, not a liability.Now, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m gonna get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t. And if I don\u2019t, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Give me a break.OK?(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)When I leave our country, I\u2019m a very high-profile person, would you say?I am extremely careful. I\u2019m surrounded by bodyguards. I\u2019m surrounded by people.And I always tell them \u2014 anywhere, but I always tell them if I\u2019m leaving this country, \u201cBe very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you\u2019re gonna probably have cameras.\u201d I\u2019m not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.And number one, \u201cI hope you\u2019re gonna be good anyway. But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places. Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can\u2019t see them and you won\u2019t know. You better be careful, or you\u2019ll be watching yourself on nightly television.\u201dI tell this to people all the time.I was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well \u2014 Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well.And I told many people, \u201cBe careful, because you don\u2019t wanna see yourself on television. Cameras all over the place.\u201dAnd again, not just Russia, all over.Does anyone really believe that story?I\u2019m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)Based on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified? Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise? And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it?As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. I have assets that are \u2014 and now people have found out how big the company is, I have very little debt \u2014 I have very low debt. But I have no loans with Russia at all.And I thought that was important to put out. I certified that. So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don\u2019t want to because I think that would be a conflict. So I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals.Now, I have to say one other thing. Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Damack, a friend of mine, great guy. And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai \u2014 a number of deals and I turned it down.I didn\u2019t have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I\u2019m president, which is \u2014 I didn\u2019t know about that until about three months ago, but it\u2019s a nice thing to have. But I don\u2019t want to take advantage of something. I have something that others don\u2019t have, Vice President Pence also has it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll need it, I have a feeling he\u2019s not going to need it.But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president. It was many, many years old, this is for presidents. Because they don\u2019t want presidents getting \u2014 I understand they don\u2019t want presidents getting tangled up in minutia; they want a president to run the country. So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time.I don\u2019t like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one to be able to do that. You can\u2019t do that in any other capacity. But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company \u2014 the country. I\u2019d do a very good job, but I don\u2019t want to do that.Now, all of these papers that you see here \u2014 yes, go ahead.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)And what I\u2019m going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company. They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They\u2019re not going to discuss it with me. Again, I don\u2019t have to do this. They\u2019re not going to discuss it with me. And with that, I\u2019m going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she\u2019s going to go \u2014 these papers are just some of the many documents that I\u2019ve signed turning over complete and total control to my sons.(CROSSTALK)He\u2019s asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he\u2019s taking. As you know, the business empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president. But at that time, no one was so concerned.President-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people\u2019s business and not his own. To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company.He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.Even so, President-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests. He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit. He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law.Critical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him. He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H.W. Bush\u2019s Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center.Mr. Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan. He\u2019s here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump organization.I\u2019m gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking. First, President-elect Trump\u2019s investments and business assets commonly known as the \u2014 as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th. Here is just some of the paperwork that\u2019s taking care of those actions.Second, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump.Further, at the president-elect\u2019s direction, the trust agreement provides \u2014 that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team. The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns.President-elect Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency. President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities.Further, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization. As she and Jared move their family to D.C., Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools.The president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments. As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets. Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics.Second, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with. Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods. Things like Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust.Through instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect trust \u2014 President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric.DILLON: The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump\u2019s presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process.The president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. Because any new deal could \u2014 and I emphasize could \u2014 be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues.The ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts. Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval.To further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization, President-elect Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights. Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole. There will be no separate business by business accounting.Another step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization; the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency.He has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to President-elect Trump\u2019s role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency.In sum, all of these actions \u2014 complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights \u2014 will sever President-elect Trump\u2019s presidency from the Trump Organization.Some have asked questions. Why not divest? Why not just sell everything? Form of blind trust. And I\u2019d like to turn to addressing some of those questions now.Selling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest. In fact, it would exacerbate them. The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization\u2019s assets. If President-elect Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency.Further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect. And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn\u2019t even feasible.Some people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children. This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated. And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now.Some people have suggested that the Trump \u2014 that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company. Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter. It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization.Some people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses. President Trump can\u2019t unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized.DILLON: Further, it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization. The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets. And this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective. It creates a complete separation from President-elect Trump \u2014 it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new deal.I\u2019m going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. That\u2019s a word I think we\u2019ve all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before.And we\u2019re gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.Emoluments comes from the Constitution. The Constitution says \u201cofficials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office.\u201dThe so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder.No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument.But since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm\u2019s-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn\u2019t even aware of.These people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It\u2019s not an emolument.The Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here. But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires.So, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit.In sum, I and president-elect\u2019s (sic) other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we\u2019ve outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family.We believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elect\u2019s desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure.The American people were well \u2014 well aware of President-elect Trump\u2019s business empire and financial interests when they voted. Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.President-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)What is your response to your critics that say not only you, but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest?And do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your \u2014 your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration...(CROSSTALK)I watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general. And he was brilliant. And what people don\u2019t know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama. And he was brilliant yesterday.So, I really think that they are \u2014 I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together. And we\u2019ve been hearing that from so many people. People are so happy.You know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil. When there was a find, he would get it. When they needed something, he would be there.A friend of mine who\u2019s very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm \u2014 big supporter \u2014 he said there\u2019s nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson.And that\u2019s what we want. That\u2019s what I want to bring to government.I want to bring the greatest people into government, because we\u2019re way behind. We don\u2019t make good deals any more. I say it all the time in speeches. We don\u2019t make good deals anymore; we make bad deals. Our trade deals are a disaster.TRUMP: We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis \u2014 hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody. We don\u2019t make good deals anymore.So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they\u2019re smart. And that\u2019s what I\u2019d put, I\u2019m very proud of the Cabinet, I think they\u2019re doing very well.It\u2019s very interesting how it\u2019s going, but it\u2019s \u2014 I think they\u2019re doing very, very well.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)They can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you. In some cases, they guide you incorrectly. In most cases, you realize what\u2019s happened, it\u2019s imploding as we sit.Some states have over a hundred percent increase and \u201917 and I said this two years ago, \u201917 is going to be the bad year. It\u2019s going to be catastrophic. Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the people.We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare. We don\u2019t wanna own it, we don\u2019t wanna own it politically. They own it right now.So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in \u201917 and believe me, we\u2019d get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time. We\u2019re going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary\u2019s approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan.It\u2019ll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour.So we\u2019re gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff. And we\u2019re gonna get a health bill passed, we\u2019re gonna get health care taken care of in this country. You have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can\u2019t even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high.Obamacare is the Democrats problem. We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them. We\u2019re doing them a tremendous service by doing it. We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service.So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we\u2019ll be filing a plan. And it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times. And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare.We\u2019re going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)And then my follow-up question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts?And they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us, a lot. But those were \u2014 that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it\u2019s always tough when they\u2019re building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement.TRUMP: So I wanna thank United Technologies. But we\u2019ve been meeting with a lot of companies. But what really is happening, is the word is now out, that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason, it\u2019s not going to happen that way anymore.You want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you\u2019re going to build that plant in Mexico and you\u2019re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you\u2019re making, and you\u2019re going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border \u2014 not a weak border like it is \u2014 we don\u2019t even have a border. It\u2019s an open sieve.But you\u2019re going to sell through a very strong border \u2014 not going to happen. You\u2019re going to pay a very large border tax. So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina. You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan.You can do anywhere \u2014 you\u2019ve got a lot of states at play; a lot of competition. So it\u2019s not like, oh, gee, I\u2019m taking the competition away. You\u2019ve got a lot of places you can move. And I don\u2019t care, as along as it\u2019s within the United States, the borders of the United States.There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. And you\u2019d have millions more workers right now in the United States that are \u2014 96 million really wanting a job and they can\u2019t get. You know that story. The real number \u2014 that\u2019s the real number.So, that\u2019s the way it is. OK. Go ahead.And on the Supreme Court, what\u2019s your timeline? You said a while ago you were down to four. Have you conducted those interviews yet? What\u2019s your timeline for nominating?And on the border fence, it now appears clear U.S. taxpayers will have to pay for it up front. What is your plan to...(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)On the fence \u2014 it\u2019s not a fence. It\u2019s a wall. You just misreported it. We\u2019re going to build a wall. I could wait about a year-and-a-half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office, but I don\u2019t want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin.I don\u2019t feel like waiting a year or a year-and-a-half. We\u2019re going to start building. Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment \u2014 probably less likely that it\u2019s a payment. But it will happen.So, remember this, OK? I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy. I would then say, who is going to pay for the wall? And people would all scream out \u2014 25,000, 30,000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had. You know that. You don\u2019t like to report that, but that\u2019s OK.OK, now he agrees. Finally, he agrees.But I say who is going to pay for the wall? And they will scream out, \u201cMexico.\u201dNow, reports went out last week \u2014 oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement. What\u2019s the difference? I want to get the wall started. I don\u2019t want to wait a year-and-a-half until I make my deal with Mexico. And we probably will have a deal sooner than that.And by the way, Mexico has been so nice, so nice. I respect the government of Mexico. I respect the people of Mexico. I love the people of Mexico. I have many people from Mexico working for me. They\u2019re phenomenal people.The government of Mexico is terrific. I don\u2019t blame them for what\u2019s happened. I don\u2019t blame them for taking advantage of the United States. I wish our politicians were so smart. Mexico has taken advantage of the United States. I don\u2019t blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of Mexico. What I say is we shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore.So, in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed. OK?Supreme Court judge. So, as you know, I have a list of 20. I\u2019ve gone through them. We\u2019ve met with numerous candidates. They\u2019re outstanding in every case. They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society. Jim DeMint was also very much involved, and his group, which is fantastic, and he\u2019s a fantastic guy.TRUMP: So between Leo and Jim DeMint and some senators and some congresspeople, we have a great group of people. I\u2019ll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the United States Supreme Court, a replacement for the great, great Justice Scalia. That will be probably within two weeks of the 20th. So within about two weeks, probably the second week. I consider the first day because we\u2019ll also be doing some \u2014 some pretty good signings and I think what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll wait until Monday.That will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday, because on Friday, people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration, and then Saturday, as you know, we\u2019re having a big church service and lots of good things are happening. So our first day \u2014 and you\u2019ll all be invited to the signings, but we\u2019ll be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday, and then also the next week. And you\u2019re all invited.But on the Supreme Court, I\u2019ll be making that decision, and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in. I think it\u2019s one of the reasons I got elected. I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court, so I think it was a very, very big decision as to why I was elected.As far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they\u2019re going to suffer the consequences. They already are. And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up \u2014 and by the way, we just found out I was coming down. Michael Cohen \u2014 I was being \u2014 Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer. He\u2019s a good lawyer in my firm. It was just reported that it wasn\u2019t this Michael Cohen they we\u2019re talking about. So all night long it\u2019s Michael Cohen.I said, \u201cI want to see your passport.\u201d He brings his passport to my office. I say, hey, wait a minute. He didn\u2019t leave the country. He wasn\u2019t out of the country. They had Michael Cohen of the Trump Organization was in Prague. It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen. It\u2019s a disgrace what took place. It\u2019s a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen.(APPLAUSE)Go ahead. Go ahead. You\u2019ve been waiting.As far as we understand it, the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news, as you describe it. If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up, that any of it is true, will you consider your position...You know, I\u2019ve been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they\u2019re talking about people that go and say all sorts of things. But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news more so than anybody. I could name them, but I won\u2019t bother, but you have a few sitting right in front of us. They\u2019re very, very dishonest people, but I think it\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have to live with.TRUMP: I guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back. When it happens to somebody that doesn\u2019t have this \u2014 doesn\u2019t have that kind of a megaphone, they can\u2019t speak back. It\u2019s a very sad thing. I\u2019ve seen people destroyed. I\u2019ve seen people absolutely destroyed. And I think it\u2019s very unfair. So, all I can ask for is honest reporters.Yes?(CROSSTALK)I want them to cover this situation. I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly \u2014 because we\u2019re hacked by everybody \u2014 you know, the United States, our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst, it\u2019s number 17, in terms of protection.If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries \u2014 they put this in the category of an industry \u2014 the United States is last in terms of protecting, let\u2019s say, hacking defense. Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National Committee.That\u2019s why we weren\u2019t hacked. By the way, we were told that they were trying to hack us, but they weren\u2019t able to hack. And I think I get some credit because I told Reince, and Reince did a phenomenal job, but I said I want strong hacking defense.The Democratic National Committee didn\u2019t do that. Maybe that\u2019s why the country runs so badly that way. But I will tell you \u2014 wait \u2014 wait \u2014 wait, let me finish. Within 90 days, we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomena \u2014 fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybody.That includes Russia and China and everybody \u2014 everybody. OK.(CROSSTALK)I\u2019ll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody\u2019s leaking it out. So, there\u2019s \u2014 maybe it\u2019s my office. Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people. Maybe it\u2019s them. And what I did is I said I won\u2019t tell anybody. I\u2019m going to have a meeting and I won\u2019t tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence.And what happened is I had my meeting. Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn\u2019t know \u2014 I didn\u2019t tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.So, I don\u2019t want that \u2014 I don\u2019t want that. It\u2019s very unfair to the country. It\u2019s very unfair to our country; what\u2019s happened. That report should have never \u2014 first of all, it shouldn\u2019t have been printed because it\u2019s not worth the paper it\u2019s written on. And I thank the New York Times for saying that.I thank a lot of different people for saying that. But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK.(CROSSTALK)We have to work something out, but it\u2019s not just Russia. Take a look at what\u2019s happened. You don\u2019t report it the same way; 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China. And that\u2019s because we have no defense. That\u2019s because we\u2019re run by people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.TRUMP: Russia will have far greater respect for our country when I\u2019m leading it and I believe and I hope \u2014 maybe it won\u2019t happen, it\u2019s possible. But I won\u2019t be giving (ph) a little reset button like Hillary. Here, press this piece of plastic. A guy looked at her like what is she doing? There\u2019s no reset button. We\u2019re either going to get along or we\u2019re not. I hope we get along, but if we don\u2019t, that\u2019s possible too.But Russia and other countries \u2014 and other countries, including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress, total. Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations.I want to thank everybody. So this is all \u2014 just so you understand, these papers \u2014 because I\u2019m not sure that was explained properly. But these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I hope at the end of eight years, I\u2019ll come back and say, oh, you did a good job. Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I\u2019ll say, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201dGood-bye, everybody. Good-bye.ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A \u2018World Unto Itself\u2019 in New York Area Yeshivas: Floor Hockey", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byIn the basement of a mammoth old building in Upper Manhattan that houses the Yeshiva University High School for Boys sits a cramped gym that is home to the high school\u2019s floor hockey team, known as the Lions.The school calls the gym the Lions\u2019 Den, but many visitors call it the Dungeon and liken playing there to playing hockey inside a box. Games are raucous affairs with rough play and frenzied fans squeezed onto the narrow bleachers at one end, between the squads of panting players.Several miles away, in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, is the comparatively luxurious indoor rink at the Salanter Akiba Riverdale High School, known as S.A.R. With its sturdy boards and rounded sides, the rink resembles a real ice hockey surface. Its scoreboard is flanked by American and Israeli flags.Between these two extremes exists the little-known but thriving world of interscholastic floor hockey at yeshiva high schools in New York City and surrounding towns.The game in these Orthodox Jewish private schools stretches back at least to the late 1970s, but in recent years, it has grown enormously popular. The championship match can fill an arena with as many as 1,000 fans, with more people watching live online. Players in elementary grades at Jewish schools now set their sights on yeshivas with the most powerful hockey programs.\u201cOutside the Orthodox community, this is a foreign thing,\u201d said Amir Gavarin, 22, a former floor hockey league player. \u201cBut inside, it\u2019s a whole world unto itself, and supercompetitive.\u201dThe game is similar to ice hockey, but played on foot on a gym floor with a hard orange ball and five-player squads made up of a goalie and four roaming players.Goalies wear full padding, but the other players wear sweatpants, jerseys and helmets with face masks. Under the jersey, some players wear a tallit katan, a religious garment with knotted fringes, or zizit.Blatant body checking is banned, but there is plenty of contact. The teams play mostly in conventional gyms set up with temporary barriers.Orthodox youngsters are often introduced to the game in summer camp or by friends from their synagogue, and end up playing in one of the many youth leagues that have cropped up in Orthodox neighborhoods, before joining teams in middle school.\u201cIn some New Jersey yeshivas, floor hockey is more popular than basketball,\u201d said Yoni Stone, the varsity coach at the Yeshiva University High School for Boys. \u201cForget high school \u2014 every single day school has a team, and the kids start in the youth leagues.\u201dPlayers, abiding by their religious tenets, use the sport as an outlet between long hours spent studying Judaic texts and other subjects. Since they observe the Sabbath, there is no play on Friday evenings or Saturdays before sundown. The season runs from late October through March.On a weeknight last month, the Lions made their dramatic pregame entrance to blaring rock music. They were there to take on the Cobras from the Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School in Livingston, N.J., a school financed by the family of Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President-elect Donald J. Trump.Mr. Kushner himself was proficient at the sport, having played for the Frisch School in Paramus, N.J., when he was a teenager.The Cobras wound up beating the Lions, a fatiguing feat since the ball rarely escapes the playing area, making for almost nonstop action. Each game has three periods, with each period lasting 12 minutes.In fact, the team from the Ramaz School on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side prepared to play at the Lions\u2019 gym by having one of its players, a senior training to enter the Israeli Army, put his teammates through rigorous military exercises.The Ramaz School holds games in a modern, brightly lit gym that is a far cry from the Lions\u2019 Den. One night last month, the Rams of Ramaz took on the visiting Thunder from the Rav Teitz Mesivta Academy, or R.T.M.A., from Elizabeth, N.J., and won the game in sudden-death overtime, prompting a celebratory mob of Ramaz players.At certain powerhouses, hockey is perhaps the most prominent sport, and rivalries have developed between neighboring yeshivas.In Brooklyn, the games can be particularly intense whenever the Magen David Yeshivah or the Yeshivah of Flatbush, both in Midwood, or the Yeshivat Darche Eres in Sheepshead Bay, face off.\u201cThey\u2019re seeing all these kids in synagogue the next day, so that creates a certain competitiveness,\u201d Mr. Stone said.When rivals in the Five Towns section of Long Island play, \u201cthe whole town shuts down\u201d for games that can attract hundreds of spectators, said David Kolb, a hockey writer for MSG Networks and the operator of Camp Dovid, a summer hockey camp in Pennsylvania where campers wear the names of their yeshivas on their jerseys.Two top teams in the Five Towns \u2014 the Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway and the D.R.S. Yeshiva High School for Boys \u2014 have nurtured a long-simmering rivalry. And in the league final in 2014, when the Hebrew Academy finally avenged years of losses with a victory, \u201cyou would have thought the messiah had come,\u201d said Seth Gordon, the hockey commissioner for the Metropolitan Yeshiva High School Athletic League.\u201cSome of these rivalries start in elementary school, with the seeds planted when these kids are in sixth grade,\u201d Mr. Gordon said.Though the sport has drawn a loyal and passionate following, the athletes are ultimately religious students who are urged to put their spiritual priorities before their athletic ones.\u201cIt\u2019s common with the Jewish identity that we can\u2019t do certain things because of the boundaries of observant Jewish life, so we create our own parameters and do it to the fullest,\u201d Mr. Gavarin said.Mayer Schiller, a Hasidic rabbi who in the 1990s coached Yeshiva University High School to six consecutive league championships, is recognized as the progenitor of the yeshiva floor hockey scene. He was hard to miss, since he coached wearing his black hat and coat.Rabbi Schiller, 65, still an avid fan of rock, pop and punk music, established the now popular tradition of having players enter the gym to loud music. The rabbi\u2019s choice: the Ramones.The rabbi formed a team at the Ramaz School in 1979, and helped organize a fledgling yeshiva hockey league with a half-dozen teams that grew significantly over the years.He regarded coaching as a form of spiritual service and striving at sports as a complement to studying sacred texts and worshiping God.\u201cIf God didn\u2019t mean for this greatness to exist, why did he give us Gretzky and Jordan?\u201d Rabbi Schiller said.On a recent weeknight, the S.A.R. team \u2014 which includes Mr. Kolb\u2019s two sons, Gordie and Henri \u2014 was put through power-play drills and scrimmaging by its longtime head coach, Howie Falkenstein.Mr. Falkenstein was getting his team ready for its game against the Frisch School and had players practicing penalty shots. Gordie, the S.A.R. Sting\u2019s captain, deftly scored on his brother, a goalie, prompting a chorus of hoots from teammates.S.A.R. wound up beating Frisch, solidifying its status as one of the league\u2019s top teams.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely its own niche, but it\u2019s still hockey and it has the team camaraderie that people are looking for,\u201d Mr. Falkenstein said. \u201cIt has the same excitement when you score a goal or make a save.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With New Congress Poised to Convene, Obama\u2019s Policies Are in Peril", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The most powerful and ambitious Republican-led Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life \u2014 refashioning the country\u2019s social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration.Even before President-elect Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities \u2014 most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s repeal. Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation. Also up early: filling a long-vacant Supreme Court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees.\u201cIt\u2019s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. \u201cAnd we intend to do it.\u201dBut as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals, Democrats are preparing roadblocks. The party\u2019s brutal election-year wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference, Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts. (On Saturday, he offered New Year\u2019s wishes \u201cto all,\u201d including \u201cthose who have fought me and lost so badly they just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d)Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock.For Republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved \u2014 the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink.The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the mid-1990s. Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber.\u201cThey\u2019ve been given a golden opportunity here,\u201d said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. \u201cBut I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand.\u201cIf you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,\u201d Mr. Lott continued. \u201cYou have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you.\u201dThe tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation; the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus.The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for re-election in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time.But on many issues, Senate Democrats \u2014 including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York \u2014 are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201cAfter campaigning on a promise to help the middle class, President-elect Trump\u2019s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he\u2019s sworn in,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. \u201cDemocrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating middle-class families and the economy.\u201dRepublicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many business-related, that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone.\u201cI hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,\u201d the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. \u201cI think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy.\u201dIn late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in mountaintop-removal mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration.But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules\u2019 completion.Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year \u2014 already a quarter over \u2014 that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster. But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama\u2019s, and they may delay the repeal measure\u2019s effective date for years.The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome.Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. \u201cThe senator doesn\u2019t want to rush,\u201d said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer.One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland.Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him \u2014 want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions.While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party\u2019s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well.\u201cThis is no time for hubris,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cYou have to perform.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corporations Open the Cash Spigot for Trump\u2019s Inauguration", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Donald J. Trump strides onto the inaugural ballroom floor this week amid the sprawling celebration of his swearing-in, he will have corporate America and many of its titans to thank for the rapturous greeting.They are far from alone.All told, the group planning the inaugural festivities says it has raised more than $100 million, which would be nearly double the record for an inauguration, with much of it coming in six- and seven-figure checks from America\u2019s corporate suites.In exchange, Mr. Trump\u2019s most prolific donors will gain access to what amounts to a parallel inauguration week, carefully planned and largely out of public sight, during which they can mingle with members of the incoming administration over intimate meals and witness Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension from the front rows.No matter which party controls the White House, corporations and wealthy individuals open their checkbooks every four years, and administrations reward their donors with private events and other incentives.But ethics experts say Mr. Trump\u2019s donors are being given greater access and facing fewer limits on donations than those in other recent inaugurations, despite his vow to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of special interests in Washington.\u201cThis is nothing short of selling access to the president, the vice president and the cabinet,\u201d said Craig Holman, a registered lobbyist for Public Citizen, a nonpartisan ethics group in Washington. \u201cThis is very unfettered, brazen selling of access. It certainly runs counter to any presidential candidate who was talking about draining the swamp.\u201dFor those who have bankrolled the events, inauguration week will look quite a bit different from what it will to average Americans viewing it from home or the National Mall. The festivities will begin Tuesday evening with a black-tie \u201cChairman\u2019s Global Dinner\u201d for Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, congressional leaders, foreign diplomats and a few top donors.On Wednesday, events include a lunchtime reception hosted by Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, and a dinner honoring Vice President-elect Mike Pence, according to a copy of the week\u2019s schedule obtained by The New York Times.Thursday will feature another \u201cleadership luncheon,\u201d a public concert at the Lincoln Memorial featuring artists like Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down, and a candlelight dinner with Mr. Trump and his family for about 1,500 in the great hall of Union Station.Throughout the week, private transportation will ferry donors between a handful of high-end hotels, where donors were given priority booking, and the events. During unscheduled time, donors will be able to take advantage of private tours of Smithsonian museums arranged for them by the inaugural committee.Depending on the size of their gift, donors are also entitled to several V.I.P. tickets to an inaugural ball (there will be two, hosted on two floors of the convention center here), the inaugural parade and the swearing-in.For the most important guests, including many of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, his new hotel blocks from the White House will serve as a de facto home base and after-hours social venue, according to a member of the committee.Unlike campaigns, inaugural committees face few regulations limiting what they can raise and how they can do it. That has traditionally left it up to each administration to set its own restrictions.Barack Obama went further in 2009, banning all gifts from lobbyists and corporations, and capping individual gifts at $50,000, even as his fund-raising team amassed $53 million, then a record. He relaxed those restrictions in 2013, generally accepting corporate gifts up to $1 million and individual gifts up to $250,000.Mr. Trump\u2019s team said it would not accept gifts from registered federal lobbyists or solicit corporate donations over $1 million. The committee did not cap contributions from individuals.The inaugural committee will not be required to disclose its donors until late April, 90 days after the inauguration.The funds will cover all nonofficial inaugural programming, though the committee has not detailed exactly how much it plans to spend. A spokesman, Boris Epshteyn, has said any leftover money will be donated to charity.Thomas Barrack Jr., the private equity investor leading the committee, said his group\u2019s work was made considerably easier by a large untapped pool of donors who for one reason or another did not support Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.The fund-raising haul also shows that corporate America is coming around to the reality that it will have to do business with Mr. Trump, who has shown himself more than willing to single out individual companies for criticism. His inauguration offers them a first chance to show their support.\u201cA lot of the people who were not on board early on are now getting on,\u201d said Mel Sembler, a longtime Republican fund-raiser who has helped solicit donations.Daniel I. Weiner, who studies campaign finance issues at the Brennan Center for Justice, said those gifts, while certainly not unusual, raised questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises.\u201cVirtually any industry of any significance in the United States has business with the government, and the chance to rub shoulders with the president and prominent officials is kind of priceless,\u201d he said.In a statement issued to The Times on the committee\u2019s fund-raising work, Mr. Epshteyn said the group was \u201chonored and humbled by the incredible outpouring of support\u201d and focused on organizing \u201cworld-class\u201d events honoring the nation\u2019s history.Several members of the committee rejected the criticism of its fund-raising.\u201cLook, a lot of people are just good American citizens, and they want to support the transfer of power,\u201d said Ray Washburne, a Dallas investor and a member of the committee. \u201cAs far as buying influence, I don\u2019t know what kind of influence that can buy.\u201dMr. Sembler agreed, but said it was certainly \u201cgood public relations\u201d for American companies to be backing the celebration.\u201cIt\u2019s important to have your name there if you are in that business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like supporting your community.\u201dRachel Shorey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Becoming Warren Buffett\u2019 Goes Beyond a $74 Billion Fortune", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported byWarren E. Buffett isn\u2019t exactly an unknown quantity.Nowhere are there in-depth discussions about balance sheets and cash flow, though there are flashy animations illustrating basic investing principles. Instead, the film focuses on how Warren Edward Buffett grew from the Nebraskan son of a congressman to become the Oracle of Omaha, the avuncular mascot of American capitalism who built Berkshire Hathaway into a $406 billion empire, and shows some of his warts along the way.\u201cPeople watching it expecting to learn how to buy cheap stocks will be disappointed,\u201d Mr. Buffett said with a chuckle during a telephone interview. \u201cWhen I think about getting beyond a financial audience, this becomes really prominent.\u201dThe film, directed by Peter Kunhardt, is indisputably positive toward its subject, showcasing hallmarks of the Buffett legend like his regular chats with students, his poring through thick corporate financial statements and his almost daily visits to a McDonald\u2019s drive-through.But the movie doesn\u2019t shy away from portraying Mr. Buffett, now 86, as something of a remarkable human computer, gifted with numbers and less so with interpersonal relationships. He is the kind of man who straightforwardly says that he can\u2019t remember the colors of his bedroom walls, and the kind of husband who when his wife had the flu and asked for a pot to keep by her bedside, instead fetched a colander.In the film, his daughter, Susie, says she learned how to talk in sound bites to a father more immersed with financial issues than his children\u2019s. \u201cYou lose him to some giant thought he had in his head at the time,\u201d she said.Mr. Buffett doesn\u2019t quibble with what is onscreen. \u201cIt\u2019s really an accurate portrayal,\u201d he said. \u201cI make no claim to perfection.\u201dSusie Buffett, in a telephone interview, said she hoped the film captured Mr. Buffett in full. \u201cI think people get so star-struck with the money and the fame, and they don\u2019t know that he\u2019s just a person,\u201d she said.But the effect is different when the movie features dozens of old family photos and interviews with Mr. Buffett, his sisters and his children, and Bill and Melinda Gates. Mr. Buffett\u2019s first wife and the mother of his children, Susan (who died in 2004), is featured so prominently as an influence and force in Mr. Buffett\u2019s life that she\u2019s virtually a co-star.\u201cI\u2019m a non-finance guy, so I wanted to do a film about Warren the man and how Warren the man became Warren the super-successful investor,\u201d Mr. Kunhardt said.A week later, Mr. Buffett \u2014 impressed by Mr. Kunhardt\u2019s previous work \u2014 agreed to the first of four sit-down interviews. By 2015, Susie Buffett presented the filmmaker with a treasure vault for Buffettphiles: closets and cardboard boxes full of family photos, personal documents and home movies never seen publicly.Mr. Buffett remained closely engaged with the project. This month, as the movie neared completion, he caught a numerical error in one of its graphics, a missing handful of zeros in one particular datum.One notable omission in \u201cBecoming Warren Buffett\u201d is any interview with Astrid, Mr. Buffett\u2019s current wife. When Susan left Mr. Buffett in 1977 to move to San Francisco, the two remained married, and she later introduced him to Astrid, who became his longtime companion with her blessing. After Susan (whom Mr. Buffet also called Susie) died in 2004, Mr. Buffett married Astrid.\u201cSusie and I and Astrid had an arrangement that worked maybe one time in a thousand,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.Nonetheless, Mr. Buffett said that he asked Mr. Kunhardt to respect Astrid\u2019s wishes not to be interviewed. For his part, the filmmaker said he retained full editorial control and decided that Susan was simply a much more vital part of Mr. Buffett\u2019s story.She is credited with helping to shape Mr. Buffett\u2019s liberal politics \u2014 along with a reaction to his beloved father\u2019s conservative principles \u2014 through her interest in the civil rights movement.And Mr. Buffett credits his first wife with being the proper parent for his children and for helping push him into philanthropy. (Mr. Buffett has pledged to give away 99 percent of his fortune.)\u201cThe part that I liked best is that they get to see Susie,\u201d he said of his first wife and the movie\u2019s prospective audience. \u201cWhat happened with me would not have happened without her.\u201dThough Mr. Buffett is an octogenarian and has battled prostate cancer (successfully), he insists that participating in the movie wasn\u2019t a way to cement his legacy.\u201cThis was not done because I think I\u2019m getting my last haircut next week,\u201d he said.\u201cAt 86, actuarially, I know what\u2019s in the books, but literally I get to do what I love, and it\u2019s easy for me,\u201d he added. \u201cI do not feel that my life is past its most interesting points.\u201dAn article on Monday about the documentary \u201cBecoming Warren Buffett\u201d described incorrectly the development of the book \u201cThe Snowball,\u201d a biography of Mr. Buffett. Although he cooperated with its author, Alice Schroeder, the book was not \u201cauthorized.\u201d Mr. Buffett had no editorial say in its content.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Aide Scaramucci Sells Investment Business to Chinese Consortium", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump has made no secret that he is willing to pick fights with China. Yet a financier with close ties to the president-elect said on Tuesday that he was selling his investment firm to a group led by a fast-growing Chinese conglomerate.The investor, Anthony Scaramucci, announced that he was selling his firm, SkyBridge Capital, to a consortium led by RON Transatlantic and HNA Capital of China. The deal paves the way for Mr. Scaramucci to join the Trump administration as a public liaison and adviser.Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Still, Richard W. Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and the chief White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, noted that upon joining the White House, Mr. Scaramucci must file a financial disclosure that requires a broad range for the sale price of SkyBridge.Mr. Scaramucci said last month that he was selling the firm, but he appeared to jump the gun on Tuesday. At a panel at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he told the audience that he had sold SkyBridge.But for several hours after Mr. Scaramucci spoke, SkyBridge was silent. \u201cI need a couple of more hours,\u201d he told reporters.During his panel, Mr. Scaramucci also confirmed that he would join the Trump administration as public liaison and intergovernmental affairs adviser, and he called Mr. Trump a \u201cgreat leader.\u201d He is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team.By selling SkyBridge and the SALT Conference, Mr. Scaramucci \u2014 Mooch to those who have traded backslaps with him \u2014 is parting ways with the businesses that made him one of Wall Street\u2019s most flamboyant salesmen.In Wall Street parlance, SkyBridge is primarily a fund of funds, buying stakes in hedge funds like those run by the billionaires Paul E. Singer and Daniel S. Loeb. Fund of funds have never been the sexiest business in finance, and are often criticized because investors essentially pay fees to the underlying hedge funds and to the managers like SkyBridge who invest in them.According to regulatory filings, SkyBridge managed about $9.2 billion in client money and advised on an additional $3.4 billion as of last year. Its senior management team will remain in place when the deal closes by the middle of this year, the filings said.SALT will be taken over by the SkyBridge employees who have managed the conference since its creation in 2009.\u201cIt has been an honor and privilege to help build SkyBridge and work alongside some of the most talented individuals in the asset-management industry who day in and day out demonstrate an unrelenting passion and commitment to helping our clients fulfill their long-term financial goals,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said in a statement.HNA Capital is a division of the HNA Group, which has grown from a Chinese airline into a sprawling business empire. Its holdings include the technology sales company Ingram Micro and a 25 percent stake in Hilton Worldwide.The deal is not expected to close until the second quarter of the year, several months after Mr. Scaramucci starts his White House position.Mr. Painter, the former White House ethics lawyer, said the lack of details in the sale announcement raised questions about whether it was a straight cash sale, or whether some of the proceeds were contingent on the firm\u2019s future performance. Such ties could create the potential for a conflict of interest, Mr. Painter said.\u201cIs it is a complete sale with no strings attached and no ability to go back?\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be a straight sale with no earnout.\u201dThe success of SkyBridge and SALT allowed Mr. Scaramucci and the firm to revive \u201cWall Street Week,\u201d a financial program that now runs on the Fox Business Network.While Mr. Scaramucci is selling SkyBridge, it is unclear whether he will retain his ownership stake in the Hunt & Fish Club, a Midtown Manhattan steakhouse.Matthew Goldstein and Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The peso fell to its lowest level ever.The new turmoil promises to make this year even more difficult for President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, whose approval ratings have already plunged below 25 percent.He returned from a golf vacation on Wednesday and appealed for unity as images ricocheted across social media of people carting away televisions from Walmarts and stealing snack foods from stalled delivery trucks.Protests continued on Thursday, as demonstrators blocked highways and gas stations. Scattered looting continued, and marches are planned for this weekend to demand a reversal of the price increases. The president\u2019s explanation that the gasoline increase of almost 20 percent was necessary to maintain economic stability did nothing to calm the outrage. \u201cEven in good times, it is a problematic decision\u201d to raise gasoline prices, Vidal Romero, a political analyst at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, said. \u201cAnd this is a very bad moment.\u201dOn Tuesday, Ford announced that it was canceling its planned investment to build a small-car plant in the state of San Luis Potos\u00ed. Although falling sales of small cars may have had more to do with Ford\u2019s decision than Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism on Twitter, the president-elect promised that the Ford episode was just \u201cthe beginning.\u201dAt the brief ceremony to announce Mr. Videgaray\u2019s return, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto seemed to address the upheaval caused by the gas prices as an afterthought. \u201cI repeat, it hasn\u2019t been easy to take this measure,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said. \u201cBut it is with a sense of responsibility to safeguard the stability of our economy.\u201dTalk of economic sobriety sits poorly with Mexicans, disgusted by a series of political scandals. \u201cThis is a government with a terrible record of corruption,\u201d Mr. Romero said. \u201cState, federal \u2014 everything smells of corruption.\u201dThe gas-price increase was approved last year by Congress as part of an austerity budget designed to insulate Mexico from the market uncertainties of Mr. Trump\u2019s rise. The government plans to let prices \u2014 which have long been controlled and subsidized \u2014 float by the end of the year. This should lead to competition, and eventually lower prices. \u201cThe incredible thing is that the government didn\u2019t expect the reaction,\u201d said Ignacio Marv\u00e1n, a political analyst at CIDE, a Mexico City university.Truck and taxi drivers have blocked highways since Sunday. Outbreaks of looting escalated into a wave on Wednesday. A Mexico City police officer was killed as he tried to stop looters.\u201cThey didn\u2019t take the measure of people\u2019s anger,\u201d said Graco Ram\u00edrez, the governor of the central state of Morelos and a member of the left-wing opposition. \u201cEverything is going to be more expensive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putting More Women on a Path to Political Power", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 About five decades since the surge in modern feminism, it is unlikely that most women \u2014 in the United States, at least \u2014 would have anticipated the current political climate in which gender equality remains almost as elusive as ever and long-ago-won rights are under siege.What is more, a man criticized by many for his treatment of women will be sworn in as president of the United States on Friday. And in 2016, a woman still could not be elected to the job.After the gamut of emotions engendered by Hillary Clinton\u2019s surprising loss to Donald J. Trump, women are once more confronting the big questions that have long enveloped the feminist quest. Put bluntly, is it sexism or the system that has so far prevented a woman from becoming president of the United States? And what lessons might be drawn from Europe, or places further afield, that could help an American woman get to the top one day?If the fight for women\u2019s rights has taught activists one thing, it is that simple questions have complex answers.Melanne Verveer, executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and former ambassador at large for global women\u2019s issues under President Obama, said that \u201cto just look at this election through the gender lens is not to understand it fully.\u201dThough many women saw Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, as the most qualified candidate, other women felt no tug to help one of their own shatter a glass ceiling and instead \u201creached a conclusion that they might be better off with a change,\u201d Ms. Verveer said.\u201cI think people would like to think there has to be one good explanation,\u201d said Shauna Lani Shames, an assistant professor of political science at Rutgers University-Camden in New Jersey. \u201cBut there is not. It\u2019s many.\u201d What she called the \u201cdeeply ingrained sexism\u201d of a country fond of cowboy myths and tales of the Wild West is one. There are others.For starters, look at how the United States chooses candidates.\u201cSelection is mostly about people self-recruiting,\u201d Dr. Shames said. \u201cYou have to self-identify as a candidate, and often win a primary before the party will take note of you.\u201d Just the expense and time away from family involved turn many women off, leaving a smaller pipeline.Even the basic act of asking for money \u2014 essential to any political bid in the United States \u2014 hurts women more, she argued: \u201cWomen hate it more than men do. Men tend to be in social circles where they can raise more money.\u201dMrs. Clinton was criticized last summer when her annual sojourn in the wealthy enclaves of the Hamptons became studded with fund-raisers. (Mr. Trump made his own round of fund-raisers there, to perhaps less attention.)In Europe, women can work their way up the ladder of their party, which tends to have a distinct ideological identity and is often subsidized by government funds from which all legal parties can benefit.In addition, Dr. Shames said, research has shown that the proportional representation that is a cornerstone of many European political systems is far more likely to get women elected to national legislatures.Europeans have also been much readier to adopt quotas to bolster women\u2019s part in politics. Americans steeped in individualism have been reluctant to legislate in this way. \u201cThe concept of quotas in the U.S., as you know, is antithetical to the American position and possibly the myth that holds that everyone pulls themselves up by their bootstraps,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers.Of course, Europeans have not always proved able to use quotas to the full advantage for women. In France, for example, where law dictates that 40 percent of candidates be female, parties, particularly conservative ones, have often preferred to pay fines rather than find the mandated number of women.Joanna Maycock is secretary general of the European Women\u2019s Lobby, which brings together about 2,500 women\u2019s groups from each of the 28 European Union nations, and from neighbors like Norway and aspiring members like Turkey and Serbia. She said she detected a change in attitudes since Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat that starkly highlighted the quirks of the American system, in particular the Electoral College. (The college affirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension to the presidency despite his loss of the popular vote.)Ms. Maycock cited a three-day workshop at the end of November that brought together about 25 American and European activists examining how to get more women into politics. \u201cWhen we planned it, we thought we would be celebrating Hillary\u2019s success,\u201d she said. Instead, the meeting reflected \u201cthe shock of Trump.\u201d\u201cA lot of the American participants were so horrified and shocked, there was a big difference,\u201d she said, a readiness to explore other methods and reinforce the need to train women in public speaking, fund-raising and building networks. Ms. Walsh\u2019s center at Rutgers runs nonpartisan campaign training in New Jersey and assists in such training in 17 other states. She reported a \u201cdramatic increase\u201d in women\u2019s signing up.\u201cWomen are seeking a way to have a voice,\u201d Ms. Walsh said. \u201cThis election has made citizens \u2014 men and women \u2014 see things through the gender blend.\u201d She added that women \u201ccan have an enormous impact on their lives, families, identities\u201d and that \u201cthey can\u2019t sit on the sidelines; they have to figure out a way to get engaged.\u201dIn modern Europe, the trail to the top was blazed by the somewhat unlikely figure of Margaret Thatcher, who was the first woman elected as prime minister in Britain in 1979.(Theresa May is now the second, with the tough task of negotiating the country\u2019s exit from the European Union.)Mrs. Thatcher had no outright feminist agenda and stood accused of fomenting social hardship with her conservative policies and iron will, for instance, to break Britain\u2019s trade unions.Close to 40 years later, similar policies of austerity are associated with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, often called the world\u2019s most powerful woman after 11 years in office. Her unwillingness to loosen Europe\u2019s purse strings while Germany, Europe\u2019s No. 1 economy, benefits substantially from the euro currency, makes her anything but a heroine in many feminist eyes.\u201cThe obsession with austerity across Europe has been really bad,\u201d Ms. Maycock said. It hits women doubly, she argued, cutting public service jobs often held by women and leaving them bereft of the infrastructure \u2014 care for children and seniors, for instance \u2014 that enables them to work.Over the past decade, Ms. Maycock contended, austerity has been a big brake on women\u2019s empowerment. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually stopped progressing, more or less,\u201d she said, citing a gender inequality index compiled by her group that showed 51.5 percent progress toward full equality 10 years ago, compared with 52.5 percent now.In general, she said, European countries with quotas tend to show an effect once the female membership of legislatures passes one-third, she said. Over all in Europe, women account for about one-quarter of legislators, she said.The range is large: In Poland, for instance, a female prime minister, Beata Szydlo, is among 27 percent of female lawmakers in the lower house of Parliament after the 2015 elections introduced a quota system. But the upper house, which has no such mechanism, is only 13 percent women.Norway, one of the first European countries to adopt quotas, has had two female prime ministers and a female defense minister, mandates 40 percent female board membership in business.Ms. Maycock pointed to recently elected female mayors in Paris, Barcelona, Madrid and Rome as more examples of women\u2019s getting power where it matters.But in the United States, Dr. Shames said, women are far more likely to be city council members than mayors and state legislators than governors.On both sides of the Atlantic, women still have important territory to take: While France has had a female defense minister, and Germany currently has one \u2014 Ursula von der Leyen, a married mother of seven \u2014 neither Britain nor the United States has entrusted defense to a woman.American finance, too, has remained firmly in the hands of men, on Wall Street as at the Treasury.And 2016 shocked many not just with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat \u2014 but with the triumph of Mr. Trump, despite accusations of misogyny, and with the murder of Jo Cox, a Labour Party legislator, who was stabbed by a man reportedly shouting \u201cBritain First\u201d days before the country voted to leave the European Union, which Ms. Cox opposed.In democracies from Australia through the United States and Europe, the thin pipeline of women ready to step up to the top in politics (and business) is an added cause for concern.In the United States, there are just five female governors right now, and 21 women in the Senate, Ms. Walsh said. \u201cThe bench is very small, and the potential pool of candidates is really very small,\u201d she said, noting that most modern presidents (if not Mr. Trump) have been governors or senators first.That makes it doubly significant that more women are expressing an interest in entering politics after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat, she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of women who have served as defense minister in France. The country has had one female defense minister, not none.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greubel Forsey Watches: A Division of Labor", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 For Stephen Forsey, the Grand Sonnerie that he and Robert Greubel are presenting this week at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva reflects the 30 years that each man has spent in watchmaking.After all, the piece took them 11 of those years to make.\u201cIt sounds like one of the very best pocket watches from the past, but in a wristwatch,\u201d Mr. Forsey, the co-founder of Greubel Forsey, said during an interview in London last month.The timepiece has 935 parts packed into a titanium case 1.7 inches by 0.6 inches, with visible hammers and gongs on the dial, an hour and quarter striking mechanism, minute repeater, inclined tourbillon \u2014 and a price tag of 1.15 million Swiss francs, or about $1.12 million, before taxes.\u201cWe push each other forward all the time,\u201d Mr. Forsey of his partnership with Mr. Greubel, which began in 1992. Previously he worked on prototypes for IWC, while Mr. Forsey restored Asprey watches.As a team, they first worked at Renaud & Papi, now part of Audemars Piguet, and then began their own business in 2004. Since then, they have won awards from the Grand Prix d\u2019Horlogerie de Gen\u00e8ve, worked with Harry Winston on its Opus 6 timepiece and secured investment from the Swiss luxury giant Richemont.Their different backgrounds gave them a substantial start, Mr. Forsey said.\u201cWe analyzed what had existed historically in watchmaking \u2014 because Robert had a strong background of French watchmaking, and I had a background of English watchmaking and we were working in Switzerland \u2014 so we were able to pull together our different experiences and drew up what we really wanted it to do: to bring something new, yet safeguard skills,\u201d he added.An example is the timepiece Mr. Forsey usually wears, a Quanti\u00e8me Perp\u00e9tuel \u00e0 \u00c9quation, which integrated a perpetual calendar with season, solstice and equinox indicators. He said they had worked on the watch for eight years, \u201cso there\u2019s a lot of toil in there.\u201dFor Mr. Forsey, defining clear roles for the two has been crucial to the company\u2019s success.\u201cRobert oversees the creative side and, as he also has strong experience on the management side, he oversees the management strategy and finance, while I oversee the technical side with the team,\u201d he said.\u201cWe can do more with two,\u201d he continued, as \u201cwe always have a sounding board, which is crucial when we are working confidentially on something. Whereas if we were just on our own we would only have our own intuition and vision, and at some point we could go wrong. Whereas as two, we are stronger.\u201dAnd faster. \u201cIt\u2019s quicker to define the specification of what we want a new piece to do, so we can move forward more efficiently,\u201d he said.Having two watchmakers at the helm \u2014 rather than the more common team of a watchmaker and a commercial specialist \u2014 has led them to focus on design rather than finances, Mr. Forsey said. And it has affected the way they have developed the company, he added, referring to their decision to resist retailers\u2019 calls in 2007 for an entry-level watch \u201cbecause we didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the idea.\u201dGreubel Forsey\u2019s workshop in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, a 17th-century farmhouse and a glass atelier, plays a practical and inspirational role in the business, too.The glass facade helps keep the building\u2019s temperature consistent, important for watchmaking, while the glass interior walls create an open space, designed, Mr. Forsey said, to encourage interaction among the teams. \u201cWe wanted a more human living space than a pure office, as we are always encouraging our people to give extra and engage in the whole company,\u201d he said.Mr. Forsey\u2019s office is in the farmhouse, while Mr. Greubel works from his office in Le Locle, a 15-minute drive away, so they meet regularly but it can be a little as once a week. \u201cIt gives us freedom,\u201d Mr. Forsey said. \u201cWe know we have parameters. For creation, you need a certain tranquillity and need your own environment to be able to create.\u201dCollaborations have been a large part of that environment. After Richemont took a 20 percent stake in the company in 2006, Greubel Forsey called on Richemont project managers to supervise the farmhouse restoration and atelier construction as, Mr. Forsey said, \u201cwe are not builders.\u201d They also worked with the sculptor Willard Wigan to incorporate his work into their 2012 Art Piece 1, which, Mr. Forsey said, introduced contemporary and fine art collectors to the brand.The business has grown steadily while limiting its output and adding only five to 10 employees per year, which permits the duo to shift focus quickly.After the 2008 global downturn, for example, \u201covernight we were able to shift the focus from North America, which fell into stagnation for six months, and were able to put more focus back to Asia and other regions where we had been working but hadn\u2019t been able to supply them, because America had been very strong,\u201d Mr. Forsey said.Expanding their market across Japan now is high on the agenda, following the opening last August in Tokyo of the first Greubel Forsey Gallery. Archive watches are on display, with only one piece for sale (Mr. Forsey declined to say which one).\u201cWe know we have a small number of collectors but no representative close to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult because it\u2019s such a different, unique culture and they need reassurance that we\u2019re a long-term, serious player.\u201dAlso, the company wants to bring all of its watchmaking functions in-house. Ninety percent of its work is done there now, but, as Mr. Forsey said, a problem with a supplier\u2019s component could mean a watch would not be delivered, \u201cwhich puts an immediate stress on our whole structure because we are small, independent and only have our means.\u201dIt\u2019s part of what Mr. Forsey described as the business\u2019s most important goals: \u201cTo stay authentic to what we do and to maintain our path.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Issues of Riches Trip Up Steven Mnuchin and Other Nominees", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byDuring five hours of contentious questioning, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee pressed Mr. Mnuchin to explain how he could fail to disclose $95 million of real estate assets, including property in New York, Los Angeles and Mexico, on his initial committee ethics questionnaire. The former Goldman Sachs banker also did not initially disclose that he is the director of Dune Capital International, an investment fund incorporated on the Cayman Islands, an offshore tax haven. And he belatedly disclosed that his children own nearly $1 million in artwork.Such problems of fabulous wealth seem almost part and parcel to the confirmation struggles of a Trump government that would be filled with billionaires and multimillionaires. Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, admitted this week that he had fired an undocumented immigrant \u2014 one of the \u201cdozen or so\u201d housekeepers the billionaire investor employs.Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to be White House budget director, Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, admitted paying back taxes of more than $15,000 for a household employee whose payroll taxes he had not paid, and his choice for health secretary, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, spent much of his confirmation hearing defending stock trades that might have been impacted by his legislating.But in a Washington where the tone is set by an incoming president who has refused to disclose his tax returns, it is not clear that any ethics question could actually derail a nominee, even ones that have caused problems in the past.During his prickly hearing, Mr. Mnuchin played down his omissions as innocent errors that were the products of cumbersome government bureaucracy.\u201cI think as you all can appreciate, filling out these government forms is quite complicated,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said when asked about the omissions, noting that he had handed over 5,000 pages of disclosures. \u201cLet me first say, any oversight, it was unintentional.\u201dDemocrats were unsatisfied with the response, assailing Mr. Mnuchin for the lapse and wondering what he was hiding.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to understand the words, \u2018list all positions,\u2019\u201d said Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey.Past nominees have stepped aside after such revelations. In 2009, Tom Daschle, President Obama\u2019s pick for health secretary, withdrew after it emerged that he owed more than $100,000 in back taxes on the use of a limousine and chauffeur. Only weeks before, the nomination of Timothy F. Geithner, Mr. Obama\u2019s first Treasury secretary, nearly came undone for his failure to pay some payroll taxes while at the International Monetary Fund.At the dawn of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, the employment of undocumented immigrant nannies deprived both Kimba Wood and Zo\u00eb Baird of the chance to become the first female attorneys general.But such missteps might not matter these days. Just as Mr. Trump shrugged off the long-established practices of releasing tax returns, divesting assets that could create conflicts of interest and disclosing medical records, his cabinet picks might choose to muscle through.\u201cIf Trump\u2019s nominees can\u2019t get their ethics disclosures right now, how can we trust them when they are in office?\u201d asked Norman Eisen, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who advised the Obama administration on government ethics.It appears that ethics concerns will continue to swirl around the Trump administration. Three Democratic senators on Thursday sent a letter to Mr. Mnuchin about reports that Anthony Scaramucci, a wealthy financier whom Mr. Trump appointed to be White House director of engagement and intergovernmental affairs, was holding talks with the head of the sanctioned Russian investment fund at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. The Russian fund has been under Treasury Department sanctions since 2015.\u201cThis raises questions about whether Mr. Scaramucci engaged in discussions to facilitate prohibited transactions with the sanctioned entity in violation of federal law, and about whether other Trump administration transition officials were aware of or approved his activities,\u201d they wrote, calling on Mr. Mnuchin to investigate the matter if he is confirmed.Mr. Mnuchin did not shy away from controversies surrounding his business record, forcefully defending his use of offshore tax havens as a hedge fund manager and rejecting accusations that he was churning out foreclosures when he was chief executive of One West Bank during the financial crisis.This week progressive groups launched television advertisements painting him as a cruel predatory lender, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, hosted a \u201cshadow hearing\u201d featuring people who felt victimized by the bank.But Mr. Mnuchin went on the offensive, dismissing such accusations in his opening statement.\u201cSince I was first nominated to serve as Treasury secretary, I have been maligned as taking advantage of others\u2019 hardships in order to earn a buck,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth.\u201dMr. Mnuchin spent a good part of the five-hour hearing fending off charges that One West had been overly aggressive in foreclosing on tens of thousands of borrowers, many of them elderly. Mr. Mnuchin said the remnants of IndyMac, which he and a group of wealthy investors bought from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was sitting on a mountain of troubled mortgages. He said the bank did its best to try to modify loans and keep borrowers in their homes but conceded that OneWest had made mistakes, such as foreclosing on some military families.Mr. Mnuchin expressed remorse for not being able to help more homeowners who struggled during the collapse of the housing market, especially one, a minor celebrity.\u201cThe most troubling loan we had was actually to the Octomom,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, referring to a woman who gave birth to octuplets and became a reality television star. \u201cThat was a terrible situation, and we worked very, very hard to move her to another home that they could afford.\u201dTo many Democrats, the actions of One West during the housing and financial crisis were too much. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, announced his opposition to Mr. Mnuchin hours after the hearing ended.\u201cMr. Mnuchin\u2019s cozy ties to Wall Street raise serious red flags that demand serious answers,\u201d Mr. Brown said in a statement.When Mr. Mnuchin was pressed on whether he was helping rich clients avoid paying taxes by setting up shop in the Cayman Islands, he insisted that he had paid all the taxes that he owed and that he was following the law.\u201cI did not use a Cayman Islands entity in any way to avoid paying taxes for myself,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cI would love to work with the I.R.S. to close these tax issues that make no sense.\u201dThat did not go over well with Democrats.\u201cOne does not go and create offshore entities at the end of the day other than to avoid, in some form or fashion, the tax laws of the United States. That\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d Mr. Menendez said.Although Republicans have been sticklers about ethics when out of power, they showed little concern about Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s failure to make disclosures. The Finance Committee in particular has prided itself on its bipartisanship when it comes to the rigorous vetting of nominees, but on Thursday, that was hardly in evidence.Republican senators praised Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s credentials, showed appreciation for his willingness to sacrifice his business career and apologized for the length and tone of the hearing.\u201cObjectively speaking, I don\u2019t believe anyone can reasonably argue that Mr. Mnuchin is unqualified for the position,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah.\u201cYou\u2019ve been assaulted by innuendo,\u201d Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, told Mr. Mnuchin.The only time Mr. Mnuchin appeared to be at a loss for words was when he was peppered with questions about the ethics of Mr. Trump.Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, grilled Mr. Mnuchin about how Americans could be sure that debt the Trump Organization owed to foreign interests would not influence Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. She also mocked the idea that the president-elect was appointing an independent ethics officer to ensure he would have nothing to do with his business empire, asking Mr. Mnuchin what authority a person that Mr. Trump could hire and fire would have to keep him honest.\u201cIt\u2019s a good question,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Carl Hulse, Matthew Goldstein and Katie Thomas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Financial Mystery Emerges. Its Name? Steven T. Mnuchin Inc.", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported bySteven T. Mnuchin plans to divest himself of his financial interests in 43 companies, hedge funds and investment funds and resign from numerous board positions as he tries to disentangle himself from potential conflicts of interest before his confirmation as the next Treasury secretary.But Mr. Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs executive, intends to retain control of one of his oldest companies \u2014 one named after himself.In an ethics statement and a 42-page financial disclosure form filed on Wednesday with the Office of Government Ethics, Mr. Mnuchin said without elaboration that he would retain his \u201cunpaid position\u201d as president of Steven T. Mnuchin Inc., a company he said is used to manage some of his investments.The financial disclosure statement did not say what investments the company manages, nor did it ascribe a value to any of those investments. But Mr. Mnuchin said he would \u201cnot participate personally and substantially in any particular matter\u201d that could have a \u201cdirect and predictable effect on the financial interests\u201d of the little-known entity.The form does confirm that Mr. Mnuchin, 53, is a very wealthy man.Among the investments and funds he intends to divest himself of are interests in his lucrative movie production businesses and a number of real estate investment funds. They also include investments in several hedge funds, including one managed by John Paulson. President-elect Donald J. Trump has reported having money, as of May 2016, with Mr. Paulson, who was a donor and is an economic adviser to Mr. Trump.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s confirmation hearing has not been scheduled. Four other hearings have been delayed by Republicans amid concerns by Democrats about having enough time to fully review background information on the nominees.Julia Lawless, a spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee, said the office would review the documents submitted by Mr. Mnuchin. \u201cFinance Committee hearings are announced seven days in advance, and we will announce the details as soon as soon as they become available,\u201d she said.Norman L. Eisen, a former special counsel for ethics and government reform under President Obama, said the Treasury secretary nominee\u2019s retention of Steven T. Mnuchin Inc. \u201craises some obvious ethics concerns\u201d that should be discussed at his hearing.\u201cThat is what these hearings are for,\u201d Mr. Eisen said. \u201cCan the nominee, and will he, recuse fully from this entity and anything related to it, including the investments it holds?\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Mnuchin did not respond to requests for comment.As he sheds assets, Mr. Mnuchin suggested in his filing that he might try to take advantage of a benefit that allows certain federal employees to defer paying capital gains taxes on certain assets that they sell to avoid conflicts. The allowance is intended to encourage government service and must be granted by the Office of Government Ethics.Other potential members of the wealthiest cabinet in modern American history \u2014 including Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the commerce secretary nominee; Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of education; and Andrew F. Puzder, his choice to be secretary of labor \u2014 have yet to file their ethics plans and financial disclosures.In his ethics disclosure, the twice-divorced Mr. Mnuchin said he would also disclose the assets of his fianc\u00e9e, Louise Linton. She is a Scottish actress whose memoir, \u201cIn Congo\u2019s Shadow\u201d \u2014 described as \u201cone girl\u2019s perilous journey in the heart of Africa\u201d \u2014 was criticized by the Zambian government, which accused her of falsifying events.Mr. Mnuchin spent much of the last decade in California, first as the chief executive of a bank and later as a Hollywood financier, and much of the disclosure is related to his various investments during this time.He led a group of investors who bought IndyMac, a bankrupt housing lender, from the government in 2009 and restructured it under the name OneWest. In 2015, the CIT Group completed its $3.4 billion acquisition of OneWest, resulting in a remarkable profit for Mr. Mnuchin and other investors. He stepped down from the helm of OneWest in March, just before Mr. Trump tapped him to raise funds for his presidential campaign.The filing is somewhat backward looking. For example, it outlined that during his time at CIT Bank, Mr. Mnuchin made at least $40 million, but the data is attributable only to his position before the merger\u2019s close in 2015, according to footnotes in the documents. In a regulatory filing in February, Mr. Mnuchin disclosed that he controlled shares in CIT valued at about $67 million based on today\u2019s price of the stock. The discrepancy is partly because he received shares when CIT bought OneWest.In the deal to buy the remnants of OneWest from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Mr. Paulson\u2019s hedge fund was one of the main investors with Mr. Mnuchin and his former boss, George Soros, a billionaire investor. It is not known when Mr. Mnuchin first invested with Mr. Paulson, who is known for making a $15 billion wager on the collapse of the United States housing market during the 2008 financial crisis.Mr. Paulson, Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin have one investment interest in common: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two mortgage finance giants that were bailed out by the federal government during the financial crisis. Mr. Paulson, like some other hedge fund managers, has made a big bet that the federal government will eventually privatize Fannie and Freddie.What seemed like an off-the-cuff comment sent the shares of the two companies surging.Sarah Cohen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Betsy DeVos Won\u2019t Shed Stake in Biofeedback Company, Filings Show", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byBetsy DeVos, the billionaire school choice advocate selected by President Donald J. Trump to serve as education secretary, is a strong supporter of using biofeedback technology to help children and teenagers enhance their performance in school.Ms. DeVos and her husband, Richard DeVos Jr., are major financial backers of Neurocore, a Michigan company that operates drug-free \u201cbrain performance centers\u201d that claim to have worked with 10,000 children and adults to overcome problems with attention deficit disorder, autism, sleeplessness and stress.In an agreement with the Office of Government Ethics made public Friday, Ms. DeVos said that she had stepped down from the Neurocore board but that she would retain her financial interest in the company. She valued that stake at $5 million to $25 million in her financial disclosure statement.On Friday evening, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said he would delay the initial vote on Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination by a week, until Jan. 31, as Democrats argued that the process had been rushed through, without enough time to answer remaining questions about her financial disclosures.But the claims that Neurocore\u2019s methods can help children improve their performance in school could present a conflict for Ms. DeVos if she is confirmed as education secretary \u2014 especially given that the company is moving to expand its national reach.Neurocore, founded about a decade ago, operates seven of the brain performance centers in Michigan and recently opened two in Florida. It has said it has plans to open as many as seven other centers across the country this year. Ms. DeVos\u2019s financial disclosure shows that she and her husband have an indirect interest in the company through a family partnership.Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics adviser under President George W. Bush, said he was familiar with Neurocore and applauded the business and education concepts behind it \u2014 but he said the DeVoses would be better off selling their interests in the company.\u201cThis is not an appropriate investment for the secretary of education,\u201d Mr. Painter said in an email. \u201cHow schools respond to attention issues is a vitally important policy question and ties right into achievement. In my view, there should be support, including financial support, for alternatives to A.D.H.D. drug treatments that are covered by health insurance whereas alternatives often are not covered.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe secretary would be barred from participating in that important policy decision if she or her husband owned an interest in this company.\u201dIn her agreement with the ethics office, Ms. DeVos said she would \u201cnot participate personally and substantially in any particular matter\u201d that could benefit Neurocore and seven family businesses in which she would continue to have a financial interest.Ms. DeVos\u2019s financial holdings may be the most complex by any of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees. At 108 pages, her financial disclosure form is longer than the one Mr. Trump himself filed last year.She and her husband, according to the disclosure filing, have $583 million to $1.5 billion in assets.The size of the family\u2019s wealth is no surprise. Mr. DeVos\u2019s father founded Amway, a multilevel marketing firm that specializes in selling health and beauty aids and had over $9 billion in sales in 2015. Richard DeVos Sr. is the 88th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes magazine.The DeVoses\u2019 financial holdings include a minority stake in Major League Baseball\u2019s Chicago Cubs and an interest in the N.B.A.\u2019s Orlando Magic, as well as an array of private equity firms and real estate entities.In her filing, Ms. DeVos said she also had a financial interest in Theranos, the embattled blood-testing firm that was once a darling of Silicon Valley but was forced to close its laboratories and lay off 40 percent of its workers after a series of articles in The Wall Street Journal raised questions about its technology.Ms. DeVos, in her filing, said that within 90 days of being confirmed, she would divest herself of her financial interest in 102 companies and investment funds.Neurocore, however, appears to be an investment that Ms. DeVos and her husband have a particular interest in.The company\u2019s website claims impressive outcomes: for example, that 90 percent of people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder report improvement and 76 percent \u201cachieve a nonclinical status.\u201d But Neurocore has not published results in the peer-reviewed literature.A year ago, the company hired Dr. Majid Fotuhi, a physician and neuroscientist trained at Harvard and Johns Hopkins University, as its chief medical officer. He said Neurocore had recently begun analyzing its data and results would be published soon in a scientific journal.Dr. Fotuhi said that Neurocore had no immediate plans to team up with schools but that he could envision that happening.\u201cBetsy DeVos really believes in improving brain performance and helping children who have syndromes such as attention deficit disorder,\u201d he said.On its website, Neurocore claims to use \u201cdata-driven, brain-based diagnostics and treatments\u201d to help children and adults. The company says it uses \u201cdata from quantitative electroencephalography\u201d to help diagnose problems and then treats them with \u201cproven neurofeedback therapy.\u201dNeurocore, which charges about $2,000 for a recommended treatment of 30 sessions, has a deal with Prosper Funding, an online lending platform, to provide financing to clients. Neurocore also says that some insurance plans may cover treatments.In its marketing materials, Neurocore makes a direct pitch to parents, featuring the personal stories of numerous children in YouTube videos and offering tips on Twitter about helping students focus at school.Still, Dr. Fotuhi expressed confidence in the field. \u201cIt\u2019s in its infancy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I can envision in the coming years, we\u2019ll have objective data.\u201dAn article on Saturday about financial disclosures of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary nominee, misstated the name of the Michigan publication that reported on one company, Neurocore, that Ms. DeVos and her husband back. It is MiBiz, not West Michigan Business News and Information.Sarah Cohen and Kate Zernike contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Tuition Plan Stands to Help Students Make \u2018the Last Mile\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byOne of 11 siblings and the first who would graduate from college, Mr. Abreu, 22, already gets financial aid. But it is never enough, so he has worked as a student assistant. He has tutored students. He has sold clothing at Forever 21 at the Crossgates Mall. But he never takes anything for granted.\u201cWe are always trying to see how much I need to fill the gap,\u201d said Mr. Abreu, a computer science major, who is president of the student association.\u201cThis could really be a game changer,\u201d said Kristin G. Esterberg, the president of SUNY Potsdam, near the Canadian border, which serves students predominantly from low-income families.\u201cThere\u2019s a significant number of potential students \u2014 folks who live in the North Country \u2014 who just think that college is not for them, and find the thicket of financial aid guidelines daunting,\u201d she added.For the poorest students, whose families make less than $30,000 a year, federal Pell grants, which top out at $5,775 per year, already pay for a large portion of tuition costs.As broadly envisioned, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s plan, called the Excelsior Scholarship, would be aimed at students and their families who made an adjusted gross income between $55,000 and $125,000 a year, said Jim Malatras, the director of state operations.After verifying whether applicants had received federal and state aid or other money, the scholarship program would help eligible families make \u201cthe last mile,\u201d Mr. Malatras said.And those making more could actually be eligible for bigger awards, because less of their need might be met by other forms of aid. Each instance would be different, based on family composition and other factors, but it is not inconceivable that a family making $55,000 could receive an award of $800, Mr. Malatras said, and a family making $65,000 could get $4,000.\u201cIt\u2019s a sliding scale,\u201d he said.The New York State tuition plan could be the first to apply to four-year public colleges. But its operations and financing still need to be fleshed out and approved by the State Legislature.Others say the $163 million estimated cost of the program, for a potential pool of 200,000 students, is far too low.But Mr. Malatras said the state would not decrease funding to the tuition assistance program.Gail O. Mellow, the president of LaGuardia Community College, stressed that for financially struggling students, even a few hundred dollars could make a difference. After Hurricane Sandy, she recalled, she met students who had lost weeks\u2019 worth of groceries when the power went out and food in their refrigerators spoiled. Replacing the food meant they could not pay tuition for the next semester.At CUNY\u2019s Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, which serves a sizable number of Caribbean immigrants, Rudolph F. Crew, the school\u2019s president, said roughly 40 percent of students needed $500 to $1,000 to finish their degrees and graduate. So the governor\u2019s proposal could mean \u201cone less thing to worry about\u201d at his school.\u201cThis is a game of margin for them,\u201d said Dr. Crew, a former chancellor of New York City\u2019s public schools.At rural SUNY Potsdam, Dr. Esterberg said, 200 to 300 of the 4,000 undergraduates are delayed in registering each year because they owe the school money. The students are often short $600 or $700.\u201cFor many of our students, it really is the difference between coming back to school in the spring or stopping out for a semester, and once they stop out the chances of them coming back are just not as good,\u201d Dr. Esterberg said.About 10 percent of his tuition is covered by government assistance; the rest is on his family. So he has typically worked about 25 hours a week, first as a cashier at Nathan\u2019s but more recently as a nursing assistant at Huntington Hospital, to pay for school.If he qualifies for an Excelsior Scholarship, however, Mr. Correia could stop worrying about how to fit together his work and class time. \u201cEach semester you have to rework your work schedule,\u201d he said. He added, dryly, \u201cThat\u2019s always fun.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eyeing Emergency Exits From Mergers in Anxious Times", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe merger escape hatch may be about to open.Surprises are inevitable, especially as the merger cycle turns downward. Abbott is crying MAC after Alere unexpectedly delayed filing financial statements, revealed billing-practice and bribery investigations and revised its financial results. A gigantic hack of email users at Yahoo is shaking Verizon Communications\u2019 desire to complete its $4.8 billion takeover of the internet firm\u2019s core business.That suggests conditions are ripe for beefier MAC clauses. Buyers may get the gumption to balk at typical exemptions, including certain changes in regulation, from the definition of a material adverse change, hoping to cover any Trump-era bombshells. They also could press harder to enforce the clauses. Judges are sounding more in the mood to oblige.Justice E. Leo Strine Jr. of Delaware Supreme Court ruled as a lower court judge in 2001 that the poultry producer Tyson Foods couldn\u2019t jilt the meatpacker IBP just because IBP reported two bad quarters and a subsidiary was shaky. In a landmark opinion, he defined MACs as \u201cunknown events that substantially threaten the overall earnings potential of the target in a durationally significant manner,\u201d a standard so high it has never been met.Often forgotten, though, is that Mr. Strine said he was \u201cconfessedly torn about the correct outcome.\u201d He ruled against Tyson largely because it had signed the deal knowing of IBP\u2019s cyclical business and troubled division, and was merely suffering from \u201cbuyer\u2019s regret.\u201dBut two bad quarters might be far less \u201cdurationally significant\u201d to a corporate buyer like Tyson than to, say, a private equity firm that expects to recoup its investment within a few years. That\u2019s especially true if the poor financial results were serious enough to jeopardize financing for the acquisition.Courts also seem more willing to read MAC clauses broadly. In 2013, Apollo Tyres of India argued it could walk away from its $2.5 billion deal to buy Cooper Tire and Rubber because labor troubles at a Chinese division prevented the target from delivering required financial information.Cooper argued that a MAC carve-out shifted the risk of any labor unrest to Apollo. While conceding that was true, a Delaware judge said the escape clause still covered anything, presumably including a labor dispute, that could \u201creasonably be expected\u201d to prevent Cooper from performing under the merger agreement. Besides, Cooper had breached its promise to sustain normal operations at the Chinese subsidiary. On that basis alone, the judge allowed Apollo to bail.The judiciary aside, MAC clauses are most useful as leverage in renegotiating terms. The buyout firm Cerberus and a partner, Chatham Lodging Trusts, were able to shave nearly 10 percent off the $1.1 billion price for Innkeepers in 2011 by invoking a material adverse change. A similar tactic may play out in Verizon\u2019s courtship of Yahoo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade in the Trump Era: The \u2018Politics of Resentment\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported byI want to talk to you about the Trump postglobalization era, if there is such a thing. You were inspired by a protester in Georgetown who was worried about the sweatshops that created the sweatshirts at Georgetown. Your sense was that the protesters \u201cdidn\u2019t get it.\u201d What might U.S. voters not have gotten about trade and globalization?I actually think they probably got a great deal right. I started working on this book in 1999, and there were a certain set of concerns there regarding sweatshops and labor abuses and so forth. [In mid-December], Georgetown students again occupied the university president\u2019s office over the same issue.So there\u2019s the human cost abroad, and then there is a human cost in the United States. If you talk to the students who are protesting at the president\u2019s office, they are concerned about workers in Vietnam, and if you talk to some of the workers in Pennsylvania, they are more concerned about economic conditions here. But if you join these two forces together, a population that contains both Bernie Sanders supporters and Donald Trump supporters, politically we\u2019re talking bigger numbers now. It\u2019s a more important political phenomenon.Do these two camps recognize each other as kindred spirits?There\u2019s a lot of space in between those two groups that hampers dialogue, but what\u2019s critical is that if you look at the sentiments that were expressed about trade in this past election season, there was an awful lot of convergence across the spectrum. This isn\u2019t a Trump thing. If you look at the U.S. economy, we are actually one of the least trade-dependent countries in the world. I think we\u2019re ranked seventh from the bottom.Because of the size of our domestic market?Because of the size of the market, the diversity of the productive assets that we have. You have a country that has relatively low trade exposure, but if you look at the polling and opinion data, we are among the most negative about trade. You look at Europe for example, they have lost the same kinds of jobs as we have, they\u2019re less protected. Yet, politically, they aren\u2019t as opposed.If I\u2019ve got people in Germany who have lost their low-end manufacturing jobs, then why are they more in favor than we are? I think it has to do with safety nets and institutions that eliminate some of the costs associated with churn. What you have in the United States is a quite rational response to the failure of policy to deal with these dislocations. If I have easily portable health insurance, if I have retraining, if I have mechanisms that facilitate search and relocation, if I have these things in place to ease these transitions, then I\u2019m not going to be so opposed.I\u2019m not sure they don\u2019t get it. They might get it just fine. Now that doesn\u2019t address the thing that many economists would say, which is that they are conflating the effects of automation and trade.You were inspired to write your book by the Seattle protests against the Doha Round, which was to produce a global trade agreement that depended on the World Trade Organization\u2019s authority, and you know the Doha Round has been moribund ever since. Do you think that multilateral trade agreements are now a thing of the past?I think it\u2019s going to be very difficult to move on these agreements, certainly in the United States, for a while. But the other thing that gets confounded is trade and trade agreements. You can be opposed to trade agreements and be in favor of trade.I\u2019m O.K. without a forward march on more trade agreements, especially given the openness of the U.S. economy. I don\u2019t think it will be a huge drag on trade itself.So let\u2019s say these movements on the right and the left, they halt trade agreements, not necessarily trade itself, but mechanization moves forward. Four years from now, the guy in Scranton, Pa., says, I still don\u2019t have a job. Where does the antitrade deal movement lead?It\u2019s not just that they don\u2019t have a job. There are mortality effects, health effects, there are opiate addiction effects. I\u2019m not optimistic about the ability of certain parts of the country to generate employment that matches up well with the human resources in those areas. Now that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m pessimistic over all, because if you look at certain regions that have been able to turn around, if you look at Pittsburgh, if you look at Charlotte, N.C., if you look at Birmingham, Ala., these aren\u2019t rural areas, but they are becoming postindustrial, and providing opportunities.So what is the difference between the Pennsylvania cities of Pittsburgh, Scranton and Wilkes-Barre? Pittsburgh is now a thriving, high-tech medical center, and Scranton and Wilkes-Barre have turned to President-elect Trump.There\u2019s this whole literature in economics over what they are calling network effects, which is just that we\u2019re all more valuable if we\u2019re together in one place. In Pittsburgh, there was an ignition switch that was largely related to health care and universities. In Charlotte, it was financial services. And in Birmingham, it was related to autos.You have to start with something.So what does that tell policy makers in areas that don\u2019t seem to have this network effect? Is it possible to implant something that begins to grow a network?That\u2019s a great question. The fact that you\u2019re talking about a 300-year-long trend in urbanization isn\u2019t going to give you an optimistic story. Even if you look at the urbanization from agriculture, we weren\u2019t able to come up with stuff to keep people in the cornfields.But you wrote about how cotton has remained king in the United States, in large part because of government policy. Does that mean you favor that?Here\u2019s where I think there\u2019s a lot of confusion. Cotton has succeeded because of its political influence, but it\u2019s cotton that has succeeded. It\u2019s not employment. There are no people in the cotton business. It\u2019s a lot easier to protect an industry than to protect employment in the industry.Should we do with manufacturing what we did with cotton, which actually accelerated mechanization? Most of us wouldn\u2019t say that is welfare enhancing.In your book, you say the importance of trade is overstated by opponents and proponents. Explain that.I was just having a conversation with one of the students who was occupying the president\u2019s office [in mid-December], and he is a left-leaning kid who has been caught up in a lot of social justice stuff. And he actually thinks global capitalism is evil. There\u2019s this idea of a faceless market force that is essentially profit seeking, and profit seeking is cost minimizing, and if you\u2019re minimizing cost, then there\u2019s this race-to-the-bottom logic where things like wages as well as environmental protections and labor protections all spiral downward. On the positive side, you get the argument of most economists, which says competitive markets mean better mousetraps will create more employment, and eventually more productivity and more consumption.In both cases, you have a machine, this market mechanism that is leading to outcomes, both negative and positive. What I tried to say in the book is, you know, if we actually look under the hood of this machine, I\u2019m not sure if it works the way you say it works.I spent a fair amount of time in China, and in Beijing there was a food street, a dumpling street. It looked like a perfectly competitive market. Whoever had the best dumplings at the best price should win. But fortunes did not rise and fall on how good your dumplings were. Through a variety of mechanisms, some guys were able to get a good spot. And that\u2019s my analogy. You\u2019re not really talking about a mechanism that necessarily generates the best mousetrap. There are ways to influence the rules and institutions.And today, that is what you\u2019re hearing in the so-called politics of resentment.Last year was the first time in modern history that global trade flows actually declined.If you start with the question, what kind of productive assets and people do we have to make things for the global economy, you\u2019re going to use what you\u2019ve got. In the United States, we have a lot of land and we have fancy machines. That\u2019s what comparative advantage is.But it results from two kinds of differences: differences in productive assets and differences in preferences. We sell China all of our chicken feet. They want them. We don\u2019t. If those differences go away, you lose the fundamental logic that drives trade. That\u2019s the way I see this in a longer-term frame.The homogenization of taste is going to be the doom of trade?That\u2019s certainly going to contribute. If you have convergence in both those things, you\u2019re going to have reductions in trade. That\u2019s not a bad thing.Donald Trump campaigned on getting good deals, keeping jobs in the United States, rebuilding our manufacturing. Does the political power structure in the United States have any way to actually reverse the course of economic history?A: No. But I think it\u2019s reversing itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For 5 Contest Finalists, a $20 Million Dash to the Moon", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byThe surface of the moon may soon be dotted with corporate logos, and its craters labeled with slogans. Families might be able to send their loved ones\u2019 ashes \u2014 or even their pets\u2019 remains \u2014 for lunar burial.Entrepreneurs hope that commercial ventures expand in lucrative ways in later years. In a farther, fanciful future, for example, the moon could be mined for platinum, a valuable metal, or helium-3, to be used as fuel for fusion energy reactors that do not yet exist.Private access to the moon grew a little closer to reality on Tuesday, when the X Prize Foundation, with prizes financed by Google, chose five teams of private entrepreneurs who say they can get to the moon by the end of this year.If any of them succeeds \u2014 the deadline has been pushed back several times \u2014 it could usher in an era of extraterrestrial commerce and renew interest in our long-ignored moon.\u201cIt\u2019s incentivized this whole business of the niche space economy,\u201d said Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, a senior director at the X Prize Foundation, which runs the contest.The X Prize Foundation was founded by Peter H. Diamandis, an entrepreneur who wanted to use competitions to encourage technological innovation in the way that aviation prizes in the early 20th century helped transform airplanes from a dangerous avocation of barnstormers to a commonplace mode of transportation.The first X Prize award of $10 million in 2004 went to the first private spaceship that could take people 62 miles up, into outer space. That led to the founding of Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic, which aims to take tourists to the edge of space for a few minutes of weightlessness.The foundation began a similar competition in 2007 to point attention to the moon. To win the top $20 million prize, a spacecraft must land on the moon, move 500 meters and send back video and photographs. The second team to accomplish the task wins $5 million. The contest also offers $5 million in bonus prizes, for feats like surviving the cold lunar night and traveling more than 5,000 meters on the surface.The next 11 months are a dash to finish team designs, assemble spacecraft and prepare for launching. And the teams differ on their approaches.Rahul Narayan, the leader of Team Indus, said the engineers had to develop their own computer, software, power system and other components when the initial approach of buying off-the-shelf satellite parts did not work out, increasing costs. Mr. Narayan now estimates the price tag at $70 million to $75 million.The Hakuto team, with a $10 million budget, is not building a lander at all, but hitching a ride for its rover with Team Indus. If Team Indus is the first to land on the moon, its rover and Hakuto\u2019s will race to travel the 500 meters to capture the $20 million prize. Both rovers have a top speed of about 4 inches a second.\u201cWe think that we can beat them on the moon,\u201d said Takeshi Hakamada, the leader of Hakuto (pronounced HOCK-tow).For SpaceIL and Synergy Moon, the main goal is not starting a business, but inspiring the next generation. \u201cKind of like Jacques Cousteau did with ocean exploration,\u201d said Kevin Myrick, a founder of Synergy Moon.Eran Privman, the chief executive of SpaceIL, said attracting the interest of venture capitalists would have been difficult for the company, because the return on investment would have been a couple of decades in the future. So instead of trying to be a profitable business, his team seeks to inspire children in Israel. \u201cJust like Apollo in the United States in the \u201960s,\u201d he said.Moon Express, based in Cape Canaveral, Fla., has followed a more conventional business path, soliciting investors. It is building a scaled-down lander to fit into a small, $5 million rocket called Electron, developed by a start-up company, Rocket Lab.It will carry a reflecting mirror experiment that bounces back laser beams from Earth, the same type of experiment that Apollo astronauts left behind on the moon. The lead scientist for the experiment, Douglas Currie, a retired physicist from the University of Maryland, was a key member of the Apollo laser experiments.SpaceIL and Moon Express are eschewing rovers. To fulfill the 500-meter requirement, both instead intend to have their landers lift off and land again.And the companies all still face challenges. Moon Express\u2019s ride, the Electron, has yet to launch even once. \u201cIt\u2019s not a blind bet,\u201d Mr. Richards said, but he conceded that it was also not a sure thing. Synergy Moon also plans to launch on an unproven rocket.Yet even some of teams that have dropped out have not given up.Astrobotic, which now plans to launch its spacecraft in 2019, has announced partnerships with DHL, the delivery company, and signed up customers for its trips including Elysium Space, which plans to offer the possibility of sending human remains to the moon. \u201cThe X Prize is not really the core driving thing anymore,\u201d said John Thornton, Astrobotic\u2019s chief executive.Robert Boehme, the leader of Part-Time scientists, said his team \u2014 which is backed by Audi, the carmaker \u2014 had a contract to launch in mid-2018. \u201cIt\u2019s too risky to try to accelerate it,\u201d he said.Its rover will have the four-ring Audi logo on the front and be called the Audi lunar quattro, echoing the name of one of Audi\u2019s cars.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the price of platinum.

Slavitt, acting director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, described the cloud database as \u201cnear historic.\u201d Largely because Medicaid information resides in so many state-level computing silos, Mr. Slavitt explained, \u201cwe\u2019ve never had a systemwide view across the program.\u201dHealth data on its own \u2014 billing, diagnostic and treatment information, typically recorded in arcane, shorthand codes \u2014 is not very useful. But if it can be aggregated and analyzed economically and quickly, that data is seen as a vital ingredient in transforming health care.The health care marketplace in the traditional fee-for-service model values volume. More doctor visits, hospital stays, operations and pills mean more revenue and profit for health care providers. But the push in recent years has been toward what is known as value-based health care. In the value model, medical groups are paid for outcomes: patients treated more efficiently and people who are healthier.But that transition only becomes possible with accurate, reliable data as the raw material for measuring outcomes and discovering what works and what does not. That is the reason for the excitement about and investment in health information technology, and the goal of the Medicaid work with Nuna. The data set will be stripped of identifying information before it is released to researchers.Ms. Kim, 35, a former Google product manager, has firsthand experience with Medicaid. Her brother, Kimong, who is a year younger, is severely autistic. When he was 8, Kimong started having monthly grand mal seizures, which are characterized by loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. The ambulance, hospital, doctor and therapy bills piled up. As a 9-year-old, Ms. Kim helped her Korean immigrant parents complete the Medicaid application forms.\u201cOur family would have gone bankrupt without Medicaid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt saved us.\u201dThe Medicaid system covers millions of working families, older people, children and people with disabilities. In fact, 40 percent of Medicaid spending goes to the disabled. Half of long-term care in America, mainly for older people, is through Medicaid. And nearly half of the children born in the United States are in the Medicaid system.The trouble with traditional health data warehouses, specialists say, is that they resemble digital vaults. It is difficult and time-consuming to get information in or out, and only people with specialized skills can use them.But the new cloud-based technology, using internet-era software, is flexible and interactive. It opens the door to real-time monitoring of emerging disease clusters, billing patterns and program effects. For example, did the percentage of low birth-weight babies decline after a Medicaid program was put in place? If so, how much?\u201cThis kind of data can help move health care policy from a partisan ideological debate to one informed by knowing who the people affected are and what will likely happen to Medicaid recipients,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research organization.\u201cHealth care is hard, and humility is important,\u201d Ms. Kim said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just put technology on something and assume it\u2019s going to work. You really have to understand the ecosystem in health care.\u201dThat government experience, Ms. Kim said, \u201cpaved the way\u201d for Nuna\u2019s work with Medicaid data. It demonstrated, she said, that internet technology and software methods could be applied to government health data from the mainframe era.Her brother is still on Medicaid, and caring for him is a family affair. Ms. Kim lives with her parents and Kimong in Hercules, Calif., in the Bay Area, about 10 miles north of Berkeley. When excited, Kimong waves his arms. When frustrated, he bangs his head against a wall. He can be loud and disruptive when he is anxious, and the family has been escorted off a few plane flights. \u201cHe\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Ms. Kim said.To relieve her parents, Ms. Kim takes Kimong with her to work some days. He can only say a few words, and one of them became the start-up\u2019s name \u2014 \u201cNuna,\u201d or \u201cbig sister\u201d in Korean.Nuna, founded in 2010, had only one full-time employee, Ms. Kim, until 2014, when it got an early round of venture financing. And no one was paid until then. David Chen, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief data officer, holds a Ph.D. in bioinformatics from Stanford University, but he also was a data scientist at Netflix for three years while Nuna was getting off the ground.Nuna is applying the technology and lessons learned from its Medicaid work to pursue business from private health plans, especially at large companies, to help them improve the efficiency and quality of care for workers.Ms. Kim expressed pride in her start-up\u2019s work, but also a sense of personal satisfaction. \u201cThis is my love letter to Medicaid for saving my family,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Backers Like His First Draft of a New America", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byMOUNT GILEAD, Ohio \u2014 The challenge Annette Cottrell pondered was how to grade President Trump\u2019s stormy first full week on the job. A trade war bubbling up with Mexico. A divisive border wall. A ban on refugees from war-torn countries. Brawls with the news media and national parks.So, about that head-spinning week. Mr. Trump drew a torrent of criticism after pressing a series of falsehoods about voter fraud, the size of the crowd at his inauguration and his attacks on the intelligence community. His rapid-fire executive actions reversing years of policy on immigration, abortion and the environment left his critics seething and fearful and liberal opponents preparing a volley of legal challenges to blunt them.But in more than two dozen interviews this week, voters who helped hand Mr. Trump the presidency \u2014 die-hards and reluctant supporters alike \u2014 were cheering from their living rooms, offices and diners across America as they saw the outlines of a new conservative era in government fast taking shape, even if they were still a little uneasy about the man doing the shaping.Yes, they said, Mr. Trump should tone down his tweets and rein in what they gently called his impulse toward \u201cexaggeration.\u201d\u201cHonestly, he sometimes needs to shut up,\u201d said Joshua Wade, 24, of Ann Arbor, Mich., a state that had not supported a Republican for president since George Bush in 1988. \u201cJust do what we elected you to do. We won. Drop the inauguration stuff. It\u2019s fine.\u201dGun rights top Mr. Wade\u2019s wish list for the new administration. He wants Supreme Court nominees friendly to gun owners and laws that extend concealed-carry rights across state lines. He said he had been encouraged that Mr. Trump took swift action on some campaign promises during his early days in office.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt: He\u2019s good at showmanship,\u201d said Mr. Wade, a registered Republican. \u201cBut I think this first week is proving he\u2019s capable of following through on that with real action.\u201dStill, Trump voters interviewed said they cared little if the president spouted off on Twitter because he was issuing the kind of executive actions many had long craved \u2014 freezing federal grant money for environmental research, banning foreign aid for groups that give abortion counseling and cutting off immigration from several Muslim-majority nations.\u201cTrump\u2019s done more in five days than Obama did in eight years,\u201d said Doug Cooperrider, 58, who works in construction repairing bridges and roads around central Ohio.The bar at Boondocks, where Mr. Cooperrider dug into a B.L.T. sandwich on a sleety morning, sits about 1,900 miles from the Arizona deserts where sections of the multibillion-dollar border wall may rise. The Hispanic population is tiny in this overwhelmingly white county of 35,000, and it has grown only 0.3 percent in the past five years.Still, people here said they felt as if immigration had undercut wages for construction workers in the area. One man said he was uneasy about the longstanding Somali community in Columbus, about an hour\u2019s drive south. Several embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s directives that limited new refugees, ordered up the border wall and cut off federal grant money to cities labeled sanctuaries for immigrants.\u201cI\u2019m 100 percent behind the wall,\u201d said Ms. Cottrell, the salon owner. \u201cIf he asked me to lay the first brick, I\u2019d sign up. I\u2019m tired of them being here illegally and cutthroating the rest of us.\u201dShe and her husband, Andrew, a Navy veteran, said their views of government had been colored by years spent struggling to get a disability claim approved for him by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They were early and enthusiastic Trump supporters, and when they went on road trips this year, they gauged their candidate\u2019s support by counting up his yard signs and Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Mr. Cottrell, 34, said he supported aid to feed and shelter refugees \u2014 but he blanched at welcoming them here.\u201cIt should be about America first,\u201d Mr. Cottrell said. \u201cWe see way too many vets waiting in line, homeless, while we\u2019re helping refugees and immigrants.\u201dMr. Cottrell said he had wanted Mr. Trump to gut the high-ranking staff of the V.A. and was disappointed when he instead kept on an Obama administration official to oversee the agency. But he said that did not affect his support for Mr. Trump.\u201cI have never seen someone make promises and immediately start keeping them,\u201d he said.Most of those promises are a long way from fulfilled. The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land. Efforts to build the Keystone XL pipeline or finish the Dakota Access pipeline could become mired in years of litigation. There is no agreement on how to pay for a $20 billion Mexican border wall.But moves like banning funding for overseas health providers who discuss abortion have a more rapid effect. Laura Alexandria, the director of operations for Grand Rapids Right to Life in Michigan, said she hoped to see the federal government soon remove financing for Planned Parenthood in the United States.\u201cWe have a pro-life president back in the White House, and that is very encouraging,\u201d she said.Ms. Alexandria said she had been in Washington for the inauguration, and she was back there this week for Friday\u2019s March for Life by abortion opponents. She said her organization had organized 12 buses to take people from Michigan to the march.If President Obama was a self-described \u201cRorschach test\u201d for voters in 2008, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions calling for curbing regulations and repealing Obamacare were cocktail-napkin sketches. He roughed them out, and his supporters filled in the details.Robert Kersey, 82, the president of an employee-owned foundry in Muncie, Ind., said he hoped Mr. Trump would pull back a recent announcement from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration addressing silica dust, which can lead to debilitating and fatal lung diseases. Mr. Kersey said he sees the rule as a burden and does not believe it will make his employees safer.Inside a gift shop in Mount Gilead\u2019s red-brick downtown, Amanda Abdon, 28, said she was eager for a repeal of the health care tax penalty her boyfriend had to pay this year. Eddie Lou Meimer, 70, walking through her family farm south of town, said she wanted the federal government to ease the kind of food-safety regulations that she said had forced her to build a $40,000 canning room for her maple-syrup business.\u201cHe\u2019s a get-it-done person,\u201d Ms. Meimer said of the president. \u201cI wish somebody would grab his phone.

You would probably think it is corrupt and that something in it needed to be fixed.This country is not imaginary. It\u2019s my country: Israel. And although I do not think it is especially corrupt, something is surely in need of fixing. The question is what.Does this mean we Israelis don\u2019t care about corruption and graft? Not exactly.Surely, no one here wants a corrupt government. On the other hand, no one believes that the police and investigators should constantly harass members of the government over misdemeanors. And everybody knows that politicians often tend to be, well, not the most honorable people. Still, we need them, and we need to let them do their jobs.We also live in Israel, a country of corner-cutting and informal practicality. Strict rules are not for us. This makes our bureaucracy much better than bureaucracies in other well-organized Western countries (yes, the Interior Ministry officer will see you even if you forgot the proper documentation; no, the clerk will not refuse your request just because the problem you describe doesn\u2019t match the one he was expecting to deal with). It also often seems petty, expecting our leaders to behave better than we do ourselves.Investigations and, even more so, the reports by the news media about these investigations often fail to convince the public that they are not politically motivated. Many Israeli dignitaries accept gifts, and supporters of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s party feel as if those received by the prime minister are getting undue attention. Similarly, Mr. Netanyahu did not invent unhealthy relations between politicians and the news media, and these voters protest that his wheeling-and-dealing is unfairly being singled out.So what is Israel\u2019s problem? Is it the corrupt ways of its leaders, or the uncompromising stiffness of its law enforcement agencies? Is it the dismissiveness with which politicians treat the rule of law, or a tendency of investigators to lose perspective as they hunt for prey?In an era demanding binary answers, the answers might seem disappointing. The solution to Israel\u2019s alleged corruption problem cannot be \u201cleave the politicians alone\u201d (Mr. Olmert did end up in jail for bribery), but it cannot be \u201cput all those crooks in jail,\u201d either (Mr. Netanyahu has never even been charged).It must be something more nuanced: \u201cGet a sense of proportion.\u201d That\u2019s a difficult principle to follow as Israel investigates its leaders \u2014 and a seemingly even more difficult principle to follow as Israel discusses and debates these never-ending investigations. But that\u2019s the real way to fix this country.Shmuel Rosner is the political editor at The Jewish Journal, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Settlement Highlights the Complexity of Credit Scores", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserIN the latest skirmish in a protracted battle, federal regulators have settled charges with two major credit bureaus for marketing credit scores and related products in misleading ways.The credit bureaus, Equifax and TransUnion, agreed this week to pay a combined $23 million to settle accusations by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that they deceived consumers into buying credit scores of questionable value over a period of several years.The federal consumer watchdog agency said the credit bureaus had also made \u201cfalse promises\u201d to lure customers into costly recurring payments for credit-related products. Customers signed up for what they thought was a free trial, but were actually enrolled in a service that charged monthly fees unless they canceled during the trial period. Terms were not \u201cclearly and conspicuously\u201d stated, the agency said.Hundreds of thousands of consumers were affected, according to the federal bureau.Credit scores are three-digit numbers used by lenders to decide how likely a consumer is to repay a loan, based on the person\u2019s financial record. The scores serve as a capsule summary of information in a loan applicant\u2019s credit report, which is compiled by a credit bureau and provided to lenders, and includes information about how many credit cards and loans potential borrowers have, and whether they make their payments on time.TransUnion and Equifax agreed to pay $17.6 million in restitution to customers and fines totaling $5.5 million.\u201cWe continue to believe that our consumer marketing has been clear and has complied with the law and other government guidance,\u201d TransUnion said. However, the company said it had worked with the federal consumer bureau to design new marketing disclosures, as part of the settlement.Equifax said it had made changes to address the federal bureau\u2019s concerns shortly after the agency\u2019s investigation began, nearly three years ago. \u201cWhile Equifax does not believe it has violated any laws and has not admitted any liability,\u201d the company said, it decided it was best to settle the matter.The companies, the consumer bureau said, violated federal laws by promoting credit scores sold to consumers as the same scores that lenders would use to make credit decisions. \u201cIn fact,\u201d the federal bureau said, \u201cthe scores sold by TransUnion and Equifax were not typically used by lenders to make those decisions.\u201d(The VantageScore model was jointly created by the credit bureaus to compete with the dominant FICO credit score, which was created by the Fair Isaac Corporation.)Barrett Burns, chief executive of VantageScore Solutions, said in an emailed statement that consumers should be \u201cclearly informed\u201d when provided a credit score that \u201cthe particular score being provided is unlikely to be the one actually used to make any given credit decision.\u201dThe settlements highlight the reality that each consumer has multiple credit scores, rather than a single, static score. The exact score used to make a decision on a given loan depends on the credit bureau providing it, the scoring model used to create it, the specific industry it is designed for and the timing of its preparation. Different scoring formulas, for instance, are used to evaluate applicants for home loans, credit cards and car loans.\u201cThere isn\u2019t just one credit score,\u201d said Liz Weston, a personal finance columnist for Nerdwallet.com and the author of a book on credit scores. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of confusion.\u201dHere are some questions and answers about credit scores and reports:Where can I get a free copy of my credit report?Am I legally entitled to a free credit score?Ms. Weston, however, said that if you were in the market for, say, a mortgage or a car loan, it might be worth buying that specific industry score from myFico.com, to get a closer approximation of the score your lender might use.If I am affected by the settlement, when and how will I receive a payment?Payment details will be included in a plan that the credit bureaus must submit to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for approval in the next three months. The agency said eligible consumers would be contacted directly by the credit bureaus.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "On a Fijian Island, Hunters Become Conservators of Endangered Turtles", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byYadua Island JournalYADUA ISLAND, Fiji \u2014 Pita Qarau pulled his boat next to a turtle, which was trying desperately to flee the buzz of the boat\u2019s noisy engine. The turtle, a female hawksbill, was surprisingly fast, capable of a top speed of about 15 miles per hour.But Mr. Qarau knew he could win the sprint. He lost the turtle momentarily, then circled back. Finally, as the turtle slowed down, he positioned the boat near the fatigued animal. He threw his engine into neutral and dived into the water.Seconds later, he re-emerged, holding on to a chaotic mess of flapping flippers.Not long ago, a catch like this would have meant turtle for dinner, but Mr. Qarau would let this one go. He checked the turtle\u2019s health, but he was unable to tag it, as he had intended, because he had run out of tags.Fiji has imposed a moratorium on harvesting turtles, and while the ban has been observed inconsistently around the island nation, some people like Mr. Qarau have weaned themselves from eating turtle, which is considered a delicacy, and instead have dedicated themselves to conservation.\u201cThe number of turtles were dropping and the size, you can\u2019t see any big ones, only small,\u201d he said later in the day. \u201cThat is why I change myself.\u201dMr. Qarau, 53, a native of Yadua, a small, remote island in Fiji\u2019s north, is a volunteer participating in a program by the World Wildlife Fund that has helped replenish the turtle population after decades of decline.The skills for hunting turtles, passed down through the generations here, come in handy for tracking and protecting them from illegal harvesting. Monitors like Mr. Qarau are known in Fijian as \u201cDau ni Vonu,\u201d or guardians of turtles.Life in Yadua is simple and close-knit. The island\u2019s only village, Denimanu, has about 200 people, almost entirely related by blood or marriage. Most residents\u2019 income is from catching and selling fish. A hot shower is accomplished with a few cans of water left in the afternoon sun.Traditionally turtles were eaten at major events, like a wedding or a chief\u2019s funeral. As traditions eroded in recent decades, some people began to think of turtles and their eggs as an everyday food to catch and sell.Climate change and habitat loss have also placed pressure on the turtle population. The conservation status of the turtles common to Fiji\u2019s waters \u2014 green, olive ridley, leatherback, hawksbill and loggerhead \u2014 ranges from vulnerable to critically endangered, according to the Red List of Endangered Species published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.The Fiji government imposed a temporary ban on turtle harvesting in 1995 to halt the decline. The current 10-year moratorium is scheduled to expire next year.It was there that Mr. Qarau realized future generations might never see or taste a turtle if harvesting continued. He said he was not thinking of himself when he decided to give up hunting turtles. \u201cI am thinking about the future generations,\u201d he said.The island\u2019s chief, Ratu Jone Cakautavatava, decided that Yadua\u2019s residents should no longer consume turtles, and people began to wean themselves off what many considered a favorite food. \u201cIt was really hard to stop,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cbut I follow the law.\u2019\u2019Mr. Cakautavatava described the old days of hunting turtles in a fiberglass boat and spearing them through the shell. Gesturing to the harpoon in his hand, Mr. Cakautavatava said, \u201cI keep the spear until the government says, \u2018Yes, we can kill turtles.\u2019 \u201dMr. Qarau\u2019s commitment to replenishing the turtle stock involves monitoring them twice a week. He walks the beaches searching for turtle tracks, which could indicate a nest. He and others are trained to dig into nests and record their contents: hatched eggs versus duds.Counting turtles is best done at night when turtles sleep under the coral, he said, or during the day when they feed at high tide on a shallow reef. A minute into a monitoring round on recent morning, the shadowy shapes of six turtles jetted across a reef.\u201cYou won\u2019t see that sight anywhere else in Fiji,\u201d said Laitia Tamata, a coastal fisheries officer for the World Wildlife Fund who manages the monitoring program. When the program began in Yadua in 2010, only six turtles nested on its beaches. Four years later there were 29 nests. At a monitoring site in Kavewa Island, no turtle nests were found in 2010; almost 70 were identified four years later.Not every Fiji community shares Yadua\u2019s commitment to conservation. Barry Hill, 27, a Yadua monitor, recently came across divers heading away from the island with two dead turtles in their boat. An argument turned into a brawl, he said.\u201cI tell them it is not allowed, but they can\u2019t control themselves,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cThey want to eat turtles every day.\u201dEven though the ban was first imposed more than 20 years ago, it has been enforced only sporadically, and few, if any, violators have been fined or sent to prison, according to Kiji Vukikomoala, a lawyer at the Environmental Law Association.\u201cThe general feeling is these are low-priority cases because the penalties are so low,\u201d Ms. Vukikomoala said. Someone convicted of killing a turtle faces a maximum fine of about $240 and up to three months in jail.The endorsement of a chief is often crucial to involving communities in conservation, said Michael Donoghue, an adviser on threatened and migratory species at the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme.\u201cIf communities don\u2019t want to do it, it doesn\u2019t matter what the law says,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Donoghue said. \u201cEspecially in remote areas, it is unlikely to happen.\u201dThe World Wildlife Fund plans to press for an extension of the 10-year moratorium when it runs out next year.Conservation efforts in Yadua and other islands have demonstrated that turtle populations can expand significantly if the moratorium is observed. But in 2014 the monitoring program ran out of financing, as the World Wildlife Fund put those funds toward saving species in greater danger of extinction.And so, while participants used to get reimbursed for expenses like boat fuel and phone calls to report their data, now the monitors themselves have to absorb these expenses.\u201cI guess that is what makes it successful,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Tamata of the World Wildlife Fund said. \u201cIt is from the heart rather than for money.\u201dMr. Qarau hopes that his conservation work will create a sustainable harvest, enabling Fijians to eat turtles again. He said he wanted future generations to see turtles and be able to taste them. \u201cWhen they grow up,\u201d he said, \u201cthey will see the number of turtles is still good in the village.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Although Navient fixed the problem, it took numerous phone calls over many days to do so, Mr. Gokey said.Navient also failed to follow Mr. Gokey\u2019s directions to allocate payments to loans with the highest interest rates first. \u201cIt almost seems like they are trying to make it more likely that I will miss a payment,\u201d he said, \u201cso they can slap on late fees and increase the interest rate.\u201dRobin Wilde is a military veteran who has had a series of trials with Navient. They began in 2000 when she went on active duty and tried to have her loan delayed as the law allows. She said she repeatedly sent Navient the proper information but it never got to the right person.\u201cThey put my loan in past due the whole time I was in basic training and it ruined my credit,\u201d Ms. Wilde said.There have been more recent troubles. After Ms. Wilde earned a master\u2019s degree in 2011, she was experiencing a financial hardship. She says she sent information Navient needed to put the loan into a temporary deferment and called to make sure it was received. \u201cI didn\u2019t find out they hadn\u2019t processed my paperwork until they put me on 90 days past due on 19 loans,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy credit score went from like a 730 to a 520 in a month.\u201dMs. Wilde said it was a happy day when she consolidated her $60,000 in loans and had them transferred to a different servicer.Of course, a couple of distressed Navient customers out of 12.5 million are by no means a scientific sample. But neither is the complaint by the financial protection bureau Navient\u2019s first rodeo with a regulator.Patricia Nash Christel, a Navient spokeswoman, said the $60 million settlement \u201cwas grounded in conflicting federal guidance,\u201d adding, \u201cSince the voluntary settlement, there have been six independent reviews confirming that Navient was following federal regulations.\u201dAnd one year earlier, Sallie Mae struck a settlement with Andrew M. Cuomo, then the New York attorney general, over conflicts of interest in the company\u2019s practices. Among them were Sallie Mae\u2019s practice of paying entertainment and travel expenses for officials of schools it did business with.The financial protection bureau may be a bane to Navient but it has been a boon to consumers, Mr. Gokey said. For example, only after he filed a complaint with the bureau did the company fix the repayment allocation problem, he said. And it did so within a week. \u201cI\u2019m very worried about what will happen to student loan borrowers if the C.F.P.B. gets gutted under the new administration,\u201d he said.Navient\u2019s shareholders seem to expect such an outcome. Immediately after the election, the company\u2019s stock rallied to almost $18 from around $13 on speculation that the bureau would be neutered under President Trump.The shares have retreated a bit, to around $16. But investors still appear to believe that education finance companies like Navient could have one less aggressive regulator to worry about under the new administration.The Fair Game column last Sunday, about the student loan servicing giant Navient, misstated part of the name of the agency that lodged a complaint against the company. It is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (not Finance).Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Senators Hope to Speed Trump Cabinet Confirmations", "Date": "2017-01-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans will move this week to speed the confirmation of President Trump\u2019s cabinet, an effort that has been stymied by the combination of lax preparation by Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, his many unorthodox nominees and Democrats spoiling for a fight, albeit with few cards in their deck.On Monday, the Senate will vote on the confirmation of Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, after Democrats used one of the few procedural maneuvers left to them to force a debate on his inevitable approval.Also on Monday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, whose road to confirmation has been bumpy. Mr. Tillerson received a lift on Sunday when two Republicans, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said they would support him, after weeks of public hedging.Other nominees have been impeded by attempts to untangle their conflicts of interest, a process that Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team started far later than its predecessors and that has led to embarrassing revelations.Whether these mistakes will thwart the eventual confirmation of any nominee remains in doubt. For all the intraparty rancor and \u201cNever-Trumpism\u201d during the campaign, Republicans appear to have closed ranks on Capitol Hill to protect their unusual president and his cabinet choices, for now.They have, when possible, prevented Democrats from grilling the nominees too hard, as was the case with Ms. DeVos, when Republicans shut down the hearing after one round of questions from eager lawmakers.Ms. DeVos had been struggling through a series of befuddling answers that raised questions about her grasp of federal education policy, including one flourish \u2014 replayed widely on social media and cable television \u2014 in which she suggested that school officials should be armed to protect against prospective grizzly bears on the premises.For their part, Democrats showed the frustration that is likely to surface repeatedly now that they have lost the White House and do not have the filibuster available to them.But their approach in confirmation hearings, raw and blunt after a bitter election defeat, probably presages the tactics that lawmakers are already learning in the Trump era \u2014 and the defensive maneuvers Republicans will employ.Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, excoriated the civil rights record of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, breaking with a long-held Senate custom of comity in the chamber.Democrats lobbed hours of questions at Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the nominee for secretary of health and human services, about his trading of stocks in health care companies that may have benefited from his legislating, keeping Mr. Price on the defensive heading into another confirmation hearing this week.\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the questioning frequently has an edge to it,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \u201cThat is not to say that there aren\u2019t legitimate questions to be asked of the nominees. But it\u2019s the way they\u2019re asked that I\u2019ve found to be different this time.\u201dThe Senate typically confirms nearly all of a president\u2019s cabinet, and many Democrats, if not most, will vote for the bulk of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees. Democrats changed Senate rules when they were in power to make cabinet nominees subject to a mere majority \u2014 rather than 60 \u2014 vote threshold, empowering Mr. Trump to send up more conservative and unusual choices.Their numbers limited, Democrats have opted to put Republicans on the defensive as much as possible. Mr. Booker\u2019s decision to testify against a fellow senator particularly rankled opponents, who accused him of grandstanding.In other moments, Republicans have chafed more at Democrats\u2019 tone than at the content of their remarks.Democrats are eager to argue the irony of any complaints about partisanship and obstructionism. Many remain bitter over Republicans\u2019 blockade of Merrick B. Garland, Mr. Obama\u2019s choice for the Supreme Court in his final year in office.\u201cThe Republican majority in the United States Senate refused a hearing and a vote on a nominee to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, chastised Democrats for refusing to consent to a speedy confirmation of nominees on Friday. \u201cThat position on the highest court in the land remained vacant because of the specific political strategy of the Republican leader on the other side.\u201dOthers have pointed to the relentless inquiries into Hillary Clinton and the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, wondering aloud why only a single round of questions was allowed in hearings for Ms. DeVos and Mr. Price.After going over his allotted time questioning Mr. Price, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, grumbled that he would cede time in the nonexistent second round.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, was not amused. He later noted that Mr. Price had been questioned more than any nominee to the post in more than two decades.\u201cYou may be here by yourself,\u201d Mr. Alexander told Mr. Franken.\u201cThe Benghazi hearing was 11 hours,\u201d Mr. Franken shot back. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201dPaul C. Light, a professor of public service at New York University who has worked on Capitol Hill as an adviser on transitions, said the confirmation process had made clear that standards for acceptable nominee conduct have changed. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any controversy about things that used to be controversial,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lowered the bar in terms of offenses that would have taken out nominees.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Sensational, Unverified Dossier Became a Crisis for Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byThe consequences have been incalculable and will play out long past Inauguration Day. Word of the summary, which was also given to President Obama and congressional leaders, leaked to CNN Tuesday, and the rest of the media followed with sensational reports.Mr. Trump denounced the unproven claims Wednesday as a fabrication, a Nazi-style smear concocted by \u201csick people.\u201d It has further undermined his relationship with the intelligence agencies and cast a shadow over the new administration.Late Wednesday night, after speaking with Mr. Trump, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, issued a statement decrying leaks about the matter and saying of Mr. Steele\u2019s dossier that the intelligence agencies have \u201cnot made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable.\u201d Mr. Clapper suggested that intelligence officials had nonetheless shared it to give policy makers \u201cthe fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.\u201dParts of the story remain out of reach \u2014 most critically the basic question of how much, if anything, in the dossier is true. But it is possible to piece together a rough narrative of what led to the current crisis, including lingering questions about the ties binding Mr. Trump and his team to Russia. The episode also offers a glimpse of the hidden side of presidential campaigns, involving private sleuths-for-hire looking for the worst they can find about the next American leader.The story began in September 2015, when a wealthy Republican donor who strongly opposed Mr. Trump put up the money to hire a Washington research firm run by former journalists, Fusion GPS, to compile a dossier about the real estate magnate\u2019s past scandals and weaknesses, according to a person familiar with the effort. The person described the opposition research work on condition of anonymity, citing the volatile nature of the story and the likelihood of future legal disputes. The identity of the donor is unclear.Fusion GPS, headed by a former Wall Street Journal journalist known for his dogged reporting, Glenn Simpson, most often works for business clients. But in presidential elections, the firm is sometimes hired by candidates, party organizations or donors to do political \u201coppo\u201d work \u2014 shorthand for opposition research \u2014 on the side.It is routine work and ordinarily involves creating a big, searchable database of public information: past news reports, documents from lawsuits and other relevant data. For months, Fusion GPS gathered the documents and put together the files from Mr. Trump\u2019s past in business and entertainment, a rich target.After Mr. Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee in the spring, the Republican interest in financing the effort ended. But Democratic supporters of Hillary Clinton were very interested, and Fusion GPS kept doing the same deep dives, but on behalf of new clients.Mr. Simpson hired Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence officer with whom he had worked before. Mr. Steele, in his early 50s, had served undercover in Moscow in the early 1990s and later was the top expert on Russia at the London headquarters of Britain\u2019s spy service, MI6. When he stepped down in 2009, he started his own commercial intelligence firm, Orbis Business Intelligence.The former journalist and the former spy, according to people who know them, had similarly dark views of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a former K.G.B. officer, and the varied tactics he and his intelligence operatives used to smear, blackmail or bribe their targets.As a former spy who had carried out espionage inside Russia, Mr. Steele was in no position to travel to Moscow to study Mr. Trump\u2019s connections there. Instead, he hired native Russian speakers to call informants inside Russia and made surreptitious contact with his own connections in the country as well.Mr. Steele wrote up his findings in a series of memos, each a few pages long, that he began to deliver to Fusion GPS in June and continued at least until December. By then, the election was over, and neither Mr. Steele nor Mr. Simpson was being paid by a client, but they did not stop what they believed to be very important work. (Mr. Simpson declined to comment for this article, and Mr. Steele did not immediately reply to a request for comment.)The memos described two different Russian operations. The first was a yearslong effort to find a way to influence Mr. Trump, perhaps because he had contacts with Russian oligarchs whom Mr. Putin wanted to keep track of. According to Mr. Steele\u2019s memos, it used an array of familiar tactics: the gathering of \u201ckompromat,\u201d compromising material such as alleged tapes of Mr. Trump with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel, and proposals for business deals attractive to Mr. Trump.The goal would probably never have been to make Mr. Trump a knowing agent of Russia, but to make him a source who might provide information to friendly Russian contacts. But if Mr. Putin and his agents wanted to entangle Mr. Trump using business deals, they did not do it very successfully. Mr. Trump has said he has no major properties there, though one of his sons said at a real estate conference in 2008 that \u201ca lot of money\u201d was \u201cpouring in from Russia.\u201dThe second Russian operation described was recent: a series of contacts with Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives during the campaign, in part to discuss the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. According to Mr. Steele\u2019s sources, it involved, among other things, a late-summer meeting in Prague between Michael Cohen, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, and Oleg Solodukhin, a Russian official who works for Rossotrudnichestvo, an organization that promotes Russia\u2019s interests abroad.By all accounts, Mr. Steele has an excellent reputation with American and British intelligence colleagues and had done work for the F.B.I. on the investigation of bribery at FIFA, soccer\u2019s global governing body. Colleagues say he was acutely aware of the danger he and his associates were being fed Russian disinformation. Russian intelligence had mounted a complex hacking operation to damage Mrs. Clinton, and a similar operation against Mr. Trump was possible.But word of a dossier had begun to spread through political circles. Rick Wilson, a Republican political operative who was working for a super PAC supporting Marco Rubio, said he heard about it in July, when an investigative reporter for a major news network called him to ask what he knew.By early fall, some of Mr. Steele\u2019s memos had been given to the F.B.I., which was already investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s Russian ties, and to journalists. An MI6 official, whose job does not permit him to be quoted by name, said that in late summer or early fall, Mr. Steele also passed the reports he had prepared on Mr. Trump and Russia to British intelligence. Mr. Steele was concerned about what he was hearing about Mr. Trump, and he thought that the information should not be solely in the hands of people looking to win a political contest.After the election, the memos, still being supplemented by his inquiries, became one of Washington\u2019s worst-kept secrets, as reporters \u2014 including from The New York Times \u2014 scrambled to confirm or disprove them.Word also reached Capitol Hill. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, heard about the dossier and obtained a copy in December from David J. Kramer, a former top State Department official who works for the McCain Institute at Arizona State University. Mr. McCain passed the information to James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director.Now, after the most contentious of elections, Americans are divided and confused about what to believe about the incoming president. And there is no prospect soon for full clarity on the veracity of the claims made against him.\u201cIt is a remarkable moment in history,\u201d said Mr. Wilson, the Florida political operative. \u201cWhat world did I wake up in?\u201dJonathan Martin, Mark Mazzetti and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And then you have a lot of people that are \u2018Yes sir, yes ma\u2019am,\u2019 to all your craziness. They don\u2019t allow you to evolve as a person, or to mature. Even when you act silly, people won\u2019t say anything because you\u2019re a tennis star.\u201dThe residual stress and continuing fear of her father took its toll eventually, however, and a year after her Wimbledon breakthrough, Lucic-Baroni had already fallen out of the top 100. She would not re-enter it for a decade.At times, she barely seemed to be a tennis pro at all. From 2004 to 2007, Lucic-Baroni competed in only six tournaments, struggling to finance her anemic career.\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to travel; I was stopped at the moment I didn\u2019t want to stop,\u201d said Lucic-Baroni, 34. \u201cI felt kind of a little bit of unfinished business. I still wanted to play on a stage like this, on a full court like this. Come out, play, have these wins, be in a quarterfinal of a Slam. Have a chance to fight for a semifinal. Those are incredible moments. Those are incredible accomplishments. I knew I\u2019m able to do that.\u201dHer comeback, which did not reach the tour level until 2010, has had ebbs and flows, with upsets of Simona Halep, a top-five player, at the 2014 United States Open and the 2015 French Open representing recent high-water marks. This week, Lucic-Baroni seems to be thriving, perhaps, she says, because she has learned to accept what she cannot control.\u201cIt was really difficult in the beginning when I started again, because I felt like I belonged somewhere at the top, and I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d she said. \u201cI was fighting really hard, clawing my way back.

I think it probably does show a little bit on the court as well.\u201dOf the abuse she says she overcame, and the lean years that followed, Lucic-Baroni said: \u201cI had a choice to cave or to grow and blossom from it. I took the latter choice, and I\u2019m very proud of myself and my family, that we got away from that. I didn\u2019t let it destroy me. It was difficult, sure, but I believe you really have a choice in everything. You either pick yourself up by the bootstraps and you move on and become stronger from your experiences. Or you falter.\u201dLucic-Baroni, who now trains on her own on public courts in Sarasota, Fla., has played remarkable tennis in Australia, particularly in a dominant 6-3, 6-2 win over third-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska.

The management company contends that Lucic-Baroni owes money from unpaid loans, and the player counters that IMG cost her money by encouraging her to pass up lucrative sponsorship offers in hope that richer deals would come along.They have not.

{"Headline": "Google, in Post-Obama Era, Aggressively Woos Republicans", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Few companies have been as intimately tied to the Democratic Party in recent years as Google. So now that Donald J. Trump is president, the giant company, in Silicon Valley parlance, is having to pivot.The shift was evident a day after Congress began its new session this month. That evening, about 70 lawmakers, a majority of them Republicans, were feted at the stately Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building, where they clinked champagne and bourbon glasses and posed for selfies with the 600 guests assembled in their honor.The event\u2019s main host was not from the Republican establishment. Instead, the party was primarily financed and anchored by Google.Now, the tech giant is scrambling to forge ties with Mr. Trump\u2019s new administration and to strengthen its relationship with a Republican-dominated Congress. Most important, Google is trying to change the perception that it is a Democratic stronghold.\u201cGoogle has a target on its back because it is fundamentally viewed as a Democratic company,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser to Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. \u201cEven though it has reached out to Republicans, it can\u2019t shake the image.\u201dGoogle said it had long had Republican lobbyists and had not changed its strategy.\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with both Republicans and Democrats for over a decade, advocating policies to encourage economic growth, innovation and entrepreneurialism,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to do exactly that.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Schmidt added, \u201cEric has a long record of working constructively and energetically on important technology issues with American and world leaders across the political spectrum.\u201dOther Silicon Valley tech companies, like Facebook, are in a similar predicament. The perception is that they lean left and their executives backed Mrs. Clinton. Many are now also pledging to work with Mr. Trump and paid court to the new president at a December tech summit meeting.One week into the administration, Google and other tech companies began to push back, criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration bans. The company said an estimated 187 employees were affected by the order and it urged any of those employees who were abroad to work with the company to return safely to the United States.\u201dIt\u2019s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in a memo to employees over the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ve always made our views on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.\u201dNow warning shots against Google have been fired by those in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle. Some of the president\u2019s advisers have debated whether the tech behemoth deserves more antitrust scrutiny, according to two people briefed by the new administration\u2019s transition team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Mr. Trump\u2019s team is particularly wary of one Google executive \u2014 Mr. Schmidt \u2014 who has been allied with Democrats. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Mr. Schmidt counseled Mrs. Clinton on strategy. A photo of him wearing a staff badge at her election-night party circulated widely in the conservative media.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, including his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, have complained about Mr. Schmidt\u2019s funding of a start-up called the Groundwork, which provided data and other technology for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. They also suspected Google was skewing search results in favor of Mrs. Clinton, said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201cMr. Schmidt spent millions and millions of his personal money to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cIt takes a particular amount of gumption to pretend that never happened.\u201dFor many years, Google\u2019s support of Democrats was plain. Google\u2019s political action committee and employees ranked third in all donations to Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign at $804,240, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2008, Google\u2019s PAC and employees were sixth with $817,855. The company did not rank in the top 20 for donations to Mr. Obama\u2019s Republican opponents in either of those elections.About five years ago, Google began diversifying its bets. The company forged ties with the Republican-dominated House of Representatives and started addressing the beginning of an antitrust investigation into whether the company was using its search dominance to suppress competing travel, map and restaurant sites.During his presidency, Mr. Obama also repeatedly supported proposals backed by Google, including net neutrality in 2015 and cable set-top box reforms last year.\u201cGoogle was very much treated as the golden child by the Obama administration,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, which has been critical of Google for privacy policies.At the party, several Republican lawmakers were positive about their tech host, brushing off questions about the company\u2019s heft and power.\u201cWhen I think of technology and Google, I don\u2019t think of dominance,\u201d said Representative Bradley Byrne, a Republican from Alabama. \u201cI think of innovation.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from Washington and Dai Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "SpaceX Launches Rocket, Its First Since Explosion on Launchpad", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byBut financial details disclosed this past week about the company overshadowed the successful liftoff, raising questions about the viability of Mr. Musk\u2019s long-range plans for SpaceX and his vision of sending people to Mars.SpaceX also repeated its feat of recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, landing it on a floating platform named \u201cJust Read the Instructions\u201d in the Pacific. Less than 90 minutes later, mission control received confirmation that all 10 satellites had been successfully deployed.Over the next 14 months, the company plans six additional Falcon 9 launches to deploy 60 more Iridium satellites that will completely replace the constellation.In the short-term, the successful launch helps put SpaceX back on track. The explosion and subsequent four-month grounding created a backlog of launches, including cargo missions for NASA to the International Space Station. September\u2019s explosion was SpaceX\u2019s second failure in 15 months; a Falcon 9 rocket carrying NASA cargo disintegrated in flight in June 2015.Company officials did not dispute the numbers reported in The Wall Street Journal article, but portrayed a rosy future.\u201cSince 2002, we have been at the forefront of revolutionizing space technology, with a solid track record of success, strong customer relationships and more than 70 future launches on our manifest, representing over $10 billion in contracts,\u201d Bret Johnsen, SpaceX\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a statement. \u201cFurthermore, with over $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt, the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth.\u201dSpaceX hopes to launch its larger Falcon Heavy this spring. The Heavy, years behind schedule, would become the world\u2019s most powerful rocket since NASA retired the Saturn 5 more than 40 years ago.SpaceX also plans to refly one of its recovered boosters this spring. By reusing instead of throwing away rocket boosters, SpaceX hopes to significantly reduce the cost of launches.Also on the schedule is an in-flight abort test of SpaceX\u2019s Dragon 2 capsule, a crucial safety prerequisite that it must conduct before the company can begin ferrying NASA astronauts to the space station next year.By applying Silicon Valley entrepreneurial practices to aerospace, SpaceX has undercut prices and disrupted the rocket launch business. That brought in many customers like Iridium, which is paying more than $450 million for the seven launches. The next-lowest bid from one of SpaceX\u2019s competitors was $1.2 billion, said Matthew J. Desch, Iridium\u2019s chief executive.Without SpaceX\u2019s lower costs, Iridium could not have afforded to replace its group of satellites, Mr. Desch said. \u201cThe Falcon 9 is perfect for what we want to do,\u201d he said.But the lower costs make it difficult to see how SpaceX could earn enough profit to finance its grand ambitions.SpaceX has described plans to offer satellite internet services with more than 4,000 satellites. The forecasts described by The Wall Street Journal, which were produced in early 2016, show how much the company is depending on this new business.SpaceX projected that current rocket launching business would quintuple in revenue, to $5 billion, in 2025. Satellite internet services, still in the early planning stages, were projected to bring in more than $30 billion in revenue and generate the bulk of more than $20 billion in profit for the company.During the September announcement, Mr. Musk spoke of \u201ca huge public-private partnership\u201d to get to Mars, but did not describe what kind of partnership he foresaw. The incoming Trump administration has not outlined in detail its plans for NASA, although some of the president-elect\u2019s advisers, including Newt Gingrich, are pushing for a greater reliance on commercial companies like SpaceX.Other Republicans, however, have been strong defenders of the Space Launch System, the big, expensive rocket that NASA is developing for a Mars mission.Advertisement"}

What will it do to American literature? Our most vulnerable faction \u2014 our first responders \u2014 would seem to be the writers in the thriving subgenre of the Russian-Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 novel. Its members \u2014 among them Gary Shteyngart, Boris Fishman, Anya Ulinich, Ellen Litman and Kseniya Melnik \u2014 were born in the Soviet Union and left as children or teenagers. In their novels, the disorienting clash between Soviet gloom and American gaud is the source of dramatic tension, exploited for tragedy and, more often, comedy. A Brezhnev baby showing up in Reagan\u2019s America is an irresistible fish-out-of-water premise. I experienced it firsthand when my family hosted two boys from the Siberian city of Novosibirsk in a cultural exchange program. On their first night, when we took them to the neighborhood Haagen-Dazs, the selection of ice cream flavors cast them into a state of shock from which they never recovered. In fearful whispers, both ordered vanilla.But now, as a Soviet film villain might say, the tables have turned. About half of Americans are beginning to feel that they live in a foreign country (the other half has felt that way for the last eight years). This new country increasingly resembles, and increasingly has ties to, Putin\u2019s Russia. Now we\u2019re the fish out of water. It\u2019s not so funny when it happens to you.Novelists choose the period they write about, but they can\u2019t choose the period in which they\u2019re read. Sana Krasikov\u2019s debut novel was composed in the previous era, but its official publication coincides with the presidential inauguration. \u201cThe Patriots\u201d is a historical romance in the old style: multigenerational, multinarrative, intercontinental, laden with back stories and historical research, moving between scrupulous detail and sweeping panoramas, the first-person voice and a kaleidoscopic third, melodrama and satire, Cleveland in 1933 and Moscow in 2008. It contains a wartime romance, a gulag redemption story, a kleptocratic comedy of manners, a family saga. The author intercedes with history lessons (\u201cIn 1934, the Baltic States had yet to be absorbed into the Soviet Union. .\u2008.\u2008.\u201d) and ominous omniscient asides (\u201cFlorence had no way of knowing this, but. .\u2008.\u2008.\u201d). Krasikov had no way of knowing that her novel would be published just as America is witnessing the ascension of a ruler who calls for jailing his opponents, proposes to weaken the First Amendment and uncritically quotes Russian propaganda. But this turn of events gives urgency to her main theme \u2014 the insidious influence of totalitarianism on the lives of those trapped under its boot.In a clever reversal of the familiar \u00e9migr\u00e9 plot, Krasikov sends three consecutive generations of a family from the United States to Russia. We meet its matriarch, the Flatbush-born Florence Fein, as a young woman in 1934, peering down on New York Harbor from the upper deck of the Bremen, a steamer bound for Latvia. From there she will travel to Stalin\u2019s planned city of Magnitogorsk in pursuit of economic revolution, a classless society, gender equality \u2014 and a strapping engineer she met while working at the Soviet Trade Mission. Surprising him in his homeland, she announces that she\u2019s available for a socialist (\u201copen\u201d) relationship. Her youthful dreams end like most youthful dreams do.But Florence doesn\u2019t go back to the United States. With a stroke of the kind of luck common to historical novels, she\u2019s hired as a translator by the Soviet State Bank in Moscow, the nerve center of international relations. \u201cI\u2019m helping build socialism,\u201d she boasts. Very soon she comes to feel \u201ca sense of rarity and belonging that her life back in Brooklyn had stingily withheld,\u201d a line that by the end of the novel will appear cruelly ironic. Her dialogue begins to resemble Newspeak. When a boyfriend advises her to board the next train out of the country, she replies, \u201cThe only train I\u2019m getting on is the locomotive accelerating into the future.\u201dThe locomotive of the future runs her over. Stalin begins to execute his rivals, and Florence comes under suspicion. Her passport is confiscated, and she begins a lifelong descent through the Soviet system: She is shadowed and clandestinely employed by the NKVD, betrays friends with false testimony and winds up in a gulag. Yet she remains blindly loyal to the revolution. Why?More than a half-century later, this question haunts her son, Julian, who emigrated to the United States after being denied a university degree because of Jewish quotas. He has followed in his mother\u2019s footsteps, in a sense, working to improve Russo-American relations: \u201cI am now employed in a business that has done more to advance the cause of Cooperation and Friendship between our two glorious nations than have decades of international peace talks and nonproliferation treaties,\u201d he says. \u201cI am speaking of Big Oil.\u201dIn scenes set in 2008, Julian returns to Russia to close a business deal with a state-sponsored oil company and investigate his mother\u2019s secret history as an NKVD informant. He also attempts to extract his own American son, Lenny. Not for Lenny, the life of an American \u00e9migr\u00e9 novelist: He has come to Russia \u201cto make his million and prove his manhood.\u201d He works in finance, combs his hair back \u201clike a pimp\u2019s\u201d and squanders his money on a Russian woman who doesn\u2019t love him.The petro-corruption scenes, together with those describing Florence\u2019s impossible struggles against Soviet bureaucracy, are the novel\u2019s best, belonging to a rich tradition of Russian writing about the petty absurdities of life under totalitarian rule \u2014 life, as Julian puts it, in the \u201clogic-free zone.\u201d We learn that diaphragms were called kafka caps, that rubber plants were found in so many Soviet conference rooms because they thrive \u201cin the stale radiator heat,\u201d that gulag guards fueled their all-night interrogations with bounteous ingestions of cocaine. Corruption at the top leads to corruption all the way down, from the oil executive who \u201chad devised the problem for which he himself was the solution\u201d to the school principal who inflates the grades of members of the Komsomol. Corruption is a trickle-down affair.In 1933, before Florence hardens herself to a life of privation and blind fealty, her Russian boyfriend warns her against devoting her life to a cause. \u201cIt is madness,\u201d he says, \u201cto burn up inside about things you cannot change.\u201d The line reverberates like a struck chord throughout the novel because its message is mercurial. Is it madder to rage against injustice or to succumb?Florence succumbs six years later, during an English literature class she teaches at a Moscow university. Preparing for a lecture, she comes across a passage from \u201cLife on the Mississippi\u201d in which Mark Twain \u2014 one of the few approved American authors \u2014 writes of his disenchantment with the river that in his childhood had overwhelmed him with its majesty. In these lines, she recognizes her own disenchantment with her adopted country. When she asks the students to respond, they parrot party platitudes. \u201cIt\u2019s just antiprogressive, reactionary romanticism,\u201d says one. Florence, under scrutiny from the secret police, hears herself agree. She launches into a lengthy speech twisting Twain into the image of \u201ca revolutionist\u201d and \u201canti-imperialist,\u201d continuing after the bell sounds and her embarrassed students file out, her fear transforming her into an apparatchik drone. \u201cShe\u2019d come to class hoping to make her students conscious of the more mysterious, philosophical musings of Twain\u2019s essay,\u201d Krasikov writes, \u201cand had succeeded in turning him into just another propagandist.\u201dHere is the danger posed to literature in times of political crisis. Tested for ideological purity, each work is judged either to support or undermine the acceptable political position. Good literature, however, lives in contradictions, particularly those that lack resolution. Florence understands this, but for her it\u2019s too late to change. For us, it\u2019s not.Nathaniel Rich is the author of the novel \u201cOdds Against Tomorrow.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Refund Loans Are Revamped and Resurrected", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported byFast, free money. That\u2019s what H&R Block, the nation\u2019s largest tax-preparation chain, is advertising on giant banners outside its storefronts and in TV commercials featuring Jon Hamm of \u201cMad Men\u201d: \u201cYou could get a refund advance of up to $1,250.\u201d It is the first time in six years that the company has offered to front customers some money from their anticipated refund.Two of H&R Block\u2019s biggest rivals, Jackson Hewitt and Liberty Tax Service, are hyping nearly identical offers \u2014 dangling up to $1,300 cash.The nation\u2019s big tax-preparation companies are so desperate for customers that they are willing to put money up front \u2014 with absolutely no hidden fees or interest charges, and no ironclad guarantees that the companies will get paid back. H&R Block, for one, has arranged a $1.65 billion funding line for its refund advances, giving pause to some of the Wall Street analysts who follow the company.The same advocates are looking warily at the resurrection of this type of loan. The new generation of refund advances are really, truly, no-hidden-fine-print free, though the tax preparers may use them to cross-sell other services. Customers who qualify will be advanced a portion of their tax refund within a day or so, with no fees or interest, though they will still need to pay for the provider\u2019s tax preparation services, which can cost hundreds of dollars.Struggling tax companies acknowledge that they are using the loans as a come-on to make up for the loss of walk-in traffic and people who have migrated to TurboTax and its alternatives. Each loan will cost H&R Block an average of $32 to $36, according to regulatory filings \u2014 which the company will chalk up as a customer-acquisition expense.\u201cThe early part of the tax season is really driven by consumers who need their refund to live,\u201d said David Prokupek, the chief executive of Jackson Hewitt. \u201cOur goal is to help them get fast access to their money, at no cost. This has some risk for us, but we needed to do something in the stores that you can\u2019t get online.\u201dThe loan offers are open to all customers, but they are particularly aimed at low-income Americans who live paycheck to paycheck and rely on their tax refund as their biggest annual cash infusion. For many people, it is a critical way to pay off holiday debt, catch up on overdue bills or cover emergency expenses like car repairs.Those taxpayers typically file their returns as early as possible. This year, tax filing season starts on Jan. 23 and runs through April 18.For tax preparation companies, the hit was devastating. On top of the lost income from those lucrative fees, they found that without the offer of refund advances, many customers stopped coming in at all.But a few years ago, Jackson Hewitt figured out how to offer refund loans in a way that would pass regulatory muster: It paid all the fees itself.\u201cThe industry has fundamentally changed,\u201d said Mr. Prokupek, who joined Jackson Hewitt in 2014, three years after the company took a trip through bankruptcy court. \u201cThe way I put it was: The girl\u2019s not coming back.\u201dA tax refund is a commodity, he concluded, and to stand out from the crowd, Jackson Hewitt, which has 3,000 of its 6,000 stores within Walmart stores, would need to offer things the competition did not \u2014 like refund advances. To make it work, he came up with a wholly new approach: Treat the loans as a marketing expense.Jackson Hewitt began offering these advances three years ago and was successful enough that a major rival, Liberty Tax, copied its model the next year. H&R Block announced its program in October.Analysts estimate that around one million customers took out refund loans last year. This year, H&R Block alone may double that volume.\u201cWe are looking to do a lot of loans to a lot of people, and we will be marketing this aggressively,\u201d Bill Cobb, H&R Block\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on a call.The company has promised not to pass the cost on in any way to customers taking advances. Some investors are not thrilled about that math: A Morgan Stanley analyst recently downgraded H&R Block, writing skeptically in a research note that the loans \u201cmay be a drag to margins.\u201dThe company also heavily promotes its Emerald Card, a reloadable prepaid debit card on which customers are encouraged to store their refunds. For some customers, H&R Block offers a credit line of up to $1,000 on those cards \u2014 for a $45 annual fee, at a 36 percent annual interest rate.Qualifying for a refund advance does not involve a credit check, and the advance will not show up on customers\u2019 credit reports. If a customer\u2019s refund is smaller than the amount that has been advanced, or is garnished by the Internal Revenue Service, the lender will be required to write the loan balance off as a loss.\u201cIn those cases, we do not attempt to collect, in any way,\u201d said Greg Steinlicht, H&R Block\u2019s vice president for financial services.H&R Block declined to comment on what percentage of applicants it expected to be approved. Jackson Hewitt said its approval rate was running around 80 percent. The company started prequalifying customers in November; so far, more than 450,000 people have been approved.Consumer advocates are keeping a wary watch on this new incarnation of refund loans.The new loans appear to be \u201cvery different from the bad, old refund loans of 10 years ago,\u201d said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center.\u201cOnly one office even had prices disclosed publicly, and often, the fees seemed to be completely arbitrary,\u201d said Liz Coyle, Georgia Watch\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for someone to comparison-shop.\u201dAnd for those who need money fast, refund loans are powerful draws.\u201cThis is an effort to arrest our client loss, to bring more people to our office,\u201d said Mr. Steinlicht of H&R Block. \u201cThe product went away for several years, but the client demand for it never did.\u201dA picture caption in some copies on Jan. 16 with the continuation of an article about big tax-preparation companies\u2019 offering no-fee advances on refunds misidentified an H&R Block accountant.

{"Headline": "The Billionaire Art Dealer Guy Wildenstein Is Cleared of Tax Fraud", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 In a surprise verdict, a French tribunal of judges cleared Guy Wildenstein \u2014 the patriarch of an international art-dealing dynasty \u2014 of charges that he laundered money by shielding a precious collection in a maze of foreign trusts to avoid inheritance taxes.But their behavior, the decision said, fell into a gray area before France enacted legislation in 2011 to require the declaration of foreign trusts.The authorities had sought a 250 million euro fine (about $267 million) for Mr. Wildenstein, 71, who is president of Wildenstein & Company, a New York art gallery. The case also ensnared his nephew and his estranged sister-in-law, along with Swiss and French legal advisers and foreign trust companies. They were cleared as well \u2014 a defeat for a relatively new prosecution unit that had been created to combat international tax evasion.Monica d\u2019Onofrio, the prosecutor, had demanded severe punishment for Mr. Wildenstein, including prison time, calling the family\u2019s financial operations \u201cthe longest and the most sophisticated tax fraud\u201d in contemporary France. The French media had also labeled the Wildensteins the \u201cimpressionists of finance,\u201d a reference to the family\u2019s deep collection of art, which included works by Bonnard, Fragonard, Caravaggio, Poussin and Watteau.Mr. Wildenstein was not in court for the verdict. But his lawyer, Herv\u00e9 Temime, said he had called the art dealer and he was \u201crelieved\u201d by the outcome.Mr. Wildenstein\u2019s legal team had argued at trial that he was unaware of the complex terms of the trusts managed by legal advisers.The Wildensteins have a presence in the art world dating back four generations, to 1875, and testimony at the trial showed how the family used its artwork to reap income from bank loans against the rising value of the paintings.Those tensions were still apparent on Thursday. Outside the courtroom, a lawyer for Mr. Wildenstein trailed Mrs. Wildenstein\u2019s former lawyer, Claude Dumont-Beghi, and loudly called the lawyer a \u201ccrook\u201d while she spoke with reporters. Ms. Dumont-Beghi ignored him, insisting that the nation\u2019s laws need to be changed to apply to trusts created before the new legislation was enacted to combat tax evasion.Mr. Wildenstein still faces other legal hurdles in civil court, including the claims by the state for about \u20ac500 million (about $534 million) in back taxes and other complaints rising from works seized by the police from the vaults of the Wildenstein Institute in Paris because the ownership was not clear. Those works remain in police possession.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bipartisan Reason to Save Obamacare", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byFixesRepublicans in the House of Representatives have voted some 60 times to repeal or roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act, and in the first days of the 115th Congress, they, along with the G.O.P.-controlled Senate, are threatening to finally fulfill their promise to repeal it.Most endangered are the insurance provisions that have brought coverage to 20 million people. Among them are Medicaid expansion and the requirement to buy insurance \u2014 without which the market would collapse.The transformation moves health care away from a fee-for-service model, which pays doctors and hospitals according to the number of procedures they do, toward value-based care, which pays based on what helps patients get better.Fee-for-service care encourages providers to do more and do it more expensively. The result is uncoordinated care that does not attack underlying health problems and comes at an enormous cost. Health care now accounts for around 18 percent of America\u2019s gross domestic product. It is pushing state and local governments into near-bankruptcy and neutralizing workers\u2019 raises. And as the first baby boomers are hitting 70, things will only get worse.There is wide agreement that value-based care is needed. But health care executives don\u2019t want to leap into the unknown. \u201cWhich alternative reimbursement strategies appear to be useful and which not?\u201d said Gail Wilensky, who was director of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H. W. Bush. \u201cThey need to be able to differentiate.\u201d\u201cWe generally couldn\u2019t see that patient on the same day,\u201d said Robert E. Baird Jr., chief executive of the Ohio network, which provides cancer treatment to 30,000 people each year. The message would sit on a desk till the end of the day, when phone calls were returned.\u201cThe patient would wait the entire day, and end up giving up and going to the emergency room,\u201d he added. \u201cMore often than not it would end up in an inpatient admission or an overnight.\u201dNo longer. In 2013, the clinic hired oncology nurses to take patient calls and gave them protocols: For example, a chemo patient with a fever gets a same-day appointment and certain tests.Baird said the program prevented 500 visits to the E.R. in 2016. \u201cWe were able to achieve Medicare\u2019s \u2018triple aim\u2019: higher quality of care, lower cost and increased patient satisfaction,\u201d he said.Cancer causes suffering. Cancer patients take strong, toxic medicines. They need same-day appointments. But neither Medicare nor private insurers reimburse a practice for solving problems over the phone.\u201cThis is a vehicle for experimentation,\u201d said Barbara McAneny, chief executive of the New Mexico Cancer Center. \u201cWe need as many doctors\u2019 thinking about what they can do better for their patients as they possibly can.\u201dMany of the experiments involve paying health care providers a set amount per patient on top of their fee-for-service reimbursement, as well as a share of the savings if they meet health care quality and savings goals.This frees up providers to do things fee for service doesn\u2019t pay for: talk to patients about how they can take care of themselves, hire community health workers to promote behavior change, see patients by video or phone, or take on extra staff to coordinate care to avoid duplication and medical errors.So far, there have been very few slam dunks, but that may be because behavior change is slow work. \u201cIt takes time to learn how to reorganize care, change incentive systems internally,\u201d said Bruce Landon, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. \u201cThese are programs we should not expect one-year returns on.\u201d\u201cWe treat a lot of poor people,\u201d McAneny said. \u201cTheir biggest co-pay was when patients went into the hospital. And even if they didn\u2019t get one of the bad infections or blood clots, every hospitalization resulted in lowered quality of life. There\u2019s a lot we can\u2019t control. But we could control whether we aggressively managed side effects of cancer and its treatment to keep people out of the hospital.\u201dMany states are innovating as well. In Ohio, the Republican governor John Kasich\u2019s Office of Health Transformation is moving providers toward value-based care. \u201cThere are primary care practices doing this today because it\u2019s right, but if anything they lose money,\u201d said Greg Moody, the office director. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to flip this: We\u2019ll pay you to do these things we know keep people well.\u201dMoody included Ohio\u2019s four largest private insurers in developing the new models. This was important \u2014 change happens faster if all insurers, not just some, ask for it. \u201cFor legal reasons they can\u2019t share with each other, but we said, \u2018if this makes sense to you, just copy what we do,\u2019 \u201d said Moody.As The Times reported, the shift in the American health care system has taken on a life of its own. States and private payers and insurers are all experimenting. But Medicare is the biggest insurance company in the world.\u201cStates can\u2019t do payment reform and still have Medicare pay on fee for service and expect anything useful to happen,\u201d said David M. Cutler, a Harvard professor of economics who studies health care. \u201cIf Medicare backs out of this, regardless of what happens at state level, nothing good will happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taliban, Collecting Bills for Afghan Utilities, Tap New Revenue Sources", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The Afghan government faces a peculiar problem in at least two major provinces: It provides precious electricity, some of it imported at costly rates from neighboring countries, but Taliban militants collect most of the bills.If the government cuts off power, it will further anger a population that is already disenchanted. If it does not, the revenue from the power will continue to provide more income to an already emboldened Taliban.But as they have taken over increasingly large areas in the past two years, they have found new ways of diversifying and collecting revenue, according to interviews with officials, Taliban commanders and local residents.The diversification of the revenue collection system, in the face of a central government largely dependent on Western donations and hobbled by corruption, has raised fears that the balance of the war could tilt even further in the year ahead, and that the insurgency is becoming more entrenched and acting as a shadow government in parts of the countryside.\u201cWhat it suggests, essentially, is that the group is becoming more efficient in systematically taxing the areas they either control or have a lot of influence on,\u201d said Timor Sharan, senior analyst for Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group, a research institute. \u201cEfficiency of taxation is quite significant in terms of sustaining the group for a long time.\u201dIn addition to collecting electricity bills from thousands of homes in provinces such as Kunduz and Helmand, the insurgents levy taxes on potato harvests, flour mills, teachers\u2019 salaries, marriage ceremonies, and fuel and vegetable trucks crossing their checkpoints.But the United Nations report also spoke of the group\u2019s diversification efforts.\u201cAnalysis of Taliban revenue sources suggests that they remain highly diverse, with various income streams that enable the Taliban to quickly substitute for declining asset streams,\u201d the report said.Mr. Sharan said the increased revenue collection was largely due to a restructuring of the insurgency spearheaded by its former leader, Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, who was seen more as a businessman heavily involved in the drug trade than a conventional Taliban ideologue. Part of the reason for the change was an expected decline in external funding amid growing competition for resources from other militant groups like the Islamic State.\u201cMansour, in his restructuring, gave more autonomy to the local Taliban groups and tasked them with finding more locally driven revenues and securing their funding at the local level,\u201d Mr. Sharan said.The Taliban have also been hit by a dwindling number of major NATO military contracts and development projects from which they could take a cut.Western and Afghan officials say the greater fund-raising autonomy for local commanders is also a consequence of chaos within the Taliban leadership and infighting over resources after an American drone strike killed Mullah Mansour in May.A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the group relied on a variety of resources, including Islamic taxes and offerings from farmers and local residents, donations from traders abroad and from Islamic countries, and booty captured from Afghan forces. He acknowledged that in their areas of control in places like Kunduz and Helmand, the Taliban collected the electricity bills.\u201cOur territory has expanded in some areas, and since our presence has increased there, our resources have also increased,\u201d Mr. Mujahid said.At first glance, each strand of Taliban revenue might seem insignificant. But for an insurgency numbering about 30,000 men, who operate in small groups, it is a substantial sum.The head of the power department in Kunduz Province, Hamidullah, said the Taliban were collecting electricity payments from close to 14,000 homes in the province, possibly as much as $200,000 for every two-month cycle.Haji Ayoub, an elder from Boz Qandahari village, north of Kunduz city, said that two months ago, the Taliban had stopped government electricity workers and taken the bills they delivered by bicycle. Then, they started calling people to come to the local mosque and pay.Mr. Ayoub said he owed the government about $200, for electricity used at his home and a flour mill he ran before it went bankrupt.\u201cThe Taliban representative took the money,\u201d Mr. Ayoub said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t sign or stamp the bill. He just tore half of it and gave me back the other half and wrote something in his notebook.\u201dHe added, \u201cI said, \u2018At least put your signature on the bill so I can bring it to the government to show that I have paid,\u2019 but he didn\u2019t.\u201dIn Helmand Province, members of the provincial council said most of the territory was controlled by the Taliban, who collected bills in places they held where there was electricity.\u201cWe cannot switch off the electricity in Taliban areas, because then they create big problems for electrical poles along the way to cities like Kandahar and Lashkargah,\u201d said Nasrullah Qani, the power department\u2019s director in Helmand.Residents in Helmand said the collection of electricity charges differed by district. In Kajaki district, the Taliban collect a fee once a year, from $60 to $150 depending on usage. In other areas, it is monthly.\u201cFor each electric bulb you use, they charge you $2 a month,\u201d said Haji Ziaudin, a shopkeeper in Musa Qala district.The Taliban have a multitude of ways to make money and to finance their local groups.Just south of Kabul, the Taliban set up checkpoints, taxing vehicles transporting vegetables, according to residents. New York Times journalists saw copies of receipts the Taliban provided to drivers for vehicles they taxed.In the western province of Ghor, farmers described paying taxes in cash and kind. Abdul Qayoum, 47, a potato farmer in Pasaband district, said he paid taxes to the Taliban twice a season, and two months ago had handed over about 220 pounds of potatoes.\u201cThe reason we give tax to the Taliban is because we have to take our vegetables to the Dahane Jamal bazaar, which is the main market for us, and it is controlled by the Taliban,\u201d Mr. Qayoum said.Sakhidad, 48, another resident of Pasaband, described how the Taliban had moved from an arbitrary system of collection, to a more ordered one enforced with strictness and fear.When the Taliban first took over the district three years ago, Mr. Sakhidad said in an interview last year, all those who had worked for the government had to pay a fine. Then, they imposed a regular 10 percent tax on harvests.Reached over the phone again recently, Mr. Sakhidad said that he continued to pay taxes to the Taliban and that he had given the new commander in the village $60 in taxes two months ago \u2014 a large sum for a farmer.But he said he was relieved that the former Taliban commander in his village, Mullah Gul Agha, had been replaced. In one of his final acts, he said, Mullah Gul Agha pulled out his pistol and shot and killed a man who had protested paying his taxes, saying he had already paid one of the commander\u2019s associates, Mr. Sakhidad said.\u201cThey force people to pay the taxes \u2014 it is not voluntary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump to Order Mexican Border Wall and Curtail Immigration", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday will order the construction of a Mexican border wall \u2014 the first in a series of actions this week to crack down on immigrants and bolster national security, including slashing the number of refugees who can resettle in the United States and blocking Syrians and others from \u201cterror prone\u201d nations from entering, at least temporarily.The orders are among an array of national security directives Mr. Trump is considering issuing in the coming days, according to people who have seen the orders. They include reviewing whether to resume the once-secret \u201cblack site\u201d detention program; keep open the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay; and designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization.According to a draft, the order on detention policies would start a review of \u201cwhether to reinstate the program of interrogation of high-value alien terrorists to be operated outside the United States, and whether such a program should include the use of detention facilities operated by the C.I.A.\u201d But one section of the draft would require that \u201cno person in the custody of the United States shall at any time be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as proscribed by U.S. law.\u201dWhere Syrian refugees have settled in the United States.The proposed orders could lead to sweeping and controversial changes in the way the United States conducts itself at home and around the globe in the name of security, potentially leading to the reinstatement of policies that have been repudiated by much of the world.\u201cBig day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday night. \u201cAmong many other things, we will build the wall!\u201dThe border wall was a signature promise of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, during which he argued it is vital to gaining control over the illegal flow of immigrants into the United States.Mr. Trump is also expected to target legal immigrants as early as this week, White House officials said, by halting a decades-old program that grants refuge to the world\u2019s most vulnerable people as he begins the process of drastically curtailing it and enhancing screening procedures.In the draft of a separate executive order now being circulated inside the administration, Mr. Trump would examine the question of whether the Central Intelligence Agency should reopen its so-called black sites, secret interrogation and detention centers that it operated overseas. Former President Barack Obama ordered the closings of all in the first week of his presidency in 2009.Syrians must pass through many steps of security clearances before being admitted to the United States.The black sites were a highly classified program, so their mention in an executive order would be highly unusual.The draft of a second executive order would also order a review of the Army Field Manual to determine whether to use certain enhanced interrogation techniques.Another executive order under consideration would direct the secretary of state to determine whether to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization. That designation has been sought by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.The refugee policy under consideration would halt admissions from Syria and suspend it from other majority-Muslim nations until the administration can study how to properly vet them. This would pave the way for the administration to slash the number of displaced people who can be resettled on American soil, and would effectively bar the entry of people from Muslim countries \u2014 including Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Syria \u2014 at least for some time.The expected actions drew strong criticism from immigrant advocates and human rights groups, which called them discriminatory moves that rejected the American tradition of welcoming immigrants of all backgrounds.\u201cTo think that Trump\u2019s first 100 days are going to be marked by this very shameful shutting of our doors to everybody who is seeking refuge in this country is very concerning,\u201d said Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cEverything points to this being simply a backdoor Muslim ban.\u201dFor Mr. Trump, whose raucous campaign rallies frequently featured chants of \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d the directive to fortify the border was not unexpected, although it may not be enough by itself to accomplish the task. Congress would need to approve any new funding necessary to build the wall, which Mr. Trump has insisted Mexico will finance, despite its leaders\u2019 protestations to the contrary. The order would shift already appropriated federal funds to the wall\u2019s construction, but it was unclear where the money would come from.Mr. Trump has said immigration will be on the agenda when he meets with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto.The order to build the wall is likely to complicate the visit of Mr. Videgaray, who has a history with Mr. Trump. It was Mr. Videgaray, then Mexico\u2019s finance minister, who orchestrated Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico before the election, a move seen by many Mexicans as tantamount to treason. He was forced to resign because of the fallout, but his reputation was restored after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, and he was given the job of foreign minister, in part to capitalize on his relationship with the new American leader.It is unclear whether Mexican officials were informed of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to sign the executive order during Mr. Videgaray\u2019s visit.Mr. Trump\u2019s refugee directive is expected to target a program the Obama administration expanded last year in response to a global refugee crisis, fueled in large part by a large flow of Syrians fleeing their country\u2019s civil war. Mr. Obama increased the overall number of refugees to be resettled in the United States to 85,000 and ordered that 10,000 of the slots be reserved for Syrians. He set the number of refugees to be resettled this year at 110,000, more than double the 50,000 Mr. Trump is now considering.By the end of last month, more than 25,000 refugees had been resettled, according to State Department figures, meaning the plan Mr. Trump is considering would admit only 25,000 more by the end of September.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Nominates Wall Street Lawyer to Head S.E.C.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byThe Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles, nor is he well known in corporate America. He is the insider\u2019s insider \u2014 a deal maker.As such, his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. In contrast, the agency\u2019s two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds.Mr. Clayton, known as Jay, has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms. His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities.He had a front-row seat to the financial crisis, advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings, including the biggest ever, the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013.Still, such recusals are not unusual. Laura S. Unger, a former commissioner and acting chairwoman, said that during her tenure, she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission. She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission\u2019s ethics officer.\u201cAn ethics officer at the S.E.C. knows all of your intimate details, and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts,\u201d she noted.Mr. Trump, who met with Mr. Clayton on Dec. 22, said in a statement that the lawyer \u201cwill ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.\u201dMr. Clayton is expected to face scrutiny on his confirmation as a Sullivan & Cromwell colleague, H. Rodgin Cohen, did in 2009. Mr. Cohen, the dean of Wall Street lawyers, withdrew his name from consideration for a senior Treasury role amid an outcry over his deep involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how an attorney who spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump\u2019s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from \u2018getting away with murder,\u2019\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said. \u201cI look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from financial institutions the S.E.C. oversees and work to prevent another financial crisis.\u201dRequests to speak with Mr. Clayton at Sullivan & Cromwell were not answered.A number of fellow deal lawyers said they were glad that the 50-year-old practitioner could be at the helm of the S.E.C.\u201cHe\u2019s a very smart, pragmatic guy who has real deal experience and has seen this stuff firsthand,\u201d said Richard Truesdell, a head of Davis Polk\u2019s global capital markets group, who has worked with Mr. Clayton on several deals. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of buzz today, and I have yet to talk to anyone who isn\u2019t pleasantly surprised by the choice.\u201dThe role of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors and enable companies to raise capital through the public markets in a way that fosters economic growth.The latter is a key tenet of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plan, with the aim that companies can use the excess capital to create jobs.Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the S.E.C. appointed by President George W. Bush, said Mr. Clayton was a \u201chigh-quality appointment.\u201d\u201cIt is especially logical with respect to the agency\u2019s obligation to promote capital formation, a subject with which the incoming administration is appropriately concerned,\u201d said Mr. Pitt in an email. \u201cMr. Clayton\u2019s background is very impressive \u2014 both for the depth of his experience, and for the quality of his efforts.\u201dMr. Clayton went to the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cambridge for separate bachelor\u2019s degrees and then obtained his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.Mr. Clayton donated to Mitt Romney and Mr. Obama in previous presidential elections and to Jeb Bush\u2019s primary campaign in 2015, according to public records.Those who know Mr. Clayton describe him as the roll-up-his-sleeves type, a doer who is often in the shadows of the better known Mr. Cohen at Sullivan & Cromwell.\u201cWhen I think about the position, the guy has a really deep understanding of the capital markets and financial regulatory matters, so he checks those boxes,\u201d said Brad Whitman, vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, who has worked with Mr. Clayton over many years. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great appreciation for what drives business and growth.\u201dReporting was contributed by Matthew Goldstein, Ben Protess, Alexandra Stevenson and Michael J. de la Merced.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hudson Square: A Manhattan Bargain, and Quiet, Too", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byLiving In9 PhotosThrough the years, Hudson Square has been a place to print books, broadcast radio shows and wobble through pub crawls, not to mention to slam steering wheels in frustration at backups in the Holland Tunnel.But to live? Yes, that too, say residents of the enclave, who praise its quiet streets, old industrial hulks and affordability, at least relative to other parts of Manhattan.\u201cIt\u2019s a little hidden jewel,\u201d said Michael El Hadj, 43, who lives with his wife, three children and a Belgian Malinois in a four-bedroom condo. Their apartment, which cost $2.8 million in 2007, is on Spring Street, a night life destination that once drew people from around the city. Mr. El Hadj recalled venturing downtown in the late 1990s, from his one-bedroom co-op on the Upper East Side, to see concerts at Don Hill\u2019s, a club at the corner of Spring and Greenwich Streets.But just as Don Hill\u2019s closed, in 2011, other bars near it have also shut down, meaning less broken glass on the sidewalks on Saturday mornings, said Mr. El Hadj, who works in finance. \u201cAs a middle-aged man with a family,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s been nice to see the seedier side of that aspect put to bed.\u201dParks, hotels and restaurants have also appeared, putting more of a residential stamp on the area, though, like a car ride over one of the Belgian-block streets, the makeover has been bumpy.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of fighting to keep it quiet\u201d \u2014 namely, to limit new bars \u2014 said Victoria Faust, 72, an artist who bought a three-bedroom, two-bath, full-floor spread in 1981, for $125,000. With its unobstructed views of the Hudson River, the apartment would very likely sell for more than $5 million today, based on transactions in the building, a converted co-op that still has a loading dock.Some battles have fizzled, like the communitywide resistance to the massive sanitation garage that looms at Spring and Washington Streets. But there have been triumphs as well, Ms. Faust said, like getting the city to remove garbage trucks from a triangular plot on Canal Street and rebuild it as leafy Canal Park.What You\u2019ll FindNamed for a small neighborhood in what is now TriBeCa, Hudson Square is framed by Canal, West Houston Street, the West Side Highway and Avenue of the Americas. Tiny, at about a tenth of a square mile, the district has grown slowly. In 1970, 1,965 people called it home, according to Census Bureau records. By 2010, it had 2,447 residents.What You\u2019ll PayThe VibeThe SchoolsThe CommuteThe 1 train runs along Varick with stops at Houston and Canal. On Avenue of the Americas, the C and E trains stop at Spring, and the A, C and E stop at Canal. Buses include the M20 and M5, which run to Midtown, and the M21, which crosses town to the East Village.The HistoryAdvertisement"}
