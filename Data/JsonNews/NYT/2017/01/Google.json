{"Headline": "From Jingles to Pop Hits, A.I. Is Music to Some Ears", "Date": "2017-01-22", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Patrick Stobbs recently sat in a conference room here playing songs from his smartphone, attempting to show how his start-up, Jukedeck, is at the cutting edge of music. The tune sounded like the soundtrack to a 1980s video game. \u201cThis is where we were two years ago,\u201d he said, looking slightly embarrassed.\u201cAnd this is where we are now,\u201d he continued. He then played a gentle piano piece. Its melody was simple, and it was unsubtle in its melancholy, but there was no denying that it could work as background music for, say, a health insurance commercial.Mr. Stobbs didn\u2019t write the music himself, nor did he commission it from a composer. Jukedeck is one of a growing number of companies using artificial intelligence to compose music. Their computers tap tools like artificial neural networks, modeled on the brain, that allow the machines to learn by doing, rather as a child does. So far, at least, these businesses do not seem to be causing much anxiety among musicians.\u201cWe see our system as still in its infancy; it\u2019s only learnt a certain amount about music,\u201d Mr. Stobbs said, although he quickly hinted how he hoped Jukedeck\u2019s music could advance: \u201cThere\u2019s no rule of physics that says computers can\u2019t get as good as a human.\u201dHaving machines write music is not new. In the 1950s, the composer Lejaren Hiller used a computer to produce the \u201cIlliac\u201d Suite for string quartet, the first computer-generated score.Jukedeck\u2019s beginnings are somewhat surprising for a tech company. Mr. Stobbs and the composer Ed Newton-Rex, both 29, founded it in 2012. They had been choristers at King\u2019s College School in Cambridge, England, and Mr. Newton-Rex went on to study music at the University of Cambridge, where he first learned that artificial intelligence could compose. After graduating from Cambridge, the pair set up a choral boy band (\u201ca terrible idea,\u201d Mr. Stobbs said), and had aspirations to run a record label. But in 2010, Mr. Newton-Rex attended a computer science lecture at Harvard, where his girlfriend was studying. The lecturer made coding sound relatively straightforward, and also made Mr. Newton-Rex recall his earlier studies in A.I. music. He decided to put the two together, and he set about building Jukedeck on the flight home.The idea behind the project is to get computers to write pop hits, said Fran\u00e7ois Pachet, the laboratory\u2019s director. \u201cMost people working on A.I. have focused on classical music, but I\u2019ve always been convinced that composing a short, catchy melody is probably the most difficult task,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cA compelling song is actually a rare and fragile object. It can only work if all the dimensions are right: the melody, the harmony, the voice, the dress of the singer, the discourse around it \u2014 like, \u2018Why did you write this song?\u2019 No one is able to model all that right now, and I\u2019m interested in that problem.\u201dFlow Machines\u2019 main system is a composing tool that works similarly to Jukedeck\u2019s: by getting a computer to analyze scores \u2014 everything from Beatles\u2019 songs to dance hits \u2014 so that it can learn from them and write its own. However, its output is then given to musicians, who are free to use it, change it or throw it away as they like, at no charge. (Negotiations are underway regarding contractual obligations if record labels release any of this music.) Musicians give \u201ca sense of agency,\u201d Mr. Pachet said. \u201cThe systems don\u2019t know why they want to make music. They don\u2019t have any goal, any desire.\u201dMr. Pachet and Lescop both said they did not think listeners would ever entirely accept computer-generated music. \u201cMusic fans need to fall in love with musicians,\u201d Lescop said. \u201cYou can\u2019t fall in love with a computer.\u201dBut the founders of Jukedeck are less certain.Mr. Newton-Rex sees artificial intelligence changing the way we listen, especially if computers eventually \u201cunderstand music enough to make it respond in real time to, let\u2019s say, a game, or you going for a run,\u201d he said. \u201cRecorded music\u2019s brilliant, but it\u2019s static. If you\u2019re playing a game, Hans Zimmer isn\u2019t sitting with you composing. I think responsive systems like that will be a big part of the music of the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Snap Goes Public, Some Shareholders\u2019 Voting Rights May Disappear", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe current rising star of tech start-ups, the parent company of the messaging app Snapchat, is apparently planning to issue shares with no voting rights when it goes public this year.It\u2019s another sign of how the balance of power has tilted to tech founders. But Snap may have gone too far.Still, a total disenfranchisement of public shareholders has been a long time coming among technology companies.When Apple and Microsoft went public decades ago they had the traditional corporate structure of one share, one vote. Google started the trend of making public shareholders lesser citizens in 2004, when it issued to public shareholders shares having one vote while the founders and insiders held shares with 10 votes.That has become the norm among new tech companies, as Facebook, Zynga and Groupon (among others) followed, as well as nontech companies such as Shake Shack. The typical structure was to give 10 votes per share to the Class A stock held by the founders and one vote to the public, though some companies went even further: Zynga\u2019s class A had 70 votes per share. (Twitter, however, was a noticeable exception and instead adopted a more traditional one-share, one-vote structure.)But Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, as well as other tech founders, soon discovered a problem. Even with all of those high-vote shares, they might lose control if they sold their stock to fund their charities or other ventures. As a result, Google, Zillow and even Under Armour have created no-vote shares to issue to employees and for future offerings.This is having your cake and eating it, too.Snap could go public with a Google-like structure and then issue out no-vote shares later. But why deal with all those pesky shareholders who may challenge such a conversion?Instead, Snap is apparently going to make sure that the public has no vote and hence never the opportunity to have a say in the company\u2019s governance. While public shareholders will be totally disenfranchised, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy are reportedly going to have 70 percent of the total vote despite owning only 40 percent of Snap.The discrepancy is not bad compared with other companies. At Facebook, for example, Mark Zuckerberg currently casts 53.8 percent of Facebook\u2019s votes while owning 15 percent of the company.Snap\u2019s rationale for wanting its co-founders to have this power has not been explained. But from news media reports and otherwise, we can figure out the gist. Snap is likely to argue that Mr. Spiegel, 26, is a visionary who knows how to sell to teenagers and 20-somethings. He is the one who can lead the company to join the superpower ranks of Facebook and Google, justifying Snap\u2019s valuation of over $20 billion.Indeed, that appears to be why Snapchat changed its name to Snap, so it could mimic the big boys like Google and be an umbrella company for other innovative and presumably lucrative products. Mr. Spiegel, the argument goes, needs total control over the company to ensure that this ambitious vision is executed.There are warning signs that the hype over Snap\u2019s initial public offering is going to be extreme. Already the company is indicating that it will focus not on revenues or profits, but on alternative metrics like user engagement.Yet is there any doubt that Snap\u2019s initial public offering will be a stunning success? After all, how can you miss out on the Next Big Thing, like, say, Myspace, Zynga, Groupon or perhaps Theranos? Oh, Snap.Sarcasm aside, few big social media players come to market, so investors will be sure to gobble up Snap shares.And risks and governance problems will be ignored in the rush not to miss out. The euphoria over Snap is noticeable even among banks, which are providing the company with a loan of $1.4 billion \u2014 more than Snap\u2019s entire expected 2017 revenue. So much for sober and prudent banking.When you think about it, this emphasis on vision in technology is tiresome. It drives money to companies but often seems hype to build up the egos of founders who often get lucky. I mean, were messages that disappear \u201cvisionary\u201d five years ago?Couldn\u2019t it be easier to say that instead of a visionary, Mr. Spiegel will be a multibillionaire with total control of a company and a track record of only a few years?Without picking on Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy, this type of corporate power concentration in one or two people has too much chance of going wrong \u2014 especially someone who might be around for 70 years and is running a company with so much uncertainty in its future. Their vision may change or just go bad, but shareholders who own part of the company are stuck as are the employees and consumers of the company who then are kept in this scenario.Even Google was criticized for overspending on investment, something shareholder pressure pushed back on and caused the company to change. Shareholders can provide some measure of check on these issues, but Snap would be saying: We won\u2019t care.Defenders of such a class-share structure point to the ability to look at the long term while arguing that the market will price any governance defects. Shareholders will pay less for Snap\u2019s shares because of these risks.This assumes a rational market, but it is hard not to see that people may be discounting the risks in the rush to buy the next hot tech stock. And while there may be real benefits to this structure in preserving a singular mission, given the early trajectory of Snap, it seems too risky.Perhaps the supporters are right. But the real test of this structure will come if the institutional investment firms who have the greatest influence in the stock market, like Vanguard and BlackRock, idly stand by.But I doubt that the institutions will do much more than complain, instead leaving Snap with corporate governance that mimics its disappearing messages, leaving nothing there.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

Here are five ways to take the time off you have already earned in 2017:It seems like an obvious first step, but saying you will get organized, and doing it, are different things.There is no need to complicate the approval process by dumping your work onto other people.\u201cThe more notice you can provide, the easier it will be to convince your boss that you\u2019ll be able to delegate your responsibilities for coverage in your absence,\u201d Ms. Augustine said, adding that \u201cyou won\u2019t be able to relax\u201d if you left the office \u201cwith loose ends.\u201dYou can be firm in your commitment to take the vacation days you deserve while still being courteous to your colleagues. It is as simple as talking to your colleagues and doing it early.Mr. Petoff suggested starting the year by inviting them to a time-off planning lunch to discuss potential vacation dates and determine if there are any conflicts.If conflicts do emerge, the next step is to involve your boss, but not behind your colleagues\u2019 backs, Ms. Weeks said.Try asking yourself this: Why am I taking this time off and why is it important to me?This is kind of a trick question, because there is no such thing as a bad reason to take time off from work. But being confident in your decision can make it hard for your superior to deny your request.\u201cA self-respecting view of a decision or request is preferable to a pity plea, because asking as though a \u2018yes\u2019 is a huge favor to me may make my manager feel magnanimous, but it also sounds like I don\u2019t expect it to happen,\u201d Ms. Weeks said. \u201cI want my decision respected, not second-guessed by my manager.\u201dImagine if you had to write an email to your boss every two weeks for your paycheck, or every time you went to the doctor. Is using all of the vacation days your employer has already agreed to give you really any different?\u201cI would like to see employees who feel they must argue for permission to receive their compensation take a stance of detached entitlement,\u201d Ms. Weeks said. \u201cNot the sense of entitlement that justly has earned a bad reputation, but the simple entitlement to one\u2019s compensation as an agreed condition of employment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mentioning Tragedy in a Job Interview", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byThe WorkologistI am a 50-something professional who has worked at my current job for almost 10 years. While I love my current post (despite the relatively low pay), I am now looking for a new position due to a company restructuring. I have been out of the interview circuit for years, and in preparing I am struggling with the amount of personal information I should share.Specifically, my career path was slowed, or even put in rewind, because of tragedies in my life. My son died suddenly at a young age, and my husband left me soon thereafter. While I worked part time throughout that process, it took years for me to heal and to fully re-engage in the work force.Do I mention these events in a job interview? I feel they are relevant in explaining why my career seems stalled. But I also fear they could amount to an inappropriate over-share \u2014 or that I will lose my composure and dissolve into tears. How much is too much to share in a job interview? DIANESo don\u2019t exaggerate an employer\u2019s potential questions or skepticism so much that you put yourself on the defensive. Your real focus remains on making the case that you\u2019ve got the skills the company needs. \u201cTypically,\u201d Mr. Walsh says, \u201cyou would not share too much personal information unless you thought it would help you in some fashion.\u201dEven if you feel it\u2019s to your advantage to address a period of career stasis, you can keep the nonwork details vague, says Camille DeBell, a professor in the division of counseling and family therapy at Regis University\u2019s Rueckert Hartman College for Health Professions in Denver. Dr. DeBell suggests something like: \u201cFor personal \u2014 or family \u2014 reasons, I decided that it was best to stay in a job\u201d that provided some growth and considerable stability, \u201cbut my situation has changed now, so I have more freedom to pursue new challenges.\u201dIn your case, perhaps mention that because of your son\u2019s unexpected death, you didn\u2019t want too much change in your life. \u201cEvery employer is going to get that,\u201d he says. But pivot to the present, and your readiness to move forward in your career. (Coincidentally, Mr. Walsh says, he recently had a networking interview with a man who had gone through a similar tragedy, and handled the subject exactly this way.) Particularly given your concerns about how you\u2019ll handle this conversation emotionally, role play it a bit and practice with a trusted friend, Mr. Walsh suggests.Either way, you should probably skip focusing on the divorce. Not to sound callous, but however painful it may have been, it\u2019s a much less extraordinary circumstance, and (fairly or not) could raise more questions than it resolves about whether you\u2019re ready to move ahead. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to feel a need to talk to someone about that, but it shouldn\u2019t be a job interviewer.A few years ago, my contracted position was terminated. Under the terms of my contract, I was eligible for a buyout. My employer denied this request, so I filed a claim with my city\u2019s employee appeals division. The judge ruled in my favor.However, since then, despite being highly qualified and experienced, with solid references, I\u2019ve had an astonishing lack of success in finding another position in my field. In trying to explain this, I Googled myself and saw that this claim is one of the first items in the search result.Yes, bring it up yourself. An online search has become a routine candidate-vetting practice, so employers are probably going to come across this anyway. You may as well frame the matter yourself.Interviews often begin with some variation on \u201ctell me about yourself,\u201d so perhaps toward the end of your opening response you could say something like: \u201cYou might find if you Google me that I was forced to take legal action when I left my last employer,\u201d Mr. Walsh suggests. Acknowledge that this might raise concerns, but emphasize that \u201cit was something I did hesitantly.\u201d There was a principle involved, and happily the court recognized this. You might even add something like: \u201cWhat I learned in that process is how important it is that your own values align with your employer\u2019s.\u201dYour goal is to put the interviewer at ease, demonstrate that you have nothing to hide and move on to the subject of all you have to offer. If the company can\u2019t get over this incident, maybe it\u2019s better to learn sooner rather than that later that your values just don\u2019t align.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Got Gay Married. I Got Gay Divorced. I Regret Both.", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byOpinionLOS ANGELES \u2014 In 2008, gay marriage was so new, my wife and I had a hard time finding a lawyer to help us legally join our lives together.In 2013, gay divorce was so new, I had a hard time finding a lawyer to take our marriage apart.And we decided to tie the knot ourselves the day before Election Day that year, when it suddenly seemed that California Proposition 8 was going to pass, banning same-sex marriage again.Beneath an arbor of grimy plastic ivy at the Alameda County Clerk-Recorder\u2019s Office, we wept grateful tears as we swore to \u201clove, honor, and keep each other, in sickness and in health, as long as we both shall live.\u201dTwenty-four hours later, Prop 8 did pass, changing the marital status of 18,000 same-sex California couples from \u201cmarried\u201d to \u201cwho knows?\u201dAlso unknown: why the happiest day of our life together was one of our last happy days. Why nothing we tried \u2014 individual and marriage therapy, romantic vacations, trial separations \u2014 could fix us.In 2013 I Googled \u201cgay divorce lawyer\u201d and found only \u201cgay family law\u201d attorneys. I called the one with the best Yelp reviews.\u201cI need to file for d \u2014 \u201d The word caught in my throat.In many cities over many years, my wife and I had marched for marriage equality. We\u2019d argued with the haters and we\u2019d argued with the gay people who said that legal marriage would co-opt us, diminish us, turn us into a caricature of \u201cnormal\u201d married people. We swore we could enjoy the rights only marriage conferred and still have our gender-fluid commitment ceremonies, our chosen-family configurations, our dexterity at turning friends into lovers and vice versa.Divorce felt like more than a betrayal of my wedding vows. It was a betrayal of my people and our cause.\u201cYours won\u2019t be my first gay divorce,\u201d the lawyer told me, \u201cand I guarantee you, it won\u2019t be my last.\u201dI asked how long it would take, and what it would cost. He couldn\u2019t give me even a ballpark estimate. The laws were in such flux, he said, that both gay people who wanted to marry and gay people who wanted to divorce were twisting in the shifting winds.When the lawyer and I had our first, $350-an-hour conversation, same-sex marriage was outlawed in 37 states and legal in 13 (and the District of Columbia). Change was the only constant, and each change increased the time (his) and money (mine) it cost to research its implications.My case had a bonus complication. In 1999, before real marriage was available to us, my wife and I had registered as California domestic partners. Did we need a separate legal process to end that partnership? No one was sure.I mailed the lawyer a big deposit. He emailed me a big stack of documents. On the first page, there it was: my wife\u2019s name, right next to mine. The thrill of that triumph, of being a gay person with the legal recognition of a straight person, ran through me as it always had. Then I remembered that I was seeing it for the last time.Like most early same-sex-marriage adopters, my wife and I had intermingled our hearts and lives but kept our finances and property separate. And yet I was in for a much longer, costlier contest.Governments, lovers: If only we could know, in the beginning, what we come to know in the end.As we elder feminists used to say, \u201cThe personal is political.\u201d In the case of gay marriage, for me, the political was a personal disaster. I\u2019ve been an activist for 50 years, and never have I fought so hard for a right that hurt me so much.Am I sorry that same-sex marriage is the law of the land? No.Am I sorry that my marriage didn\u2019t last \u201cas long as we both shall live?\u201d Yes.Am I sorry that we got legally married? Yes, I am. Not only did marriage fail to keep us together; it sentenced us to an agonizingly drawn-out, devastatingly expensive divorce.Would I do it again \u2014 fight for equality; make a life with a lover, do all I could to honor that love?In a heartbeat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clearing Out the App Stores: Government Censorship Made Easier", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThere\u2019s a new form of digital censorship sweeping the globe, and it could be the start of something devastating.These moves may sound incremental, and perhaps not immediately alarming. China has been restricting the web forever, and Russia is no bastion of free speech. So what\u2019s so dangerous about blocking apps?Here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s a more effective form of censorship.But that\u2019s not the end of this story. The banning of apps highlights a deeper flaw in our modern communications architecture: It\u2019s the centralization of information, stupid.\u201cI think the app store censorship issue is one layer of ice on the surface of the iceberg above the waterline,\u201d said Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School and a leader in the free software movement of activists who have long been warning about the dangers of centrally managed, commercial software.For more than a decade, we users of digital devices have actively championed an online infrastructure that now looks uniquely vulnerable to the sanctions of despots and others who seek to control information. We flocked to smartphones, app stores, social networks and cloud storage. Publishers like The New York Times are investing in apps and content posted to social networks instead of the comparatively open World Wide Web. Some start-ups now rely exclusively on apps; Snapchat, for instance, exists only as a mobile app.Compared with older forms of distributing software, apps downloaded from app stores are more convenient for users and often more secure from malware, and they can be more lucrative for creators. But like so much else online now, they risk feeding into mechanisms of central control. In most countries, the Apple and Google app stores are the only places to find apps for devices running their respective operating systems. (There are more choices for Android app stores in China, where Google does not offer its store.)The internet\u2019s earliest boosters considered it a magical tool to liberate people from restrictions on speech. The easy banning of apps suggests that if we let it, the internet could instead become something quite the opposite \u2014 one of the most efficient choke points of communication the world has ever seen.As the threat of nuclear attack diminished and the internet grew, its decentralized design became as much a political selling point as a technical one.What the creators and early proselytizers of the internet did not foresee was the rapid commercialization of the network. The internet that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Gilmore envisioned was built and maintained by collectives of users; the one that users flocked to was tamed by companies whose very success turned them into some of the largest corporations on the planet.The internet is now no longer \u201ceverywhere and nowhere.\u201d Just about all of its economic value is instead connected to two very specific somewheres: the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, the homes of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook, the four monstrously large companies that own the internet\u2019s central information platforms. As these companies began to build ever-larger empires online, they have evolved into convenient choke points \u2014 the very points of control that the internet was designed to eliminate.Apple offered this statement in response to my queries on how it decides to take down apps: \u201cFor some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China, and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.\u201d Google declined to comment.But Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights activist organization, said the internet giants were not without leverage in this fight.\u201cThe flip side of that is, is China going to block the entire Apple App Store over a single app?\u201d she asked. Interestingly, the internet giants\u2019 hold on every aspect of online life works toward their advantage in battling governments.\u201cThe bigger a company is, the bigger the risk that blocking them will lead to riots in the streets because you have come between people and their pictures of cats,\u201d Ms. Galperin said. \u201cThose are the companies that governments are going to be more wary of blocking, and they should be the ones that stand up to government pressure. They have a special responsibility.\u201dUsers and app developers who are now at risk of being censored also bear some responsibility. When I asked Mr. Moglen at Columbia about app bans, he was incensed that I didn\u2019t recognize The New York Times\u2019s own complicity in this story.The Times, he argued, could have stuck with the old way of publishing news. The company could have declined to create a downloadable app and instead invested all of its engineering resources into making its news available on the web, anonymously. The Times could have refused to profile users for advertising purposes, or to have its articles hosted on Facebook, or to monitor what people read in order to recommend more articles to keep people engaged. In short, The Times could have refused to play the modern digital-publishing game. But like every other publisher, it went along.\u201cWhat did you expect would happen?\u201d Mr. Moglen asked. \u201cChina didn\u2019t have to build a Great Firewall to do this. You all offered them an opportunity to piggyback onto your disrespect for the privacy and integrity and autonomy of your readers and users.\u201dI don\u2019t agree with Mr. Moglen that The Times disrespects its readers by offering a news app. (I think it\u2019s a very nice app.) But he is right that a lot of people online walked blindly into the no-win position we are in now, where our only recourse against censorship might be the good will of a few giant corporations that control most of the internet.There has to be some other way. Let\u2019s maybe work on finding it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "5 No-Phone Zones for Parents and Kids Alike", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byThe CheckupHow can we get our kids to put down their phones when they see us on ours so often?It\u2019s just as important to regulate our own use of devices and put them aside for screen-free periods as it is to ask our children to disconnect. And it certainly adds spice to family life if children understand that the same rules apply for all ages: that Dad will get grief for surreptitiously checking his phone under the dinner table and Mom has to park hers in the designated recharging zone for the night just as the children do.Here are my own top five sacred spaces, but I\u2019ll tell you frankly that they\u2019re very much \u201caspirational\u201d for me; I have a long way to go before I\u2019m a good example.Keeping TVs out of children\u2019s bedrooms and bedtimes is an old pediatric recommendation from back in the day when TV was the screen we worried about most. Now we also stress keeping smartphones out of their beds, but many of us as adults also struggle with this imperative, which pretty much everyone agrees is critical for improved sleep and therefore improved health. Those of us with children out of the home, of course, tell ourselves that the phone has to come into the bedroom in case a child needs to call \u2014 but the phone can sleep on the other side of the room, not on the night stand.If the family gathers around the dinner table, basic table manners dictate no digital participants. And yes, that means parents get in trouble if they lapse, and you don\u2019t get to use the old let-me-just-Google-this-important-and-educational-fact strategy to settle family debates and questions of history, literature, or old movie trivia, because everyone knows what else you\u2019ll do once you take out the phone.I don\u2019t read books well if I\u2019m toggling back and forth to email. That\u2019s O.K. for other kinds of reading, maybe, but not for books. If you made a New Year\u2019s resolution to read more books or you\u2019re going to try for family reading time, you can allow e-readers, but you might keep other screens at a distance.It\u2019s definitely worth picking some outdoor experiences that are going to be screen-free. One of the dangers of carrying our screens with us wherever we go is that wherever we go, the landscape is the same \u2014 it\u2019s a conscious decision to go outside and see what there is to see, even if that means losing the chance to take a photo now and then. It may also work to put phones on airplane mode for travel and family activities, so they can be used only as cameras \u2013 or for maps or emergency calls if needed.This is a tougher one for many families, since screens in the car can be so helpful on long rides, especially with siblings in proximity. But time in the car can also be remarkably intimate family time (yes, I know, not always in a good way). Some of the most unguarded conversations of the middle school and adolescent years take place when a parent is chauffeuring, so it\u2019s probably worth trying for some designated screenless miles. I assume that I don\u2019t have to say that the driver should not be looking at a screen \u2014 but the parent riding shotgun in the front also has to play by the rules.Mr. Steyer said his organization\u2019s survey showed that parents are paying attention to the ways that their children use screen media, and that they see it as their responsibility to monitor and regulate their children\u2019s use of technology. In fact, two-thirds of the parents felt that such monitoring was more important than respecting their children\u2019s privacy.Parents\u2019 role has to include awareness and also a willingness to \u201cuse media and technology together whenever you can,\u201d Mr. Steyer said; \u201cit\u2019s good for parents to watch and play and listen with their kids and experience media and technology with them and ask them questions about what they see and hear.\u201dAdvertisement"}

J.: Made in America,\u201d has found himself in dazzling company of late, thanks to the tremendous response to his documentary, which millions have seen.\u201cIf you think you\u2019re watching a film, it\u2019s a film,\u201d Mr. Meyers said. \u201cNo one\u2019s watching \u2018Dance Moms\u2019 going, \u2018Is this a movie?\u2019\u201dIn one sense, a big one, the point is moot, because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences deemed \u201cO. J.\u201d eligible. The film landed the newspaper review and theatrical release required under the academy\u2019s rules, which also demand four daily screenings. But \u201cO. J.,\u201d because of its length, was given the O.K. to screen twice a day instead.\u201cIt is not unprecedented for the academy to make special accommodations for films with long running times,\u201d a spokeswoman for the organization wrote in an email.And while the Bagger isn\u2019t putting \u201cO. J.\u201d on trial here, there is also the matter of intent.\u201cI told Connor from the start that I wouldn\u2019t make a mini-series,\u201d Mr. Edelman said. \u201cThe only reason I took this on was the challenge of making an epic film.\u201dThe result, culled from 800 hours of footage and 72 interviews, is a 7 hour 47 minute opus that wowed at its 2016 premiere at Sundance. The filmmaker Michael Moore, in an interview with the Bagger, called the work \u201cepic\u201d and \u201cbrilliant,\u201d and very much a film. He also noted that a few years ago, he successfully pushed for tighter academy rules to ensure that documentaries had proper theatrical releases.\u201cWe wanted to make sure that the system was not abused by TV networks to cop an extra gold statue,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that that\u2019s what was going on here. I don\u2019t think they begin their mornings at ESPN with: \u2018How do we get Oscars gold? I know \u2014 we need a nine-hour movie! That\u2019s it!\u2019\u201dAnother question about \u201cO. J.\u201d is whether it\u2019s fair for a work presented as a mini-series to be granted Oscar contention, and what precedent that might set. However, the film was broadcast all in one day, once, with commercials, on ESPN.Very long films have gained Oscar attention before. \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d which is more than seven hours, won best foreign-language film in 1969. \u201cLittle Dorrit,\u201d at about six hours, landed two nominations in 1989, apparently a year of great patience, for it was also when \u201cHotel Terminus,\u201d a four-and-a-half-hour film about Klaus Barbie, took home the Oscar for best documentary feature. Among the most famous Oscar snubs is Claude Lanzmann\u2019s 10-hour 1985 documentary, \u201cShoah,\u201d which didn\u2019t land a nomination.It\u2019s hard to say if any ill feelings toward Mr. Edelman\u2019s \u201cO. J.\u201d are really a thing or the product of sour grapes or whisper campaigns, which documentaries \u2014 especially those leading the race \u2014 are not immune to. \u201cI can guarantee you there is no one on that shortlist who didn\u2019t wish they\u2019d made it,\u201d said John Battsek, executive producer of the Oscar-winning nonfiction \u201cSearching for Sugar Man.\u201dMr. Kenner was evasive about whether he saw \u201cO. J.\u201d as movie or mini, but said stretching the boundaries of documentaries was a good thing: \u201cThe fact is it did qualify, and to judge it on its merits, it was a totally superior piece of work.\u201dAnd Ms. Johnson said she unequivocally saw it as a great film.\u201cA film finds its length, and if a film can earn its presence, that is what matters,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cMany subjects demand much more time than we give them to actually succeed. The directorial vision of Ezra was to understand that there is so much ignored context in the story of O. J., that the time was really needed.\u201dOf course, Mr. Edelman would much rather talk about the film itself, and the issues in it. By revealing, among other things, the ugly history between the Los Angeles Police Department and African-Americans, the documentary provided context for why Mr. Simpson\u2019s acquittal unleashed such joy among some African-Americans.\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I never understood why African-Americans responded the way they did to the verdict; now I get it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Edelman said. \u201cFor people to come away with a new perspective and a newfound understanding that they lacked before, that\u2019s not even a compliment.

It puts Apple and Google in a difficult position. The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens.When LinkedIn\u2019s website was blocked, the apps stopped functioning properly. Removing them from the Google Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store may not have cut off access to content, but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps.\u201cApps are the new choke point of free expression,\u201d said Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America.LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service, which the company confirmed was extended to apps in Russian Apple and Google Play stores.\u201cIt denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,\u201d said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn.Apple confirmed it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. It has also confirmed it was asked by China to block The New York Times app, but declined to comment further on both events. Google would not confirm it has removed LinkedIn in Russia but said it adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates.\u201cInternet free speech and internet freedom are increasingly under attack all over the globe, and not just from authoritarian regimes,\u201d said Robert M. McDowell, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission and partner at Cooley law firm. \u201cIt appears to be a one-way ratchet with speech control getting tighter.\u201dLinkedIn has several million users in Russia, it said. In November, a Russian court ruled that the professional networking site broke local laws that require foreign internet firms to keep their servers holding information on Russian accounts within the nation.Most American internet companies in Russia operate in violation of the law, but without explanation, Russian regulators at a body known as Roskomnadzor took the rare step of enforcing its rules. The Russian regulators could not be immediately reached for comment.Advertisement"}

But many people still find these systems too unreliable, or annoying, to use for more than the most simple tasks, like \u201cCall Mom.\u201dThat isn\u2019t stopping auto and tech companies from trying to give drivers the ability to do even more things by talking to their cars \u2014 while keeping their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. The efforts have some added urgency now, as states pass stricter laws aimed at curbing distracted driving. Under a California law that went into effect Jan. 1, holding or operating a phone while driving is now prohibited.This week at the International CES, the giant electronics conference in Las Vegas, Ford Motor announced that owners of its cars would soon be able to use Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice-activated assistant in their vehicles. Drivers will be able to ask for a weather report, stream music from Amazon Music or add appointments to their calendars. They will also be able to use Alexa from home to start or unlock their cars remotely.But the automaker also envisions drivers using Alexa to help with other tasks \u2014 like shopping on Amazon. Stuck in traffic? You can take care of Valentine\u2019s Day by saying, \u201cAlexa, order flowers on Amazon.\u201dOther companies are moving in the same direction. Apple\u2019s Siri can be used to control iPhone functions in cars, and Apple\u2019s CarPlay software allows drivers to dictate text messages while driving, as well as program destinations into Apple Maps and have the route plotted on the car\u2019s display. Google\u2019s Android Auto can do the same.In the last year, carmakers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and General Motors have also introduced improved voice-recognition systems that can understand normal spoken words for many tasks. Older systems required drivers to learn specific commands.With newer models, owners can program in a destination just by saying the address, as if speaking to another person. In older cars, the state, city and street had to be given separately, one at a time \u2014 and if you were lucky, each was correctly understood.While more advanced systems like Alexa will make it easier for drivers to use voice commands, there are still hurdles. The biggest is just changing habits, and persuading people to try talking to their cars.On the day before Thanksgiving, Frank Krieber bought a 2016 Dodge Challenger, granite gray, with a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 engine, and the latest version of the Uconnect infotainment system. A few days later, when he set off on a road trip to Florida from his home in Michigan, he synced his phone to the car, but didn\u2019t bother to use the voice-recognition capabilities to enter destinations or handle other tasks.\u201cI probably should use it, but it\u2019s just easier to put in an address manually, so I haven\u2019t really played around with it,\u201d said Mr. Krieber, a sales executive for a computer company. \u201cMy experience so far has been, when you tell it to do something, it doesn\u2019t do what you want.\u201dOlder cars used voice-recognition systems that were built into the car and had limited computing power and memory. Now that more and more cars have wireless connections, the voice-recognition processing can be done via the internet in distant computers and servers, what the tech industry calls the cloud.That is an advantage that Ford sees in using Alexa, said Don Butler, Ford\u2019s executive director for connected vehicle and services. \u201cIf you have the voice recognition done outside the car, people will see a much greater ability to interpret normal, everyday speech,\u201d he said.With Alexa, a user will need to download an Alexa app to a phone and carry the phone in the car, creating the connection with the cloud.Ford and Amazon have also developed a way to get Alexa to work seamlessly with a Ford car\u2019s own built-in entertainment and navigation systems. Alexa will first be available in a few months in battery-powered and hybrid models like the Focus Electric and Fusion Energi, and later in other Ford models.\u201cYou can ask Alexa where the nearest Starbucks is, and have her program the address into the Ford navigation system for you,\u201d Mr. Butler said.For Amazon, the collaboration with Ford is another illustration of a broader push by technology giants to push their versions of voice assistants, which are made to perform simple tasks like turning on lights at home, playing music and fetching sports scores from the internet.Apple was an early entrant into the market with its Siri assistant for iPhones. Google has its Assistant and a new connected speaker featuring the voice technology called Google Home. And Samsung, which has announced plans to buy the audio and automobile technology company Harman International Industries, last year agreed to acquire a voice assistant start-up, Viv Labs.Many analysts believe Amazon has vaulted to a leadership position in the race with the surprise success of the Echo family of smart speakers. While Amazon does not reveal sales figures for its devices, the company recently said that the Echo speaker and a smaller device called Echo Dot were the best-selling products on Amazon last year.Amazon has been more aggressive than other tech giants in getting other companies like Ford to integrate Alexa into their products. Dozens of other companies were expected to announce plans at CES to allow people to control their devices using Alexa.The satellite television provider Dish Network said people who use its Hopper digital video recorders would be able to use Alexa voice commands to change channels and play movies. Lenovo, the computer maker, announced its own Alexa-based speaker, Lenovo Smart Assistant. The maker of Seiki, Westinghouse Electronics and Element Electronics televisions said it would build Alexa into the remote controls for some 4K sets from those brands.In California, Mr. Smith-Fagan would welcome better voice recognition. \u201cWith the new law we have, I\u2019m kind of worried, because everyone\u2019s going to have to find a way to use the phone without touching it with your hands,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Orders Registration of App Stores", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 In the clearest sign yet that China\u2019s government has begun a new push to solidify control over mobile apps, a regulator has ordered the registration of app stores across the country.\u201cMany apps have been found to spread illegal information, violate user rights or contain security risks,\u201d the post read. It said the purpose of the registration was to ensure that it is clear who takes responsibility if apps, or app stores, are found to engage in illegal practices.Beijing has begun pushing harder to enforce a law passed last year that barred apps from engaging in activities deemed to endanger national security or disrupt social order, terms that are often broadly applied to discussion of politically sensitive topics.While the Chinese authorities have long maintained tight controls over the internet, smartphone apps have presented new challenges.Because Google\u2019s store for apps using its Android operating system is blocked in China, a large number of third-party stores have arisen to take its place. Most of China\u2019s biggest app stores are controlled by its largest internet and smartphone companies, including Tencent, Baidu, Qihoo 360, Xiaomi and Alibaba.The profusion of third-party stores has led to multiple versions of apps and low security standards on the sites where they are commonly downloaded, according to analysts.Government monitoring of content and discussions can also be more difficult on mobile apps than on websites. Content that would be strictly blocked on the internet can often be found on Chinese apps, though the authorities have occasionally banned apps that hosted such content.As with many Chinese laws and government orders, the notice posted Friday is vague, but it does appear to place some responsibility for policing apps\u2019 activity on the app stores themselves.Chinese laws are often intentionally broad and open-ended to allow regulators discretion in enforcing them. For that reason, concrete steps like the registrations ordered Friday can provide the first indication of how laws will be carried out in practice.While the impact the order will have on China\u2019s mobile internet is not clear, it could ultimately lead to a culling of apps that store owners are uncomfortable with, including ones from foreign companies, which could be more difficult to identify or rein in.Still, it may take years for the government to exert control over all the app stores in the country. Carrying out such edicts is often a slow process; for example, efforts to ensure that online profiles are linked to the user\u2019s real name have been continuing for more than a decade.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

But in recent months, Ms. Atwood has been hearing from anxious readers who see eerie parallels between the novel\u2019s oppressive society and the current Republican administration\u2019s policy goals of curtailing reproductive rights.In 2016, sales of the book, which is in its 52nd printing, were up 30 percent over the previous year. Ms. Atwood\u2019s publisher has reprinted 100,000 copies in the last three months to meet a spike in demand after the election.\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is among several classic dystopian novels that seem to be resonating with readers at a moment of heightened anxiety about the state of American democracy. Sales have also risen drastically for George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d and \u201c1984,\u201d which shot to the top of Amazon\u2019s best-seller list this week.To many observers, her comment evoked Orwell\u2019s vision of a totalitarian society in which language becomes a political weapon and reality itself is defined by those in power. The remarks prompted a cascade of Twitter messages referencing Orwell and \u201c1984.\u201d According to a Twitter spokesman, the novel was referenced more than 290,000 times on the social network this week. The book began climbing Amazon\u2019s best-seller list, which in turn drove more readers to it, in a sort of algorithm-driven feedback loop. It amounted to a blizzard of free advertising for a 68-year-old novel.On Wednesday, the CNN host Van Jones read a famous passage from the novel about efforts to force citizens to \u201creject the evidence of your eyes and ears,\u201d and urged his viewers not to become complacent when faced with a barrage of falsehoods. \u201cLet\u2019s not go down the Orwellian road, and I hope that\u2019s not where Trump is trying to lead us,\u201d he said.Of course, it is not the first time that readers and pundits have invoked the novel to criticize the actions and statements of a government. It is such a standard trope that Orwell\u2019s name has become an adjective. And because so many American readers are exposed to the novel in high school or college, most people have a passing familiarity with its basic themes about the dangers of authoritarianism, and use phrases like \u201cbig brother\u201d as a shorthand to describe a multitude of things, from Google to homeland security.\u201cIt\u2019s a frame of reference that people can reach for in response to government deception, propaganda, the misuse of language, and those are things that occur all the time,\u201d said Alex Woloch, an English professor at Stanford University who has written about the roots of Orwell\u2019s political language. \u201cThere are certain things this administration is doing that has set off these alarm bells, and people are hungry for frames of reference to understand this new reality.\u201dThe sudden prominence of such novels reflects a renewed public interest in decades-old works of speculative fiction as guides for understanding our current political moment. Readers who are grappling with a jolting shift in American politics, when easily verifiable facts are subject to debate and civil liberties and democratic norms feel fragile, are turning to dystopian novels for guidance and insight.\u201cMany of these books are becoming more important to the average American reader because they want to know what\u2019s next, because we\u2019ve never been through this before,\u201d said the novelist Gary Shteyngart, author of the dystopian novel \u201cSuper Sad True Love Story. \u201cLanguage is being used to destabilize people\u2019s perception of reality, and that\u2019s very new to this country.\u201dReaders may also be returning to the comfort (if you can call it that) of familiar dystopian novels because these stories offer moral clarity at a time when it can be difficult to keep up with the convulsions of the daily news cycle, and the fire hose of information and disinformation on social media.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a feeling that nonfiction has failed us, that journalism has not been able to keep up with things,\u201d Mr. Shteyngart said.\u201cThe book has certainly been known and alluded to since its publication, but now it\u2019s really caught on because there are so many astonishing parallels to the present,\u201d said Michael Meyer, an emeritus English professor at the University of Connecticut, who wrote an introduction to the novel. \u201cIt\u2019s a satire about the politics of someone like Trump.\u201dThe novel \u201c1984\u201d is a reliable best seller \u2014 it was an instant hit when it was first published in 1949, and it continues to sell some 400,000 paperback copies in the United States annually. Still, the recent demand caught the publisher and some booksellers off guard. Signet, which publishes the mass-market paperback edition of \u201c1984,\u201d is reprinting 200,000 more copies of the book, and another 100,000 copies of \u201cAnimal Farm.\u201d (Its edition of \u201c1984\u201d is currently out of stock on Amazon.)\u201cWe\u2019re getting significant reorders from all our accounts,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cWe\u2019ve printed, just this week, about half of what we normally sell in a year.\u201dPublishers and book retailers have been quick to seize the momentum and take advantage of renewed interest in decades-old titles. The Amazon page for \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d now features a bold print quote from Salon, calling the book \u201cthe novel that foreshadowed Donald Trump\u2019s authoritarian appeal.\u201d This week, Penguin started an online advertising and social media campaign to promote \u201c1984,\u201d which included posts with quotes from the novel on Facebook and Instagram.There\u2019s perhaps another reason that readers are returning to \u201c1984\u201d and other dystopian classics during unsettling times. Sometimes, it\u2019s nice to be reminded that things could be worse.Advertisement"}

The book is as compelling \u2014 and as problematic \u2014 as her magazine writing: vivid, maddening, heartbreaking, very funny, chaotic and repetitive, as benders are.On a recent Tuesday, Ms. Marnell, now 34, welcomed me into her Chinatown apartment, a one-bedroom overlooking the on-ramp to the Manhattan Bridge. The place, which she rented a year and a half ago, was decorated with stacks of addiction memoirs; a sheepskin rug upon which was laid a strand of blue Christmas lights aglow; a gray wool sofa; a few framed Takashi Murakami prints; and a poster of Harry Styles of the pop boy band One Direction.Birdlike and delicate-looking, Ms. Marnell wore bell-bottom jeans, a pink tank top and a waist-length wig in candy colors, one of a sizable collection she has amassed since her hair fell out a few years ago, she isn\u2019t quite sure why. She ordered three cups of coffee from a nearby deli, smoked a Marlboro Light very quickly, blowing the smoke out of the sliding glass windows that open to a fire escape, and then poured herself a glass of white wine.The following interview has been edited and condensed.I\u2019ve just finished reading your book, which is harrowing, so I\u2019m a little shaken.Dude, that was four years ago. I have everything now but hair, though I\u2019m not in recovery and I\u2019m not clean. People are like, \u201cIs it so brave to tell everything?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo.\u201d For me, being brave would be being in a program and getting clean, instead of \u201cI found a way to talk about my problems ad nauseam and somehow get paid for it.\u201d Not that I want to reduce what I\u2019ve accomplished. I want to say good things.One idea about addiction is that it\u2019s a way to impose structure on a chaotic world. Ann Marlowe\u2019s memoir of her heroin addiction, \u201cHow to Stop Time: Heroin From A to Z,\u201d out in 2000, is a compelling example. And you still take Adderall and Ambien, right? Yes. That\u2019s really true. People think of addicts as being out of control, and they really are. But I\u2019m also a control freak. I want to control everything with a pill, from my appetite to sleeping.Do you feel you\u2019ve been exploited by the magazines you worked for?No. Addicts exploit people. I exploited every opportunity. I have my whole life. The thing about addiction, everyone is asking, Don\u2019t you think addiction books are tired? But I think addiction is as human an experience as anything, like heartbreak. It\u2019s like any relationship, a marriage, a divorce, it\u2019s a relationship and it\u2019s human. I wrote this book really for younger people, for the girl I used to be.Your father, a psychiatrist, prescribed you Ritalin when you were a teenager.If my father had been a gun owner, he wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about having a gun in his office, and I wouldn\u2019t have touched it or done anything violent. But in the same way, as a doctor, he didn\u2019t think twice about having samples of Zoloft in his home office. And at 12 years old I did steal samples of antidepressants and bring them to school and take them in front of my friends because I wanted to be cool. I think I am hard-wired for addiction. My father is a good man, and a good dad, and so ethical and I manipulated him for years. But this is the problem. Parents are putting their children on drugs, but they don\u2019t think of them as drugs. They think of them as medication.You were good at magazines, even when you were a little girl, making zines up in your bedroom. You write that you always wanted to be a beauty editor. Cond\u00e9 Nast editors were like movie stars to me. When I got to Lucky and saw them in the halls, I wanted to huff Anna Wintour. I would stare at Grace Coddington and her fruity red hair. I wanted to be like them so badly, and I did everything I could to fit in. I want my ashes sprinkled in the Cond\u00e9 Nast library. I have a whole collection of magazines in storage. Italian Vogues. Lucky was on the same floor as the international editions, and I got a lot there.I think about Diana Vreeland, she was so fabulous. Her \u201cWhy Don\u2019t Yous\u201d were better than anything on the internet. I\u2019ve been trying to start a list of my own. I just thought of one yesterday: Why don\u2019t you cultivate a wee garden of carnivorous plants so you can lord over them?So magazines were everything to me; it never felt like work. It\u2019s crazy that they are nothing now. I feel so embarrassed having this sleazy book sometimes. Did I just sell out everyone in my life including my parents?Let\u2019s talk about your internet reputation. If you Google \u201cCat Marnell,\u201d the predominant image is of you in a slip, with smeared lipstick and matted hair and words written in Sharpie on your forearms. Is this the result of a bender or was it your intention to go for a full-on Courtney Love look? I\u2019ve always homaged. Let\u2019s just say it was one night, and it was intentional. It interests me that women paint their face every day. So I was at an event, and I just smeared it.On purpose?Yes. The reason it\u2019s used over and over is because I never showed up for that many things. I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. But as a beauty editor who had a drug addiction at the same time, when I got positive attention for that, things just started to meld. Also, I was smoking a lot of PCP.Your book is dedicated to \u201call the party girls.\u201d Can you elaborate? I always wanted to be a party girl. But party girls don\u2019t exist in recovery or rehab. I didn\u2019t know until I lost my career that I was an addict and not just a person with problems. Girls come up to me in the nightclubs now, and I see them trotting around in their miniskirts and their flea market rabbit coats and I love them. I was lucky enough to have such strong female mentors, surrogate mother figures like Jean Godfrey-June [Lucky\u2019s beauty director and one of Ms. Marnell\u2019s long-suffering bosses] in roles I forced on them. Now, I don\u2019t have a way to mentor young girls. I don\u2019t work in magazines or have a job. I can\u2019t coach them, but I can talk from an authentic place about what it\u2019s really like to go through this stuff. I\u2019m a privileged person, I\u2019ve never had to struggle, but I\u2019ve been through it.An earlier version of this article misidentified the bridge that is visible from Cat Marnell\u2019s apartment.

{"Headline": "San Francisco Asks: Where Have All the Children Gone?", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In a compact studio apartment on the fringes of the Castro district here a young couple live with their demanding 7-year-old, whom they dote on and take everywhere: a Scottish terrier named Olive.Raising children is on the agenda for Daisy Yeung, a high school science teacher, and Slin Lee, a software engineer. But just not in San Francisco.\u201cWhen we imagine having kids, we think of somewhere else,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to feel like a no-kids type of city.\u201dA few generations ago, before the technology boom transformed San Francisco and sent housing costs soaring, the city was alive with children and families. Today it has the lowest percentage of children of any of the largest 100 cities in America, according to census data, causing some here to raise an alarm.\u201cEverybody talks about children being our future,\u201d said Norman Yee, a member of San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors. \u201cIf you have no children around, what\u2019s our future?\u201dAs an urban renaissance has swept through major American cities in recent decades, San Francisco\u2019s population has risen to historical highs and a forest of skyscraping condominiums has replaced tumbledown warehouses and abandoned wharves. At the same time, the share of children in San Francisco fell to 13 percent, low even compared with another expensive city, New York, with 21 percent. In Chicago, 23 percent of the population is under 18 years old, which is also the overall average across the United States.California, which has one of the world\u2019s 10 largest economies, recently released data showing the lowest birthrate since the Great Depression.As San Francisco moves toward a one-industry town with soaring costs, the dearth of children is one more change that raises questions about its character. Are fewer children making San Francisco more one-dimensional and less vibrant? The answer is subjective and part of an impassioned debate over whether a new, wealthier San Francisco can retain the allure of the city it is replacing.Many immigrant and other residential areas of San Francisco still have their share of the very young and the very old. The sidewalks of some wealthy enclaves even have stroller gridlock on weekends. But when you walk through the growing number of neighborhoods where employees of Google, Twitter and so many other technology companies live or work, the sidewalks display a narrow band of humanity, as if life started at 22 and ended somewhere around 40.\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll be walking through the city and I\u2019ll see a child and think, \u2018Hey, wait a second. What are you doing here?\u2019\u201d said Courtney Nam, who works downtown at a tech start-up. \u201cYou don\u2019t really see that many kids.\u201dThere is one statistic that the city\u2019s natives have heard too many times. San Francisco, population 865,000, has roughly the same number of dogs as children: 120,000. In many areas of the city, pet grooming shops seem more common than schools.In an interview last year, Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor and a co-founder of PayPal, described San Francisco as \u201cstructurally hostile to families.\u201dProhibitive housing costs are not the only reason there are relatively few children. A public school system of uneven quality, the attractiveness of the less-foggy suburbs to families, and the large number of gay men and women, many of them childless, have all played roles in the decline in the number of children, which began with white flight from the city in the 1970s. The tech boom now reinforces the notion that San Francisco is a place for the young, single and rich.\u201cIf you get to the age that you\u2019re going to have kids in San Francisco and you haven\u2019t made your million \u2014 or more \u2014 you probably begin to think you have to leave,\u201d said Richard Florida, an expert in urban demographics and author of \u201cThe Rise of the Creative Class.\u201dMr. Florida sees a larger national trend. Jobs in America have become more specialized and the country\u2019s demography has become more segmented, he says. Technology workers who move to San Francisco and Silicon Valley anticipate long hours and know they may have to put off having families.\u201cIt\u2019s a statement on our age that in order to make it in our more advanced, best and most-skilled industries you really have to sacrifice,\u201d Mr. Florida said. \u201cAnd the sacrifice may be your family.\u201dMr. Yee, the supervisor, is urging his colleagues to hold hearings next month on the issue of children.\u201cFor me it\u2019s part of the fabric of what a city should have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes us all care more.\u201dThe city has also invested millions in upgrading parks, according to Phil Ginsburg, the general manager of the city\u2019s Recreation and Parks Department.\u201cWe are trying to do our part to send a very strong message that San Francisco is an awesome place for kids,\u201d Mr. Ginsburg said. The city has increased its offerings for summer programs, many of which were fully enrolled last summer.Yet even those with the means to stay find themselves looking elsewhere when children come along.Liz Devlin, a senior manager at Twitter, which like other technology companies offers generous parental leave, took 20 weeks off at full pay when her second child, Jack, was born in 2014.Living in a three-bedroom apartment in the Marina district, Ms. Devlin said, she considered San Francisco a \u201cphenomenal place to raise kids.\u201dBut last July when the energetic Jack turned 2, she and her husband decided it was time to leave.\u201cIn terms of cost of living, space and schools I think it\u2019s definitely attractive for people to look outside the city,\u201d said Ms. Devlin, who moved across the Golden Gate Bridge to Marin County.Those who make it work in San Francisco speak of the compromises.Jean Covington, a San Francisco resident who works as a public defender in Contra Costa County, said she noticed a \u201cpilgrimage\u201d of her friends out of the city when children reached school age. When she decided to stick it out, she was confronted with what she described as a bewildering public school selection system governed by an algorithm that determines where children in the city are placed \u2014 sometimes miles from home.When her daughter turned 5, Ms. Covington applied to 14 public kindergartens, but her child ended up being placed in another. She chose a private school instead, along with the strain on the family budget that it entailed.\u201cEveryone starts off with the same dreams: \u2018I\u2019m going to make it work in the city, and I\u2019m going to be the family that sticks it out,\u2019\u201d Ms. Covington said of her friends. \u201cAnd suddenly the one bathroom in their flat becomes two or three too few. And the school system is too daunting.\u201dSan Francisco\u2019s public school system has around 53,000 students, a sharp drop from 90,000 in 1970.The decline is a reflection both of families leaving the city and wealthier parents sending their children to private schools. Around 30 percent of San Francisco children attend private school, the highest rate among large American cities.Opinion is divided on whether having fewer children in the city is something San Francisco should worry about.Mr. Florida, the expert in urban demographics, said a lack of children made a city \u201ca little bit more of a colder or harder place.\u201dMr. Lee, the software engineer, said he loved San Francisco \u2014 the weather, the food, the friends he has made. But the city, he said, feels somewhat detached from the life cycle.\u201cIt\u2019s similar to when you go to college and you are surrounded by people who are in the same life stage or who have the same attitude about what their priorities are,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cThat\u2019s all you see: people who are exactly like you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Republicans, Under Fire, Back Down on Gutting Ethics Office", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was supposed to be a triumphant morning for Republicans on Capitol Hill \u2014 a moment to demonstrate the merits of unified party rule in the age of Donald J. Trump. By noon, party leaders had a message for their charges: It was not going smoothly.By midmorning, Mr. Trump had weighed in, questioning the members\u2019 priorities on Twitter. Shortly after, lawmakers were summoned to the basement of the Capitol for a hastily convened meeting with Republican leaders.Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader \u2014 who, along with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, had opposed the proposal \u2014 lobbed a pointed question at his fellow Republicans, according to two people present: Had they campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act, or tinkering with an ethics office? Minutes later, members emerged to say the changes had been scrapped.House Republicans, led by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, had sought on Monday to prevent the office from pursuing investigations that might result in criminal charges. Instead, they wanted to allow lawmakers on the more powerful House Ethics Committee to shut down inquiries. They even sought to block the small staff at the Office of Congressional Ethics, which would have been renamed and put under the oversight of House lawmakers, from speaking to the news media.\u201cIt has damaged or destroyed a lot of political careers in this place, and it\u2019s cost members of Congress millions of dollars to defend themselves against anonymous allegations,\u201d Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, said Tuesday, still defending the move.\u201cIt was a stumble,\u201d said Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina, who opposed the measure and who was himself the subject of an ethics investigation while he was governor of South Carolina. \u201cProbably not the way you want to start out.\u201dMr. Trump had weighed in via a series of Twitter posts, suggesting that the House should be focused on domestic policy priorities such as health care and a tax overhaul. He called the Office of Congressional Ethics \u201cunfair\u201d but said focusing on it now was a case of misplaced priorities. He appended the hashtag \u201cDTS,\u201d an apparent allusion to his promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington.At first, on Tuesday morning, Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy played down the changes. Mr. McCarthy suggested that he and Mr. Ryan did not have the power to simply order other Republicans to take their advice.About an hour later, before new members of Congress were to be sworn in \u2014 the point when the House adopts new rules that will govern how it conducts itself during the two-year session \u2014 Mr. McCarthy told his fellow Republicans that they needed to reverse themselves quickly, or potentially face an even more embarrassing revolt on the House floor. By his estimation, he told them, the provision was going to be removed one way or another.This was not the first time that House lawmakers \u2014 Democrats or Republicans \u2014 had tried to curtail the powers or budget of the Office of Congressional Ethics, which some lawmakers see as being too aggressive in its investigations, even though it is routinely cheered by nonprofit ethics groups on both the left and the right.The House Ethics Committee, the only body that has the power to actually punish lawmakers, also frequently clashed with the office, which serves more as a grand jury that investigates allegations and issues findings to the Ethics Committee of probable cause of misdeeds.House rules require the Ethics Committee to act on recommendations by the Office of Congressional Ethics within 90 days, with the expectation that it will either formally clear the targeted lawmakers or create investigative committees to determine if rules or laws have been violated. But in recent years, the committee has increasingly relied on a loophole that allows it to informally continue to review allegations without closing a case, a step it has taken in 21 of the 68 cases referred since 2009.After their reversal on Tuesday, House Republicans agreed to ask the Ethics Committee to examine the Office of Congressional Ethics and recommend possible changes by this summer to address the concerns that some members have raised.Mr. Goodlatte, who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, defended his proposal and called the reporting about it inaccurate.\u201cGross misrepresentation by opponents of my amendment, and the media willing to go along with this agenda, resulted in a flurry of misconceptions and unfounded claims about the true purpose of this amendment,\u201d he said in a statement.But Mr. Goodlatte\u2019s critics said he had simply been caught trying to sneak through a favor to help protect his fellow lawmakers.\u201cWe\u2019re glad that the House Republicans listened to the public outrage about this proposal and came to their senses to reverse it, and not end real ethics enforcement in Congress,\u201d Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Data Could Be the Next Tech Hot Button for Regulators", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byWealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on.Now data \u2014 gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations \u2014 is increasingly a focus of technology competition. And academics and some policy makers, especially in Europe, are considering whether big internet companies like Google and Facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation.In recent years, Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion, privacy or antitrust investigations. But in the coming years, who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in American tech giants.As government regulators dig into this new era of data competition, they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make. Using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit, for example. And higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services.The competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990s about software and Microsoft. The worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers, and gather more data, a powerful \u201cnetwork effect\u201d effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform, like Google in search or Facebook in consumer social networks.Evidence of the rising importance of data can be seen from the frontiers of artificial intelligence to mainstream business software. And certain data sets can be remarkably valuable for companies working on those technologies.Microsoft is betting LinkedIn, combined with data on how hundreds of millions of workers use its Office 365 online software, and consumer data from search behavior on Bing, will \u201cpower a set of insights that we think is unprecedented,\u201d said James Phillips, vice president for business applications at Microsoft.IBM estimates that 70 percent of the world\u2019s data is not out on the public web, but in private databases, often to protect privacy or trade secrets. IBM\u2019s strategy is to take the data it has acquired, add customer data and use that to train its Watson artificial intelligence software to pursue such tasks as helping medical researchers discover novel disease therapies, or flagging suspect financial transactions for independent auditors.\u201cOur focus is mainly on nonpublic data sets and extending that advantage for clients in business and science,\u201d said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s Watson and cloud businesses.At Google, the company\u2019s drive into cloud-delivered business software is fueled by data, building on years of work done on its search and other consumer services, and its recent advances in image identification, speech recognition and language translation.For example, a new Google business offering \u2014 still in the test, or alpha, stage \u2014 is a software service to improve job finding and recruiting. Its data includes more than 17 million online job postings and the public profiles and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of more than 200 million people.Its machine-learning algorithms distilled that to about four million unique job titles, ranked the most common ones and identified specific skills. The job sites CareerBuilder and Dice are using the Google technology to show job seekers more relevant openings. And FedEx, the giant package shipper, is adding the service to its recruiting site.That is just one case, said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google\u2019s cloud business, of what is becoming increasingly possible \u2014 using the tools of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, to sift through huge quantities of data to provide machine-curated data services.\u201cYou can turn this technology to whatever field you want, from manufacturing to medicine,\u201d Ms. Greene said.Fei-Fei Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is taking a sabbatical to become chief scientist for artificial intelligence at Google\u2019s cloud unit. She sees working at Google as one path to pursue her career ambition to \u201cdemocratize A.I.,\u201d now that the software and data ingredients are ripe.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have the current era of A.I. without the big data revolution,\u201d Dr. Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s the digital gold.\u201dIn the A.I. race, better software algorithms can put you ahead for a year or so, but probably no more, said Andrew Ng, a former Google scientist and adjunct professor at Stanford. He is now chief scientist at Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant, and a leading figure in artificial intelligence research.Rivals, he added, cannot unlock or simulate your data. \u201cData is the defensible barrier, not algorithms,\u201d Mr. Ng said.Advertisement"}

He was 91.Mr. Nakamura began making a business of amusement in 1955. A decade after Japan\u2019s calamitous defeat in World War II, the country\u2019s economy was springing back to life, and the somber mood of the first postwar decade was retreating. Japanese were ready to embrace fun and games again.His first venture \u2014 installing two wooden horses for children to ride on the roof of a department store \u2014 was simple, and turned into a modest success.Rooftops gave him more success as time went on. In the early 1960s, he secured a deal with Mitsukoshi, a leading Japanese department store chain, to install another children\u2019s ride, this one using small replica automobiles running on tracks, on the roof of its flagship Tokyo location. The attraction, Roadway Rides, proved popular, and Mitsukoshi commissioned it for all of its stores.Real fame and fortune came later, with the rise of video games.It was conceived by a 25-year-old Namco employee, Toru Iwatani, who later said that he was inspired by the shape of a pizza with a slice missing. The \u201cPac\u201d came from the Japanese onomatopoeic word \u201cpakku,\u201d equivalent to the English \u201cgobble\u201d or \u201cmunch.\u201dAnd as fast as Pac-Man could gobble up pellets in his maze, players gobbled up Pac-Man.In the 36 years since its release, it is estimated to have been played more than 10 billion times. The Smithsonian Institution and the Museum of Modern Art have Pac-Man machines in their collections.Despite that habit \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014 he warned against what today would be called screen addiction.\u201cI am a little concerned about the way some young people play it so much,\u201d he said at the height of the Pac-Man craze. \u201cOnce it goes beyond a certain level, it is not good for young people.\u201dNamco continued to develop video games, though none could top Pac-Man\u2019s success. The company expanded into other businesses, including a chain of food-themed amusement parks in Japan, most of which have closed or been sold off. In 1993, it bought the bankrupt Japanese film studio Nikkatsu, known for output like samurai epics and soft-core pornography.Mr. Nakamura led Namco until 2002, when he took on a more ceremonial role. When Namco merged with a rival toy and game maker, Bandai, in 2005, public tax records indicated that Mr. Nakamura was Japan\u2019s 68th-richest person.Born in Yokohama, Japan, on Dec. 24, 1925, Mr. Nakamura attended what is now Yokohama National University. He studied shipbuilding, according to a short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 provided by Bandai Namco.The company did not release information on survivors, citing what it said was his family\u2019s wish for privacy.Daniel E.

{"Headline": "Tiffany Trump Looked West for Her Inauguration Dress", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byStyles Q. and A.While Melania and Ivanka Trump looked to the New York fashion circle for their inaugural ball gowns, Tiffany Trump, the president\u2019s younger daughter and the only child from his marriage to Marla Maples, looked west to Southern California, where she is from. Ms. Trump, 23, relied on the dressmaker Simin Taghdiri of Simin Couture for her rhinestone-decorated baby pink and silver damask strapless mermaid gown.Ms. Taghdiri, 63, an Iranian-American who studied fashion design in Manchester, England, has had a store on North Robertson Boulevard in Beverly Hills, Calif., for years. There, a smorgasbord of Middle Eastern royals, celebrities (the country singer Reba McEntire; the actress Abigail Breslin, a friend of Ms. Trump\u2019s; and the reality TV star Lisa Vanderpump are all clients) and brides-to-be have sought her ornate creations. In fact, Ivanka Trump has worn a few Simin Couture pieces. Here, Ms. Taghdiri talks about dressing Tiffany Trump for the inaugural balls.Q. How did you come to work with Tiffany? That\u2019s not a lot of notice.Here I am (in Beverly Hills). I wouldn\u2019t have time to make it from the beginning. Luckily, I had some dresses in the store. Almost everything I do is custom. My main thing is bridal, but I put out some ready-to-wear dresses so people can buy when they walk into the store. They are more affordable.Did Tiffany and Marla go to your store for fittings?I did ask them if they would be kind of enough to come here, but they didn\u2019t have time. I flew to New York and took 10 to 12 pieces with me. They didn\u2019t give me any direction. I just Googled their names and looked at the pictures that came up to see what they had worn before.How did the meeting with them go?Marla took one dress, and Tiffany took two. Tiffany loved the one she eventually wore right away. I think, especially with the color, it was sexy but sweet. It was good for her age and good for the occasion.Have you dressed other prominent political figures?Yes, I have dressed Farah Diba (the former empress of Iran) and many princesses of Saudi Arabia.What does the other dress that Tiffany selected look like?The other option was black. We thought she shouldn\u2019t wear black. It was nicer to be in a lighter color.Did you have to do fittings, or did the dress fit well right off the hanger?There was a lot that needed to be done. I had only three or four days before they had to go to Washington. I didn\u2019t sleep!Can a strapless gown be tough for fittings?I put so much boning into it, it didn\u2019t move at all.How much did Tiffany\u2019s dress cost?I\u2019d estimate around $2,500 because of the work I did on the fittings. You can buy a ready-made evening dress of mine starting at $400, but they go into the thousands. My custom evening dresses start at $2,000, and my bridal gowns start at $4,000 and go up.What did you think of her?Tiffany is extremely well mannered. Ivanka was like that, too. We did not talk politics.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alphabet\u2019s Profits Stay Predictably Good in a Volatile Industry", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It is almost boring how predictably good Alphabet\u2019s earnings are these days \u2014 a trait not always shared by the company\u2019s tech conglomerate peers.But fourth-quarter results announced on Thursday from Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, proved once again that the company is the model of moneymaking consistency.The heart of Alphabet\u2019s consistent earnings remains the company\u2019s search engine. While a consumer can delay an iPhone purchase or shop somewhere other than Amazon, Google\u2019s search engine is an indispensable tool for anyone using the internet. The shift to mobile devices, once considered a threat to Google\u2019s search business, has only strengthened it.Google\u2019s market share on desktop search is around 78 percent, but it is above 90 percent on mobile devices, according to research from NetMarketShare.com. What is more, on smaller mobile displays, Google\u2019s ads occupy a large portion of the screen \u2014 making it more likely a user will click on them.Clicks on Google ads increased 36 percent in the quarter, but what advertisers paid for each click decreased 15 percent.Google is also sitting on many of the internet\u2019s most valuable properties \u2014 the places where people go to stay in touch on email, find driving directions or seek out entertainment.While clicks on Google\u2019s ads across the internet are rising, they are growing faster on its own websites like YouTube. Alphabet does not break out results for YouTube, but the site continues to amass a huge audience. Google said more than a billion people watched YouTube every month, viewing hundreds of millions of hours of its videos every day.Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said company assets like search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play, constituted \u201cprime time in the mobile era.\u201dEven Alphabet\u2019s unexpected hiccups are a little dull. The company\u2019s earnings per share were $7.56, or 11 cents below analysts\u2019 estimates. It said the reason for the shortfall was that it paid more in taxes. The company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 percent, compared with 5 percent in the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet said it paid more in United States taxes but did not explain why.Alphabet shares were down 2 percent in after-hours trading. The stock reached a record high on Wednesday.While the dominance of the Google search engine seems unassailable today, Alphabet is investing heavily in new technologies that may threaten its stronghold. Devices like the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated smart speaker, portend a future where artificially intelligent digital assistants fetch information without needing to access a search engine directly.Google did not provide figures for how those products sold, but the \u201cother revenue\u201d category, which included hardware sales along with revenue from Google Play, rose 62 percent to $3.4 billion.Part of the company\u2019s financial stability came from Google\u2019s creation of Alphabet in 2015. The reorganization into a holding company split the company\u2019s core search business from a growing list of fledgling operations, like the newly minted Waymo \u2014 what used to be Google\u2019s self-driving car project until it was spun off as an independent Alphabet company in 2016.Under the watch of Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, the company has scaled back costs and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 the ambition of its speculative investments into new technologies. During the quarter, Alphabet said quarterly revenue from \u201cother bets\u201d rose 75 percent to $262 million, while operating losses narrowed to $1.09 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.Advertisement"}

Why or why not?\u201dBefore they read that article, put them into partners or groups and ask them to wrestle with three questions:\u2022 What does the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d mean?\u2022 When have you or someone you know fallen for or shared fake or inaccurate news of some kind? \u2022 Why does it matter if we can\u2019t tell real news from fake news?As they share their thoughts with the whole class, collect and record as many answers and examples as you can, since these responses will probably anticipate many of the issues raised in the exercises below.

The fast evolution of the false theory revealed how a powerful mix of fake news and social media led an armed North Carolina man to investigate the rumors about the pizza place.Mr. Revkin calls this exercise a \u201cbacktrack journal.\u201d His charge to his students was this:Each week, determine the path one bit of information took to get to you. If it was a powerful photo of a drowned refugee child, did it come via Facebook? Twitter? If so, was it forwarded by a friend from some other friend or feed? Who created the content? Try to trace how information MOVES.As he points out, this exercise shows the ways in which information moves through social media and how easily its origins can become obscured._________Consider the Effects of Fake News on Democracy:What \u201cdisinformation\u201d have your students noticed this election season?The fake-news phenomenon is not the result of personal failings. And it is not limited to one end of the political spectrum. Rather, Americans\u2019 deep bias against the political party they oppose is so strong that it acts as a kind of partisan prism for facts, refracting a different reality to Republicans than to Democrats.Partisan refraction has fueled the rise of fake news, according to researchers who study the phenomenon. But the repercussions go far beyond stories shared on Facebook and Reddit, affecting Americans\u2019 faith in government \u2014 and the government\u2019s ability to function.Does this ring true for your students? Do they think they believe \u201ca wildly different sets of facts\u201d than someone on the other side of the political aisle? How, according to the article, can that become a vicious cycle that leads to more and more political extremism?After they have read and discussed, challenge your students to revisit the question we posed originally \u2014 \u201cWhy does it matter if we can\u2019t tell real news from fake news?\u201d \u2014 and add to their list anything they gleaned from the article or discussion.If there was any doubt, the uproar this week over BuzzFeed\u2019s publication of unverified allegations about President-elect Donald J. Trump made clear that the gatekeeper role once played by major news media organizations has vanished in the digital age.This poses a deep danger for legitimate, aggressive journalism, especially from the president-elect, who has been consistent in his heavy-handed demonization of any and all media whenever he dislikes critical but accurate stories about him.To make these questions tangible, students might try the following exercises:_________Ask the Right Questions:\u2022 Who made this?\u2022 How was this made?\u2022 Why was this made?\u2022 When was this made?\u2022 What is this missing?\u2022 Where do I go from here?_________Get Used to Regularly Consulting Fact-Checking SitesYou might invite your students take a look and find a rumor or news article they\u2019ve read and present the real facts to the class:FactCheck.orgSnopes.comPolitifact.com_________Curate Your Own News Ecosystem:What would yours look like?Then ask students: \u201cWhere do you get most of your news?

Mr. Singhal will also advise Anthony Levandowski, who runs the company\u2019s self-driving automobile efforts.Early in Uber\u2019s history, it and Google were more allies than enemies. Google highlighted the Uber app in its maps application as a mode of transportation, and GV, the venture capital arm of Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Uber.Mr. Singhal\u2019s move to Uber ratchets up the rivalry.

The real issue is whether human beings will do it.Farhad\u2019s statistic looks over a 30-year period. That underplays more recent advances like cheap and abundant sensors, cloud-connected computing systems and better algorithms. All of those things mean that robots are getting better at a fast rate. Throw in artificial intelligence, and robots are even faster at doing ordinary human tasks.If you believe lots of Americans should work in American factories, it gets worse. As Farhad notes, many of the robots that are doing American work are built in China. China, eager to keep people employed and stay on top of all manufacturing, has made a business of making robots. Farhad doesn\u2019t say whether the robot factories are automated.Additionally, a big reason to have automated factories in the United States, instead of manufacturing in China, is to have a better grip on quality control and local distribution to major customers. That means jobs in operations management, loading and shipping. (Self-driving trucks are still a long way off, whatever the visionaries say.)We can build a society of work around that, perhaps.

Indira left Mexico for the United States at age 6 with her parents and two younger sisters. Her mother cleaned houses when she wasn\u2019t caring for the children \u2014 there would eventually be seven of them \u2014 and her father worked in construction, and there was no money for after-school lessons or soccer clubs, let alone traveling. \u201cI\u2019d hear about trips and experiences of my white friends, and I remember thinking: I\u2019ll never go to the beach or Disney World for spring break,\u201d Indira says. Her parents told her that education was all that mattered, and she had to spend all her free time inside, reading and writing. \u201cI tell my children this country is a blessing to all the people living here,\u201d her mother told me. \u201cIf you have the opportunity to be good, it\u2019s very important to take it.\u201d Indira took this advice to heart. By the time she was in fifth grade, her reading skills had improved so much that she tested into the top reading group. By middle school, she consistently got A\u2019s, which qualified her for a celebratory school trip every time report cards came out. \u201cThey rewarded us by taking us skating or bowling,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like I was so smart, just getting the chance to go out for the whole school day with friends. That\u2019s when I said: \u2018I can make it.\u2019\u2009\u201dIndira began to throw herself into everything. At recess, she played soccer and basketball, competing so fiercely that everyone took notice. Boys usually picked other boys for their teams, and white kids tended to favor other white kids. But everyone started picking Indira. In middle school, she was on the track team, running long-distance races. Her coach was stunned by her determination. In meets, even when she won her event, she scolded herself unless she broke her previous record. After practices ended, she would keep running. \u201cI wanted to think,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d stay after practice and run and run and run.\u201dIndira remembers understanding vaguely that it wasn\u2019t just poverty that set her and her family apart. Her parents had been doctors in Mexico. She admired pictures in their dresser drawer of the two of them in their 20s standing together, tall and proud in their white coats \u2014 before they all fled the violence of drug gangs who were then taking over their home state, Guerrero. When she asked her parents why they were no longer doctors, they explained it was because they were not American citizens. It didn\u2019t make sense to Indira. Why would her father have shed that beautiful crisp white coat for the fraying pants and shirts he now wore?Soon after Indira turned 13, in 2011, she was riding home from track practice with her mother when another car sideswiped the family\u2019s Ford Expedition. The other driver, who was at fault, insisted on calling the police, according to Indira and a lawyer who assisted the family. Indira pleaded not to involve the police, explaining that her mother did not have a driver\u2019s license because she was not an American citizen. (In Georgia and most other states, undocumented immigrants cannot obtain driver\u2019s licenses.) But the driver said she needed a police report to get insurance to cover the damage to her car.A police officer arrived and asked for Indira\u2019s mother\u2019s license. When she said she did not have one \u2014 a state crime \u2014 she was told to get out of the car. Indira got out, too. She remembers two of her younger siblings sleeping in the back, one in a booster seat, one in a car seat. Two elders from the church they attended arrived to ask for mercy. She has seven children, they told the officer. He responded that he was simply enforcing the law. Indira\u2019s mother turned to her and began to cry. \u201cIndira, I don\u2019t know what is going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to take me.\u201d Indira remembers remaining strangely calm. \u201cWhen she was being handcuffed, I said: \u2018Mom, everything is going to be O.K.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cThat woke me up,\u201d Indira says. \u201cUntil then, I thought the world was happy.\u201d In fact, she now realized, it was only American citizens who seemed truly happy. \u201cIt must feel pretty good, I guess, to not have to worry about whether your family could be taken away any day.\u201dShe was distressed to discover that Georgia barred undocumented immigrants from attending its top public universities and charged them out-of-state tuition at all others \u2014 triple the rate for citizen residents. She then turned to researching financial aid and learned that Congress barred her from accessing federal Pell grants, loans, scholarships and work-study jobs \u2014 the most common forms of assistance for low-income students. At first, she greeted this as just another set of obstacles to surmount, but as time went on, she began to despair. She would retreat to the classroom of her science teacher, Teresa Leach, who had become her mentor, in need of encouragement. \u201cThere were a couple of times when I just cried to her because I was tired,\u201d she said. \u201cI questioned myself if it was all worth the effort.\u201d All the while, Indira told me, she held onto her religious conviction that God had a plan, and that she must respect it.At a college fair attended by representatives of numerous Georgia colleges, she asked admissions officers what kind of help was available for undocumented students. No one had any to offer her. She switched her focus to private colleges and was admitted to Atlanta\u2019s Agnes Scott, which she says awarded her $20,000 annually in financial aid, less than half of what she needed. She researched full-ride private scholarships and found two for undocumented students, but she was selected for neither. She was awarded seven small scholarships, which totaled $10,000, enough to go to a nearby public commuter college for only one semester at the out-of-state tuition rate.Last May, Indira attended her graduation ceremony at Gainesville High School, but she had nowhere to go next. In every picture from that day, she wears a wide smile, but she was in pain inside, particularly when she caught a glimpse of her mother in the crowd, looking distraught. Unable to bring herself to celebrate with friends, she went home to be with her family.Days later, a friend told her about a philanthropic organization called TheDream.US, which was offering undocumented students full four-year scholarships to Delaware State University or Eastern Connecticut State University. The application was demanding, and only 76 students would be chosen. She poured herself into the essays, spending hours composing them alongside an English teacher, Cindy Lloyd. She applied to Delaware State, a historically black college in Dover, five hours closer to home than Eastern Connecticut. In late June, she received an email from TheDream.US. \u201cI saw \u2018Congratulations,\u2019\u2009\u201d she remembers, \u201cand I read no more.\u201dIn late August, Indira made the 11-hour drive with her parents from Gainesville to Delaware State in unusual silence. She was thinking hard about each of her six younger siblings, wondering how they would fare without her. Over breakfast at a Cracker Barrel in South Carolina, when her mother pressed her about how she was feeling, she talked only of her concerns about not being at home to help everyone. When she arrived on campus \u2014 a flat expanse of grassy courtyards and buildings amid strip malls, auto dealers and chain restaurants just beyond Dover\u2019s historic capital area \u2014 she found 33 other \u201copportunity scholars,\u201d just as worried and hopeful as she was. All of them were assigned to a dorm about a quarter of a mile from the D.S.U. campus, a former Sheraton hotel acquired a few years earlier by the university as part of an expansion. They bonded instantly, traveling as a posse from classes to the library to the cafeteria, often ending up together late at night in the dorm lobby or in a lounge that had been a large hotel suite on the second floor.While most of the students are 18 or 19, typical for college freshmen, some have worked for years in hopes of one day saving enough for college. Olivia Bekale, who is 27 and grew up in Baton Rouge, arrived in Louisiana from Gabon as a child. She graduated from high school in 2008 with a 3.9 G.P.A. from the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, a prestigious state-supported boarding school for top achievers. Unable to afford college, she cycled from one low-wage position to the next \u2014 server at the Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant; retail sales consultant for Sprint; customer-service agent for Marriott; pharmacy tech for Walgreens. Olivia, who had wanted to be a doctor since an aunt died of AIDS when she was 5, had been out of high school for eight years when she learned of the opportunity scholarship; she applied immediately.All but one of the students were enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Created in 2012 by an Obama-administration executive action, DACA allowed teenagers and young adults who came to the United States illegally as children with their parents to register with the government and in turn receive a two-year renewable protection against deportation, along with work permits and Social Security numbers. Most of the students, like Indira, signed up at age 15, as soon as they were eligible. With DACA, Indira, who is now 18, was able to get a driver\u2019s license and a job at a Publix supermarket when she was in high school, working 20 hours a week as a cashier and bagger. Being able to work and drive legally, free of the fears her mother faced, and fitting in with her classmates, Indira says, was \u201cliving the American dream.\u201d With her income from Publix, she even was able to get braces for her teeth.Undocumented children poured into the nation\u2019s schools over the next generation, and as they reached college age, they coalesced into a movement, advocating access to higher education as well as full citizenship. In 2001, they began calling themselves Dreamers, now an estimated 2.1 million young immigrants who have grown up as Americans in almost every way except for their passports. The name came from the Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors), introduced in Congress in 2001 by Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, and for which activists fought for over a decade. The measure, which would have put undocumented children on a path to citizenship, never passed, but the vast network of Dreamers became a compelling political force.In 2001, hundreds of them turned out to testify in Texas in favor of legislation to allow undocumented residents to pay in-state college tuition if they graduated from Texas high schools and lived in the state for three years. \u201cSomething magical happened when those kids told their stories,\u201d says the former Texas state representative Rick Noriega, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. \u201cIt was a humanizing of a very real issue dealing with children\u2019s dreams and hopes. Every heart on that committee was touched, Republicans and Democrats.\u201d The legislation passed both houses almost unanimously and was signed by Rick Perry, then governor of Texas and now President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for energy secretary. Texas became the first state, followed quickly by California, to allow Dreamers to pay in-state tuition. Today, 21 states charge Dreamers the same tuition as legal residents, including six carried by Trump \u2014 Florida, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Texas.In many of those states, however, the once-bipartisan issue has turned politically treacherous. In Texas, efforts to repeal the tuition law come closer to passing every year, and Noriega says there is no chance the original measure would pass today. The leading national opponents of in-state tuition for Dreamers include the Republican senator Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general, and the secretary of state of Kansas, Kris Kobach, a Republican who was a leader of Trump\u2019s transition team on immigration. Each argues that students who are in the United States illegally should not get a public benefit in any state that is denied to a citizen from another state. In other words, if Dreamers pay in-state tuition in Texas, citizen students next door in Arkansas and Oklahoma \u2014 or Massachusetts, for that matter \u2014 should have the same right. \u201cHow much sense does that make, to have people here illegally, and they have more benefits than those who are here legally?\u201d Sessions asked in a Senate floor statement. Kobach used the same argument to bring class-action lawsuits against in-state tuition for Dreamers in Kansas and California. Judges found no legal basis for the claims and dismissed the cases.The larger debate over how to treat an estimated 11 million immigrants who came here illegally has been at a stalemate for decades, with advocates seeking a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d for law-abiding families who have been in the country for years and opponents denouncing \u201camnesty\u201d for people who broke the law to enter the country. Amid hardening resistance in Congress to immigration reform, Dreamers brought pressure on Obama \u2014 including sit-ins and hunger strikes at his 2012 campaign offices \u2014 to use his executive power to create DACA. The program, announced on June 15, 2012, the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s Plyler decision, proved transformative for Dreamers. They have entered college, taken on-the-books jobs, received driver\u2019s licenses, bought cars. They now fly on planes, passing effortlessly through airport security. They still lack legal immigration status, but no longer are they exactly undocumented. \u201cDACAmented,\u201d many have called themselves.Even in states where they pay in-state tuition, Dreamers still struggle to afford college because they are disproportionately low-income and have no access to federal financial aid. Fewer than 10 percent of Dreamers who graduate from high school enroll in college. At a time when college graduates earn 70 percent more than those without degrees, these numbers conjure the 1982 warning by the Supreme Court that undocumented children could become a permanent underclass.In response, a handful of philanthropies have adopted the cause of sending students with DACA status to college. The biggest of these, TheDream.US, has raised $90 million to eventually finance 4,000 students at public colleges, with significant contributions from Donald Graham, former publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, and his family; Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan; Bill and Melinda Gates; the hedge-fund executive William Ackman; and Michael Bloomberg, among others. (I was a reporter at The Washington Post from 1980 to 2008.) In 2014, TheDream.US began offering Dreamers full scholarships in states that charge them in-state tuition. Last year, in partnership with Delaware and Connecticut, the organization created the opportunity-scholarship program for students from the other 29 states, financed by $41 million in philanthropy from Graham and his family and two anonymous donors. The governors of Delaware and Connecticut agreed to charge roughly in-state tuition rates for the 34 scholars at Delaware State and the 42 at Eastern Connecticut State \u2014 a total of $80,000 per student for tuition, room and board for four years. In an effort to pre-empt political opposition, Graham says, the philanthropy works only with schools, like Delaware State and Eastern Connecticut State, that have excess capacity, so that undocumented students are not displacing citizens. And private donors pay all expenses, so that no state dollars are spent.Still, when The Delaware State News ran an article in September about the D.S.U. opportunity scholars, the online comments complained that undocumented immigrants, not citizens, were benefiting. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t perfect, but I will vote for him because he puts Americans FIRST,\u201d wrote a reader named John Huff of Magnolia, Del. \u201cThere are plenty of kids who are citizens who have the same dream and should come first.\u201d And as news of the scholarship spread on the Delaware campus this fall, a number of African-American students told Dreamers that they resented that their own families had to go into debt for a portion of their education costs while the DACA students got full scholarships.By then, Trump had mobilized anti-immigrant anger in large swaths of the country, having kicked off his campaign criticizing Mexican immigrants \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u201d \u2014 and vowing to build a wall on the border to keep them out. In stump speeches, he promised to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and, in his first 100 days in office, to terminate DACA, labeling it \u201cillegal amnesty.\u201d Both vows became instant applause lines.Separation from family, from home, even from Mexican food made most of the opportunity scholars profoundly lonely. Estephany Martinez, a petite criminal-justice major with long black hair, couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her sisters in the first weeks. \u201cWhenever we came home from school, all four sisters would sit in the living room and do our homework and talk and watch TV,\u201d she recalled wistfully of her life in Winder, Ga. In Delaware, \u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody that cared for me. I didn\u2019t have anyone to come home to.\u201d In early September, she summoned all the scholars to a gathering in the dorm\u2019s second-floor lounge. \u201cAll right, you guys, we\u2019re going to be here for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cThat part of our lives \u2014 being undocumented \u2014 is critical to who we are. We have to share our stories.\u201d Everyone crowded in, sitting on the sofa, spilling onto the floor, sitting shoulder to shoulder on counters that once were part of a kitchenette, sprawling into one another\u2019s space.Carlos Gonzales of Manteo, N.C., a lanky and cheerful marketing major whose mother is a restaurant cook, broke down crying when he recalled the violence that drove his family from Mexico City. He, his mother and his younger sister moved to North Carolina when he was 7. It was his mother who encouraged him, beginning in elementary school, to reach for college. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to live the life we\u2019re living now,\u201d she told him. In high school, he was an honor student and varsity wrestler and runner, working nights and weekends at McDonald\u2019s in his Outer Banks town. When he received the email telling him he was an opportunity scholar, he said: \u201cI hugged my mom and cried for two hours. The only reason I stopped was I had to go to work.\u201dIndira told the harrowing story that led to her own family\u2019s departure from Mexico. In 2004, when she was 6, three masked gunmen broke into their home, which housed her parents\u2019 clinic, and robbed them of everything \u2014 money, jewelry, a new computer, a television, cameras and medications. They filed a report with the police, they said, who didn\u2019t investigate, in deference to cartels then taking over Guerrero, now the most violent state in Mexico. An uncle of her father\u2019s already had been killed. In subsequent years, a cousin of her mother\u2019s, a veterinarian, was kidnapped and never found. Two nephews disappeared. Her mother\u2019s sister has been kidnapped twice \u2014 most recently this past November \u2014 and returned only after her family paid steep ransoms.Weeks after the robbery, Indira\u2019s family of five arrived in the United States on a tourist visa that her father procured a month earlier in hopes of taking everyone to Disney World. Instead, they went to Gainesville, where her father\u2019s brother worked in construction \u2014 one of thousands of Mexican workers who flocked to the north Georgia community in the last 25 years, swelling the Hispanic population to more than 40 percent in 2013 from 8 percent in 1990. Indira said her parents are certain they would have been killed had they stayed. They decided to forfeit their careers for their family\u2019s safety. \u201cI no longer saw my future, but I saw my children\u2019s future,\u201d her father said to me.Antonio Patino, a computer-science major who is a lifeguard and plays bass and guitar in his spare time, told the group about riding with his family in their car in 2015 in Lawrenceville, Ga., when a police officer pulled them over, though none of them understood why. His father, who is undocumented and processes returns for a local manufacturer, was driving but did not have a license. Antonio and his mother, younger sister and brother all watched in terror as his father was handcuffed, placed in a police cruiser and driven off to jail. As it turned out, he was released the next day after paying a fine of more than $800 and was not referred to immigration court for further proceedings, but the incident shook Antonio\u2019s sense of belonging in America. \u201cI felt like I got slapped in the face just for living, trying to be a normal person in this beautiful country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like a hole inside me.\u201d He said he now found himself gripped with fears for his parents\u2019 safety at random moments during his days at D.S.U. It is as if he has swapped roles with his mother and father. \u201cLike I\u2019m now the parent and they\u2019re the child, and I\u2019m worried for them,\u201d he told me. \u201cNot being there, all these what-ifs swarm into my mind. What if out of nowhere they get pulled over again?\u201d Calling them and hearing their voices usually comforts him. But after one such call, he said: \u201cI went outside, and I had to cry a little. I was feeling like I couldn\u2019t help them.\u201dA number of students shared the enormous sacrifices they had seen their parents make for them. Juan Chavez, 23, who grew up in Plymouth, Ind., and worked for five years after high school, told of his mother suffering a breakdown after her divorce from his father. He saw it as a response to the crushing instability of their lives, moving from one home to another in search of shelter. \u201cShe\u2019s the strongest person I\u2019ll ever know,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my role model. My father figure as well as my mother.\u201d He continued: \u201cI felt so helpless to make things better. I decided almost right then I\u2019ll go to college and medical school if it takes me the rest of my life.\u201d He is now a psychology and pre-med major, intending to become a psychiatrist.On and on the students went until almost 3 a.m., the common threads in their stories drawing them closer. It was the first time most of them had talked openly about being undocumented, but instead of feeling exposed, they felt safer. Until then, Antonio had gone out of his way to avoid conversations with non-Dreamers at D.S.U. about his scholarship, not wanting to have to explain that he got it because he was undocumented. The next day, though, he fell into conversation with a student who asked him how he happened to come all the way from Georgia to D.S.U., and he said without hesitation: \u201cI got a scholarship.\u201d\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m undocumented,\u201d Antonio said, surprised at how comfortable this felt.\u201cO.K., man, that\u2019s cool,\u201d the student said.After their long night talking, the scholars also better understood what had propelled them all for as long as they could remember. Throughout high school, the opportunity scholars watched undocumented friends and siblings give up and drop out, shamed and beaten down by public scorn over illegal immigration and the dead-end options awaiting even those who excelled in high school. But they kept on striving, steeled to the insults, positioning themselves for a breakthrough they couldn\u2019t yet see. Now this all made sense. \u201cThis pain \u2014 it pushes us,\u201d Estephany said. \u201cIt\u2019s motivation. It has made me who I am. It makes me go through every day.\u201d\u201cNow we know what drives us,\u201d Indira said.A similar scene unfolded that morning in the ultramodern science center, in computational-thinking class, where Antonio and Jose Reyes Rios, another computer-science major, sat front and center with an African-American classmate named Hanqaamo Lintisio, who is from Maryland and has a track scholarship. The three had formed a study group and tutored one another so effectively that they all scored above 100 on the midterm. (They nailed the bonus question.) Theirs were the only A\u2019s in the class.The Dreamers gather daily at a long Formica table in a D.S.U. cafeteria for food and conversation. At lunch, Carla Moreno propped her English composition textbook, \u201cPatterns for College Writing,\u201d against a napkin holder, securing it with an apple. She paged through a chapter while eating her salad and chili dog. \u201cIt\u2019s just a quiz,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I want to keep my A.\u201d\u201cI deal with a lot of students, and I feel like the Dreamers are at a different level,\u201d says Kevin Noriega, the adviser for their scholarships. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got to make this happen because it\u2019s my only option.\u2019\u2009\u201d Of the 488 scholars funded by TheDream.US who began college in 2014, 94 percent remain enrolled after their sophomore year; research shows that only 66 percent of low-income college students nationally return after one year. \u201cThis is a low-income population with retention rates like Harvard\u2019s,\u201d Donald Graham says. Because beneficiaries of TheDream.US have full rides, they avoid a common problem faced by other disadvantaged students: running short of money for costs not covered by Pell grants or other forms of aid.One night in October before a biology exam, Indira went to the D.S.U. athletic center for a workout to relieve stress. She was armed with a stack of homemade flash cards and her iPhone, on which she had downloaded discussions of test topics from various websites. While pounding out three miles on the treadmill, she flipped through her study cards, then plugged in her earbuds for a YouTube lecture on glycolysis. Returning to her dorm, she sat down at her desk for a final review. Hanging on the wall in front of her was a collage of family photographs. One showed the whole family of nine around their dinner table. \u201cWhen I\u2019m struggling, I look at a picture of my mom or dad, and I say, \u2018I\u2019m working for that person,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. That night, her studying complete, she took a last look at her parents\u2019 picture and fell asleep listening to recordings of her biology professor\u2019s lectures. She got an A on the exam.Such unsinkable optimism, which I heard from many D.S.U. Dreamers in the early fall, is hard to maintain, and many of the estimated 65,000 undocumented immigrants who graduate from high school every year \u2014 and thousands who drop out \u2014 simply can\u2019t muster it. In a recent book, \u201cLives in Limbo,\u201d Roberto G. Gonzales, an assistant professor at Harvard\u2019s graduate school of education, writes that academically successful Dreamers are far outnumbered by those who become casualties of \u201cthe deeper and more far-reaching consequences of being undocumented: living in poverty, having parents and family members who also bear the burdens of being undocumented, watching friends moving forward but being unable to join them, watching opportunities pass you by, navigating a world of exclusions while constantly looking over your shoulder.\u201dAt least some of the opportunity scholars\u2019 optimism last fall came from their assumption, based on reported polls, that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. They were heartened by her speeches about keeping families together and pursuing comprehensive immigration reform. At the very least, they were confident that DACA would remain in effect under her leadership. Though they didn\u2019t believe Trump could win, he unnerved them with his speeches branding Mexicans criminals who stole Americans\u2019 jobs and lived off their tax dollars. They took this rhetoric as a personal affront and were horrified by the hatred they saw on the faces of those who cheered his words. \u201cThe only thing that depresses me is so many people support him,\u201d Jose Reyes Rios, the computer-science major, who aspires to work at Google one day, said in late September.On election night, a group of Dreamers gathered around the flat-screen TV in the dorm lobby, many of them studying as they watched returns. Indira had exams the next day in math and biology and arrived equipped with her flash cards. The mood turned dark after Trump won Florida. Everyone\u2019s mind flooded with his vows that they had discounted until now \u2014 to revoke DACA, to deputize local police departments to enforce federal immigration laws. \u201cWe will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings,\u201d Trump said last summer in Arizona. As all of them knew well, these crimes included one of their parents\u2019 daily activities \u2014 driving without a license. If DACA disappeared, and with it their Social Security numbers, their own driver\u2019s licenses would be worthless. So would their federal work authorization, meaning most would lose the jobs that paid for their books, phones, clothes, travel home and anything else they needed.By 1 a.m., Indira became too distressed to concentrate. Olivia Bekale was one of four opportunity scholars who watched until Trump was declared the president-elect. \u201cWe were just looking at each other and crying,\u201d she says. \u201cWe hugged each other and went to our rooms.\u201dSocial media brought aftershocks for all of them as they discovered that many of their best friends voted for Trump. Almost all of Antonio\u2019s high-school swim teammates in Lawrenceville had Trump filters on their Facebook and Snapchat profile pictures. \u201cAll I could think was: You voted against me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did I do to you?\u201dThe day after the election, Indira couldn\u2019t bear to call her mother until the afternoon. Instead, she confided her fears in text messages to her former science teacher, Teresa Leach. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so disappointed in this country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so powerless. ... I\u2019m scared about my family, my mom. ... Not sure if I\u2019ll even get my degree, much less go to medical school here.\u201d When Indira finally did call home, her mother insisted she was not afraid and told Indira that education was now even more important.Several of Indira\u2019s friends back home told her they doubted Trump would follow through on all his campaign promises, and in any case, they couldn\u2019t imagine he would target her. \u201cThese are people who helped me get to where I am, who remind me they love me, and I love them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll never understand what we feel. They say, \u2018He won\u2019t do that.\u2019 Do they think he\u2019s going to send back all the immigrants except Indira?\u201dA lifeline of sorts arrived the week after the election, when the students received letters from TheDream.US, Governor Markell and the president of D.S.U., pledging to stand behind their scholarships no matter what became of DACA. Donald Graham lined up attorneys to represent them if anyone challenged their right to be in school.But their bigger fears were for their parents. Antonio and Indira went home for Christmas to find their families filled with trepidation. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be invisible, trying to stay hidden,\u201d Antonio\u2019s father said, \u201cdo only the things we have to do to live, like go to work, go buy groceries.\u201d During the 2015 holiday season, they took a driving tour of the Christmas lights and celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve in downtown Lawrenceville. \u201cNow we can\u2019t go to any festivities because for us it\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d his mother told me in their apartment in a complex in Buford, Ga. \u201cThere are a lot of police there.\u201dAntonio\u2019s father said he worries about driving his daughter, Litzy, 15, home from her swim-team practice at rush hour, when the police presence increases. Litzy was born in Georgia, and he thought of asking her to leave the team until she is old enough to drive because, as a citizen, she will be able to get a driver\u2019s license. \u201cBut then I said to myself: \u2018No! That\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here \u2014 for our kids. So they can take advantage of every opportunity.\u2019\u2009\u201d He continues to ferry her \u2014 carefully \u2014 during rush hour.Indira found her mother more frightened than at any time since receiving her deportation order. Her mother says she has no choice but to drive when someone at her church asks for help, when her children call for rides home and when she is needed at a charity medical clinic where she volunteers as a doctor\u2019s assistant and translator. \u201cLife changed after the election,\u201d she told me in December, in her living room decorated with framed academic awards for each child. She was surrounded by her kids, who listened carefully. \u201cThe children know I don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. They know at any time maybe the police will take me again. \u2018If I can\u2019t come back,\u2019 I tell them, \u2018you have to go to school every day. You have to study hard \u2014 even harder.\u2019\u2009\u201dEstephany Martinez focused on her life\u2019s mission. \u201cMy goal is being a police chief \u2014 something that makes my voice louder,\u201d said the criminal-justice major. \u201cI have to educate myself to get there. I want to show people who don\u2019t believe in us: \u2018I got all the way here. I\u2019m starting from the bottom with education, and I\u2019m going to get there.\u2019\u2009\u201dAs they settled into the semester, they monitored everything Trump and his close allies were saying about immigration, their moods shifting with each utterance. Back in December, they felt hopeful when Trump, in his interview as Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year, said approving things about Dreamers and indicated that he would deport serious criminals before other undocumented immigrants. They were discouraged in January when Jeff Sessions, in his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, appeared unconcerned about the consequences of revoking DACA. They took heart two days later when Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, said in a CNN town-hall meeting that he wanted Congress to pass legislation making Dreamers \u201cright with the law.\u201dSoon after classes started, the opportunity scholars learned that their collective grade point average for the first semester was a 3.76. Six of the 34 students had achieved a perfect 4.0. Indira was one of them. \u201cSucceeding for me is how I can get my revenge,\u201d she told me over the phone, interrupting her biology homework for a few minutes. \u201cI want to break the stereotype of us being here taking jobs away and not helping the economy. I want Trump to see we\u2019re the total opposite of what he thinks.\u201dDale Russakoff is a freelance writer and the author of \u201cThe Prize: Who\u2019s in Charge of America\u2019s Schools.\u201d This is her first article for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Many of the investigations that started in 2016 will be decided in the coming year. If Silicon Valley companies lose the battles, they could be forced to change how they operate not only in Europe, but also farther afield.Here is what awaits them in 2017.Google is facing three sets of antitrust charges in Europe related to some of its search services and Android, its popular smartphone operating system. Both appeals are expected to be heard by Europe\u2019s top courts in late 2017, at the earliest.The social media giant is becoming an increasing target for European officials because of its ever-expanding role in the region\u2019s economy.The ride-hailing company has been locked in a yearslong struggle to operate freely across Europe after some taxi associations and policy makers accused it of flouting local rules and promoting unfair competition.If Uber is deemed a transportation service, it will have to comply with Europe\u2019s tough taxi rules and not be able to offer some of its low-cost services. If the court rules Uber is a digital platform, the company will have greater ability to expand aggressively in the region, still one of its more important international markets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Seem Invincible. That Worries Lawmakers.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech \u2014 from IBM to Hewlett-Packard to Cisco to Yahoo \u2014 were eventually outmaneuvered by start-ups that came out of nowhere.The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place.Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable.In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world\u2019s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will.The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump\u2019s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds.This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year.Let\u2019s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends \u2014 mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs.Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech \u2014 on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance.The Five aren\u2019t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple\u2019s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet\u2019s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren\u2019t entirely safe from competition from start-ups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot.Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from start-ups; today\u2019s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five.But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you\u2019re supposed to in America \u2014 by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren\u2019t considered that bad. They weren\u2019t causing environmental disasters. They weren\u2019t selling cigarettes. They weren\u2019t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five\u2019s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn\u2019t I called them the Fabulous Five?Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with.During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos\u2019s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry\u2019s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public.For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised \u2014 entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others.\u201cDuring the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U.S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,\u201d said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them.During Mr. Genachowski\u2019s term at the F.C.C., and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201d which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies.But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. \u201cThe next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things \u2014 battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,\u201d he said.That\u2019s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger \u2014 their benefits to society as well as their potential costs \u2014 when deciding how to police them.But there\u2019s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today\u2019s start-ups. The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining, voice-activated assistants, self-driving cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five.That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more; and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been eating since most of us here completely missed the way the election would turn out. (Except for Nigel Farage at Table No. 3!) And by the way, the barbecue stations during cocktail hour were provided courtesy of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7.Finally, for the business executives in the room who are wondering if this free meal violates your conflict-of-interest policy, don\u2019t worry; see what your legal department says when you tell it, \u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for the president, it\u2019s good enough for me.\u201dNow, on to the toasts \u2014 and some predictions for the new year.Let\u2019s start with predictions, given that everyone, myself included, seemed to be so wrong about everything in 2016 \u2014 Trump, Brexit, the way the stock market would go. Instead of offering conventional predictions, I\u2019m going to offer up some Black Swans \u2014 things that were considered unthinkable but may now be thinkable, in a blue-sky, the-world-is-upside-down kind of way. Consider some of these thought experiments, if nothing else.This one may be slightly more plausible: Masayoshi Son, the billionaire controlling shareholder of Sprint \u2014 and a newfound friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who pledged to invest $100 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs \u2014 makes a bid to merge Sprint with T-Mobile. Under most antitrust analysis, such a deal would be dead on arrival. But perhaps under a new business-friendly administration \u2014 and given Mr. Son\u2019s public support for the president-elect \u2014 the transaction gets the green light?Here\u2019s another: With the possibility that the Trump\u2019s administration will undo net-neutrality laws that allow content companies to transmit unlimited data over cable company pipes, Netflix will finally accept a takeover bid \u2014 from Disney, which has been looking for a way to create an even stronger direct relationship with its customers. It would be Robert A. Iger\u2019s final megadeal before his contract expires in 2018. It would also pave the way for Mr. Iger to hire digitally savvy Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, a Disney board member, to take over for him.John G. Stumpf, the chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo, wasn\u2019t supposed to end his career this way. He is a reasonable and \u2014 dare I say \u2014 decent man, yet he led a bank engaged in one of the most blatant financial scandals in recent memory. Wells opened up millions of accounts without the permission of its customers, just to goose internal numbers. In truth, customers lost only $1.5 million, which, if we\u2019re being honest, is minuscule for a bank the size of Wells Fargo. The problem is that Mr. Stumpf treated it as a blip on the radar screen and ignored the significant damage his bank was doing to real people. And when he was called to account, he didn\u2019t have the right answers. Ultimately, he resigned, which was the right decision. But it could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 all been avoided.President and Michelle Obama couldn\u2019t make it to dinner (the venue might have been a turnoff). But whatever you think of his stewardship of the nation, he deserves our thanks. For those of us who pay attention to economic statistics, Mr. Obama walked into the worst economic crisis in recent history. We are now in the longest economic expansion and monthly job creation in history. Was he alone responsible? No, but it happened on his watch. Could we have gone faster with different policies? Very possibly. We will see just how much faster we can grow and if there is a cost to doing so under the next administration. Was he perfect? Of course not. But in a town that\u2019s filled with scandals and red flags about conflicts of interest \u2014 which are often skewered in this annual column \u2014 the Obamas stand out for avoiding those questions.Advertisement"}

Sensing that their bug was in fact a feature, the two dropped the chess project immediately and hurled themselves at the light trails, hoping to develop a tool for drawing in three dimensions.This is hardly the kind of reception the two inventors were expecting when they started working on it in Mr. Skillman\u2019s apartment, a 400-square-foot studio in South Park, the little neighborhood that has been a hub for San Francisco\u2019s digerati since the 1990s. \u201cNot in our wildest dreams,\u201d said Mr. Skillman, a slightly built 36-year-old with a neatly trimmed beard and a modest, unassuming manner.Tilt Brush got its name because in its earliest versions, you would draw or paint on a two-dimensional surface that could be tilted in any direction in virtual space. But because the HTC Vive includes not just a virtual reality headset but also a pair of hand-held controllers and two tracking sensors that map your movement in space, the program was revamped to enable you to paint or draw anywhere within a room-sized area \u2014 no surface required.One controller serves as a palette, with dozens of colors and effects; the other acts as a brush or pen. To watch someone use it is a bit unnerving, since the person appears to be making marks in midair, but you can\u2019t actually see those. But put on a Vive headset and step between the sensors yourself \u2014 as I did in a windowless room in Google\u2019s New York offices \u2014 and the illusion of delusion disappears. Instead, you suddenly see what has been produced: a phantom creation in three dimensions, something you can walk around, walk through, poke your head inside, do everything except touch.\u201cWhen I left Disney in 2012,\u201d Mr. Keane said recently in his studio, a vintage bungalow on a quiet residential street in West Hollywood, Calif., \u201cI told them it was because I know there\u2019s something new coming \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it is, but I need to leave to find it.\u201dSo, what are people going to use it for? Mr. McCloud threw out a few suggestions: performance art, virtual sculpture, industrial prototyping. \u201cI doodle with it,\u201d said Mr. Yeo, the painter, who spoke by telephone from London. \u201cI describe it as a three-dimensional sketchbook.\u201d What it won\u2019t produce is anything resembling comics as they currently exist in the medium some call \u201cFlatland.\u201d\u201cJust like you have a spatial dimension, you\u2019ve got to have time as a dimension,\u201d Mr. Keane continued. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t do that.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban Draws Deep Anger and Muted Praise", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byA group of Nobel Prize winners said it would damage American leadership in higher education and research. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and some relatives of Americans killed in terrorist attacks said it was right on target. An evangelical Christian group called it an affront to human dignity.The reaction on Saturday to President Trump\u2019s ban on refugees entering the United States, with particular focus on certain Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa, was swift, certain \u2014 and sharply divided.And around the world, allies and critics alike voiced concern about what the new American policy could mean.St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for the United Nations, said, \u201cWe hope that these measures are temporary, as refugee protection needs have never been greater.\u201d And Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada used his Twitter feed to reiterate his government\u2019s open policy toward refugees, particularly those from Syria.International reaction, though, was far from uniform. Politicians who have called for restricting Muslim immigration have gained support in a number of European countries, and one of them, Geert Wilders of the Netherlands, praised Mr. Trump on Twitter: \u201cI would do the same. Hope you\u2019ll add more Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia soon.\u201dStill, some immigration policy experts in the United States questioned the logic behind the action. They noted that terrorists who had carried out attacks in the United States had not entered as refugees, and that Muslim attackers had been born here or came from countries like Pakistan or Saudi Arabia \u2014 which were not on the list of seven mostly Muslim countries that the administration has singled out for a halt to entry.The president\u2019s executive order, issued on Friday, brought a positive, if muted, reaction from some Republicans, and could prove popular politically.Michael Banerian, 22, who was a Trump elector in the Electoral College, and is the youth vice chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, said he saw the president\u2019s more narrowly tailored order as common sense. \u201cI feel that it\u2019s a necessary step for us to take for the security of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s un-American. I think it\u2019s very reasonable.\u201dKathleen Ganci, 67, whose husband, Peter J. Ganci Jr., the highest-ranking uniformed officer of the New York Fire Department, was killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, said she supported the order, too.\u201cI don\u2019t care how difficult it makes it for these people to come over,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want other Americans to go through what I did \u2014 because we have to care for our own first, before we care for others.\u201dAnd Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that seeks to restrict immigration, said it makes sense to suspend the refugee program temporarily, examine it, \u201cand at least begin to initiate some changes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what form those changes will take, and I\u2019m not sure the administration knows yet,\u201d he said.The executive order put an indefinite halt to citizens of Syria, a country racked by civil war and an immense refugee crisis, entering the United States. It suspended immigration for 90 days from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also suspended the nation\u2019s program for admitting refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days, while the government comes up with a stricter process for vetting them, but allowed for exceptions for persecuted religious minorities, like Christians in Muslim countries.Many other leading congressional Republicans did not make statements on the matter, including Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader.By Saturday afternoon, members of Congress were hearing from constituents whose friends or relatives were detained at airports.Mr. Dent said he was awakened by his college-aged son, whose Syrian-American friend had six family members being held at Philadelphia\u2019s airport on Saturday morning, though they had valid documents to enter the country. The congressman said that despite his attempts to intervene with government officials, the family was placed on a flight bound for Qatar.\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThe order was rushed through without any nuances toward immigration policy, and this can be life or death for some people.\u201dGoogle\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in India, sent a memo to the company\u2019s workers saying that as many as 187 of its employees were affected.The A.C.L.U. and other legal organizations filed a lawsuit on Saturday on behalf of individuals subject to President Trump's executive order. The lead plaintiffs were detained by the U.S. government and threatened with deportation.In a note to his employees, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, said, \u201cApple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s order, he said, \u201cis not a policy we support.\u201dSome colleges and universities had urged students who might be affected by Mr. Trump\u2019s policies to return to the United States before Inauguration Day if they were abroad, or to remain in the country if they were already here.The seven countries covered by the temporary ban have about 13,000 citizens who are college or graduate students in the United States, said the American Council on Education. The group said it was unclear how many were stuck abroad. \u201cIt is clearly up to the federal government to decide how to safeguard our nation, but at the same time, it is in America\u2019s interest to remain the destination of choice for the world\u2019s students and scholars,\u201d said Terry W. Hartle, the group\u2019s executive vice president.The president\u2019s action poses a particular challenge to Christian leaders whose followers have largely supported Mr. Trump, but whose organizations are among the most active on behalf of refugees.Jen Smyers, director of policy and advocacy for the immigration and refugee program of Church World Service, said that the executive order was \u201cakin to President Trump taking a wrecking ball to the Statue of Liberty.\u201dAs reports circulated about travelers being stopped upon arrival, protests broke out at several airports, including San Francisco International, O\u2019Hare in Chicago, Dulles outside Washington and Kennedy in New York.By sundown the boisterous crowd shouting \u201cLet them in!\u201d at Kennedy\u2019s Terminal 4 had spread along the parking apron, the ramp to the elevator and on three floors of the adjoining parking deck.

{"Headline": "Detroit Auto Show Reveals a Google-Designed Van That Could Steer the Industry", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 There are shiny new sport utility vehicles, brawny pickups and sleek sedans. But the unlikely star of the annual Detroit auto show is an odd-looking minivan capable of driving itself.The van, designed by Google, grabbed the spotlight on Sunday, the first day of press previews at the show. The vehicle\u2019s introduction highlighted the industry\u2019s fascination with autonomous driving vehicles, as well as the rising sway of the technology industry in the auto business.The van shown on Sunday is the first fruit of those labors.In many ways, it looks like a conventional minivan. But it is also equipped with the self-driving sensors and vision systems developed by Waymo, some of which protrude from its body.That combination is telling. The van was built by the Detroit automaker Fiat Chrysler, making it the first heavyweight collaboration between a major automaker and one of Silicon Valley\u2019s elite. And it shows how Waymo, widely considered the leader in autonomous driving technology, hopes to sell its self-driving systems to car companies unwilling to bear all the costs of developing vehicles.Some automakers, like General Motors and Ford Motor, have committed to creating their own driverless cars. Both companies recently announced plans to build their first fully autonomous vehicles at factories in Michigan.But Google is intent on offering another option to automakers by creating a ready-made package of self-driving equipment that can be integrated into mainstream vehicles.The chief executive of Waymo, John Krafcik, said on Sunday that the company had sharply reduced the cost of producing the radars and other high-tech components needed to achieve fully autonomous driving.\u201cWe\u2019ve brought all of our self-driving sensors in-house,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cIt\u2019s all designed and built from the ground up by Waymo, with every part manufactured with one goal in mind: to safely handle the complex task of full autonomy.\u201dBy doing so, Waymo is positioning itself as a mega-supplier to the industry, and a turnkey solution to transforming conventional cars into driverless models.In the past, industry analysts were doubtful that automakers would work closely with tech companies, which were perceived as potential competitors in their core business of making and selling new vehicles.\u201cThe auto industry has to date expressed a collective wariness to allow players like Alphabet too close to the data generated by today\u2019s car platform,\u201d Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a recent research report.The collaboration between Waymo and Fiat Chrysler has broken new ground and whetted the interest of other automakers. Last month, Honda said it was in talks with Waymo \u201cto integrate its self-driving technology into Honda vehicles.\u201dOther automakers, however, are choosing to keep their self-driving research private. G.M., for example, has acquired outside tech companies to bolster its own engineering teams, and it recently announced plans to manufacture self-driving versions of its new all-electric Chevrolet Bolt at a plant in suburban Detroit.Ford Motor is also pressing ahead with efforts to introduce a new fully autonomous vehicle by 2021, and other carmakers are on similar paths, although some of their efforts are focused only on adding driver-assist features that control some of a vehicle\u2019s functions, rather than developing cars that do not require a human driver to operate.Hanging over the industry is the potential for new federal regulations addressing whether a self-driving car needs a steering wheel and pedals to operate on public roads. While the Obama administration has consistently supported the move toward autonomous cars, it is not clear whether President-elect Donald J. Trump will adopt similar policies.One company that is hedging its bets is Fiat Chrysler, which is smaller and less profitable than its rivals G.M. and Ford. Rather than spend billions on autonomous driving projects, it opened its doors to Waymo to convert a hybrid-electric Chrysler Pacifica minivan into a self-driving vehicle.\u201cStrategic collaborations such as this one are vital to promoting a culture of innovation, safety and technology,\u201d said Sergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chief executive.The result on display at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit was a minivan adorned with swooping plastic scoops that contained sophisticated sensors and radars installed by Waymo.The van does have a steering wheel, primarily because some states, such as California, require one during testing on public roads and highways.But Mr. Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief executive, said the vehicle was \u201ccapable of getting you door to door without a person at the wheel\u201d and represented major improvements in the costs associated with self-driving systems.He said that when Google began working on autonomous vehicles in 2009, a sophisticated sensor system using lasers could cost as much as $75,000 from an outside supplier. By manufacturing the components internally, the company has cut the cost by 90 percent.\u201cThis is a big step in making this technology affordable and more accessible to millions of people,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said.For its part, Fiat Chrysler modified the electrical systems and other components of 100 minivans built at a Canadian assembly plant and then delivered the vehicles to Waymo to add its proprietary self-driving equipment.The vehicles have already undergone testing at the automaker\u2019s track in Michigan, and Waymo plans to start driving them on public roads in Arizona and California this month.Mr. Krafcik did not provide a forecast for when Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology would be available for sale directly to automakers or ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft. Instead, he said, the company is \u201cmastering the hardware and software to build a better driver for a truly self-driving car.\u201dDespite its long history of staging elaborate news conferences at the Detroit show, Fiat Chrysler was noticeably absent from Sunday\u2019s event. But it did announce on Sunday that it would increase its employment in the United States by 2,000 jobs when it added new Jeep S.U.V.s to factories in Ohio and Michigan.In another sign of the industry\u2019s rapidly changing landscape, the carmaker instead chose last week\u2019s consumer electronics show in Las Vegas to introduce an electric concept vehicle targeted at young buyers.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Get Up and Move. It May Make You Happier.", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byPhys EdWhen people get up and move, even a little, they tend to be happier than when they are still, according to an interesting new study that used cellphone data to track activities and moods. In general, the researchers found, people who move are more content than people who sit.But many of these studies focused only on negative moods. They often also relied on people recalling how they had felt and how much they had moved or sat in the previous week or month, with little objective data to support these recollections.To accomplish these goals, they first developed a special app for Android phones. Available free on the Google app store and ultimately downloaded by more than 10,000 men and women, it was advertised as helping people to understand how lifestyle choices, such as physical activity, might affect people\u2019s moods. (The app, which is no longer available for download, opened with a permission form explaining to people that the data they entered would be used for academic research.)The app randomly sent requests to people throughout the day, asking them to enter an estimation of their current mood by answering questions and also using grids in which they would place a dot showing whether they felt more stressed or relaxed, depressed or excited, and so on.Periodically, people were also asked to assess their satisfaction with life in general.After a few weeks, when people were comfortable with the app, they began answering additional questions about whether, in the past 15 minutes, they had been sitting, standing, walking, running, lying down or doing something else.They also were asked about their mood at that moment.At the same time, during the 17 months of the study, the app gathered data from the activity monitor that is built into almost every smartphone today. In essence, it checked whether someone\u2019s recall of how much he or she had been moving in the past quarter-hour tallied with the numbers from the activity monitor.In general, the information provided by users and the data from activity monitors was almost exactly the same.Of greater interest to the researchers, people using the app turned out to feel happier when they had been moving in the past quarter-hour than when they had been sitting or lying down, even though most of the time they were not engaged in rigorous activity.In fact, most of the physical activity that people reported was gentle walking, with little running, cycling or other more strenuous exercise.But the links between moving in any way and feeling happy were consistent for most people throughout the day, according to the data from their apps. It also didn\u2019t matter whether it was a workday or weekend.The researchers also found that people who moved more frequently tended to report greater life satisfaction over all than those who reported spending most of their time in a chair.In general, the results suggest that \u201cpeople who are generally more active are generally happier and, in the moments when people are more active, they are happier,\u201d says Gillian Sandstrom, a study co-author who was a postdoctoral researcher at Cambridge and is now a lecturer in psychology at the University of Essex.In other words, moving and happiness were closely linked, both in the short term and longer term.Of course, this type of study does not establish causation. It cannot tell us whether being more active actually causes us to become happier or, conversely, whether being happy causes us to move more. It only shows that more activity goes hand-in-hand with greater happiness.The study also is limited by its reliance on cellphone data, Dr. Sandstrom says, because it may not have captured information about formal exercise. People often do not carry their phones when they run, cycle or engage in other types of vigorous activity, she and her colleagues point out in the study. So those types of workouts would not be reflected in the app or the phones\u2019 activity monitor, making it impossible to know from this data set whether formal exercise is linked to happiness, for better or worse.Still, the size of the study group and the consistency of the findings are compelling, Dr. Sandstrom says. They do indicate that if you get up and move often, you are more likely to feel cheerful than if you do not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Profit Rises 4 Percent, as Cloud Business Booms", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 At Microsoft, cloud computing is the future, and investors are happy as long as the company keeps delivering growth from it.For several years, Microsoft has sought to shed its reputation as a stodgy seller of traditional software, highly dependent on the ups and downs of the personal computing market. The company misfired along the way as it competed head-on with Google in internet search and Apple in smartphones.Microsoft\u2019s shares, which languished for years, are now trading near record highs. After its results were released, the company\u2019s stock rose almost 1 percent to $64.27.For the quarter, Microsoft reported net income of $5.2 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with $5.02 billion, or 62 cents a share, during the period a year earlier.Revenue rose to $24.09 billion from $23.8 billion a year ago.With adjustments to exclude results from LinkedIn and the impact of nearly $2 billion in deferred revenue related to its Windows 10 operating system, Microsoft earned 84 cents a share and revenue of $25.84 billion, exceeding the estimates of Wall Street analysts, who also excluded those items from their forecasts.The average analyst estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters had called for Microsoft earnings of 79 cents a share and revenue of $25.28 billion.Sales from the company\u2019s Azure cloud computing business, which caters to businesses that want to move basic computing functions into Microsoft\u2019s data centers, increased 93 percent from a year ago. Revenue for intelligent cloud, Microsoft\u2019s name for the category that includes Azure, rose 8 percent to $6.9 billion.\u201cWe know their cloud business is doing well,\u201d said Christopher Voce, an analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cThey delivered on that front.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s Office business also had strong results as more of its customers signed on to use a subscription version of Office 365 software. Revenue in the Microsoft category dominated by Office rose 10 percent to $7.4 billion.The category also benefited from $228 million in revenue that LinkedIn brought in for Microsoft after the acquisition closed. LinkedIn showed an operating loss during that period of $201 million.One of the biggest surprises of the quarter was a 5 percent increase in the revenue Microsoft received from personal computer makers for licenses to its Windows software. Windows revenue that Microsoft received from agreements with corporate customers rose by the same amount.The personal computer market has been in a slump for years as buyers have shifted to newer categories of devices like tablets and smartphones. In the last three months of 2016, worldwide personal computer shipments fell 3.7 percent, according to Gartner, the technology research firm.But Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., still occasionally outperforms the overall market, especially during a surge in sales of higher-end personal computers. In an interview, Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said that corporations were increasing their deployments of Windows 10 on their personal computers and that innovative new machines aimed at consumers sold well.\u201cWe\u2019re feeling very good about growth in the PC segment,\" Ms. Hood said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Headline to Photograph, a Fake News Masterpiece", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 It was early fall, and Donald J. Trump, behind in the polls, seemed to be preparing a rationale in case a winner like him somehow managed to lose. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest,\u201d the Republican nominee told a riled-up crowd in Columbus, Ohio. He was hearing \u201cmore and more\u201d about evidence of rigging, he added, leaving the details to his supporters\u2019 imagination.A few weeks later, Cameron Harris, a new college graduate with a fervent interest in Maryland Republican politics and a need for cash, sat down at the kitchen table in his apartment to fill in the details Mr. Trump had left out. In a dubious art just coming into its prime, this bogus story would be his masterpiece.Mr. Harris started by crafting the headline: \u201cBREAKING: \u2018Tens of thousands\u2019 of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse.\u201d It made sense, he figured, to locate this shocking discovery in the very city and state where Mr. Trump had highlighted his \u201crigged\u201d meme.\u201cI had a theory when I sat down to write it,\u201d recalled Mr. Harris, a 23-year-old former college quarterback and fraternity leader. \u201cGiven the severe distrust of the media among Trump supporters, anything that parroted Trump\u2019s talking points people would click. Trump was saying \u2018rigged election, rigged election.\u2019 People were predisposed to believe Hillary Clinton could not win except by cheating.\u201dIn a raucous election year defined by made-up stories, Mr. Harris was a home-grown, self-taught practitioner, a boutique operator with no ties to Russian spy agencies or Macedonian fabrication factories. As Mr. Trump takes office this week, the beneficiary of at least a modest electoral boost from a flood of fakery, Mr. Harris and his ersatz-news website, ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, make for an illuminating tale.Contacted by a reporter who had discovered an electronic clue that revealed his secret authorship of ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, he was wary at first, chagrined to be unmasked.\u201cThis topic is rather sensitive,\u201d Mr. Harris said, noting that he was trying to build a political consulting business and needed to protect his reputation. But eventually he agreed to tell the story of his foray into fake news, a very part-time gig that he calculated paid him about $1,000 an hour in web advertising revenue. He seemed to regard his experience with a combination of guilt about having spread falsehoods and pride at doing it so skillfully.\u201cNo one really goes in this building. It\u2019s mainly used for short-term storage by a commercial plumber,\u201d Prince said.In case anyone missed the significance of the find, Mr. Harris made it plain: \u201cWhat he found could allegedly be evidence of a massive operation designed to deliver Clinton the crucial swing state.\u201dA photograph, he thought, would help erase doubts about his yarn. With a quick Google image search for \u201cballot boxes,\u201d he landed on a shot of a balding fellow standing behind black plastic boxes that helpfully had \u201cBallot Box\u201d labels.He was correct. The ballot box story, promoted by a half-dozen Facebook pages Mr. Harris had created for the purpose, flew around the web, fueled by indignant comments from people who were certain that Mrs. Clinton was going to cheat Mr. Trump of victory and who welcomed the proof. It was eventually shared with six million people, according to CrowdTangle, which tracks web audiences.\u201cA Christian myself, I take offense to reading such unbelievable lies from a publication alleging Christian ties,\u201d Mr. Husted said.He had put in perhaps half an hour a week on the fake news site, he said, for a total of about 20 hours. He would come close to a far bigger payday, one that might have turned the $5 he had spent on the Christian Times domain into more than $100,000.The money, not the politics, was the point, he insisted. He had graduated from Davidson College in North Carolina in May, and he needed to pay his living expenses. \u201cI spent the money on student loans, car payments and rent,\u201d he said.By the time he launched his fraudulent story on ballot fraud, he had found minimal success with \u201cHillary Clinton Blames Racism for Cincinnati Gorilla\u2019s Death,\u201d a reference to the sad tale of Harambe, the gorilla shot after he grabbed a little boy visiting the zoo. He had done better with \u201cEarly Morning Explosion in DC Allegedly Leaves Yet Another DNC Staffer Dead,\u201d spinning off conspiracy theories around the earlier shooting death of a Democratic National Committee staff member.President Obama thought the fake news phenomenon significant enough to mention it as a threat to democracy in his farewell speech in Chicago last week. \u201cIncreasingly,\u201d he said, \u201cwe become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it\u2019s true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.\u201dDonald J. Trump has used false claims to attack political opponents, question the legitimacy of the Obama administration and undermine the news media. The practice has paralleled his rise from reality TV star to holder of the nation\u2019s highest elected office.That was exactly the insight on which Mr. Harris said he built his transient business: that people wanted to be fed evidence, however implausible, to support their beliefs. \u201cAt first it kind of shocked me \u2014 the response I was getting,\u201d he said. \u201cHow easily people would believe it. It was almost like a sociological experiment,\u201d added Mr. Harris, who majored in political science and economics.By his account, though he voted for Mr. Trump, his early preference had been for Senator Marco Rubio. Mr. Harris said he would have been willing to promote Mrs. Clinton and smear Mr. Trump had those tactics been lucrative. But as other seekers of clicks discovered, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters were far more fervent than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s.In late October, with the inevitable end of his venture approaching, Mr. Harris sought an appraisal for the web domain that by then had vaulted into the web\u2019s top 20,000 sites. An appraiser said that given the traffic, he could probably sell it for between $115,000 and $125,000.A few days later, when Mr. Harris checked his site, the ads were gone. He checked with the appraiser and was told that the domain was now essentially worthless.All was not lost, however. He had put a pop-up on the site inviting visitors to \u201cjoin the \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 team to find out HOW Hillary plans to steal the election and what YOU can do to stop her!\u201d and collected 24,000 email addresses. He has not yet decided what to do with them, he said.Asked whether he felt any guilt at having spread lies about a presidential candidate, Mr. Harris grew thoughtful. But he took refuge in the notion that politics is by its nature replete with exaggerations, half-truths and outright whoppers, so he was hardly adding much to the sum total.\u201cHardly anything a campaign or a candidate says is completely true,\u201d he said.Lately he has picked up Mr. Trump\u2019s refrain that mainstream news organizations are themselves regular purveyors of fake news. Last week, when BuzzFeed released what it called an \u201cexplosive but unverified\u201d dossier suggesting that Russia had planned to bribe and blackmail Mr. Trump, Mr. Harris wrote on Twitter:He did not mention his own expertise in the field.Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the origin of a widely shared fake news story misstated a Twitter post by Cameron Harris, a 23-year-old Maryland man who created the article and the website on which it originated. Mr. Harris, quoting BuzzFeed\u2019s description of a dossier on alleged Russian attempts to win influence over Donald J. Trump, wrote: \u201c \u2018Explosive but unverified\u2019 \u2014 That could describe every fake news headline ever.\u201d His Twitter post did not say, \u201cHe did not mention his own expertise in the field.\u201d (That was the last sentence of the Times article, referring to Mr. Harris.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberal Lawyers Plan Wave of Resistance to Trump Policies", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The calls and emails went out a little past 10 p.m. Friday, rippling through an informal network of current and former Yale Law School students who had worked at the school\u2019s immigrant rights advocacy clinic. The news told of an Iraqi man being detained at Kennedy International Airport because of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, putting him at imminent risk of deportation.Around 5:30 a.m. \u2014 shortly before the first Europe-bound flights were scheduled to depart \u2014 they filed the lawsuit on the electronic docket system for the Eastern District of New York. Then they began converting their files into templates for lawyers in districts across the country to use, as well.So began the opening salvos of the legal pushback to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order banning entry to refugees and others from seven predominantly Muslim countries.The effort illustrates that a broad mobilization of rights-oriented lawyers is emerging.Determined to make legal resistance one of the defining attributes of the Trump era, lawyers at liberal advocacy groups have been putting aside institutional rivalries and organizing to work together on litigation.Several leaders of the effort said their hope is that the judiciary may serve as a strong check to a government controlled by Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress across a broad range of anticipated fights.\u201cWe are clearly in a moment in which civil rights organizations face unprecedented challenges and will need to mount new and more aggressive strategies,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee.Now, with the lawsuit filed in Brooklyn \u2014 which was quickly echoed elsewhere, including one filed in Virginia by two other veterans of the Yale immigration clinic \u2014 the leading edge of that wave is arriving. (The litigation joins a lawsuit filed last week arguing that Mr. Trump\u2019s ownership of businesses that take payments from foreign governments violates the Constitution.)Propelling the effort is an outpouring of financial support and volunteers that legal rights group leaders say dwarfs the campaign that gradually emerged to counter the George W. Bush administration\u2019s post-Sept. 11 national security policies, including detention without trial at the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.The A.C.L.U.\u2019s membership rolls and fund-raising provide a measure of those energies. Mr. Romero said his group last year had about 400,000 members \u2014 to be active, people must give at least $20 each year \u2014 down from its peak of about 550,000 during the Bush administration. In each of the past three years, its website took in about $5 million in donations, he said.But just since Election Day, he said, the A.C.L.U. has surged to more than a million members and \u2014 as of 5 p.m. Monday \u2014 it had taken in $71.3 million from 921,304 online donations; $31.5 million of that came from 456,714 since Friday, when Mr. Trump signed the travel ban. The money will fund many more lawyers at both the federal and state level, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary \u2014 we\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Mr. Romero said. \u201cIt means that people expect us to do a lot more of this work.\u201dOther organizations also reported a surge in fund-raising and interest. Caroline Fredrickson, the executive director of the American Constitution Society, said that when her organization sponsors a conference call to discuss an issue, it typically gets 80 to 100 R.S.V.P.s. On Monday, it announced a call about the travel ban and got 500, she said.\u201cThe bar has been galvanized in a way I have not seen since the 1960s,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are just showering us with offers of legal assistance.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to supplant other organizations \u2014 we\u2019re looking to complement them,\u201d Ms. Love said.Many immigrant legal advocacy groups were also steering volunteer lawyers to airports, and over the weekend at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, the number of volunteer lawyers at times exceeded the number of protesters. By Sunday, the volunteers had set up a makeshift legal clinic on a folding table under a bank of escalators and began to organize themselves, starting a WhatsApp group to share information and a Google spreadsheet to track potential cases.The man had a special visa that is given to those who have worked for the United States military or government, and was arriving with his wife and children.\u201cIf you get pulled aside, give them my name, give them my phone number and tell them I\u2019m your lawyer,\u201d Ms. Murray told him.Then the waiting began. After hours to clear customs, her clients made it out.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robots Will Take Jobs, but Not as Fast as Some Fear, New Report Says", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byThe robots are coming, but the march of automation will displace jobs more gradually than some alarming forecasts suggest.A measured pace is likely because what is technically possible is only one factor in determining how quickly new technology is adopted, according to a new study by the McKinsey Global Institute. Other crucial ingredients include economics, labor markets, regulations and social attitudes.Globally, the McKinsey researchers calculated that 49 percent of time spent on work activities could be automated with \u201ccurrently demonstrated technology\u201d either already in the marketplace or being developed in labs. That, the report says, translates into $15.8 trillion in wages and the equivalent of 1.1 billion workers worldwide. But only 5 percent of jobs can be entirely automated.\u201cThis is going to take decades,\u201d said James Manyika, a director of the institute and an author of the report. \u201cHow automation affects employment will not be decided simply by what is technically feasible, which is what technologists tend to focus on.\u201dThe report, a product of years of research by the McKinsey group, adds to the growing body of research on automation and jobs.Differing assumptions, and sheer uncertainty about the future, explain the conflicting outlooks.Throughout history, times of rapid technological progress have stoked fears of jobs losses. More than 80 years ago, the renowned English economist John Maynard Keynes warned of a \u201cnew disease\u201d of \u201ctechnological unemployment.\u201dToday, it is the rise of artificial intelligence in increasingly clever software and machines that is stirring concern. The standard view is that routine work in factories and offices, like bookkeeping or operating basic machinery, is most vulnerable to automation.But A.I. software that can read and analyze text or speech \u2014 so-called natural language processing \u2014 is encroaching on the work of professionals. For example, there is a lot of legal work that is routine, said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But that routine work, sifting through documents for relevant information, is wrapped in language, which had protected lawyers from the effects of automation. But no longer.\u201cNatural language processing opens the door to doing more and more work that was beyond automation until recently,\u201d Mr. Levy said.The McKinsey report cites natural language processing as a key technology: The faster it develops, the more that tasks can be automated; a slower pace means less automation.The economic cost of automation is another concern. People see advances in self-driving vehicles, and think that the jobs of America\u2019s 1.7 million truck drivers are in imminent peril, said Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey institute and an author of the report.Yet replacing America\u2019s truck fleet would require a trillion-dollar investment, Mr. Chui said, adding \u201cif you could buy a self-driving truck, which you can\u2019t.\u201dSuch uncertainties led the McKinsey researchers to calculate the pace of automation as ranges rather than precise predictions. The report\u2019s multifactor scenarios suggest that half of today\u2019s work activities could be automated by 2055. That threshold could be reached 20 years earlier or 20 years later, the report adds, depending on economic trends, labor market dynamics, regulations and social attitudes.So while further automation is inevitable, McKinsey\u2019s research suggests that it will be a relentless advance rather than an economic tidal wave.\u201cWe have more time than we think to adjust to the world that technology makes possible,\u201d said Matthew J. Slaughter, an economist and dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.The McKinsey report also considered the other side of automation \u2014 as an engine of productivity and economic growth.In that context, the report points to the demographic challenges ahead, as most nations age, and the need for automation-powered growth. Today, there are 46 million Americans over 65, or 15 percent of the population. By 2060, the size of the over-65 group is projected to reach 98 million people, or 24 percent of the population.The American economy may need all the A.I.-assisted automation it can muster.\u201cIf productivity growth continues to be anemic, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d said Hal Varian, Google\u2019s chief economist and an emeritus professor at the University of California, Berkeley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Non-Tech Companies, if You Can\u2019t Build It, Buy a Start-Up", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byFor years, mergers and acquisitions in technology were fairly straightforward: Every investment bank kept a list of a dozen or so companies like Google and IBM that had a track record of acquisitions and cash to deploy. When the time and price were right, bankers would seek to match the tech giants with a start-up, and a deal would be hatched.Now the technology deal-making club has had its doors blown wide open.All kinds of companies, including century-old industrial stalwarts like General Motors and General Electric, are among the corporate giants acquiring tech start-ups of late.This trend, of course, reflects how new technology is radically changing many traditional businesses. Developments like connected homes and driverless cars are upending old models. Many companies have come to the realization that building technology in-house was a painstaking process that often meant getting leapfrogged by start-ups.So companies not usually thought of as being in the tech sector have become more aggressive, making more than $125 billion worth of acquisitions in 2016, the most ever. Five years ago, that figure was $20 billion.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that many non-tech companies have tried to build and have made the determination that it\u2019s enormously challenging,\u201d said Anthony Armstrong, co-head of technology mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley. \u201cIt\u2019s better to acquire disruptive technology than to be disrupted by that technology.\u201dLast year, the number of technology companies sold to non-tech companies surpassed those acquired by tech companies for the first time since the internet era began, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding private equity buyers, 682 tech companies were purchased by a company in an industry other than technology, while 655 were acquired by tech companies, Bloomberg\u2019s data showed.More broadly, merger activity was down in 2016. Companies around the world announced $3.6 trillion worth of deals last year, a decline of 16.6 percent from 2015, which was a record year, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. The number of deals signed rose slightly from 2015, the data showed.Of the 45,416 transactions announced last year, 6,657, or 15 percent, were acquisitions of technology companies, more than any other sector, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters on Thursday. That was in line with the proportion of technology deals in 2015.Still, many of tech\u2019s big traditional buyers were quiet last year. Four of the five largest tech companies by market capitalization did not announce any giant deals in 2016.Investment bankers expect this trend to continue this year as well. They have been fielding many calls from companies outside the tech sector wondering what shareholders might think about a potential tech acquisition.Non-tech chief executives have been found mingling at technology conferences, trying to spot their next potential target. And the assortment of so-called unicorns, or private companies valued at $1 billion or more, may be more inclined to sell this year after very few went public or sold in 2016.Only 20 technology companies went public last year, the fewest since 2009, according to Thomson Reuters. With almost 200 unicorns, there could be more exits this year if the markets hold up.One major shift as to why non-tech executives are becoming more active in tech deal making is that they have become more comfortable with the technology itself.\u201cVery rarely are management teams willing to get into businesses that they absolutely don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Scott Adelson, co-president and global co-head of corporate finance at Houlihan Lokey. \u201cSoftware and internet are so pervasive that it\u2019s no longer something that the average management team can\u2019t wrap their head around.\u201dSome companies are also trying to recast themselves as tech companies.General Electric has moved its headquarters to Boston, more of a hub for tech and start-ups than its previous home in Fairfield, Conn. The company\u2019s recent commercials feature the tagline: \u201cThe digital company. That\u2019s also an industrial company.\u201dHoneywell\u2019s incoming chief executive, Darius Adamczyk, was formerly the head of a technology company that Honeywell acquired eight years ago. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering, and a master\u2019s degree in computer engineering.Historically, non-tech companies have largely not felt comfortable paying the high prices that many tech companies can fetch. Older, mature companies tend to trade at lower valuations relative to measures like revenue and earnings, compared with young technology companies \u2014 which sometimes do not even have earnings.\u201cWhen it comes to M.&A., boards and C.E.O.s of non-tech companies have become much more fluent in the language of tech company valuations,\u201d Mr. Armstrong of Morgan Stanley said.The next challenge for many of these companies might be in integrating their tech start-ups with the main business.When traditional companies acquired small technology companies, they typically would place them in a \u201cdigital division\u201d separate from the rest of the company.That too needs to change, according to Aryeh Bourkoff, the founder and chief executive of the investment bank LionTree.\u201cTechnology should not be a division of a company. It should be integrated into every division,\u201d he said.For now, investors in traditional companies seem willing to let these companies make bets and take risks because they too know the stakes of disruption are high.\u201cShareholders are judging management teams on their ability to be bold and not just make short-term moves,\u201d Mr. Bourkoff said. \u201cThe bold C.E.O.s are the ones that play to the future.\u201dGraphic by The New York TimesAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Cavs, the Warriors and the Five Best N.B.A. Games This Week", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byBy week\u2019s end, we will have reached the midpoint of the N.B.A. season.Last year, around this time, there was one big topic of conversation around the league: Could the Golden State Warriors break the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls\u2019 regular-season win record?He bet wrong. Three months later, in their final game of the season, the Dubs, as the Warriors are sometimes called, romped past the Bulls and into the history books with a 73-9 record. (They went on to lose to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the N.B.A. finals, four games to three.)Sadly, there is no team record as compelling as that one to watch for this season. But there is an individual player chasing something nearly as exciting, and the odds against him seem even more daunting than they were against Golden State.Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder is averaging 30.8 points, 10.7 rebounds and 10.5 assists, a triple-double, per game this season. And commentators are beginning to wonder whether he can keep it up through April.Much like the Warriors last season, one of the chief obstacles between Westbrook and his goal is fatigue. But, of course, unlike Golden State, which had three superstars to rely on, the Thunder guard has no one to turn to but himself.On the other hand, he can do things like this.So maybe he will pull it off. I can\u2019t wait to keep watching.Let\u2019s get into some games.Cleveland at Golden State, Monday, 8 p.m. Eastern, TNTI messed up, you guys.On Dec. 26, in a post-Christmas haze, I wrote an article in which I stated that \u201cCleveland does not face Golden State again this regular season.\u201dSince Dec. 11, Golden State has lost only two games, to the Cavs on Dec. 25 and to the Memphis Grizzlies this month. But its losses have not stopped commentators from wringing their hands.The other issue that fans have fretted over is the play of Stephen Curry, last season\u2019s most valuable player. He is averaging 24.7 points a game on .469 shooting, and shooting .398 from behind the 3-point line. Those are strong numbers for anyone else, but they fall well short of the superstar\u2019s statistics from last season.Of course, Curry no longer has to score as much, now that he is playing with Kevin Durant. But even he has acknowledged that he is not playing up to his own standards.In the same interview, Curry shrugged off talk of a \u201cslump,\u201d calling the use of the word \u201ccomical.\u201d But Ethan Sherwood Strauss, who has covered the team, said the concern about Curry was legitimate.Milwaukee at Houston, Wednesday, 8 p.m., ESPNOklahoma City at Golden State, Wednesday, 10:30 p.m., ESPNESPN\u2019s second matchup on Wednesday is even sweeter. You\u2019ve heard of this guy Westbrook? He has his team in sixth place in the West through sheer willpower. On Wednesday, he pays a visit to the man who may have revved up his engines. Durant is sitting pretty in Golden State with his new team, and Westbrook is eager to avenge a 122-96 November loss in Oakland to the Dubs.League Pass Games of the Week: Portland at Washington, 2 p.m. Monday; and Memphis at Washington, 7 p.m. WednesdayDon\u2019t look now, but the Wizards have won 11 consecutive home games. But they will be tested at the Verizon Center twice this week, first by the Portland Trail Blazers, who are hanging on to the eighth seed in the West despite a record of 18-24, and next by the Memphis Grizzlies, one of the better teams in that conference. If Washington can make it out of the week with its home winning streak intact, its point guard, John Wall, is a stronger leader than anyone thought.The reason he cited caught some attention.\u201cObviously people, particularly millennials, have increasingly short attention spans, so it\u2019s something as a business we need to pay attention to,\u201d Silver said.I\u2019m split on this statement. On one hand, I\u2019m a millennial with a short attention span who often complains about how games can drag in the final minutes. On the other hand, how dare he? I am offended.I decided to find out for myself whether there was any truth to Silver\u2019s comment. I started by typing \u201cDo millennials have\u201d into Google.I intended to write \u201cshort attention spans?\u201d next. But Google autofilled in some funny answers after the first three words. So I decided to tweet about it.I then forgot what I was doing for the next 10 minutes.All of which is simply to say: Fair point, Mr. Silver. Let\u2019s speed up those games. For the children, and also, for me.That\u2019s all for now. See you all next week.All times are Eastern.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Takes a Right Turn", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byMost tech executives and employees remain supportive of Democrats, especially on social and cultural issues. The Republican tilt of the PACs at Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook suggests, however, that as these companies\u2019 domains grow larger, their bottom-line interests are becoming increasingly aligned with the policies of the Republican Party.In 2016, the Microsoft PAC gave $478,818 to Republican House candidates and $272,000 to Democratic House candidates. It gave $164,000 to Republican Senate candidates, and $75,000 to Democratic Senate candidates.This was not small change. In 2016 Microsoft employees gave a total of $6.47 million.The firm first became a noticeable player in the world of campaign finance in 2012 when employees and the company PAC together made contributions of $910,000. That year, Facebook employees backed Democrats over Republicans 64-35, while the company\u2019s PAC tilted Republican, 53-46.By 2016, when total Facebook contributions reached $3.8 million, the Democratic advantage in employee donations shrank to 51-47, while the PAC continued to favor Republicans, 56-44.While the employees of the three other most valuable tech companies, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and Apple, remained Democratic in their giving in 2016, at the corporate level of Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 that is, at the level of their PACs \u2014 they have not.Tech giants can no longer be described as insurgents challenging corporate America.American consumer technology companies are getting larger, more entrenched in their own sectors, more powerful in new sectors and better insulated against surprising competition from upstarts.Among Ferenstein\u2019s findings: a minority, 29 percent, of tech company founders described labor unions as \u201cgood,\u201d compared to 73 percent of Democrats. Asked \u201cis meritocracy naturally unequal?\u201d tech founders overwhelmingly agreed.Ferenstein went on:One hundred percent of the smaller sample of founders to whom I presented this question said they believe that a truly meritocratic economy would be \u201cmostly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unequal. This is a key distinction: Opportunity is about maximizing people\u2019s potential, which founders tend to believe is highly unequal. Founders may value citizen contributions to society, but they don\u2019t think all citizens have the potential to contribute equally. When asked what percent of national income the top 10% would hold in such a scenario, a majority (67%) of founders believed that the richest individuals would control 50% or more of total income, while only 31% of the public believes such an outcome would occur in a meritocratic society.One of the most interesting questions posed by Ferenstein speaks to middle and working class anxieties over global competition:In international trade policy, some people believe the U.S. government should create laws that favor American business with policies that protect it from global competition, such as fees on imported goods or making it costly to hire cheaper labor in other countries (\u201coutsourcing\u201d). Others believe it would be better if there were less regulations and businesses were free to trade and compete without each country favoring their own industries. Which of these statements come closest to your belief?There was a large difference between tech company officials, 73 percent of whom chose free trade and less regulation, while only 20 percent of Democrats supported those choices.Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University who writes about demographic, social and economic trends, sees these differences as the source of deep conflict within the Democratic Party.The disruptive force is largely Silicon Valley, a natural oligarchy that now funds a party teetering toward populism and even socialism. The fundamental contradictions, as Karl Marx would have noted, lie in the collision of interests between a group that has come to epitomize self-consciously progressive mega-wealth and a mass base which is increasingly concerned about downward mobility.The tech elite, Kotkin writes, \u201cfar from deserting the Democratic Party, more likely will aim take to take it over.\u201d Until very recently, theconflict between populists and tech oligarchs has been muted, in large part due to common views on social issues like gay marriage and, to some extent, environmental protection. But as the social issues fade, having been \u201cwon\u201d by progressives, the focus necessarily moves to economics, where the gap between these two factions is greatest.Kotkin sees future partisan machination in cynical terms:One can expect the oligarchs to seek out a modus vivendi with the populists. They could exchange a regime of higher taxes and regulation for ever-expanding crony capitalist opportunities and political protection. As the hegemons of today, Facebook and Google, not to mention Apple and Amazon, have an intense interest in protecting themselves, for example, from antitrust legislation. History is pretty clear: Heroic entrepreneurs of one decade often turn into the insider capitalists of the next.In 2016, Donald Trump has produced an upheaval within the Republican Party that shifted attention away from the less explosive turmoil in Democratic ranks.Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed bid to finesse the inherent conflict between her dependence on corporate contributions and her need for a strong turnout by union workers, minorities and idealistic millennials embodies the Democratic Party\u2019s long term struggle.The public, at least for the moment, is not willing to support the continued compromise of principle that has been a hallmark of both parties. Trump has provided a temporary solution for the Republican Party; the Democrats need to find a legitimate and more lasting one.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How an American Ended Up Accused of Aiding ISIS With Gift Cards", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. had a job offer for Nick Young, a veteran Washington transit officer: Become an undercover informant for the bureau and gather information at local mosques on fellow Muslims who might pose a terrorism threat.The clandestine work would be \u201ca lot sexier\u201d than his current job, Mr. Young remembered an agent named Ryan telling him. And it could pay him a lot of money if the intelligence was good.Mr. Young turned him down. But it would not be the last time he would see the F.B.I. agent.Last August, five years later, Mr. Young was summoned to the headquarters of the transit agency, Metro, where Ryan and other agents were waiting for him. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t recognize me, do you?\u201d Ryan, whose beard was now thicker, asked him. \u201cOh, I recognize you,\u201d Mr. Young said. This time, the agent handcuffed Mr. Young on a charge of supporting the Islamic State \u2014 a case built, in a twist, by an informant who posed as a would-be terrorist fighter.The prosecution of Mr. Young, the only law enforcement officer among more than 100 Americans who have been accused of helping the Islamic State, offers a revealing look at the F.B.I.\u2019s shadowy cat-and-mouse efforts to identify possible Islamic extremists. President Trump has vowed to intensify the effort as part of a campaign to \u201cannihilate\u201d the militant group.To law enforcement officials, however, Mr. Young represents one of their worst fears: a longtime officer, with access to sensitive facilities, who they suspect was \u201cradicalized\u201d to support Islamic extremism.He is charged with providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the Islamic State, in the form of $245 worth of Google Play gift cards. The authorities say he gave the gift cards to a Muslim friend named Mo \u2014 in reality, an undercover informant \u2014 to support recruitment for the terrorist group.Before now, very few American suspects linked to the Islamic State have spoken out. But in three and a half hours of interviews from jail, Mr. Young, a convert to Islam, portrayed himself and many other American Muslims under investigation as victims of religious persecution. He accused an \u201coverzealous\u201d F.B.I. of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d the case.\u201cI know for sure I wouldn\u2019t have been targeted if I was an evangelic Christian or a Sikh or a Hindu or something,\u201d said Mr. Young, 37.\u201cI\u2019m not a terrorist,\u201d he added. \u201cSeeing these horrible allegations and the way they\u2019re trying to paint me, it\u2019s just a nightmare.\u201dOfficials at the F.B.I. and the Justice Department declined to comment on the case. In general, the F.B.I. said in a statement, the investigative techniques used in such national security cases \u201care subject to vigorous oversight and require us to use the least intrusive means possible.\u201dThe F.B.I. has moved aggressively since the rise of the Islamic State in 2014 to identify suspected extremist supporters inside the United States, opening hundreds of investigations and generating convictions from Brooklyn to Southern California, often against young Muslim men.Mr. Trump has declared that the country must do more to confront what he calls \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d including the possibility of expanding surveillance and intelligence operations, creating a \u201cregistry\u201d of American Muslims, and reviving torture as an interrogation technique.While Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals on some of those proposals, they have worried some civil liberties advocates, who say they are eager to see whether the Justice Department and the F.B.I. seek to expand their investigative powers still further in domestic terrorism cases.Mr. Young sees himself as a pawn in that broader fight.He acknowledges holding passionate views about the Middle East and the \u201cslaughter\u201d of Syrians by the government of President Bashar al-Assad. On breaks from the transit agency, Mr. Young traveled to Libya twice in 2011 with body armor to join rebels fighting the Qaddafi regime.\u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone while I was there,\u201d he said, laughing, but \u201cI got shot at a lot.\u201dHe insisted that he had never supported terrorists. He plans to take the witness stand at his trial, an unusual tactic for a terrorism suspect. \u201cNick doesn\u2019t have anything to hide,\u201d said Nicholas D. Smith, one of his lawyers.As he waits for his trial date, he sits in a rural jail in Warsaw, Va., reading science fiction occasionally, with \u201cThe Jerry Springer Show\u201d sometimes playing on a television in the background. \u201cMy brain\u2019s turning to mush,\u201d he said.He said the jail had denied him access to Muslim prayer sessions. But the conditions are far better, he added, than the solitary confinement he was placed in for 23 hours a day for months after his arrest. That ordeal, he said, has caused lingering panic attacks and other problems.Unlike the bulk of the Americans charged with supporting the Islamic State, Mr. Young is not accused of plotting violence or trying to travel to the Middle East to fight with the group.He said he was under investigation for so long, it was almost inevitable that the authorities would find a way to charge him. \u201cAt the end of the day, the crime I\u2019m being accused of \u2014 a crime of sending gift cards \u2014 it would be laughable if it wasn\u2019t really happening,\u201d Mr. Young said.He declined to explain the gift cards, citing a pretrial order that restricts what he can say about documents in the case. But he said his explanation would come out at his trial.Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, dozens of terrorism defendants caught in undercover stings have claimed in court that they were illegally entrapped into saying or doing incriminating things. None have succeeded.Judges have given the Justice Department wide latitude in using undercover stings in terrorism cases. \u201cYou almost need a perfect case\u201d to prove entrapment, said Seamus Hughes, a terrorism expert at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism, \u201cand that\u2019s difficult to find.\u201dStill, several legal analysts said Mr. Young might have a legitimate shot, because of the unusual elements of the F.B.I.\u2019s yearslong undercover investigation. They point out that even an obstruction-of-justice charge that Mr. Young faces is based on his statements to agents about a fictional F.B.I. investigation into the whereabouts of a would-be Islamic State fighter who never existed.Mr. Young apparently first came onto the F.B.I.\u2019s radar around 2010 because he knew a fellow student at George Mason University, Zachary A. Chesser, who, like him, was a white convert to Islam from Northern Virginia and attended the same mosque.The F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Young that year as part of an investigation into Mr. Chesser, who ultimately pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges after he was accused of threatening the creators of \u201cSouth Park\u201d over the show\u2019s depiction of the Prophet Muhammad.Mr. Young does not appear to have been an F.B.I. target at the time, even as undercover informants began giving the bureau reports about the activities of him and some of his associates.He continued working as an armed officer patrolling Washington-area subways and bus lines. He said F.B.I. agents \u2014 Ryan and a second agent \u2014 had met with him twice in 2011 to recruit him as an informant.Mr. Young said he found the idea of becoming an informant distasteful. The F.B.I. said in a court affidavit that he had used stronger language in a conversation with one of the bureau\u2019s undercover informants, saying that if he were ever betrayed by one, \u201cthat person\u2019s head would be in a cinder block\u201d at the bottom of a lake.Based on wiretaps and statements from informants, the F.B.I. reported that Mr. Young had made a number of other incendiary and perhaps even threatening comments over the years about Muslim informants, F.B.I. investigators and \u201ckaffirs\u201d \u2014 or nonbelievers.Mr. Young acknowledged that he could have used \u201ca little self-editing\u201d in some of his private remarks. But he said he had never meant them to be taken literally. \u201cEveryone\u2019s capable of saying stupid, blustery things,\u201d said Mr. Smith, his lawyer.Some F.B.I. officials pressed to bring criminal charges against Mr. Young years ago, but the Justice Department rebuffed them because of an apparent lack of evidence that he was involved in supporting terrorism, according to law enforcement officials.It was not until 2014 that Mr. Young crossed the line into supporting terrorism, the Justice Department now alleges. That was when he first met Mo, a Middle Easterner who said he was a military reservist, at a mosque where he prayed. Mr. Young said he had suspected early on that Mo might be an informant because of his strange mannerisms.But his concerns eased, and the two became friends, meeting at a Starbucks or elsewhere. Mo later told Mr. Young that he was thinking of traveling to Syria to join the Islamic State, prosecutors said.While Mr. Young sometimes appeared to offer Mo advice on how best to avoid government scrutiny if he went to the Middle East, he also told him at times that he did not need to join the terrorist group \u2014 at least not then, according to the F.B.I.\u2019s account.\u201cThere is no one with a gun to your head that is counting down,\u201d he told Mo in a conversation recorded in October 2014.Such statements, said Mr. Smith, his lawyer, show that \u201cthe government is really grasping at straws here.\u201d Prosecutors are acting on \u201creally more of a hunch that he might commit crimes in the future,\u201d he said, \u201cand they can\u2019t prove it.\u201dAdam Goldman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chief Executive of Audio Firm Sonos Steps Down", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Over the years, Sonos has weathered competition from better known rivals like Apple and Bose to find a devoted audience among audio enthusiasts. But lately its wireless speaker has lost ground to an unexpected competitor, Amazon\u2019s Echo.Now it faces another challenge: a change in the corner office. After 14 years leading the company he helped found, John MacFarlane has resigned as chief executive of Sonos and has been replaced by one of his deputies, Patrick Spence.Mr. MacFarlane, 50, has also left the company\u2019s board of directors, though he will remain an employee to help mentor colleagues and work on other projects. He said he left the board so Mr. Spence would not feel like he was always looking over his shoulder.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be that founder who\u2019s always second-guessing,\u201d Mr. MacFarlane said.Sonos is a rarity among technology companies, started in 2002 at a time when independent hardware companies in consumer electronics, an industry dominated by much bigger players, were hard to find. Mr. MacFarlane did not take venture capital money for several years and kept the company private, shunning the usual routine of selling shares to the public or being acquired by a bigger company.Sonos \u2014 based hundreds of miles away from the glare of Silicon Valley in the seaside town of Santa Barbara, Calif. \u2014 does not have the visibility of an Apple, Facebook or Uber. But it has amassed a loyal following with its family of wireless speakers, which allow people to play music streamed from internet services like Spotify or stored on a local computer.One of the secrets to Sonos\u2019s business is that once listeners become hooked on the sound from one of the company\u2019s speakers, they tend to buy more of them so they can simultaneously play music in multiple rooms in their homes.Mr. MacFarlane said he had planned to resign as chief executive earlier, citing his wife\u2019s bout with breast cancer and his aging parents as factors. But last year he delayed his plans when Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker unexpectedly began to eat into sales of Sonos speakers.While Echo has received mixed reviews for its sound quality, its Alexa voice assistant \u2014 which allows people to quickly play music with verbal commands \u2014 has captivated the tech industry and the public. More recently, Google introduced its own Echo competitor, Google Home, with a voice assistant.\u201cI fell into that trap where I\u2019ve been watching voice recognition for years,\u201d Mr. MacFarlane said. \u201cI tried Echo in the beginning and wrote it off. I had too many distractions at that time.

On Wednesday, the Silicon Valley companies showed that they were still in the early stages of their battle to limit misinformation online.Yet taken together, the efforts showed how the fight against fake news remains a work in progress. Google\u2019s bans were a drop in the bucket compared with the almost two million publishers that use AdSense. Facebook\u2019s new measures were part of a continuing series of small experiments by the company to find out what worked best in displaying news to its users.\u201cWe genuinely asked Google and Facebook for \u2018moonshots,\u2019\u201d said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. \u201cWe appreciate the work, but based on the numbers, that\u2019s hardly even running in place.\u201dGoogle and Facebook have been in something of a no-win situation in recent months when it comes to fake news. Both companies have been grappling with a widespread backlash over how their sites may have spread rumors on a vast scale, and how little responsibility they take for any of the content that appears on their platforms. The issue came to a head after the American presidential election, when commentators accused Facebook in particular of swaying voters to President Trump through misleading and untrue news articles.Google\u2019s blog post on Wednesday was the first time the company explained the results of its moves against publishers that spread misinformation. The search giant said it reviewed 550 sites \u201csuspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations\u201d in November and December. It took action against 340 of those sites and kicked nearly 200 publishers off its network permanently.Before taking steps to thwart fake news publishers, Google had an existing policy that outlawed publishers of \u201cmisrepresentative content,\u201d such as websites peddling weight-loss schemes or counterfeit goods. It expanded this policy to include sites impersonating news organizations.Google said that its search algorithms fell short but that the company would continue to work to improve its results.The AdSense system is a major revenue driver for independent web publishers who rely on the network to deliver display advertising on their sites. The publishers are paid when a reader views or clicks on those ads, with a portion of the proceeds going to Google. AdSense is one of the largest advertising networks on the web with nearly two million publishers using the system.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the number of sites it has banned since November.Trending Topics is a feature on the social network that tells people what popular topics are being discussed on the site. Apart from more transparency around headlines, the changes to the feature on Wednesday included identifying popular topics through the number of publishers posting articles on Facebook about a piece of news, rather than engagement around a single article.\u201cToday\u2019s update may also help prevent hoaxes and fake news from appearing in Trending because the updated system identifies groups of articles shared on Facebook instead of relying solely on mentions of a topic,\u201d the company said in a blog post.Still, industry watchers remain skeptical about the efficacy of these moves.\u201cNothing drives clicks better than when the headline is exactly what people want to hear or believe,\u201d Ian Schafer, the chief executive and founder of Deep Focus, a digital advertising agency, referring specifically to Google. Mr. Schafer said that without significant changes to the economics and technology of online ads, banning individual sites would not produce change in the long run.An article on Thursday about steps by Google and Facebook to curb the number of false news articles on their sites misspelled the surname of the chief executive and founder of the digital advertising agency Deep Focus.

Their turnover ratios \u2014 the percentage of holdings they replace each year \u2014 are lower than average. The typical actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar sloughs nearly 65 percent of its portfolio annually. Not one of these three hits that rate.Like Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor who leads Berkshire, Mr. Mullholland started out as a hard-core value hound; he sought stocks that were selling for far less than his estimate of their worth. But, he said, he concluded early on that the best companies also had the potential to grow in the long term and that an investor often had to pay more for them.\u201cYou make money by buying the exceptional \u2014 an exceptional business, exceptional management or an exceptional price,\u201d he said. These days, Mr. Mulholland calls himself a \u201cprice-conscious\u201d purchaser of both value and growth stocks.Consider Goldman Sachs Group, which was recently the fund\u2019s top holding. Its shares, like those of many companies, had lagged in some years since the financial crisis. But Mr. Mulholland said he saw an exceptional business \u2014 \u201cthe premier financial brand in the world.\u201d When he bought in, the stock was trading at what he deemed a discount. It returned nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter.Mr. Mulholland likes to stick with winners and will let them swell into a sizable stake. Goldman recently accounted for 9 percent of his fund\u2019s assets, and several years ago Apple was nearly 18 percent. It\u2019s now also about 9 percent.He runs the fund out of a small office in suburban Philadelphia, and he and his wife are its biggest shareholders, he said. \u201cI invest for myself and whoever wants to ride along with me.\u201dMatthew 25, with an expense ratio of 1.06 percent, returned 19.3 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 3.8 percent for the S.&P. 500.Mr. Miles said he and Mr. Green had learned, in 20 years of running the fund together, that many investors will take \u201cwhatever current earnings are, good or bad, and extrapolate them to an unreasonable level.\u201d Thus good news can lead to irrational exuberance, and bad news to unjustified avoidance. \u201cIf the market says this company is underperforming and will underperform forever, that\u2019s often an opportunity,\u201d he said.That kind of thinking had prevailed, Mr. Miles said, with financial companies, which, as a group, accounted for about a third of the fund\u2019s assets on Nov. 30. \u201cBanks haven\u2019t been given much hope since the financial crisis, and their earnings haven\u2019t been spectacular. So they\u2019ve been inexpensive, relative to the market,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been improving their capital position \u2014 they\u2019re fundamentally less risky. And with the new administration coming in, there\u2019s potential that some of the regulatory regime will relax. That would allow them to generate greater returns on capital, which would improve earnings.\u201dExpectations that President-elect Donald J. Trump will bring different policy priorities to Washington may have also given a lift to private prison companies, Mr. Miles said. The GEO Group, a prison operator based in Florida, was another recent winner for the fund and is a top holding.\u201cThe private prison industry is the low-cost source of supply,\u201d Mr. Miles said. \u201cIf there\u2019s more immigration enforcement, you\u2019d think there\u2019s going to be additional demand.\u201dThe managers of the Hotchkis & Wiley fund neither favor nor shun any particular sector or industry. They will consider any small-cap company that has a strong balance sheet and \u201cimportance to its customers\u2019 success or the broader economy,\u201d Mr. Miles said. The fund returned 17.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Its A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.29 percent.Mr. Coniaris said that three tenets unify the investment approach of all the funds in the Oakmark lineup. They invest in shares trading at discounts to the fund managers\u2019 estimates of their intrinsic value. The stocks\u2019 issuers must show \u201ca clear path to growing per-share value over time,\u201d he said. And their management teams must \u201cthink and act like owners.\u201dHe added that, when valuing stocks, Oakmark doesn\u2019t just seek statistical cheapness, such as a low price-earnings multiple. Its fund managers and analysts dig deeper. That can lead them to picks like Alphabet, which may seem unusual for a value hunter.When valuing the stock, the Oakmark team members made several adjustments, Mr. Coniaris said. They subtracted the company\u2019s big hoard of cash. They also factored out its money-losing \u201cmoonshot investments,\u201d like its effort to develop a driverless car. And they estimated that the market had misunderstood the value of YouTube, the company\u2019s video-streaming service.\u201cIf YouTube were to monetize its viewership like a cable company, it could be worth roughly $300 a share,\u201d Mr. Coniaris said. Alphabet has lately traded above $800.\u201cThe way we see it is, if you back out all that stuff, you\u2019re getting the core search business at a big discount.\u201dMr. Coniaris\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.17 percent, returned 7.6 percent for the quarter. The fund\u2019s sibling, Oakmark Global Select, also thrived in the quarter, returning 7.4 percent. The duo\u2019s holdings overlap, but Global Select is more concentrated, with only 20 holdings, while Global has 35.Advertisement"}

He was at Momofuku Nishi, a new restaurant from the celebrity chef David Chang, and he had come to eat the Impossible Burger.At Momofuku Nishi, Mr. Motz knew what he was getting. The Impossible Burger arrived on a squishy white bun, topped with a slice of American cheese, lettuce and tomato, fries on the side.\u201cIt looks real,\u201d Mr. Motz said, picking up the burger and examining it. \u201cIt feels like the right weight.\u201dAnd with that, he took a big bite, chewed vigorously and stared into the distance.For Impossible Foods to succeed, Mr. Brown will need to win over meat eaters like Mr. Motz. \u201cNo disrespect to vegetarians,\u201d Mr. Brown said, \u201cbut the only consumers we really care about are meat consumers.\u201dA vegetarian for 40 years, Mr. Brown is not interested in making just another meatless treat for those who have already sworn off eating animals. Instead, he said, he wants to change the world.When he took a sabbatical from Stanford six years ago and pondered what big problem he could help solve, he zeroed in on the idea of reducing the consumption of meat.Never mind the business of killing billions of animals for food. The farming, fishing and production of feed for livestock and poultry strains the earth\u2019s finite resources \u2014 consuming fossil fuel, emitting greenhouse gasses, hogging farmland and polluting waterways. \u201cIt is seriously imperiling some of the world\u2019s ecosystems, Mr. Brown said.\u201cBut there is a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cProduce all those same foods, with all the specifications consumers demand, but do it with a much lower environmental footprint, without using animals as the technology. That, I realized, was something that was fundamentally doable.\u201dThere is a growing market for these products. Sales of meat substitutes are up 18 percent in recent years, to more than $1 billion in the United States this year, from about $850 million in 2012, according to Euromonitor International, a research firm.\u201cCustomers are becoming more willing to accept the idea of alternatives to meat,\u201d said Raphael Moreau, a food analyst at Euromonitor. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where the real success will come from, by appealing to a much wider group beyond vegetarians.\u201dBut for Impossible Foods to succeed, carnivores like Mr. Motz would have to choose an Impossible Burger over a conventional hamburger at the point of sale.Mr. Brown said he had no illusions that meat-eaters would go vegetarian simply for the sake of the environment. \u201cWe have to have a product that consumers choose because they want to eat it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market will decide.\u201dSo what did America\u2019s burger expert think of the Impossible Burger? Back at Momofuku Nishi, Mr. Motz delivered his verdict.\u201cNo, I\u2019m very sorry, but this does not taste like a hamburger,\u201d he said. \u201cIt tastes like a fabrication of beef, not a real animal.\u201d\u201cThis is a big step in the right direction for the veggie burger,\u201d Mr. Motz said. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t burped yet. I usually burp.\u201dMr. Brown said he was only getting started. The Impossible Burger is being served in just a handful of high-end restaurants for now. There are plans to expand distribution this year and make it available for consumers to cook at home. He and his team are continuing to improve its formula, he said.\u201cThe cow is never going to get better at making meat,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cIt was not optimized for beef. It did not evolve to be eaten. Our burger was. We\u2019re always getting better.\u201dPerhaps Mr. Motz will revisit the Impossible Burger in the future. For now, he is sticking with ground beef.\u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact that they have gone and made the veggie burger for the proletariat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut any carnivore will take one bite of this burger and know it\u2019s fake.\u201dWith that, Mr. Motz left Momofuku Nishi. His destination: a nearby food truck, where he ordered a real cheeseburger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rachel Carson, DDT and the Fight Against Malaria", "Date": "2017-01-22", "News": "Supported byRetro ReportThe advent of the Trump administration brings a designated head of the Environmental Protection Agency whose commitment to the E and P of E.P.A. is widely suspect.Carson warned that pesticides like DDT \u2014 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane \u2014 were being sprayed excessively and indiscriminately in attempts to control crop pests. Poisons washed into waterways and moved along the food chain, threatening delicate ecosystems for birds, fish and, ultimately, humans. Even America\u2019s national symbol, the bald eagle, suffered. DDT poisoned eagles that fed on tainted fish, leading to eggs with thin shells that routinely broke during incubation. The E.P.A., created in 1970 under an earlier Republican president, Richard M. Nixon, took heed of the warnings.The reality is that the American ban on DDT did not extend to other nations, although some later enacted their own prohibitions. For that matter, the pesticide was not completely banished in the United States or elsewhere; the E.P.A. declared it acceptable if public health was at risk. And despite a decline in its effectiveness because of overuse, it remains a valued anti-malaria tool in many countries, principally for spraying indoors, where its potency is enhanced and its impact on nature is kept low.Then, too, the notion that Carson advocated a ban on pest-killing chemicals is a fiction. It was not her contention, she said, that \u201cchemical insecticides must never be used.\u201d\u201cNo responsible person contends that insect-borne disease should be ignored,\u201d she wrote in \u201cSilent Spring.\u201d The trouble, in her view, was that DDT and other chemicals were employed so liberally that \u201cthe insect enemy\u201d developed resistance to them in fairly short order and was thus \u201cmade actually stronger by our efforts.\u201dInsect resistance to DDT, many scientists say, was a major reason for a sharp decline in its use around the world: Why bother spraying if the bugs would just shrug it off? Experts also blamed reduced spending on anti-malaria projects by governments and international organizations \u2014 not Carson \u2014 for a resurgence of the disease after 1972.Notwithstanding such gains, the battle is far from over. W.H.O. says that 3.2 billion people in 97 countries, nearly half of the world\u2019s population, remain at risk. In Burkina Faso, a focus of the Retro Report video, roughly 40 percent of the people get malaria each year.To keep the disease on the run, experts say new methods are needed. Some that are under study now go beyond blitzing insects with chemicals. Scientists have experimented with ways to manipulate the mosquito\u2019s genome to make it resistant to malaria and perhaps other diseases as well, like dengue fever, yellow fever and the latest global scourge, the Zika virus. There have been successes in the laboratory. But spreading the desired traits among wild insect populations has thus far proved elusive (not to mention that concerns about genetic modification\u2019s unintended consequences are ever lurking).Dr. St. Leger has experimented with fungi that, when absorbed by a mosquito, will inject deadly spider venom directly into its blood. Still, he cautioned that a combination of approaches was necessary.\u201cThe solution,\u201d he said, \u201cisn\u2019t going to be relying on any single technology as the silver bullet.\u201dFor now, the weapons of choice remain what they have been for a while: diligently covering beds with nets infused with pyrethroids, synthetic versions of organic pesticides; judiciously coating the interiors of houses with DDT and other chemicals; and carefully mopping up pools of stagnant water where mosquitoes breed. That last one requires arduous and often fruitless labor. But it is a challenge that ought to be familiar to the Trump administration. To borrow a phrase it has popularized, it means draining the swamp.Advertisement"}

All Felt the Mood of a New Era.", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The people gathered in nature\u2019s gloom, squinting through a spitting rain, sizing up the man and his moment, in a city disinclined to welcome either.On the National Mall, the president\u2019s buoyant supporters clustered in their hats \u2014 roving masses of red \u2014 fitting comfortably where two Obama inaugurations had once overwhelmed the grounds.\u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d they shouted in waves, reveling in the president\u2019s sporadic fist pumps.So many others had already skipped town \u2014 lifelong residents, departing government employees, Democratic members of Congress \u2014 leaving behind pockets of eerie quiet.Others stayed, or arrived, to stand on a different side of history, trudging toward a celebration they were powerless to stop but desperate to at least interrupt.\u201cThis is our right to stand here,\u201d said Mica Reel, 21, who took part in an attempted midmorning human blockade near an entrance to President Trump\u2019s ceremony.Mr. Trump was sworn in around noon on Friday. The resistance, which sometimes turned violent, was already well underway.Perhaps some strange alchemy was inevitable, crackling throughout this day of contradictions: an underwhelming crowd for a showman president; a city that rejected him \u2014 Mr. Trump received about 4 percent of Washington\u2019s vote \u2014 hosting his celebration; a peaceful transfer of power pierced, at least occasionally, by simmering clashes in the streets.Of course, many thousands were eager to greet the new day, grafting their celebration onto the city from the American heartland \u2014 and bidding good riddance to a Washington era they had detested from afar.But across the city \u2014 the nexus of a weekend of national demonstrations cresting with a women\u2019s march on Saturday \u2014 a peculiar sensation took immediate hold, visiting every corner of the capital on its biggest day.It wafted from the mall, where raindrops seemed to fall just as Mr. Trump began his address.And it slithered downtown, near the parade route, a province of protesters in protective goggles and police officers in riot gear, of hurled objects and bursts of pepper spray. At least a few windows were shattered at a bank and a cafe, where structures were tagged with an anarchist \u201cA.\u201d Elsewhere, a vehicle and a handful of garbage cans were set aflame.By early evening, the Metropolitan Police Department said, more than 200 arrests had been made in connection with protests. These included many at a confrontation, a few blocks from where Mr. Trump passed on the parade route, that prompted the police to use pepper spray and rubber \u201csting balls\u201d against dozens of protesters, some of whom had thrown rocks and bricks.More often, demonstrations were peaceful, pocked with occasionally soggy signage: \u201cReject, Resist\u201d; \u201cPutin\u2019s Orange Puppet\u201d; \u201cRage, Rage Against the Dying of Our Rights.\u201dOther appraisals were more charitable, particularly among the area\u2019s entrepreneurial set.Jonas Williams, 43, of Greensboro, N.C., made a temporary office of his Silver Line train, hawking Trump buttons, Trump hats, Trump bumper stickers. \u201cWe got bobbleheads!\u201d he cried.Though Mr. Williams had sold more than $300 worth of gear since boarding, he said, the money was \u201csecondary\u201d to supporting a man he admired.\u201cI like what other people don\u2019t like \u2014 his outspokenness,\u201d said Mr. Williams, who is African-American. \u201cGive it to me straight.\u201dNext to the Capitol South Metro station, a group of 52 middle-schoolers, bused in from Massachusetts, wore matching blue hats and held red pom-poms.\u201cWe have a pretty split group of supporters and non-supporters,\u201d said Anna Baboval, a seventh-grade geography teacher. \u201cBut they\u2019re all pretty excited to experience history.\u201d29 PhotosA teenager approached Ms. Baboval. \u201cWould it be bad if I bought a pin with a swear on it?\u201d he asked.\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that,\u201d she said.Other protest literature was more subtle. Kenneth Harringer, a 54-year old tax preparer from Silver Spring, Md., held a sign in Russian, in a nod to the country\u2019s interference in the election. Its message: \u201cNot My President.\u201d \u201cGoogle Translate,\u201d he said.At times, there was cautious optimism among Trump skeptics. Or something like it.\u201cHopefully,\u201d said Dan MacNeil, from Beverly, Mass., \u201cit will be closer to a Ronald Reagan thing than a Mussolini thing.\u201dMuch of the day, though, was defined by its absences, from the dozens of House Democrats who boycotted the inauguration to the Democratic operatives who repaired to a Florida golf resort to plot an opposition strategy.One telling statistic came from underground. Metro ridership as of 11 a.m. was 193,000 trips, according to Washington\u2019s transit agency. For President Obama\u2019s inaugurations, total trips by that hour totaled 513,000 and 317,000.Many from the metropolitan area had deserted the nation\u2019s capital for tropical beaches or woodland cabins without internet access, the better to distract themselves from the swearing-in.Jennifer Palmieri, a former Obama administration official who served as communications director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, traveled to New Orleans for the weekend.\u201cI\u2019m not allowing the swearing-in of Trump to drive me out of my own country,\u201d she said, \u201cbut headed somewhere that is not likely to care much about politics.\u201dFor the Democratic organizers who stayed behind, Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration presented a moment to ratchet up public protest and dissent against his presidency, a show of resistance amid the pageantry.\u201cThis is about saying to the top leadership of this country, \u2018We are watching you,\u2019\u201d said Lauren Footman, 25, a community organizer who staged an afternoon rally at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. \u201cWe are ready for the next four years.\u201dOn the campus of George Washington University, a group of activists on Friday convened an eight-hour \u201cresistance-training workshop\u201d designed to teach left-leaning millennials techniques to thwart Mr. Trump, including lobbying Congress, making media appearances or running for office.And even among some Democratic lawmakers who attended the inauguration, a silent challenge to Mr. Trump was pinned to their lapels. \u201c#ProtectOurCare,\u201d the blue buttons read, in a plea to spare Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health care law.Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration is not the first to draw protesters from around the country and opposition from ideological foes, or even to prompt some lawmakers of the opposing party to stay away. But the level of organized resistance to his presidency \u2014 by elected leaders and activists, lawyers and service workers \u2014 is striking.Ron Klain, who led Al Gore\u2019s legal battle after the 2000 contest, said that he recalled Mr. Bush\u2019s inauguration as \u201cdepressing,\u201d but that it did not yield the kind of opposition efforts Mr. Trump\u2019s did.\u201cI was not hosting protesters on Inauguration Day 2001,\u201d said Mr. Klain, who is holding a dinner on Saturday for 25 young people who plan to participate in the women\u2019s march and other demonstrations this weekend.Already, patience has been tested.By 9 a.m. on Friday, about 150 protesters had gathered in McPherson Square, carrying signs and nodding to the beat of two men drumming on buckets.A local walked his small dog through the plaza. Another man stood near the back of the crowd, nibbling on a sandwich.\u201cIn the name of humanity,\u201d the group chanted, in a call-and-response, \u201cwe refuse to accept a fascist America.\u201d\u201cImpeach Him Already!\u201d one sign read.Three hours later, Mr. Trump raised his right hand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "A year ago, Mr. Markowski, a former newspaper photographer, sought to challenge himself with a long-term project. Instead of going to a foreign country, he wanted to stay and produce a particular portrait of his home. He was struck by a thought: Why not spend time getting to know the river? \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all know how it looks inside the city,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Markowski. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOutside the city, it was a mystery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He used Google Maps to virtually explore terrain and structures. Then he spent hours reading small publications from each town and village to identify interesting people and events he might photograph. When he was ready to shoot, he began with one agenda: Make images that were \u00e2\u0080\u009cas weird as visually possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And weird they are. In one (slide 8), a man wades in a clumpy swamp created by the Brda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waters. The man told Mr. Markowski that after he accidentally cut off the tip of his finger, regular dips helped it grow back \u00e2\u0080\u0094 much to his doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprise. In another, four men carry a rocket ship well over six feet tall and made out of plastic bottles. It is one of the entries in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat Bottle Race\u00e2\u0080\u009d an annual event on the Brda. Then there are seemingly random physical objects, like a gun turret that was once part of a prop tank used in the filming of a popular 1960s Polish television show. Today, the turret is lodged in an empty field not far from the water.As a second layer to these oddities, Mr. Markowski provides offbeat captions that are longer and more humorous than your typical who, what, when, where and why. One of his photos (slide 16) shows a grinning man reclining in a lawn chair while dressed in mock-Napoleonic garb. Behind him is an RV and wet underwear hanging from a line. In the caption, Mr. Markowski tells us of a local rumor that has it that Napoleon and his men once crossed the Brda near Drzewicz in 1810. The man pictured is a tourist, and often travels to the river\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge to take part in re-enactments. But recently, a neighbor spilled the truth: She made up the whole legend with her friends at a party. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow could she predict that the whole scam would unleash the effect of visiting buses with French tourists?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Markowski wrote. Mr. Markowski, who finds inspiration in the work of photographers like Martin Kollar, says the aim of his photographs is to use the Brda River as a vehicle to highlight a small fragment of Poland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inherit \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrangeness\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009clack of judgment on the imagination of citizens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a lot of crazy ideas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, speaking of his compatriots. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome are amusing. Some are maddening. Some are just weird.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018How to Be Bored\u2019 Looks at How to Deal With the Blahs", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesThe institute offers classes and lectures at outposts around the world, but its most visible work to bookstore browsers is a series of small, stylishly designed \u201chow to\u201d guides. The books are a balancing act. Primarily written in a way so as not to insult the intelligence of literary self-help seekers, they also want to keep you from fearing that certain things in life might just permanently not be O.K. Concerned but cozy, they have titles like \u201cHow to Stay Sane\u201d and \u201cHow to Deal With Adversity.\u201dNow comes Eva Hoffman\u2019s \u201cHow to Be Bored,\u201d in keeping with the brand. Woolf is in here, as are Kierkegaard, Rousseau and Sartre, among other distinguished life coaches. But it\u2019s also one of the more confounding entries in the series.The book\u2019s title starts the trouble. Being bored is not something you do, it\u2019s something that happens to you, envelops you like unexpected weather. You can get out of it, but you can hardly get into it. The \u201cboredom\u201d part of the book\u2019s focus could be better labeled \u201cHow to Make the Most of Down Time.\u201d But Ms. Hoffman touches so many bases \u2014 how we should approach culture, talk therapy, human contact, creative work \u2014 that she could have chosen from a thousand titles.On the clock, we\u2019re overworked to the point that companies like Google are enforcing naps and other breaks to increase efficiency. \u201cI must admit,\u201d Ms. Hoffman writes, \u201cthat the idea of napping or meditating on cue in order to work better in the afternoon fills me with slight dread.\u201d Agreed.Speaking of meditation, she also expresses a healthy skepticism for the Western world\u2019s embrace of mindfulness. Meditation can be good for temporary relief, she argues, but it doesn\u2019t change the fundamental stresses that keep us feeling such a desperate need to meditate.The most philosophically vexing problem she recognizes is \u201cthe temptations of plenitude and the problems of freedom.\u201d We\u2019re led to believe that we have a paralyzingly large number of prospective romantic partners or career choices or recreation options. And we face these forking paths without a compass; the acceptance of increasingly diverse lifestyles and values leave us with \u201cfew common criteria for making important life choices.\u201dSo what about boredom, again?It\u2019s best to stop expecting the book to be about that. Ms. Hoffman does.She barrels ahead into solutions for our paradoxically harried ennui, including close listening to Mozart and keeping a diary. She also strongly suggests we get off the devices. Technology, a mixed blessing to be sure, is here a towering straw man, responsible for much of our unhappiness.\u201cOur coexistence with digital devices has affected our patience and shortened the span of our attention,\u201d runs a typical sentence. She bemoans \u201cthe segmentation of thought encouraged by digital technologies,\u201d \u201cthe constant barrage of external stimuli,\u201d and the \u201cvirtual knowledge\u201d we get from \u201cthe flat spaces of computer screens and via abbreviated communications.\u201dShe\u2019s a fan of \u201cauthentic human contact,\u201d but worries that by texting and Facebook messaging so often, \u201cwe may be losing track of what such contact is, or how we can achieve it.\u201dTechnology proselytizers could simply dismiss Ms. Hoffman as a \u201cget off my lawn\u201d type, and she might even embrace the label. But even this reader, a lip-service Luddite who\u2019s tired of interacting with his iPhone first thing each morning, thought Ms. Hoffman was making the case against technology sound too easy. There are dozens of unexamined assumptions in this book, about what humans are built for, how they best thrive.And though Ms. Hoffman is mostly a lucid writer, she can lapse into fogginess, repeating the importance, for instance, of knowing ourselves in \u201cthree dimensions.\u201d And there are a few low-calorie gnostic pronouncements: \u201cWe need to think inwards, and to think from within.\u201dMany of us would agree, vigorously, with Ms. Hoffman about the problems we share. But her analysis of those problems, and her proposed solutions for them, are a bit boring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Inauguration: A Day of Ceremony, Protests and Celebration", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byInauguration Briefing\u25a0 President Trump\u2019s era on the government web began almost immediately with the wiping out of Obama-era initiatives and a new brand of policy pronouncement. But two sides can play that game.\u25a0 As Mr. Trump dined with dignitaries and members of Congress in the Capitol, the police skirmished with protesters, hurling flash-bang grenades to drive them from the inauguration parade route.\u25a0 Hillary Clinton, who won the popular vote by nearly three million but lost the presidency, was on hand for her former rival\u2019s swearing-in at the Capitol.Mr. Obama clarified last year that he wanted the King bust in the Oval Office \u201cto remind me of all the hard work of a lot of people who would somehow allow me to have the privilege of holding this office.\u201d But he said he also kept the Churchill bust nearby, just outside his private office in the second-floor White House residence.Hours after the Senate confirmed James. N. Mattis as secretary of defense and John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security, President Trump signed their commissions in the Oval Office. Vice President Mike Pence swore in both generals in his ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, across from the West Wing.Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general, issued a statement to the Defense Department casting the United States as a bulwark of the international order and the guardian of important alliances. He vowed the Pentagon would work \u201cfor an America that remains a steady beacon of hope for all mankind.\u201d\u201cRecognizing that no nation is secure without friends, we will work with the State Department to strengthen our alliances,\u201d Mr. Mattis added.In tone and substance, Mr. Mattis\u2019s short statement, like his congressional testimony last week, seemed intended to reassure partners abroad. It also appeared at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s populist vision of putting America first at the expense of longtime allies.29 PhotosIt didn\u2019t take long.\u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve been held back by burdensome regulations on our energy industry. President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years.\u201d\u201cPeace through strength will be at the center of that foreign policy. This principle will make possible a stable, more peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.\u201dFor some of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, hope for that @POTUS handle is high. They want him to stop using the handle he\u2019s had since he joined Twitter, @realDonaldTrump, and accept staff management of the official account.But Mr. Trump relishes the freedom and direct-contact he has over Twitter, and he has continued using his personal account, with a staff member tweeting from it even as he was signing the official nominations of his Cabinet appointees after the swearing-in.Many supporters and protesters scrambled to find a spot along the parade route to get a glimpse of President Trump. Near the White House on 15th and G, a small group of people wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats gathered behind tall metal barricades and layers of security.\u201cWell, we didn\u2019t realize we needed tickets,\u201d Lisa Ross, a new Washington resident, said. \u201cWe still wanted to come and see what the inauguration is all about.\u201dMadeline Valentine, arriving at the barricade after running into multiple roadblocks, said it was pretty clear \u201cthey don\u2019t want us here.\u201dShe traveled to Washington from Detroit for the Women\u2019s March on Washington on Saturday, but said she wanted to witness inaugural festivities, too.\u201cI wanted to be here today to express my concerns for the nation,\u201d she said.As Mr. Trump grew closer, the apparent split in the crowd became evident: a pocket of pink pussycat hats and a pocket of red Trump hats.Protesters and police officers faced off in downtown Washington just hours after Mr. Trump was sworn into office, with the sound of flash-bang grenades echoing through cordoned-off streets and the smell of tear gas wafting through the air.As some protesters chanted, some in black face masks threw rocks and bricks at officers who responded with tear gas and flash grenades, trying to clear the streets. The police formed a line blocking off parts of K Street, the heart of Washington\u2019s lobbying district. But hundreds of people remained, and some started a small fire in the street.The protesters had struck first, hurling rocks at the police and hauling newspaper racks into the street.During his one and only news conference as president-elect, Mr. Trump said no one cared about his refusal to release his tax returns but reporters.President Trump\u2019s first official act as commander in chief was to pave the way for his defense secretary to be confirmed by the Senate.Then he had some fun passing out pens.Minutes after being sworn in at the Capitol, Mr. Trump went to the President\u2019s Room just off the Senate floor to sign a series of papers, including legislation cleared by Congress last week that provides a waiver for Gen. James N. Mattis from a legal requirement that military officers wait seven years before serving as defense secretary.Seated at a large table and surrounded by lawmakers from both parties, the newly minted president also signed nominations for the rest of his cabinet, joking with members of Congress as he cycled through a series of pens, one for each nominee, and asked them which ones they would like to keep.\u201cI\u2019ll give you Elaine \u2014 you want Elaine?\u201d Mr. Trump asked Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, apparently referring to Elaine Chao, his nominee for secretary of transportation. \u201cAre we getting some more pens back there?\u201d he asked moments later. \u201cThis is fun.\u201dMr. Trump also signed a proclamation for a national day of patriotism.There was no word from Mr. Trump\u2019s aides about whether he would issue any executive orders on his first day in office, although they have hinted that he would move immediately to roll back Obama administration policies on health care and immigration, among others.The Trump administration on Friday afternoon suspended a plan to reduce the fees that borrowers must pay on some federally backed mortgage loans.The Obama administration announced the cut last week in an effort to make homeownership more accessible to lower-income borrowers. A family that borrowed $200,000 would have saved $500 in annual fees. But Republicans had decried the change as risky.The fees cover the cost of defaults, so the change would have reduced the money available to cover such losses.Ajit Pai, a senior Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission, is expected to be named chairman of the agency, in what is expected to be the beginning of a period of regulatory unwinding, according to two sources familiar with the transition team\u2019s thinking.The main target will be net neutrality regulations that treat broadband providers like utilities and that forbid internet service providers from blocking or slowing websites.Mr. Pai is a veteran telecommunications lawyer, who has shifted in and out of government. He worked for Verizon from 2001 to 2003 and served as deputy general counselor at the F.C.C. from 2007 to 2011. In 2013, President Obama appointed him as a minority Republican commissioner.Mr. Pai has a drastically different view on competition in telecommunications than Mr. Wheeler. Mr. Pai has said web firms such as Google and Facebook are competitors to wireless, cable and broadcast companies in voice calls, messaging and streaming video. The F.C.C. under Mr. Wheeler, Mr. Pai said, strapped too many rules on internet service providers without providing real evidence that consumers were harmed without regulations.Although Mr. Pai is well liked by other Republicans in government, his impending appointment was greeted with much consternation by consumer groups.\u201cI\u2019m proud to attend with my husband and parents, all immigrants.\u201d \u201cWe will simply attend to witness the historic and peaceful transition of power that is the backbone of our republic.\u201d\u2014 Jennifer Lindrud, 54, North Oaks, Minn.\u201cBeing a member of the L.G.B.T.Q. community who supports Trump means that I\u2019m not just a single-issue voter. Trump represents a new era of the Republican Party.\u201d\u2014 Mark Meunier, 32, Springboro, OhioHillary Clinton, who amassed nearly three million votes more than Mr. Trump on Election Day but lost in the Electoral College, was on hand with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to watch the man who called her a \u201cnasty woman\u201d take the oath of office. She shook Mr. Trump\u2019s hand at the post-inauguration luncheon in the Capitol.As she was shown on a large screen on the National Mall, some in the crowd shouted, \u201cLock her up.\u201d They chanted, \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump.\u201dWhile crowd-size estimates were not immediately available, Washington\u2019s transit system released ridership numbers.As of 11 a.m., Metro logged 193,000. Four years ago, there were 317,000 at the same point on Inauguration Day. At Mr. Obama\u2019s first inauguration, the number was 513,000.On George W. Bush\u2019s second inauguration, 197,000 had taken the subway by 11 a.m.As Mr. Trump gave his inaugural address, one of the biggest cheers from the crowd came when he spoke about eradicating \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\u201cFinally, someone said it,\u201d a supporter shouted. That man was Mark Constantine, a lawyer from Yonkers.\u201cI\u2019ve never been to an inauguration before,\u201d Mr. Constantine said. \u201cBut I made a point about coming.\u201dNearby, Eric Metaxas, an evangelical writer and radio host from Manhattan who voted for Mr. Trump, said he was bothered by people who have protested the new president\u2019s administration.\u201cThe level of anger frightens me,\u201d Mr. Metaxas said. \u201cIt\u2019s not coming from the Trump side.\u201dOn Friday morning, just minutes before Mr. Trump was sworn in, news publications reflected the country\u2019s great division.\u201cWinter Comes,\u201d blared The Huffington Post, the left-leaning site founded by Arianna Huffington, in all capital letters.\u201cYes, this is really happening,\u201d BuzzFeed said briefly on its home page, in the lower right corner of its live video of the inauguration.By contrast, The Drudge Report, the conservative website known for its flashy headlines, struck a more optimistic tone with the headline, \u201cIt All Begins Today.\u201dBreitbart, the right-wing website that embraced Mr. Trump during the election campaign, was, perhaps surprisingly, the most subdued, going with the blandly factual \u201cThe Inauguration of President Donald Trump.\u201dFox News announced that Nigel Farage, the right-wing populist British leader who helped lead last year\u2019s Brexit campaign, would join the network as a regular contributor. The move grants Mr. Farage, who is friendly with Mr. Trump, a foothold on the country\u2019s most watched cable-news network, in a year of critical elections in Europe where right-wing groups are on the rise.As Mr. Trump gave his inaugural address, Madea Benjamin, a founder of the left-wing stunt protester group Code Pink, strode toward the dais in a section reserved for honored guests and journalists, pausing just below the president as she shouted that he was not a \u201clegitimate president.\u201dTwo Capitol Police officers quickly grabbed her and escorted her out.How she got that ticket, now that\u2019s a story.As Mr. Trump assumes the presidency, he and his senior aides have settled on a strategy to begin slowly unwinding regulations and policies from the Obama era, opting against the more sudden approach that some inside his team had recommended.The plan, as described by one senior Trump official, is \u201cmore rolling thunder than shock and awe.\u201dSome aides to Mr. Trump, including his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, had advised the president-elect to make a more dramatic show of his first few days in office, by signing a flurry of executive orders and making new policy pronouncements that would undo many of Mr. Obama\u2019s actions on immigration, wages, banking and the environment.But Mr. Trump has opted instead to let his plans trickle out over the next 30 days, this official said.He was encouraged to elaborate.It seems word had traveled to Catholic University, where he was a student, that the inaugural parade of 1953 needed bodies. My future father-in-law soon found himself standing alone, in cap and gown, on a long float crawling down Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 a nervous representation of Eisenhower\u2019s tenure as president of Columbia University.Intrigued, Nora searched online for a photograph of this odd moment, but only came up with that year\u2019s inaugural program. She then contacted Kathy Struss, the audio/visual archivist at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, Kan., to explain the situation: guy in cap and gown, on an inaugural float.The library has more than 330,000 photographs. Still, Ms. Struss, who has been with the library since 1977, faintly recalled the image, and began her cross-reference hunt. And there it was, a National Park Service photograph, preserved in a red-covered album that Eisenhower had given to his mother-in-law, Elivera M. Doud, as a birthday gift.And yes, that is Joe Trinity in cap and gown, aboard a float adorned with an inspirational banner (\u201cYouth is the Future of America \u2013 Eisenhower\u201d) and being pulled by a jeep bearing the name of the Young Republicans National Federation.This is particularly delicious, since my father-in-law, a retired public-school teacher, is a lifelong Democrat. His excuse: It paid a few bucks.DAN BARRY12 PhotosAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Ambivalence Toward Trump Turns to Anger", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Friday morning, Silicon Valley was largely ambivalent about President Trump. The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration.By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination.In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades.Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the 10th-richest man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He good-naturedly obliged.The tech companies\u2019 reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did.That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump\u2019s order proclaimed that \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d and would be suspended indefinitely.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said that his great-grandparents had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam.Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was \u201cnot the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201d Mr. Musk was born in South Africa.Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, \u201cthere was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is.\u201dBeyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world.\u201cAlmost every company\u2019s products \u2014 Google, Apple, Airbnb \u2014 has a global customer base,\u201d Mr. Levie said. \u201cThese policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors.\u201dBy early last week, the companies sensed trouble.Murtadha al-Tameemi, 24, an Iraqi-born software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out.\u201cIt may be my na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how politics and industries interact, but I don\u2019t interpret the tech community\u2019s opposition to the president as a political stance,\u201d Mr. Tameemi said. \u201cIt seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them.\u201dThe larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was \u201cconcerned.\u201d Apple said, \u201cIt is not a policy we support.\u201d Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards\u201d and said it would create \u201ccollateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dIt was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. \u201cIt feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,\u201d said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One.Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists.Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media.Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory team.That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day.In an email to employees on Saturday titled \u201cStanding up for what\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday.As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers \u2014 largely immigrants \u2014 began a one-hour work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order.Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen.\u201cAfter the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,\u201d Mr. Altman said. \u201cNow they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come.\u201dMr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p.m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Under Armour Simple Takes Its Toll", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsUnder Armour\u2019s founder-led approach is wearing thin. The company, a $12 billion athletic-wear maker, reported its slowest top-line growth in eight years and signaled more challenges ahead. Its chief financial officer is also bailing. The news wiped a quarter off the company\u2019s market value. And the chief executive\u2019s strategy of maintaining power is underperforming badly.Nearly two years ago, the chief executive, Kevin Plank, set out a plan worthy of Silicon Valley to ensure that he remained at the helm of the company he started in 1996. Under Armour changed its capital structure in a move not unlike Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, and Facebook, issuing nonvoting stock to offset sunset provisions that would have diluted Mr. Plank\u2019s control. He has 65 percent of the vote but only 15 percent of the economic stake, according to Under Armour\u2019s latest proxy.Investors did well in the first decade after the company\u2019s 2005 initial public offering as the split-adjusted stock soared more than sevenfold. But the shares have plummeted nearly 60 percent over the last 18 months, a period that closely overlaps with the new share scheme.During the fourth quarter, Under Armour\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth slowed drastically to 12 percent because of deep discounting caused by slower foot traffic. The company\u2019s signature compression shirts, which emphasize athletic performance, face growing competition from a slew of competitors. Nike, Adidas, Lululemon, Macy\u2019s, The Gap and J. Crew are just a few brands that are pushing their own athletic wear, as well as hoodies, yoga pants and the like. The absence of stores like the bankrupt Sports Authority that once carried the brand has also taken a toll.The forecast for 2017 doesn\u2019t inspire confidence. Under Armour said top-line growth was projected to increase about 12 percent, well below prior expectations of about 20 percent. Operating income and gross margins will slip this year too. Mr. Plank mentioned on a Tuesday call with investors that he now keeps whiteboards in his office with the operational mantra \u201cmake UA simple.\u201d Putting the focus back on performance rather than share classes would be a good way to start.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putting The Times\u2019s First Email Address to Bed", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byOn Thursday, Dec. 29, The New York Times switched off markoff@nyt.com. Although the internet database asserts that it was created in 1994, I originally registered the domain at least three, possibly five, years earlier \u2014 the exact date is lost in history.The internet was just coming into existence as a new form of scientific and academic networking when I arrived at The Times in spring 1988. It burst into the nation\u2019s popular consciousness six months later when a young Cornell graduate student unleashed a stealthy program called a worm into the then-brand new internet. That would be the first hint of the potential power of computer networks for both good and ill.At the time, it was more of a curiosity. Nevertheless, because the incident happened during the transition away from the original Pentagon-funded ARPAnet, the worm caused a sensation, as there was concern that it might represent some kind of military attack on the country (sadly, a premonition of things to come). On the first day of the worm, The Washington Post article about it had six bylines.I had stumbled across the ARPAnet a decade earlier when there was little computer security. To get my first email address I had only to use my 300-baud modem to dial the NASA-Ames \u201ctip\u201d in Mountain View, Calif. and make my way to a computer in Cambridge known as MIT-AI. Anyone who could find their way there was automatically awarded an account on the system. It afforded me an easy way to read the Human-Nets mailing list \u2014 a revealing window into a continuing discussion about the impact of technology by those who were building the computer-based systems that would transform society during the next two decades.By the late 1980s there were already lots of email systems around \u2014 the Source, CompuServe, MCIMail and Prodigy all were offering electronic mail islands. The online world was only beginning to be interconnected.When I arrived at The Times I was using an email account on a Sausalito, Calif., conferencing system known as the Well. It seemed that markoff@nyt.com would be a nice way to announce the fact that I was the Times reporter whose beat was computer networking. (To thoroughly date me, I gave up the beat when I moved back to California in 1992 to cover Silicon Valley, and Peter Lewis was given the newly created internet beat.)In any case, before leaving in 1990 or 1991 I had toyed with the idea of putting together a mail server on a loaner computer that had shown up in the newsroom from NeXt, Steve\u2019s Jobs\u2019s interim company while he was in exile from Apple.It didn\u2019t take long to realize that I wasn\u2019t going to be my own system administrator, at which point I quickly moved markoff@nyt.com to Internex, an ISP based in Menlo Park, Calif., that was the first ISDN (broadband of its day!) internet service provider in Northern California.The next year, in 1995, when The Times finally went online, I dutifully offered the nyt.com domain to the paper. To my surprise, initially The Times turned my offer down. (Do you have any idea what a three-letter domain is worth these days?) I was told that nyt.com would be confused with the internet address of New York Telephone, which still existed at the time.Recently I learned from Walter Baranger, one of the paper\u2019s early telecommunications people, that to put the paper online he and a group of IT systems people sat in a room and picked the paper\u2019s domain name. Although nyt.com was a contender, it lost out to nytimes.com after a fair amount of debate.For about a year I continued to receive mail at markoff@nyt.com. I didn\u2019t bother to run a web server \u2014 as I would infamously note several years later, my \u201cblog\u201d was www.nytimes.com \u2014 and so anyone who typed nyt.com would end up with a dreaded \u201c404\u201d error.About a year later one of the systems people came back to me and asked if I would give nyt.com to the paper, and I did. The deal I struck was that in exchange for the domain I would be able to continue to get mail at markoff@nyt.com.I continued to receive mail at that address through this past December, although every couple of years someone in the systems department would disconnect me and I would have to remind them of the agreement. During that time it became a tremendous spam magnet and so I let it go at the end of 2016 with only a small amount of remorse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Fix for Gender Bias in Health Care? Check", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byFixesWhen Dr. Elliott Haut and his team at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore designed their blood clot prevention protocol back in 2006, they didn\u2019t expect to discover systemic gender bias. But the data were clear and the implications were alarming: Women who were trauma patients at Johns Hopkins Hospital were in considerably greater danger of dying of preventable blood clots than men.Why? Because doctors were less likely to provide them with the appropriate blood clot prevention treatment. At Hopkins, as at many hospitals, both men and women were receiving treatment at less than perfect rates, but while 31 percent of male trauma patients were failing to get proper clot prevention, for women, the rate was 45 percent. That means women were nearly 50 percent more likely to miss out on blood clot prevention.Blood clots, gelatinous tangles that can travel through the body and block blood flow, kill more people every year than breast cancer, AIDS and car crashes combined. But many of these clots can be avoided \u2014 if doctors prescribe the right preventive measures.Haut is a trauma surgeon, not a bias expert, so gender disparities were the last thing on his mind when he and his team put together a computerized checklist that requires doctors to review blood clot prevention for every patient. \u201cOur goal was not to improve care for men or women or whoever, it was to improve the care of everybody,\u201d he said. But what they found was that after the introduction of the checklist, appropriate treatment for everyone spiked. And the gender disparity disappeared.In trying to end preventable blood clots, the Hopkins team may have quietly stumbled upon a way to eliminate at least one form of gender bias.Gender bias has received significant attention in recent years, and has been scrutinized as a factor in the dearth of female chief executives, the treatment of presidential candidates and the lower pay of Hollywood actresses.It\u2019s not clear what causes these differences. While situational factors and variations among patients may explain some of them, broad gender differences in treatment protocols that play out across large numbers of patients suggest a systemic bias. What\u2019s especially difficult in ending such discrimination is that providers may not even realize they\u2019re behaving in biased ways.In the case of blood clot prevention, doctors\u2019 assumptions about women\u2019s risk factors could lead to disparities in treatment. \u201cThere might be stereotypes about women\u2019s biology or environment or occupation that could all play into medical decision-making,\u201d Kolehmainen said.Whether unintentional, unconscious or simply based on erroneous assumptions, treatment differentials clearly exist. Interventions like the Hopkins checklist can help correct them.The Hopkins checklist is considered a \u201cdecision support tool,\u201d and it works like this: Whenever a provider is admitting a patient to the hospital, a computerized checklist pops up onscreen. It asks if the patient has specific risk factors for blood clots, or for bleeding from blood thinning medication. Then the system offers a recommended treatment.But implicit gender bias isn\u2019t about forgetting, it\u2019s about making assumptions. And this is where the Hopkins checklist makes a difference. In spelling out the specific criteria for determining a treatment plan and then recommending one, the checklist interrupts bias in two important ways.First, it disentangles the thinking that goes into a medical decision. Typically, clinicians aggregate relevant patient information and use their judgment to arrive at the best course of action. The Hopkins checklist disaggregates that decision into its constituent parts. In a sense, the Hopkins checklist puts the decision about blood clot prevention through a prism, separating out and clarifying the sub-decisions the way a prism separates white light into its rainbow colors. In illuminating each step, the checklist interrupts habitual biases, preventing them from corrupting the decision-making process.Second, the checklist reduces reliance on human judgment. \u201cThe decision support tool makes it very cut and dry \u2014 the decision isn\u2019t, \u2018Hey, what do you think you should do?\u2019 The decision is \u2014 click, click, click, here\u2019s what the computer says to do,\u201d Haut said.Interviews with more than 100 staff members at 10 British National Health Service hospitals revealed that some providers opt out because they\u2019re not convinced of the checklist\u2019s utility. Others feel they haven\u2019t been adequately consulted, and the checklist is just another irritating dictum from on high. Yet others felt the checklist wasn\u2019t correctly tailored for a specific scenario.But, crucially, these checklists were all optional. The Hopkins checklist was mandatory. Clinicians can override its recommendation, but they can\u2019t opt out of participating. \u201cThese passive approaches don\u2019t seem to work,\u201d Haut said. \u201cHanding out laminated cards, education, reminding people \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work as well.\u201dThe checklist principle could be used in other fields as well. Indeed, structuring decision-making in order to root out bias is already gaining traction in business \u2014 companies like Google and Slack have begun to use structured interviews to avoid discrimination in hiring. Instead of allowing interviews to be free-form, guided by the interviewer\u2019s own judgments, these companies use the same interview techniques and questions for each candidate. Just as every Hopkins patient is assessed for the same blood clot risk factors, every job candidate is assessed the same way. This ensures fairer interviews.Given the chances of clot-related deaths, that\u2019s dozens more women\u2019s lives saved, and dozens of families who didn\u2019t lose a mother, sister, grandmother or daughter. And that\u2019s just one hospital. Rolled out across the country, this relatively straightforward intervention could save thousands of lives \u2014 of both women and men \u2014 each year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook, Nodding to Its Role in Media, Starts a Journalism Project", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook is increasingly owning up to its role as one of the world\u2019s largest distributors of information by taking more responsibility for the millions of stories that flow through its site.On Wednesday, the social network made its latest move to acknowledge that role by announcing the Facebook Journalism Project.The effort calls for the company to forge deeper ties with publishers by collaborating on publishing tools and features before they are released. Facebook will also develop training programs and tools for journalists to teach them how to better search its site to report on news and events. And Facebook wants to help train members of the public to find news sources they trust, while fighting the spread of fake news across its site.The project will begin in coming weeks in partnership with publishers including The Washington Post and Vox Media. (The New York Times is not among the initial partners for some parts of the test, but it has been invited and plans to participate in the project.)In an interview about the Facebook Journalism Project, Fidji Simo, a director of product at the company, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard loud and clear over the last year that there are questions about our role in this ecosystem. It has added an extra motivation for us to be involved even earlier on.\u201dThe new initiative is something of a peace offering from Facebook to publishers who share news content on the network.Publishers have long considered Facebook a kind of frenemy \u2014 increasingly relying on the social network to spread their stories but often wary of depending too much on one medium to reach an audience. Facebook also regularly changes its algorithms, which can make or break a publisher\u2019s traffic and revenue. Because of such changes, sites like Elite Daily and Upworthy have experienced wide swings in traffic.\u201cThere would be times when Facebook would come to us with a new product or function, but by the time we were invited to participate, product development was already kind of a done deal,\u201d said Shailesh Prakash, the chief intelligence officer and vice president for digital product development for The Washington Post. \u201cYou had to fix your content and design into their parameters.\u201d\u201cNow we\u2019re finally coming to a more formal positioning of a model where we can begin working together much earlier in the process,\u201d Mr. Prakash said.Facebook and Mr. Prakash said that earlier collaboration could improve relationships and perhaps help overcome some of the challenges that publishers face, such as how to increase subscriptions or newsletter sign-ups from inside Facebook. The company has also expressed interest in working with publishers to build products for local news and in promoting small, independent news media.Facebook also plans to make CrowdTangle, an analytics tool it acquired in November, free to use. CrowdTangle is popular with publishers and journalists searching for Facebook data.Other components of the project may help repair Facebook\u2019s status as a place to discover news, after it attracted criticism over the amount of fake stories appearing on the site. Facebook said it hoped to train audiences with \u201cnews literacy\u201d programs to better spot false news, as well as by producing public-service announcements about how to determine which news sources to trust. Facebook may dole out financial assistance grants for such projects.Facebook cautioned that its journalism project was in the early stages, and would evolve as the needs of publishers, readers and journalists changed. But the company said it would not shy from questions about its role in news media.\u201cAs an industry, we have a lot to learn collaboratively,\u201d said Ms. Simo, the Facebook director of product. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is an increased commitment to that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Newton\u2019s head spun round. There was that Los Angeles Ram who flew at Newton and snapped his head back like a bobblehead doll.I caught myself wincing. Play after play, game after game, I was watching the winner of last season\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award get his brain bounced. Newton was gentlemanly in response, allowing after one game that \u201cIt\u2019s not fun getting hit in the head.\u201dIn one game, he slid as a Washington Redskins linebacker went airborne and ground Newton\u2019s head into the grass. Newton flipped the football lightly toward the player who had just hit him.Newton was assessed an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty for his response.The league\u2019s executive vice president for health and safety policy, Jeff Miller, talked for many minutes about new research initiatives and biomechanical advances, $100 million here and $100 million there. My mind wandered \u2014 it was though I had ended up at a NASA briefing on a space launch.Then Miller offered us a movie tip. Make sure, he said, to watch the new video on how the concussion protocol works.\u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen it, I would commend it to you,\u201d he said.I\u2019m sure that Newton must have enjoyed watching that particular video before he sustained another severe concussion this season.Not long after that, Dr. Robert Heyer chimed in, \u201cI know what we are doing will make a difference.\u201dDr. Heyer is president of the N.F.L.\u2019s Physicians Society, and what a wondrously busy group that society must be.Let\u2019s look a little closer at the league\u2019s data. Concussions in regular-season games were, in fact, down, although that\u2019s because concussions the previous year reached a five-year high of 183. In 2013, the league reported 148 concussions; in 2016, it was 167.Then there\u2019s the matter of torn anterior cruciate ligaments. These are brutal, career-threatening injuries, and the N.F.L. reported 56 in 2016, compared with 61 in 2013. As for tears of the medial collateral ligament, there were 143 this past season and 134 in 2013.All of which is to say that on questions of torn ligaments and brains smacked about in their pans, the N.F.L. is hobbling sideways.The league\u2019s doctors and analytics experts gently pushed the argument that this season\u2019s statistics might be better than they look. Players, they said, now report injuries more readily.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increased number of self-reported concussions this year,\u201d noted Dr. John York, a co-chairman of the San Francisco 49ers. \u201cI would also say that they have an effect that may cause an increase in the number of concussions that we identify.\u201dAs players are learning more about the grievous damage this game does to their minds and bodies, they are getting better at reporting that in real time.But the bottom line does not change: We can pile protocol atop protocol and drop a moonshot\u2019s worth of dough on studies, but at its core, football remains an inherently brutal and dangerous sport.A year ago, I sat in the lobby of a hotel and chatted with Warren Moon, one of the dominant quarterbacks of the 1980s and \u201990s. He\u2019s a personable man just now edging into his 60s. He had this anecdote for me: Several friends of his, former N.F.L. comrades, often pull out of their driveways, go three or four blocks, and then call their wives and ask, \u201cWhere am I going?\u201dThat is not normal for that age groupThen there was the intriguing question asked at the news conference by a reporter from The Charlotte Observer. His news organization, he said, had monitored the reporting of concussions across the league, and found large and disturbing variations among teams. That struck me as a red flag.I am, however, just a medical amateur. Dr. Christina Mack, director of epidemiology for QuintilesIMS, which compiled the injury data for the N.F.L., fielded that question.\u201cWe feel confident,\u201d she said, \u201cthat we\u2019re getting the concussions in equal numbers from the teams.\u201dOh, thanks.Last February, after the Super Bowl, I wrote a column taking Newton to task for his churlish sulking after his team lost to the Broncos. A reader who is a nurse suggested that I might have been unfair to Newton. He had taken a tremendous beating that night, and she noted that his symptoms \u2014 monosyllabic responses, fatigue and lack of interaction with reporters \u2014 were consistent with being concussed.The N.F.L. made no such public finding. I confess, however, that the nurse gave me cause for pause then, and even more so now. We report on a brutal, perhaps morally indefensible game. We are best advised perhaps to withhold our judgments.After the news conference Thursday, I called Bob Carmichael, who played football for the University of Colorado before moving on to NFL Films. He is now an award-winning photographer, having long ago left football\u2019s ravages behind.\u201cThere\u2019s so much posing going on, so much pretending that you can make this sport safe,\u201d Carmichael said. \u201cHow do you rationalize this roulette that we are playing with young men?\u201dFrom high school to college to the pros, rationalization is a game that is increasingly difficult to play.Email: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

A law passed in 2014 prohibits local jails from holding immigrants any longer than required by criminal law, with exceptions for violent and other serious crimes. And most counties in the state also prohibit holding immigrants beyond their sentence if federal immigration agents do not have a judicial order. And legislation currently making its way through the Legislature would further expand the law, by prohibiting all state and local law enforcement agencies to respond to requests from immigration authorities.The mayors of San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Berkeley released a joint statement vowing to keep their existing policies in place. Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, who has long shied away from the term sanctuary city, said the Police Department would continue its four-decades-old policy that prohibits officers from questioning people for the purpose of determining their immigration status and arresting them for illegal entry to the United States.\u201cWe all want a nation of laws, but we are also a nation of immigrants,\u201d Mayor Garcetti said in a brief interview.How the executive order will play out over the next several years remains murky.\u2022 What obstacles could the federal government face to cutting off funds to sanctuary cities?Trump will face massive political resistance and challenges in the courts. The Supreme Court has made clear it is the exclusive function of the federal government to enforce immigration laws. Coercing states and localities to perform these functions would also be constitutionally suspect under the 10th Amendment, which safeguards states\u2019 rights.\u2022 How painful could the cuts be?The president has not identified the source of funds at issue. Nor has an amount been specified. He has indicated that he plans to revive a program, commonly known as 287(g), that could provide additional funding to localities that partner with immigration authorities. But participation in the program is voluntary and known to divert resources from local law enforcement priorities.\u2022 How would sanctuary jurisdictions be defined?The president\u2019s order doesn\u2019t say. Trump has suggested he defines them as jurisdictions that fail to honor immigration detainers. However, federal courts have found that such detentions violate Fourth Amendment protections against unlawful search and seizure.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Each year from December through March, colonies of northern elephant seals gather on beaches to perform their birthing and mating rituals.Mr. Menke, 73, leads field trips at Piedras Blancas.

Justices Hear Sides", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court considered on Tuesday how broad the government\u2019s authority is to deport immigrants who commit serious crimes.The question was in one sense fairly technical, concerning whether a federal law on the subject was unconstitutionally vague. In another sense, though, the argument was part of a larger debate over the nation\u2019s immigration laws, which President-elect Donald J. Trump has pledged to enforce vigorously.Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the laws have grown increasingly draconian.\u201cWe have many more criminal sanctions with harsher sentences now,\u201d she said. \u201cToday what\u2019s at stake is a lot more than what was at stake decades ago.\u201dEdwin S. Kneedler, a deputy solicitor general, said there was another side to the question.\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake can\u2019t be viewed just from that perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is the fact that the immigration laws are vital to the nation\u2019s national security and foreign relations and the safety and welfare of the country.\u201dThe case, Lynch v. Dimaya, No. 15-1498, concerns James Dimaya, a native of the Philippines who became a lawful permanent resident in 1992, when he was 13. In 2007 and 2009, he was convicted of residential burglary.The government sought to deport him on the theory that he had committed an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d which the immigration law defines to include any offense \u201cthat, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201dBoth laws, the government said then, require courts to identify features of a hypothetical typical offense and then to judge the risk of violence arising from them.Justice Elena Kagan, quoting from Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s majority opinion in the 2015 case, asked how judges are to decide the features of a typical offense.Should they use, she asked, \u201ca statistical analysis\u201d of reported decisions? \u201cA survey? Expert evidence? Google? Gut instinct?\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s a multiple-choice test,\u201d Justice Kagan said, suggesting that all of the choices risked unconstitutional vagueness. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201dMr. Kneedler said there were important distinctions between the two cases, notably that the one in 2015 arose from a criminal prosecution and the one at issue on Tuesday from an immigration proceeding, which is a civil action.Mr. Kneedler asked the justices not to place too much weight on that observation, saying the question had not been raised in the briefs at the time. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not seem to think that mattered.\u201cSomething has to be briefed before we say it\u2019s the law?\u201d he asked.E. Joshua Rosenkranz, a lawyer for Mr. Dimaya, said the 1951 case concluded the matter.\u201cIn our view and in the view of all of the lower courts,\u201d he said, \u201cJordan settles the question on whether it\u2019s the same standard for criminal deportation.\u201dBut Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said that extending scrutiny that applies to criminal laws challenged for vagueness to civil ones would be a major step.\u201cIt certainly is true that deportation has more severe consequences than the typical civil case,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are many other civil cases that can have a devastating impact on someone, such as child custody, loss of a professional license, complete destruction of a business, loss of the home.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Your Digital Life Ready for Your Death?", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byYou\u2019ve probably thought about what will happen to your finances, your possessions and maybe even your real estate when you die. But what about your Facebook account? Or your hard-drive backups?For the past two decades, most of us in the modern world have gradually shifted our central living space online. That\u2019s 20-ish years of documenting our real-life experiences while also creating entirely new versions of ourselves in countless places online.These digital lives are basically immortal, so you may as well figure out while you\u2019re still alive what will happen to them after you\u2019re gone.There are two main things to consider: What will happen to your accounts and what will happen to the data contained therein. For example, you can give someone authority to delete your Google account and to download all your photos stored there after you die.It\u2019s a grim thought, but like writing a last will and testament, this has become just another part of death preparation.Many online spaces offer some form of death planning. But this is still a relatively new concept, and some of the most popular destinations on the internet don\u2019t give users a way to plan for their death. In that case, it\u2019s best to establish a plan now with a trusted loved one.For the websites and services that do offer help, here\u2019s what to know.This person will be able to write a post that will remain at the top of your profile, update your profile photo and respond to friend requests. You can also allow that person to download an archive of your public activity (including posts, photos and \u201clikes\u201d), but he or she can\u2019t read your messages, so your most intimate secrets will be safe.Alternatively, you can set your account to delete everything once Facebook is notified of your death.To set this up, choose an amount of time between sign-ins for your account to be designated \u201cinactive.\u201d Once that threshold is met (for example, you don\u2019t sign into any Google service for a certain number of months), your chosen contact will get a prewritten email from you with, presumably, your wishes for your account.Unlike your legacy contact on Facebook, you can designate this person to have full access to your Google account, including email and chat histories, and he or she can download the data you specify. (You also have the option not to give that person access to any of it.)Google also allows you to delete your account and all its data.A similar protocol is in place in the event a user becomes incapacitated, though in that case someone will have to have proof of power of attorney.These three networks offer no type of death planning, though all offer some form of account management for the deceased.Snapchat said it can delete the account of a deceased person at the request of a next-of-kin (with a death certificate).And Tumblr will let a next-of-kin request that an account be deleted.Snapchat and Tumblr declined to say whether they\u2019ll eventually add a similar legacy-contact feature, and LinkedIn said it\u2019s \u201cconsidering\u201d some form of death planning or account memorialization.Beyond that, many sites (including Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL) have relatively standard protocols in place for immediate family members to request the deletion of a deceased person\u2019s account.Online data storage is an especially tricky part of death planning. The industrywide push for privacy and encryption, while great for personal protection, has created its own problems.\u201cThere\u2019s a very real security and privacy implication that can somewhat conflict\u201d with online death planning, said Ahin Thomas, the vice president of marketing for Backblaze, an online backup service. \u201cIf you set up a private encryption key \u2014 we\u2019re not joking \u2014 we don\u2019t have access.\u201dIn one recent case, a widow contacted the company for access to her late husband\u2019s backups, but the data was inaccessible because it had been encrypted.\u201cIt was heartbreaking and sad, and I wish we could\u2019ve done something,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cBut the stuff was encrypted.\u201dSo what can we do? The best advice, Mr. Thomas said, is to simply give the keys to your data to someone you trust. (Some backup services have protocols in place for this. Check with yours.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Instead of Leaving a Job, Why Not Take a Pause?", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byPreoccupationsIn 2011, I knew something was wrong at work. I was a client services manager at Google, and I was miserable. My \u201cthink about work\u201d mental switch was permanently on, and I couldn\u2019t find the off switch. I was constantly thinking about the next email to send, or on my laptop or phone tackling my to-do list. I would be out with friends, and while everyone else was engaged in conversation, I was lost in my own world, missing everything.Although I was burned out, I thought I was doing a good job. My manager felt otherwise and tried to give me constructive feedback. But my ego just wouldn\u2019t allow me to hear what she was saying.Finally, my manager took me aside one day and said: \u201cYou are not a fit for this role. You should think about what\u2019s next for you.\u201dYou might think that this story ended with me leaving the company. But fortunately, Google is one of a minority of companies that offer unpaid leaves of absence not related to family or medical issues. After my manager\u2019s accurate appraisal, I put together a case for the company to allow me a three-month leave.The leave \u2014 or pause, as I came to call it \u2014 allowed me to reassess my path and take stock of my strengths and my goals. I returned to Google three months later with a new job and a new outlook.Detaching from work is one way to pause, but pausing is also a change in mind-set. I define a pause as any intentional shift in behavior.Learn the strategies that chief executives have developed to help you go beyond the polished r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and scripted answers to hire more creative and effective members for your team.My experience with taking a career pause made me realize how valuable it can be for both employers and employees. Currently, a parenting leave is one of the few times a worker may take extended time away from a job. Why should only parents have this opportunity?I happen to have no children. I think leaves should be available for parents and nonparents, and for the purpose of clarifying your career goals. The academic world \u2014 and some corporations \u2014 have embraced the concept of sabbaticals, and I hope more companies recognize how important they are in helping their workers thrive.During my pause, I took a few small vacations, but otherwise I didn\u2019t do all that much \u2014 at least in terms of tackling big outside projects. I did create some rules so that my days would be sure to have structure. Untethered from the corporate world, it would have been all too easy for me to fall into aimlessness.So I made it a requirement to shower once a day, make my bed and get out of the house by 10 a.m. I also had to spend at least an hour a day outside the house doing something I enjoyed, like yoga or hiking. And I made sure to spend no more than 30 minutes at a time on my computer. Taking these simple steps enabled me to clear my head and become more sure of who I really was. I achieved a level of introspection that simply would not have been possible while dealing with the daily urgencies of the office.Given the benefits of taking unpaid leaves, why don\u2019t more companies offer them? My sense is that, in addition to the inconvenience that might result, companies are afraid they will lose more employees permanently. In fact, unpaid leaves are a way to attract and retain talent. Companies can offer this coveted perk and have happier, more satisfied employees who know they are trusted to return. This leads to increased company loyalty, good will, engagement and reduced turnover.Some people will inevitably choose not to return to work after a pause. This may not be such a bad thing and may even be a blessing in disguise that allows someone to pursue a new opportunity that might otherwise not have occurred.Pauses bring employees a renewed sense of purpose and alignment. Exploring new interests or lifelong passions, taking a class, or spending time with family that otherwise wouldn\u2019t happen are all big payoffs. Employees can reflect on what matters in life and take action to align their behavior with that. Employees end up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated \u2014 a feeling that is likely to have a ripple effect on their job and their co-workers when they return.New leadership and growth opportunities emerge from these pauses. Newer or less experienced employees can fill interim roles and learn new skills. This leads to more fully engaged team members, which leads to greater flexibility and adaptability across a team or company.Once you return to work after a leave, you can incorporate pauses into your day-to-day working life, by going outside and taking a walk, for example. I believe workers could benefit from picking a time of day for a \u201cdigital device pause\u201d \u2014 where they intentionally disconnect from any technology. In today\u2019s always-on and connected world, it is too easy to get caught in the spin cycle of never-ending to-dos. Whether it is for a few minutes or a year, pausing is one way we can take a step back before moving forward again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Industry Frets Over Possible Immigration Changes", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 American technology companies for years have relied on a steady stream of skilled engineers from overseas to help them create their products.Now many of those companies and their workers are girding for expected changes to immigration policy under President Trump that the companies say could hurt their ability to tap the technical talent they need to stay competitive.Mr. Trump, who has signed a series of executive orders related to immigration, is expected to soon take similar action on visa programs for foreign workers.The draft proposed a regulation to \u201crestore the integrity of employment-based nonimmigrant worker programs\u201d and to consider options for modifying the H-1B program to \u201censure that beneficiaries of the program are the best and the brightest.\u201dThat language rattled some executives and lawyers representing technology companies because of its implication of sweeping changes.\u201cYou\u2019d be shocked at the number of people who are feeling fear, calling our firm alarmed based on what\u2019s coming out,\u201d said Priya Alagiri, an immigration lawyer based in the Bay Area who has tech clients. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the undocumented. Even people who are here on green cards, legally. Citizens. They\u2019re scared.\u201dSome technology companies have started warning their investors of potential threats to their business from the changes. In a filing on Thursday with securities regulators related to its quarterly financial results, Microsoft included new language related to immigration.\u201cChanges to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts,\u201d the company said in the filing.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in a statement that the company believes \u201cin a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system and in broader immigration opportunities for talented and law-abiding young people like the Dreamers,\u201d a reference to young people who entered the country illegally as children but were allowed to remain by President Barack Obama.\u201cWe are a nation of immigrants, and we all benefit when the best and brightest from around the world can live, work and contribute here,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cI hope we find the courage and compassion to bring people together and make this world a better place for everyone.\u201dThe technology industry is open to changes that have been proposed by members of Congress to better enforce the skilled worker program and adjust limits on the number of visas. But the companies see skilled worker visas as a signature policy issue that they have fought to protect and expand.They fear Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, and others in the administration will take a more severe approach to immigration and sweep up H-1B visas into prohibitions on refugees and stronger border protection.\u201cThe effect would end up being exactly the opposite of what Trump wants. Companies would go offshore like Microsoft did with Vancouver, Canada\u201d to seek talent, said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research group sponsored by several tech firms.But Mr. Trump has made it increasingly clear that immigration policy may change drastically.Any changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, initiated under the Obama administration, could have significant effects on current tech employees who fear for their status.\u201cRight now, we are focused on making sure for protections for 750,000 Dreamers who have DACA stay in place,\u201d said Todd Schulte, president of Fwd.us, in an interview. \u201cIf the goal is to increase public safety and prevent future illegal immigration, the way to do that is to modernize the legal immigration process. That\u2019s radically different than a large-scale ramp-up of rapid deportation.\u201dThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Start-Up New York Gets a New Name, and a Focus on Start-Ups", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported bySome kind of revision appears to be at hand. Tucked among the policy prescriptions and infrastructure plans in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s state budget proposal this week were several changes to Start-Up that narrowed the program\u2019s focus to true start-ups and reduced the number of jobs companies were required to create to qualify for tax benefits.And the program had a new name: the Excelsior Business Program, a rebranding that carries some irony. Instead of allowing businesses of any size to apply, the program will now be open only to what most people would define as start-ups \u2014 small companies in their formative stages \u2014 in a move aimed at encouraging the next Google or Facebook to hatch in New York State.Currently, businesses are required to create at least one new job each year to remain in the program, which exempts companies operating in certain tax-free zones from all taxes for up to a decade; under the new proposal, the requirement would fall to creating one new job in the first five years the company is in the program.Empire State Development, the state agency that oversees the program as well as the governor\u2019s other economic development efforts, will be required to update the public on the initiative, as well as a related program known as Empire Jobs, once a year.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has not budged from his support for Start-Up, and the state insisted this week that the program would produce more than 4,000 new jobs over the next several years. State officials say the lower requirement for yearly job creation should allow companies to focus on growing rather than on hitting specific job targets, and argue that the companies will generate so little revenue at first that any taxes the state would pass up in exchange would be negligible.\u201dThis program remains in place and the proposed adjustments, which are based on feedback from businesses, will help it reach its full potential,\u201d Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Empire State Development, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain firmly committed to the model \u2014 innovative academia-business partnerships coupled with performance-based, tax-free incentives.\u201dThe program will still require young businesses to move to tax-free zones, most of them near universities, in the hope that academic centers, with their students, research and equipment, will help seed economic growth. Under the new proposal, companies that add enough jobs during the tax-free period can qualify for even more tax benefits in later years under a sibling program called Excelsior Jobs, which officials hope will induce successful companies to stay in New York as they grow.\u201cIt was never the scale to be a really transformative program,\u201d said E. J. McMahon, the president of the Empire Center. \u201cThe governor basically made it a lightning rod for attention and criticism.\u201dHe said he thought the state\u2019s faith that entrepreneurs would move to and stay in New York State seemed unrealistic. \u201cWhat if they get acquired by a company from California?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re still pretending that they\u2019re venture capitalists who can spot a unicorn, and unicorns will grow generally quite oblivious to whether they\u2019re offering financing in a tax-free zone.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information from a spokesman, misstated the time period over which the Excelsior Business Program intended to create more than 4,000 jobs. It is a period of three to five years, not five.An earlier version of this article misstated how often Empire State Development was required to provide the public with updates on Start-Up New York. It was required to release annual updates, not quarterly.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Transgender Women Fear Abuse in Immigration Detention", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 Nina Chaubal and her wife, Greta Martela, thought about going through the Rocky Mountains on their way to Chicago from San Diego late last month, but did not want to risk getting caught in a snowstorm. So they drove south through Arizona, where Ms. Chaubal, an Indian national with an invalid work visa, fell into the hands of the Border Patrol.But as a transgender woman, she said she was afraid of what could happen to her while in custody.As she stepped inside the jail on Dec. 30, Ms. Chaubal said she wondered, \u201cIs this what\u2019s waiting for me?\u201dMs. Chaubal, a former software engineer for Google, resumed her trip to Chicago as soon as she was released from Eloy, four days after her arrival. She walked out \u201cfeeling privileged to be able to get out so quickly, and in one piece,\u201d she said in an interview.Others have not been so fortunate. Karyna Jaramillo, a transgender woman from Mexico living in Phoenix without authorization, spent nearly two weeks among male detainees in Eloy in 2015, so fearful for her safety that she said she considered suicide.\u201cThe men whistled, screamed obscenities at me,\u201d Ms. Jaramillo, 46, said. \u201cThey\u2019d touch their genitals and say, \u2018Here comes fresh meat.\u2019\u201dNo one abused her, she said through tears. \u201cBut the emotional trauma, I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\u201cThe abuse, the mistreatment, they are not aberrations,\u201d Mr. Morris said.The question of how to best protect transgender women in immigration detention has confounded federal authorities for some time. In 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 known by its acronym, ICE \u2014 for the first time recognized transgender detainees as a vulnerable population, albeit a small one. According to statistics provided by the agency to The New York Times, among the approximately 41,000 immigrants in custody on Tuesday, 53 identified as transgender.There are guidelines to allow transgender detainees to continue their hormone treatments and be placed in units based on the gender they identify with.While acknowledging the changes, lawyers and advocates say mistreatment and abuse endure. A client of Immigration Equality told her lawyers that she was assaulted in the Hudson County Correctional Facility in Kearny, N.J., on Dec. 21 and was transferred to another detention center in the state afterward, Mr. Morris said.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of training that\u2019s necessary for them to overcome the deep lack of knowledge and understanding about our community and treat us with dignity and respect,\u201d said Ms. Guti\u00e9rrez, who is transgender.Many transgender men and women flee to the United States in search of protection from torture, sexual violence and other types of persecution in their home countries.That is why Ms. Jaramillo, a director at Trans Queer Pueblo in Phoenix, said she left Mexico. She did not, however, petition for asylum. (She said she was not aware it was an option.) She said she landed in immigration detention after a drunken-driving arrest by the local police.She met Ms. Martela, a contract software engineer at the time, while working for Google. They married in San Francisco in the spring of 2015, just before they moved to Chicago to work on Trans Lifeline full time, Ms. Chaubal said.Ms. Chaubal said she had been working on completing her application to adjust her immigration status when she was detained.She always carries her Illinois driver\u2019s license when she travels. That is the document she showed to the Border Patrol agent who stopped their van at the checkpoint near Yuma, Ariz., on Dec. 28.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing if I had left the country and crossed into Mexico,\u201d Ms. Chaubal said. \u201cBut I\u2019m in California, driving down the interstate. There\u2019s this checkpoint in front of us and everything changes.\u201d\u201cWhat would have happened if we hadn\u2019t been able to mobilize so many people, get a lawyer, raise money?\u201d Ms. Martela said. \u201cWhat if we didn\u2019t have the connections that we do?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of immigrants in custody who identified as transgender and misstated the day of that census.

And Is It Secure?\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byAsk The TimesA reader asks: \u201cWhere does cloud storage really reside? And is it secure?\u201d_____\u201cCloud\u201d data is stored on hard drives (much the way data is usually stored). And yes, it\u2019s probably more secure than conventionally stored data.What makes cloud storage different? Instead of being stored directly on your own personal device (the hard drive on your laptop, for example, or your phone), cloud-based data is stored elsewhere \u2014 on servers owned by big companies, usually \u2014 and is made accessible to you via the internet.When people think of cloud computing, they often think of internet-connected public clouds run by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. (If you use Gmail, Dropbox or Microsoft\u2019s Office 365, you are using a cloud service.) There are also consumer clouds that, for example, hold your pictures and social media posts (think of Facebook or Twitter), or store your music and email (think of Apple or Google).Each of these companies has cloud computing systems \u2014 computer servers and storage devices, connected with computer networking equipment \u2014 that span the globe. (Facebook\u2019s systems can allow more than one billion people to interact with them.) Your data is in their computers, usually stored in a regional data center close to where you live.Individual companies can also have their own clouds, called private clouds, that employees and customers access, usually over the internet and on their own private networks.Storage aside, computing clouds can also process information differently; they have special software that enables workloads to be shared among different machines. Your Facebook photos, for example, don\u2019t have a permanent home on a specific chip, but may move among computers.That is a big deal. When workloads are shared, computers can run closer to full capacity, with several programs going at the same time. It\u2019s much more efficient than stand-alone computers running one job at a time.For the people running the computers, it doesn\u2019t really matter where the data or the programs are at any one moment: The stuff is running inside a \u201ccloud\u201d of computing capability. Ideally, if one machine fails, the operation moves over to another part of the system with little downtime.Nowadays, computing clouds are everywhere \u2014 which is one reason people worry about their security. We hear more and more often about hackers coming over the internet and looting the data of thousands of people.Most of those attacks hit traditional servers, though. None of the most catastrophic hacks have been on the big public clouds.The same way that your money is probably safer mixed up with other people\u2019s money in a bank vault than it is sitting alone in your dresser drawer, your data may actually be safer in the cloud: It\u2019s got more protection from bad guys.In the case of the big public clouds, the protection is the work of some of the world\u2019s best computer scientists, hired out of places like the National Security Agency and Stanford University to think hard about security, data encryption and the latest online fraud.And they\u2019re pretty good at keeping things safe online.At least, they have been so far.__________Have a question for Ask The Times?

If you\u2019re among them, you\u2019ll likely give, or receive, artfully decorated red envelopes filled with cash.Giving \u201chong bao\u201d or \u201clai see,\u201d as they are called in Mandarin and Cantonese, comes with many rules. Break them and you can risk causing family rifts.Typically, only married relatives hand out envelopes, and only spouseless, younger family members receive them. At work, they are typically given to subordinates as a sign of recognition.Sometimes, giving too much can be as disrespectful as giving too little.Ideally, the money inside should be unused. Before the holiday, banks struggle to accommodate long lines of customers demanding fresh bills.Technology is changing the tradition. WeChat, a widely used social platform on smartphones, allows for the digital transfer of red envelopes. The practice is increasingly popular.On the eve of Chinese New Year in 2016, eight billion cash gifts were swapped via the app.More traditionally, in parts of China, real coins are hidden in dumplings served at family parties.Whoever eats the dumpling might risk cracking a tooth, but they are promised a year of riches.Patrick Boehler contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dumping a Bad App? Tips for a Painless Breakup", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byTech FixEVERYONE is familiar with this scenario: An app you once loved no longer brings the same joy. It\u2019s gotten buggy over time, or an update transformed it to the point it became unusable.Chances are you thought about calling it quits. But after years of sharing your personal data with this app, you probably gave up and stayed in this stale relationship. You put up with the productivity-killing bugs and odd design changes because moving to a new, potentially better app felt harder than sticking with the bad one.Even so, people have stuck with Evernote partly because taking their notes elsewhere is hardly easy.\u201dWe understand those kind of changes don\u2019t make everyone happy,\u201d said Greg Chiemingo, an Evernote spokesman. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve seen continued growth of paying customers over the last two years.\u201dPeople deserve better than this. Every day you stay with a bad app is time you could be spending with a superior product that will make life better. Here are my tips, based on interviews and personal experience, for a clean break.No app is perfect, but you have to draw the line somewhere. The problem is, you may be in such a rut that you can\u2019t recognize the warning signs.An obvious one is when an app stops working reliably in a way that affects your life. For instance, I called it quits on Apple\u2019s Calendar app when I was planning a dinner with friends last month and the software sent a calendar invite in Greenwich Mean Time rather than Pacific Standard Time. As a result, one person thought we were meeting on Saturday instead of Friday and didn\u2019t show up. (It wasn\u2019t the first time this happened, either.)Brian Fitzpatrick, a former manager at Google who led a team that developed tools to help people move their data to and from Google, said he dumps an app when it has stopped improving.\u201cIt\u2019s still functioning, but you don\u2019t see any changes in it for a very long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a zombie app, I would call it at that point.\u201dAnother sign that it\u2019s time to move on is when you have nobody to talk to. Many popular apps for tasks like note taking, photo management and word processing are connected to social networks, or people you can share data with. If an app\u2019s audience is a ghost town \u2014 like Yahoo\u2019s photo-sharing app, Flickr, which sank in popularity after mobile photo-sharing services like Instagram emerged \u2014 then it\u2019s probably time to leave.Yahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Flickr.The hardest part of breaking up with an app is moving your data. So as a rule of thumb, save a backup copy of your data so that you can export it into a new app. Then carefully search for a better app to suit your needs.As a safety measure before changing apps, you should always keep extra copies of your data somewhere, whether it be in the cloud with a service like Dropbox or on a physical hard drive.Some companies deliberately make exporting your data difficult because they want you to stick around.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like moving into an apartment and finding out at the end of the lease you can\u2019t take your furniture and your books with you,\u201d Mr. Fitzpatrick said.Evernote is a good example. It includes an \u201cExport notes\u201d feature, but it only lets you export notes into two formats that are compatible with just a few other note-taking apps. Microsoft\u2019s note-taking app OneNote, along with Apple\u2019s Notes app, can easily import Evernote records. But if your app of choice is something else, such as Google Keep, you will have to manually paste your notes in the new app.Flickr is also difficult to part ways with. Getting out your photos requires lots of manual labor: You have to download all the photos, which can take a significant amount of time if you have thousands of high-resolution images, and then upload them to a new photo service.When companies don\u2019t provide convenient tools to export your data, look elsewhere by doing a quick web search for solutions. There are plenty of people in the same boat as you, and chances are they have written scripts, or lightweight programs, to automatically pull out your data for you.If there is no convenient way to export your data, sometimes it doesn\u2019t hurt to just take out what is most important to you. Perhaps you don\u2019t need five-year-old notes from Evernote anymore, so you could just manually paste your latest memos and get a fresh start with a different app.On the bright side, you can learn a lot from a tough breakup with an app \u2014 which can be especially useful when looking for a replacement.The biggest lessons: Pick a tool that supports a wide array of formats instead of proprietary ones. And before you commit to a new app, make sure it is as easy to get out as it is to get in.Ditching Apple\u2019s Calendar app was fairly easy. All my calendar data was already stored online and Apple\u2019s app supports calendars from multiple online services including Google, Microsoft and Facebook. The key was finding an app that also supported those services but performed better.After testing several apps, I decided that Fantastical 2, a new app with a cleaner interface for getting a glance at calendar events, was the best one. Once Fantastical 2 was installed, I added my Google calendar accounts to load all my events into the app.Google said it updated Google Voice on Monday with photo sharing and group messaging. But that was too late to keep people like Mr. Fitzpatrick.\u201cA lot of it comes down to, How interested are you in change?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tool Kit for the Donor Eager to Grasp All the Risks of Donation", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersSASHA KRAMER, an ecologist, was having success promoting greater sanitation in Haiti when she lost access to her nonprofit\u2019s only composting site in Port-au-Prince: a dump that was being mismanaged.Her group, SOIL, provides toilets to poor households. Each week it sent representatives to empty the five-gallon buckets, bring the waste to the dump and turn it into compost, which was sold to farmers as fertilizer.Nearly nine years into the work, though, the local dump fell into chaos when the private company managing it lost its contract. The government ceased to keep access roads clear and began burning trash to clear it.\u201cWe managed to keep the compost site open, but we could only get in there once every two weeks,\u201d Dr. Kramer said. \u201cThere was so much smoke out there that it was becoming a health risk.\u201dWorse, she said she didn\u2019t know where to turn to get money for another site.Despite the likelihood of problems, leaders of nonprofit organizations rarely lay out the risks of their projects, lest any hint of failure scare away funders. On the flip side, donors often fail to dig deeply enough to discuss the obstacles a project may encounter. Among donors, 76 percent don\u2019t ask recipients about the risks they face, while 87 percent of nonprofit leaders said grant applications had no questions about risks, according to Open Road Alliance.\u201cThis isn\u2019t anecdotal evidence,\u201d said Laurie Michaels, Open Road\u2019s founder. \u201cThis is donors and funders reporting that 20 percent of the projects need more money. Yet no one ever asks about this.\u201dSpurred by this research, and by its experience with shoring up projects in crisis, Open Road Alliance partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation and Arabella Advisors, a nonprofit consultancy, in convening a group of nonprofit executives to think through risk assessment.\u201cWe designed the tool kit very deliberately, so a foundation could take it in total or pick and choose tools \u00e0 la carte,\u201d said Maya Winkelstein, who served as chairwoman of the group, called the Commons. \u201cOur hope is people will print off the tool kit and bring it to their staff meetings or their board meetings or to their C.F.O. of programming.\u201dGiven the spike in philanthropic giving, the time is ripe to discuss the downsides of giving money away. A study released this week by the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy predicted that charitable giving would rise 3.6 percent this year and 3.8 percent next year, based on a strong economy.The biggest increase will come from foundations, which are often financed by wealthy individuals. Foundations will increase their giving by 5.9 percent and 6 percent in the next two years, the report predicted.But with that increase will come the need to apply business fundamentals to grant making and to look at all the potential downsides of a project. FOR the past five years, the Rockefeller Foundation has set aside contingency funding for individual initiatives and broader programs, said Judith Rodin, its president. Her foundation also assesses its grants by low, medium and high risk.\u201cOur tax-advantaged dollars create opportunities for us to take risk, but the evidence shows there isn\u2019t that much risk-taking in our sector,\u201d Dr. Rodin said. \u201cTaking smart risk is essential.\u201dThe risk management tool kit produced by the Commons covers broader areas like helping donors understand their own risk appetite with their grants, and putting together a risk policy statement similar to ones done for a portfolio of investments.But the kit also has seven items dealing with specific conversations donors ought to have with groups they are supporting. These include talking about contingency funding and planning, putting in place their own risk management strategies and monitoring the progress of the project in order to pre-empt problems.\u201cPart of the reason we focused on donors is they have the money,\u201d said Dr. Michaels, a clinical psychologist who is married to David Bonderman, a founder of the private equity firm TPG.\u201cThere\u2019s a power differential,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for a nonprofit to come to a funder and say, \u2018How are you going to insure us if something gets screwed up?\u2019\u201dLess than a year ago, Reclaim Detroit, which trains workers to salvage wood from homes slated for demolition and repurpose it, lost its warehouse to a blaze. With no wood, no equipment and no work space, it had also no plan for dealing with such a total loss and was in danger of folding.Reclaim Detroit partly supports itself through the sale of objects it makes from the reclaimed wood \u2014 something it could not do after the fire. But it also receives grants from companies like the JPMorgan Chase Foundation, the PNC Bank Foundation and others that are directed at its job training program and operational expenses.What it didn\u2019t have, though, was money to rebuild after the fire.Susan Dundon, business innovation director at EcoWorks, the nonprofit parent of Reclaim Detroit, said the group tried to raise money from the community, but then one of its program funders, REDF, directed it to Open Road Alliance, which gave $100,000 as bridge funding so the nonprofit could get running again.\u201cSome of it went for operating funds to continue to pay our crew, who was paid out of our earned revenues,\u201d Ms. Dundon said. \u201cThe main part was to rebuild our mill shop and to buy new equipment.\u201dNot everyone in the philanthropic community thinks such contingency funding is a good idea. Amir Pasic, dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, said nonprofits having to ask funders for money after a crisis can create an additional level of bureaucracy when funds are really needed.\u201cIt\u2019s getting us to continue to think about projects rather than organizations or causes,\u201d Dr. Pasic said. \u201cIt\u2019s allowing us to forget the fact that if you have a really good relationship with your funder and they know what\u2019s going on, it doesn\u2019t have to be a formal contingency plan.\u201dDr. Pasic, who was not involved with the Commons, said he saw a place for such backstop funding with smaller organizations. But in general, he said, he supported the group\u2019s conclusion that larger nonprofits and funders should plan for problems.\u201cYou need a joint conversation upfront,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to create an honest conversation between both sides so we can be productive.\u201dShelley Whelpton, managing director of Arabella Advisors, said that while the tool kit will start those conversations, it will take time to get donors to think differently. \u201cThere is culture change that needs to take place first,\u201d she said. The kit, she added, \u201cis a way to start a conversation.\u201dIN the case of SOIL, which has an annual budget of $1.3 million, Dr. Kramer said she went back to one of its longest-standing funders, the 11th Hour Project, which is backed by Wendy Schmidt, whose wealth comes from Google. Dr. Kramer said she was told the foundation had already made its grants for the year, and she was pointed toward Open Road Alliance, which issued a $100,000 grant for a new composting site.\u201cWith our other donors, I have much more of a traditional grantee relationship, where I wouldn\u2019t go back and say, \u2018I need more money for the same project,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t something I had considered before.\u201dDespite losing its dump, SOIL was lucky. Open Road Alliance gave $3 million last year, mostly in the form of small grants. But it operates by word of mouth and referral; it hopes that with the tool kit, more nonprofits will be able to talk to their donors about crises.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to get people on board saying, \u2018You\u2019re right, we could be backing up our grantees in a more comprehensive way, but where do we start?\u2019\u201d Dr. Michaels said. \u201cOne way to start is to lay out the path and say, \u2018These steps are not so difficult.\u2019 It\u2019s an attempt to make it easier for people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "1994 | A Road Map to the Information Superhighway", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byLooking BackBefore sophisticated search engines like Google existed, the World Wide Web wasn\u2019t much more useful than a library without a catalog. As you poked around, it was clear that knowledge lurked everywhere. But finding specifics took patience and luck. You\u2019d just grab books off the shelf in the hope that you\u2019d come across what you were looking for.When Navigator went live on an internal server on Nov. 2 (it would later be made public), the library suddenly grew a lot less formidable. In fact, it became inviting. We were given keys to all that knowledge. An inscrutable, unfathomable collection could be approached systematically, logically, topically and timely.After more than 22 years of service, the Navigator page was retired last Friday.\u201cO.K.,\u201d he later acknowledged. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018What hath God wrought?\u2019 or even \u2018Watson, come here, I need you!\u2019 \u201d (Mr. Thompson, who retired in 2001, died last week at home in Manhattan. He was 69.)After dinner, Mr. Meislin sat his guest down at his home PC and typed Mr. Lelyveld\u2019s name into a web browser.\u201cWhen he saw the list of things about him appear on the screen, he pretty much got it,\u201d Mr. Meislin said.For his part, Mr. Lelyveld said: \u201cI remember having dinner at Rich\u2019s house and him showing me stuff on the web. But I don\u2019t remember him typing my name or eating rabbit. Maybe he didn\u2019t tell me what was in the ragu. I\u2019ve knowingly eaten rabbit only once or twice in my life.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t presume to query Rich\u2019s version,\u201d Mr. Lelyveld added. \u201cHe was our guide and mainstay then.\u201dNavigator had three main purposes, Mr. Meislin said: \u201cTo gather the amazing sources of information that people were finding on the web in one place and organize them in a coherent way; to let people build on the exploration of others, rather than start every adventure from scratch; and to get people excited about the potential of this new world of digital information that was opening up to them.\u201dOurs was not the only Navigator in town. \u201cNavigator was the name that Netscape (which began as Mosaic) chose for their web browser,\u201d Mr. Meislin said. \u201cNo relationship between them functionally, except that you could use your Netscape Navigator browser to reach The New York Times Navigator page. We were using the name first.\u201dAnyone looking at Navigator today would be struck by its dense, spartan appearance. \u201cDesign was so limited by technology in the early days of the web,\u201d Mr. Meislin said. \u201cThe idea that massive amounts of information were a click away was the primary thrill at the beginning; the technology to permit attractive design came later. There were only a handful of fonts available on all browsers, different web browsers rendered HTML differently from each other, and there wasn\u2019t much flexibility in altering horizontal or vertical spacing to improve readability.\u201d\u201cAnd the Navigator page tried to be elegant in its simplicity,\u201d he added. No easy feat, since it served two readerships simultaneously. Times journalists could use Navigator to file a photo assignment, submit an expense account, book a trip, look up an archived news article, sign on to Nexis or find out what was for lunch in the cafeteria.On Navigator, links appeared under categories: \u201cSearching the Net? Here are Places to Start,\u201d principally search engines; \u201cCollections for Journalists,\u201d a lot of government sites; \u201cThe Reference Desk,\u201d from the venerable Encyclopaedia Britannica to the upstart Wikipedia \u2014 \u201cincreasingly popular (but not uniformly accurate)\u201d; \u201cTelephone and Email Directories\u201d; \u201cPublications on the Net\u201d; \u201cPolitics\u201d; \u201cThe New York Region\u201d; \u201cCommerce\u201d; \u201cTravel\u201d; \u201cEntertainment/Culture/Pastimes\u201d; \u201cSports and Recreation\u201d; and finally \u201cDemonstrations and Miscellany.\u201dThe beguiling last category almost guaranteed that visitors would be tempted to scroll all the way through the long Navigator page in order to find the Cool Site of the Day, the F.B.I.\u2019s Most Wanted, Sodaconstructor, Earthcam, the Dead People Server and Ghost Sites of the Web, described by Mr. Meislin as a guide to \u201csome of the rusting hulks along the information superhighway.\u201dAt the end, Navigator had become kind of a rusting hulk itself. Numerous links led to dead ends.\u201cI updated the public version regularly until February 2007, though for a general audience its usefulness declined as the power of Google grew,\u201d Mr. Meislin said. \u201cThe internal version remained relevant longer because many of the collections there are useful to a journalistic pursuit but might not be found in the first page of a typical Google search. And while younger reporters (and web editors, who found Navigator joke-worthy after a time) might have thought it quaint, it still had its followers, so I continued to update it now and again until late 2014.\u201d He retired two years later.Too bad there\u2019s no Navigator.Advertisement"}

Of course, there are exceptions, such as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter series and Lisa Simpson in \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d Most often, though, our cultural stereotypes promote the idea that being intellectually gifted is a male quality.In contrast, questions about physical appearance were relatively more common for girls: Parents Googled \u201cIs my daughter overweight?\u201d about 70 percent more often than \u201cIs my son overweight?\u201dDo little girls pick up on what their parents and teachers think about their smarts?In our most recent research, with the psychologist Lin Bian as lead author, we studied 400 children ages 5 to 7, recruited over the last several years from a middle-class community near the University of Illinois, where one of us was working at the time.For one study, each of 96 children (half boys, half girls) was told two stories about a person whose gender was not specified. They were told that one was about a \u201creally, really smart\u201d person, and the other was about a \u201creally, really nice\u201d person. Next, the children were shown four pictures (two males and two females) and were asked to guess which one might be the person in the story.At age 5, boys and girls were equally likely to associate intelligence with their own gender, but that changed quickly. At age 6, girls were significantly less likely to associate brilliance with their own gender. Many of them picked a male character to identify as the really smart person in the story, much as the boys did.These stereotyped responses were given by both white and nonwhite children, and did not seem to vary as a function of parental education and income.When we asked children to guess which of four children, two boys and two girls, would get the best grades in school, girls picked mostly other girls. In other words, the girls we tested were aware that girls do better in school than boys, but that didn\u2019t change their ideas about who\u2019s \u201csmart.\u201dOur research also suggests that these stereotypes may have lasting effects. Once internalized, they begin to guide girls\u2019 interests away from things that they perceive as \u201cnot for them.\u201dIn another part of the research, 64 children ages 6 and 7 (half boys, half girls) were shown two unfamiliar board games and told that they were either for children who are really smart or for children who try really hard. They were then asked four questions to measure their interest in the games.When told that a game was for really smart children, the girls showed less interest and motivation than boys. This didn\u2019t have anything to do with the game itself: When we described the exact same game as being for kids who try really hard, girls were just as interested in it as boys.The difference between 6-year-old boys and girls appears to be related to their emerging stereotypes: We found that 5-year-old boys and girls \u2014 whose beliefs about brilliance were not yet differentiated \u2014 were equally interested in the game for really smart children.Early and consistent exposure to such protective factors \u2013 and to the countless contributions made by women \u2013 may have the best chance of convincing little girls that they are, in fact, smart enough.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A City Built on Refugees Looks at Trump\u2019s Plan With Fear", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byLOWELL, Mass. \u2014 When Hawo Ahmed, her two sisters and their mother arrived here late Wednesday night, the Somali family could hardly believe their good fortune.\u201cIt\u2019s like a dream come true,\u201d said Ms. Ahmed, 24.Their arrival was all the more remarkable because they were among the last refugees allowed into the United States before President Trump closed the borders. He signed an executive order on Friday suspending the nation\u2019s resettlement program temporarily, with an eye toward shrinking it when it resumes. The action touched off widespread protests around the globe.Ms. Ahmed and her family had never heard of Lowell, an old mill city about 30 miles northwest of Boston with red-brick factories lining its canals, until they searched for it on Google from Kenya two weeks ago.But if Lowell is strange to them, having them here is not strange for Lowell.Immigrants, including many refugees, are part of the fabric of life in this city of 108,000, which boasts a kaleidoscope of cultures. Downtown is bursting with restaurants serving Portuguese, Mexican, Greek, Cambodian, Thai and Japanese fare. Lowell features a statue of Buddha, a plaque honoring Nelson Mandela and a big sign in the high school that welcomes visitors in multiple languages. Colorful flags of various nationalities hang in the windows of homes here, and ethnic festivals are common. Arabic is regularly heard in shops.For a city with such a heavy refugee presence, Mr. Trump\u2019s order is not an abstract political issue, but one that could alter families\u2019 lives and even the community itself \u2014 especially if, as people here fear, the temporary policy is made permanent.Farouq Ali, an Iraqi refugee who arrived in Lowell in 2009 and works with new refugees, said he and other Iraqis in the area had been exchanging near-constant Facebook messages about Mr. Trump\u2019s impending policy. Over the weekend, he said, dozens of Iraqi and Syrian women gathered at a restaurant to share their fears.\u201cMost Iraqis have some of their families back in Iraq, so they are struggling to bring them to Lowell, to America,\u201d Mr. Ali said. Mr. Trump\u2019s policy, he said, could shatter their hopes.Lowell and its many nonprofit organizations devoted to refugees and immigrant groups are haltingly coming to terms with the idea that, at least for now, the flow of refugees here could stop or slow, a startling turnaround for a city built by immigrant labor.People from French Canada, Ireland, Portugal and Poland powered Lowell\u2019s once-mighty textile mills starting in the 1800s, and immigrants and refugees have found homes here ever since. It is a place where the history of immigration in America is writ large. Many of the mills closed before World War II, and the city\u2019s population declined, but it picked up again in the late 1970s as a wave of Cambodians fleeing the Khmer Rouge came to the city. Today, Cambodians make up about 13 percent of the population, and Lowell has the second-largest Cambodian community in the country, after Long Beach, Calif. A Cambodian represents part of Lowell in the state legislature.\u201cLowell has been replenished and re-energized by refugees and immigrants for generations,\u201d said Jeffrey Thielman, the president and chief executive of the International Institute of New England, which works with the federal government to resettle refugees in Lowell, Boston and Manchester, N.H.\u201cWe won\u2019t feel it right away,\u201d Mr. Thielman said of a halt in refugees, \u201cbut businesses will not have enough workers, and not having enough workers will inhibit Lowell\u2019s ability to grow.\u201dThe region\u2019s economy and its immigrants are closely intertwined. Southwick, a factory in nearby Haverhill that makes suits for Brooks Brothers, offers four English classes per week for about 70 refugees and other immigrants who work there. Thithi Aye, a Burmese refugee who arrived here in 2010, car-pooled from Lowell to her job at Southwick every day with other refugees, including one from Iraq. Eventually, she was able to buy her own car, and then a condo.Employers see hiring refugees as a win for everyone, as supply meets demand.\u201cThey use us as a steppingstone for the betterment of their families,\u201d said John Martynec, Southwick\u2019s senior vice president for manufacturing.Because there are so many nonprofit organizations, volunteers and government services here to support refugees, a decline in the number of refugees could lead to a withering of those support services.\u201cIf everything\u2019s closed off for a period of time, the problem would then be figuring out how to rebuild the infrastructure to welcome people in,\u201d said Robert Forrant, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, whose classes include third-generation Cambodians.The possibility of closing the borders has unsettled some residents who are not part of the refugee community. Samantha Cail, 49, the owner of HyperText Bookstore and Caf\u00e9, said she found it \u201chorrifying.\u201d\u201cThis administration\u2019s ability to demonize the \u2018other\u2019 is very frightening to me,\u201d said Ms. Cail, who voted for Hillary Clinton.The vast variety of cultures and ethnicities was one reason she was attracted to Lowell, where she has lived for 11 years.\u201cThere\u2019s always Cambodian operas or amazing, yearlong festivals that really add color and depth to the community,\u201d she said.Ms. Cail said she was not worried that terrorists would slip through, in part because the vetting process, which takes at least two years, seemed so rigorous.But Cheryl Carville, 54, a longtime Lowell resident who works in retail and voted for Mr. Trump, was more concerned. She said that her philosophy was \u201clive and let live,\u201d but that she could not think of a reason the borders should not be closed for 120 days. \u201cYou got to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said, adding that she wondered how many refugees the city could really absorb. \u201cYou got to know who\u2019s coming in here.\u201d\u201cAt some point,\u201d she asked, \u201chow much can you take in, and how much before it starts hurting everybody else?\u201dDavid Donovan, 25, an electrician and longtime Lowell resident, agreed that it was \u201creasonable\u201d to suspend the resettlement program, even though he had voted for Mrs. Clinton.Cambodians in particular, he said, had done much to enrich Lowell. But, he added, \u201cgiven that we\u2019re in a state of war, it\u2019s O.K. to freeze the border.\u201dIn the meantime, the city is continuing to absorb refugees like the newly arrived Ahmed family. On Thursday, the International Institute of New England helped organize a job fair here at which 18 other refugees met employers who were looking for workers in the health care field.Lisa Gurgone, executive director of the Home Care Aide Council, told the refugees that the aging of New England virtually guaranteed them jobs in health care. \u201cWe need all of you,\u201d she said.Among the refugees who attended the job fair was Zainab Abdo, 21, who came in May from Syria, where her home in Aleppo had been bombed. She said she was relieved to be here, had been treated well and was taking nursing classes at Middlesex Community College.\u201cThere is security here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel safe.\u201dAnd yet, with Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order in the works, she remains nervous about the future, especially for relatives still in Syria and Turkey, who she had hoped would be able to join her family here.Luis Pedroso, an immigrant from the Azores who helped found an electronics factory, said that he had employees who were refugees and that he viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s order as an overreaction.\u201cLowell has been known as a location for so many different, diverse parts of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Mr. Trump sees that he needs to be doing this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We will address a few of those complaints first, before turning to this week\u2019s topics.The headline is completely inappropriate for the advice question to which it refers. The child seems to harass his guest based solely on his misguided stereotype of a certain heritage. This is plain bigoted, not \u201cpopulist\u201d as the headline suggests. Populism is a broad term that is used to refer to vastly disparate political beliefs and styles, including those of Bernie Sanders and President Obama as well as President-elect Trump. It is synonymous neither with antipathy towards particular ethnicities, nor specific immigration policies. To call the child\u2019s taunt \u201cpopulism\u201d at once minimizes the seriousness of his actions and strains the definition of populism beyond recognition.Sarah Bayer, Boston, Mass.The author of the column, Philip Galanes, took the time to reply to a reader who wrote to him directly.Thank you for your note. I am the author of the column \u2014 but not the headline. And I agree with you. We should have found a better hed, particularly since the answer called on all of us to be extra-vigilant to racism and misogyny in these times. It also asked us to moderate the pitch of our speech, especially in complaint, to communicate better. I thank you for doing both.Shortly before the new year, an ad ran on a Times story that left some readers befuddled.My NY Times digital copy keeps displaying a pop-up that advertises a fabulous Obama tax rebate (supposedly he signed a bill Dec. 18). It would return millions of dollars to anyone who paid sales taxes in 2015. I called my accountant, who said it was a hoax. The pop-up has returned day after day as part of your news for the last two weeks. Could you please tell me if this has been approved by the NY Times? Is my accountant wrong?Rita ClearyThe ad was indeed a hoax, and readers who realized this have asked The Times to address the issue.The below ad is now part of the norm at The Times, alas. I don\u2019t frankly understand the mechanism by which such ads appear but assume, perhaps erroneously, that sites exercise some control in that regard.John Seager, Washington D.C.They\u2019re nearly impossible to catch in advance as they come through advertising technology platforms such as Facebook and Google at random. When fake news ads are reported we block the advertiser, and we\u2019ve also been lifting price floors, which has made an impact since implementation.The byline caught my attention for a couple reasons. I spent a year as a freelancer in Istanbul and understand the myriad challenges and dangers Turkish reporters (and foreign journos in Turkey) face. It seems every week brings fresh reports of journalists detained by the dozens for their work. While it saddens me that reporters in Turkey may elect to shield their identities in the same way those working in active war zones do, I see that in the current climate it could be necessary.Elizabeth Hewitt, Montpelier, Vt.The same story caught readers\u2019 attentions for other reasons, too. Initially, the story reported that the single gunman may have been as many as three gunmen, and they were wearing Santa Claus suits, an image which stayed with readers. The Times, however, never appended a correction to the story nor added a note explaining the change.As of my writing, the Times\u2019s current version of its online article makes no reference to Santa-disguised terrorists, only to a single (apparently normally-dressed) assailant. And there is no correction about \u201cearlier reports of multiple terrorists dressed in Santa costumes were in error.\u201d Especially in a case like this, the Times should go beyond just correcting its reporting to acknowledge that it had hastily printed an inaccurate rumor (and perhaps identify the rumor\u2019s original source).Richard D. Smith, Rocky Hill, N.J.We asked Slackman about this. Here\u2019s his response:It was a fast-breaking story and The Times, and many other sites, used information we thought was credible. Would it have been advisable to adjust the language so that it was clear we were now skeptical of the earlier reports? Probably so. But these were challenging circumstances.Another reader raised an issue that will hopefully be addressed in the new year.Erik Nordlof, Arlington, Va.We asked Alexandra MacCallum, who oversees Times video, for an answer. She told us that while some videos have text overlay, which editors add manually, an automated closed caption system is in the works this year.Different leadership ran the video department in March of 2015; I was unaware of that statement. When I took over in January of 2016, no work had started on the project, which is a large technical heave as well as a change to our newsroom workflow.Closed captions and transcriptions are a priority for the beginning of this year (2017). We spent much of last year fixing some technical infrastructure, and we\u2019re looking have a solution in the coming months. We understand that it\u2019s problematic for our readers and recognize the importance to make sure our readers have a seamless watching experience when they are on our site.As trust in the media falters, a reader has taken a stand, one friend at a time. He wrote us to ask for our aid in his mission.Where might I find the New York Times\u2019s statements on journalistic integrity, quality of journalism, and news standards? I am preparing for a debate with a friend who has called The Times biased.David E. Johnson, San Antonio, Tx.Good luck, and see you next week.An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of the video editor. It is MacCallum, not MacCullum.Advertisement"}

The proposal was put forward by Councilman Mitch O\u2019Farrell, who said he was simply trying to add public playgrounds to the list of places \u2014 such as schoolyards \u2014 that, under state law, are already off limits to adults who are not there with children.\u201cAs city leaders, we owe this to our youngest Angelenos to create safe spaces for them,\u201d he said in a letter to constituents. \u201cOur park facilities should be a safe haven, and we must do our part to provide the proper shelter for our kids.\u201dThe letter was sent out as Mr. O\u2019Farrell faces questions about whether his proposal was an overreach, impeding the activities of law-abiding adults who don\u2019t have children and who might want to enjoy the pleasure of sitting in a playground.\u201cIf you are worried that somebody is going to molest children, there are laws to prevent that,\u201d said Peter Eliasberg, the chief counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. \u201cYou can\u2019t just assume that because you\u2019re an adult you don\u2019t enjoy the sound of kids or watching kids in a playground.\u201dMr. O\u2019Farrell asked the city\u2019s department of law to draft an ordinance based on his proposal.

And yet, strangely, it was where readers who clicked on the main headline were directed.The best of the features? The Hearing Highlights box mixing news and analysis. Not surprisingly it drew an audience triple the size of the live chat and five times what the story had garnered by late afternoon.So why not just eliminate the running news story altogether? With the other two digital features in place (and mobile friendly) the story feels like a relic of a previous era. Don\u2019t kill the story altogether, but don\u2019t do it while the hearing is going on. Save it for something reporters turn to in late afternoon and make it a purely analytical, high-value piece aimed at print and next-day digital readers.Step two, amp up the hearing highlights. That\u2019s the money play, only it is mostly text now, with a few plug-in photos. Cut the video of the hearing to focus on the most newsy segments, incorporate fact-checking and pepper in more original reporting. (Achieve this through the time gained by not having reporters tending a running story.)Finally, the live chat. Not my favorite feature as executed but I like the idea of it. It seems to me this is another feature that could benefit from cutting the live story. For my taste, I\u2019d like fewer glib remarks from reporters and more of the rare expertise they bring. While they\u2019re at it, could they use The Times\u2019s clout to grab a couple senators or top staffers to help us understand the politics behind the scene? Ask them a question or two for the chat: Why did the Democrats go so easy on Sessions, for example? Any good information they glean from the chat can get rolled over into the Live Highlights. (The next day, when Rex Tillerson, Exxon\u2019s chief executive, was up at bat and the hearings were diminishing in news value, both the day story and the chat disappeared.)\u201cBasically we\u2019re experimenting,\u201d said Washington bureau chief Elisabeth Bumiller. \u201cThe live chats are really popular, as is the live briefing. We\u2019ll do much the same for the inauguration, but given the historic nature of the event, we\u2019ll probably also have a traditional one-stop story online that will evolve into the lede of the paper the next day.\u201dExperimentation defines the era, and the reporters and editors involved in the Sessions coverage that day were doing just that. The result was classic New York Times: high quality, smart, complete. Only maybe a bit too complete. That\u2019s for the 2020 Group to decide.But it\u2019s worth remembering that, sometimes, less is more and so is letting go.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Sweden, Happiness in a Shorter Workday Can\u2019t Overcome the Cost", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byThere\u2019s just one catch. The practice is too expensive and unwieldy to become widespread in Sweden anytime soon.The two-year trial, which took place in the southern city of Gothenburg, centered on a municipal retirement home where workers were switched to a six-hour day, from eight hours, with no pay cut. Seventeen new nursing positions were created to make up for the loss of time, at a cost of around 700,000 euros, or $738,000, a year.Although it was small, the experiment stoked a widespread discussion about the future of work, namely whether investing in a better work-life balance for employees, and treating workers well rather than squeezing them, benefits the bottom line for companies and economies.\u201cThe trial showed that there are many benefits of a shorter working day,\u201d said Daniel Bernmar, the leader of the Left party on Gothenburg\u2019s City Council, which had pushed for the experiment. \u201cThey include healthier staff, a better work environment and lower unemployment.\u201dBut the high price tag, and political skepticism about the practicality of a shorter workday, was likely to discourage widespread support for taking the concept nationwide.\u201cThe government is avoiding talking about the issue,\u201d Mr. Bernmar said. \u201cThey\u2019re not interested in looking at the bigger picture.\u201dWhile a growing number of countries and companies are studying the concept of employee happiness, the idea of improving it through shorter work hours has by no means gained broad traction. In Gothenburg, the City Council\u2019s conservative opposition parties derided the experiment as a utopian folly and sought to kill it, citing high costs for taxpayers and arguments that the government should not intrude in the workplace. The current government is also not backing a shorter workweek.Even the handful of progressive political groups aligned with Mr. Bernmar\u2019s Left party have not made a six-hour workday in Sweden a priority in their platforms. Nor have large Swedish companies, including multinationals active around the world, embraced the idea. Other Swedish towns that previously conducted limited experiments with a shorter public-sector workweek eventually abandoned the concept, citing high costs and flawed implementation.A similar model in France has been controversial for more than 15 years, ever since a Socialist government made a 35-hour workweek mandatory.Still, some large companies are beginning to explore the argument that happy workers may make better, more productive employees.In the experiment at the Gothenburg retirement home, employees reported working with greater efficiency and energy when their hours were cut to six from eight a day. They called in sick 15 percent less than before and perceived their health to have improved at least 20 percent, according to a preliminary review issued last year.At a nearby municipal retirement home, where a control trial left working conditions unchanged, employees reported increased blood pressure and said they perceived no improvement in their health, peace of mind or alertness, the review showed. A final report is scheduled to be released in March.The program increased Gothenburg\u2019s costs by 22 percent, mostly to pay for new employees. But around 10 percent was offset by reduced costs to the state from people being taken off the unemployment rolls and paying taxes into the system, rather than receiving state subsidies, Mr. Bernmar said.Modest experiments are moving ahead in a handful of small towns in Sweden, mostly in the public health care sector, to see if the results from Gothenburg can be duplicated. This year, four additional Swedish municipalities are expected to start research programs.A small but growing number of private Swedish companies, mainly technology start-ups, are also dabbling with the concept, following the lead of some established companies, including a Toyota service center in Gothenburg that has successfully operated on a six-hour day for more than a decade.The question, Mr. Bernmar added, was \u201cshould we work to live, not live to work?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Fight Trump Immigration Order in Court", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byOn Monday, two tech companies \u2014 Amazon and Expedia \u2014 stepped up their opposition to the order with filings that were part of a lawsuit in federal court against the Trump administration, arguing that the order will hurt their businesses.Expedia argued that the executive order hurt its ability to recruit employees from overseas, and it also could undermine the core of the company\u2019s business as an internet travel company.As of Sunday, at least a thousand Expedia customers with passports from one of the seven countries, which includes Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, have made travel plans that involve flights to, from or through the United States.Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia\u2019s chief executive, was born in Iran and fled the country with his parents in 1978 shortly before Iran became an Islamic republic during the revolution. \u201cThe president\u2019s order represents the worst of his proclivity toward rash action versus thoughtfulness,\u201d Mr. Khosrowshahi said in a statement. \u201cOurs is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen.\u201dSeven job candidates, all of them originally from Iran but citizens of other countries, have received employment offers from Amazon. The company is considering jobs for the candidates in other countries.In an email to Amazon employees, the chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said the company had expressed its opposition to the order to senior administration officials and congressional leaders. He said the company was exploring \u201cother legal options as well.\u201d\u201cFor tech leaders, it\u2019s a work force issue,\u201d said Michael Schutzler, the chief executive of the Washington Technology Industry Association, a trade group representing the state\u2019s technology companies. \u201cWe have a huge shortage of talent. We create jobs 10 times faster than the state can produce talent. Reducing our ability to recruit talent to the state essentially concedes the field to our international competitors.\u201dAt Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., hundreds of employees crowded into a quad near the main cafeteria to protest the order. Employees carried signs like \u201cTrump, Don\u2019t Be Evil\u201d and \u201cSilicon Valley: Built by Immigrants,\u201d while others chanted \u201cNo Ban, No Wall\u201d into a megaphone.It was a scene more fitting for a college campus than a gathering of employees at one of America\u2019s most valuable companies. Google offices in other cities like Seattle, San Francisco and New York held similar rallies. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, told employees at the rally that immigration was \u201ccore to the founding of this company.\u201dWhen the Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who attended the protests at the San Francisco airport on Saturday, was introduced, the crowd broke into chants of \u201cSergey, Sergey, Sergey.\u201d Mr. Brin noted that he came to the United States as a 6-year-old refugee from the Soviet Union when nuclear tensions between the two countries were at their peak.The reaction from major American companies to President Trump\u2019s order has ranged from silence to outrage.\u201cEven then, the U.S. had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees,\u201d he said.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today or have any kind of life I have today if this wasn\u2019t a great country that stood up and spoke for liberty,\u201d Mr. Brin added.Soufi Esmaeilzadeh, a Google product manager who is an Iranian national with Canadian citizenship who resides in the United States with a green card, said that Google\u2019s immigration team initially recommended that she not return home from a business trip in Switzerland after the order was signed on Friday.\u201cMy life is in the U.S. I felt angry, scared, and honestly rejected,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel free or at peace.\u201dBut after the stay won by the American Civil Liberties Union, Google told her that she might have a small window to return but needed to leave immediately. Flying through Dublin, she said four immigration officers pored over her paperwork. She eventually arrived in San Francisco on Sunday.An earlier version of this article misstated the day on which Amazon and Expedia stepped up their opposition to President Trump\u2019s immigration order. It was Monday, not Tuesday.An article on Tuesday about a legal fight of many technology firms against President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration referred imprecisely to the Iranian revolution, which led Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia\u2019s chief executive, to flee the country with his parents. Although Mr. Khosrowshahi left Iran in 1978, when there was unrest against the shah, the revolution was not over at that point.

{"Headline": "Growing a Different Apple", "Date": null, "News": "Supported byAt Apple, Brian Latimer was in charge of protecting some of the company\u2019s deepest secrets.Under Apple\u2019s \u201cneed to know\u201d philosophy, he did not even have access to much of the information he helped to secure. And like all Apple employees, he was discouraged from talking about his job with co-workers.His current employer, Pearl Automation, could not be more different.Founded in 2014 by three former senior managers from Apple\u2019s iPod and iPhone groups, Pearl has tried to replicate what its leaders view as the best parts of Apple\u2019s culture, like its fanatical dedication to quality and beautiful design. But the founders also consciously rejected some of the less appealing aspects of life at Apple, like its legendary secrecy and top-down management style.The start-up, which makes high-tech accessories for cars, holds weekly meetings with its entire staff. Managers brief them on coming products, company finances, technical problems, even the presentations made to the board.\u201cIt\u2019s very liberating to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Mr. Latimer, who left Apple in May to join Pearl. \u201cEveryone is contributing here, so everyone has a need to know.\u201dBest of all, Mr. Latimer is working with many of his old Apple colleagues.Pearl, which is led by Bryson Gardner, has recruited heavily from Apple. More than 50 of Pearl\u2019s 80 or so employees worked for the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant at some point.Although Apple pays very well, many of the Apple recruits had gotten bored cranking out incremental improvements to the iPhone and the Mac, said Brian Sander, Pearl\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer. \u201cThey were vibrating. It was time for them to do something different,\u201d he said.Pearl\u2019s pitch was appealing: Make the roads safer by giving tens of millions of older autos the same high-tech safety features that the newest models have.Mr. Gardner declined to disclose specific sales figures but said Pearl had released the product too late to make it into physical retailers before the holidays. The company plans to expand distribution early next year.Like Apple, though, Pearl is playing the long game. Engineers are already testing self-parking technology and other driver-assistance features for future products. So far, the company has raised $50 million from prominent venture capital firms, including Accel, Shasta Ventures and Venrock, but Mr. Gardner said it would need to raise more money in 2017.Pearl\u2019s headquarters \u2014 in an office complex between vast redwood groves and Santa Cruz\u2019s beaches \u2014 are a world away from Apple\u2019s campus in the busy technopolis of Silicon Valley.The larger company\u2019s influence, however, is clear.Apple, which has about 110,000 employees, breaks big projects down into smaller tasks. Those are assigned to small teams, and each subtask is given to a specific employee, who must get it done \u2014 what Apple calls the \u201cdirectly responsible individual.\u201dPearl has copied this system. \u201cIn leading small teams, that\u2019s very effective,\u201d Mr. Gardner said.Pearl has also imported Apple\u2019s disciplined approach to engineering. Deadlines are regularly set, and flaws are relentlessly investigated. \u201cWhy did this fail?\u201d Mr. Gardner said. \u201cYou really understand the full bounds of the problem.\u201dAnother Apple hallmark \u2014 elegant design \u2014 is also a core value. \u201cWe\u2019re building something that has an Apple-quality fit and finish,\u201d Mr. Sander said.Unlike competing models, the RearVision has two high-definition cameras to provide a better view, and one is tuned for night vision. The cameras peek out of a license-plate frame and are powered by a hidden solar panel. They transmit data wirelessly to an adapter that plugs into the car\u2019s diagnostic port near the steering wheel. The images are displayed on an app on the driver\u2019s smartphone. The setup allows the company to frequently update the software to fix bugs and add new features.Like Apple, Pearl dealt with dozens of suppliers, mostly in Asia, to obtain the 400 unique components in RearVision.\u201cWe were used to doing this with the iPhone and iPad,\u201d said Joseph Fisher, Pearl\u2019s co-founder and head of engineering. Indeed, the Pearl team tapped many of the same suppliers they worked with at Apple.But Pearl\u2019s leaders also consciously rejected Apple\u2019s view that only the top executives should have a view of the whole company.Apple\u2019s longtime chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, exercised control over the smallest details about products. When he stepped down in 2011, his power was distributed among more of the company\u2019s executives, but decisions remained highly centralized.Apple, for all of its success creating phones and computers, has spawned very few start-ups like Pearl in recent years, especially compared to peers like Google and Facebook.Eswar Priyadarshan, who sold his mobile advertising company, Quattro Wireless, to Apple in 2010 and stayed for four years, said that he learned about design and aesthetics during his time there. But he noted that Apple\u2019s high compensation, focused product mission and top-down decision-making tended to damp the risk-taking necessary to start a company.Mr. Priyadarshan, who is now chief executive of BotCentral, a six-person start-up, compared Apple to a community of warrior monks. \u201cWarrior monks don\u2019t talk and do whatever is asked,\u201d he said.Nest Labs, the most successful company to have been founded by Apple veterans in the last few years, was born in part because its founders, Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, were told that Apple had no interest in their smart thermostat.\u201cIt was a great place to work: superhigh growth, great product, lots of innovation,\u201d said Mr. Rogers, who remained at Nest after its sale to Alphabet for $3.2 billion in 2014. \u201cBut Apple is very much, \u2018How do we ship our next iPhone for Christmas?\u2019\u201dBut Mr. Rogers, who worked with some of Pearl\u2019s founders at Apple and serves on its board, said that the start-up absorbed many of the positive lessons of Nest: Recruit top Apple people, control your hardware and software, establish a culture of openness and empowerment, and constantly upgrade the product.Apple, for its part, appears to hold no hard feelings toward Pearl, despite the start-up\u2019s steady recruitment of its employees.\u201cPearl Auto is a great example of the creativity and innovation driving the iPhone ecosystem,\u201d said Josh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman. \u201cWe wish them great success with their new product.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vacation in Paradise. Whose Bad Idea Was That?", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byI Was MisinformedI\u2019m going on a snorkeling trip in Fiji this month, so if a tsunami hits, you can wave in the direction of the Pacific and say, \u201cThere goes Joyce.\u201dI\u2019m not a great swimmer; what if I get swept away? They have sharks in those waters. Google says January is typhoon season and rainy season and mosquito season and mosquitoes carry dengue fever, the pain of which has been likened to sitting through the new Scorsese movie. The next morning, I am on the phone with my travel outfit, the Extremely Earnest Travel Company, which is so serious about educating travelers that it has a mission statement. It does not include \u201cGetting lucky.\u201dA staff member tells me all of the guides are certified divers and they never go out in bad weather and that if someone needs specialized medical care, say because a shark bit off your foot (my example), they could airlift you to New Zealand. Later, checking travel time between New Zealand and the remote village where we will be staying, I find it\u2019s a nine-hour trip. But as I try to remind myself, would Indiana Jones worry?Indy is my travel ideal: Not only does he travel light, packing everything into one small leather carry-on that doesn\u2019t even have wheels, he also has absolutely no fear of flying. Nor does he spend hours in front of his closet obsessing.\u201cWhich is better? A cotton sweater or two Coolibar T-shirts, which offer a UPF of 50+ as well as zinc oxide protection? The sweater would be warmer on the flight but the shirts will be practical when the Nazis throw me into an Egyptian snake pit. You could keel over from the heat in the those pits.\u201dExcuse me, I have an I.M. from a reader.\u201cJoyce, you spineless wimp, if you are so nervous about out-of-town medical care why are you schlepping all the way to Fiji?\u201dLast year, as Herb was just starting to swim, we went snorkeling in Vieques. We saw exactly three fish, and I am pretty sure the yellow one felt so sorry for us that he came around twice.Fiji, however, is supposed to have one of the last healthy coral reefs in the world, which means it has everything you could want in sea life: fish, turtles, whitefish, nova. I also liked the idea of a snorkeling trip because it\u2019s so uncomplicated. The only special clothing you need is a T-shirt.The Extremely Earnest Travel Company, however, takes coral health very seriously. If only one seat was left in the lifeboat and it was between me and a ruddy hunk of coral they would toss me a life vest and say, \u201cPago Pago, 782 miles northeast, you can\u2019t miss it.\u201dTo prevent damage to the coral, Extremely Earnest recommends eco-friendly sunscreens or a rash guard, which is swimwear that protects your body from the sun as well as scrapes. The company also suggests bringing your own snorkel, mask and fins. And perhaps a wet suit. But do pack light, because if your luggage is over 15 pounds, the island-hopping balsa-wood and rubber-band planes, which are best not to think about before you have to, will charge extra.I\u2019m not a last-minute packer. I start shopping six months before the trip. I buy two short-sleeved rash-guard bathing suits, two long-sleeved rash-guard shirts, a mask and a snorkel. I decide against a wet suit, which I figure will take up space that could be used for three pairs of shorts, four cute tops and my lifesaving dengue-fever repellent, cleverly marketed as mosquito spray.During this time I also swim a few times a week so I can be a strong enough swimmer to make it back to shore should an underground volcano trigger a 30-foot wave that scuttles our excursion boat.\u201cBut what kind of protection do you have for your legs?\u201d a salesman in a dive shop says. \u201cEver get stung by a jellyfish? If you had, you\u2019d remember it.\u201dI buy a full-piece dive skin, sort of a cat suit, from ankles to wrists.\u201cWhat about a wet suit?\u201d a clerk in another shops asks. \u201cThe water might be 85 degrees, but your body temperature is 98. You\u2019re in the water two, three hours, you\u2019re going to start getting cold. And women chill faster than men.\u201dI buy a wet suit to go over the dive skin to go over my short-sleeved bathing suit.I now have so much stuff I have to order a new suitcase. And the more I think about this trip, the more I need.My contact lenses have been bothering me, and I don\u2019t want to be unable to see the fish hanging out in one of the last living coral reefs. So in addition to my regular snorkel mask, I get a prescription snorkel mask.I also get Herb and me some hot-pink bathing caps.\u201cNo way I am wearing that,\u201d Herb says.\u201cYou might think that now,\u201d I tell him, \u201cbut when the rescue helicopters come looking for us and you\u2019re being carried away by the tsunami, you\u2019ll think differently.\u201dThis is going to be such a carefree vacation.I Was Misinformed a humor column about survival in New York City.

But the most capable virtual reality headsets are expensive and require powerful personal computers to support them. Breakout applications, including video games, have not materialized because developers have been reluctant to pour resources into an uncertain market.While Facebook does not provide sales figures for the $599 Oculus Rift headset, which was released to the public last year, analysts believe they are slow. One research firm, SuperData Research, estimated the company sold only about 355,000 by the end of last year.Oculus has been problematic for Facebook in other ways. Last month, a founder of Oculus, Brendan Iribe, stepped down as chief executive, moving to lead an Oculus group focused on virtual reality on personal computers. Facebook is also facing a lawsuit from ZeniMax Media, which has accused Oculus of stealing technology that went into the creation of the Oculus goggles. The social network could face as much as $2 billion in damages if it loses the suit.This month, Mr. Zuckerberg said at the trial for the lawsuit in a federal courthouse in Texas, \u201cI don\u2019t think that good virtual reality is fully there yet.\u201dMr. Barra is well known in Silicon Valley.

They had been cleared to resettle in Nashville \u2014 a new life that Mr. Shareef considered a great opportunity. After the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Mr. Shareef worked as a translator with American officials, and he received death threats. But after the Shareefs arrived in Cairo on Saturday, a check-in official spoke to Mr. Shareef.\u201cHe said they had just received an email from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad,\u201d Mr. Shareef said. \u201cIt said we could not get on the flight.\u201dSpeaking by phone from an airport lounge, Mr. Shareef said he had sold the family home and car. His wife had given up her job. His two daughters, 10 and 17, had quit school. He had spent $5,000 on flights.\u201cI thought in America there are institutions, democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis looks like a decision from a dictator. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cDonald Trump ruined my life,\u201d he said.Ms. Omer, 39, is a green card holder, has lived in the United States since 1993, and graduated from Harvard University. On Friday night Ms. Omer was detained at Kennedy International Airport as she returned from Sudan, where she is a citizen, after a research trip for her anthropology Ph.D. at Stanford University.Ms. Omer said customs officials were apologetic and appeared confused about what they were supposed to do with the detained travelers. \u201cI have to do this,\u201d one told her. For five hours they asked about her travels, her academic research and her views on Sudanese politics, which they admitted to knowing little about.At one point, she said, they aggressively patted her down and handcuffed her. They removed the restraints when she began to cry, but the detainees brought in for questioning after her arrived in handcuffs, she said.\u201cFor the brief moment I was handcuffed, I couldn\u2019t control myself and I just started crying,\u201d Ms. Omer said. \u201cIt was humiliating. I thought I was going to be returned to Sudan.\u201dAfter Ms. Omer was released she said she felt like one of the lucky ones.\u201cThere are a lot of people being treated much worse or are being sent back,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they get sent back to Iraq or Syria it is a life-or-death situation.\u201dMr. Abdi, 30, a Ph.D. student in anthropology at Yale with permanent residency in the United States, said he left the United States on Jan. 22 for Afghanistan, where he planned to do field research for much of the next year. He had participated in the women\u2019s march in Washington the day before. Now, he said he was in legal limbo as he awaited a visa from the consulate of Afghanistan, unable to return to the United States even with a green card and fearful of returning to Iran because of his activism about human rights issues there.Speaking by phone from Dubai, Mr. Abdi said his current visa limits his stay in the United Arab Emirates to about a month. The possibility that green card holders and refugees could be barred from the United States did not occur to him when he left, he said.\u201cWe didn\u2019t believe it really, that it was going to be implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we were taking the Trump administration less seriously than it is.\u201dShe was turned away, however, when she arrived at the gate for her flight in Dubai, wrote Kirk W. Johnson, the founder and executive director of the List Project to Resettle Iraqi Allies. \u201cThe flight crew sent her back,\u201d Khalas texted Mr. Johnson, \u201csaying they got orders that no Iraqis with American visas should be boarded.\u201dMs. Assali, 25, a third-year medical student from Allentown, Pa., said six of her Syrian relatives had arrived in Philadelphia on a flight from Doha, Qatar, on Saturday morning, only to be detained and put on a flight back less than three hours later. The group had obtained family-based immigrant visas.Ms. Assali said in a telephone interview that her six relatives \u2014 two uncles, two aunts and two teenage cousins, whom she did not name out of fear of endangering them or their case \u2014 are Christians who live in Damascus.

The titans of Silicon Valley like to claim that they\u2019re inventing technology to change the world, and their philanthropic efforts often mirror those big global goals and dreams, with initiatives to end hunger and fight diseases.But the arts in San Francisco haven\u2019t always felt their generosity. Even as total philanthropic spending in the Bay Area has more than doubled over the past decade to around $5 billion, according to the Foundation Center, it\u2019s been difficult for some arts groups to find support with so many organizations competing for attention and funding.Last year, for example, with social inequality such a high-profile issue, one heavyweight charitable organization, the James Irvine Foundation, chose to stop spending on the arts and switch all of its future giving toward addressing poverty.The move has important repercussions: In 2015 the Irvine Foundation gave $15.45 million to the arts, more than a fifth of the foundation\u2019s total grants.So on Tuesday culture fans were given a reason to cheer when the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation announced a plan to spend $8 million on performing arts projects in the Bay Area over the next five years.A panel of experts convened by the foundation will help select 50 works from artists in the Bay Area. The performances will include dance, theater, music and performance art.\u201cThere\u2019s much more of a demand for arts than we can hope to fulfill,\u201d said Larry Kramer, the president of the foundation, which gets its funding from the fortune made from one of the founders of Hewlett-Packard, the pioneering computer company.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to raise money for the arts,\u201d said Ben Mangan, the executive director of the Center for Social Sector Leadership at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. \u201cThe arts don\u2019t fall neatly into a category of a problem to solve.\u201dGiving money away is fraught with difficult choices, Mr. Kramer said.\u201cThe thing about philanthropy is that there are a million problems that are worth addressing and you can\u2019t address all of them,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Hundreds of outdoor walls across Sacramento serve as canvasses for colorful murals.To find them, people have had to rely largely on word of mouth or serendipity.The project is the brainchild of Nathaniel Miller, an interactivity editor at The Sacramento Bee.In an interview, Mr. Miller said he used his free time outside of work to research the murals over much of 2016. He portrayed himself as an art novice who was simply in the mood for a project that he thought would be of use.The murals range from the handiwork of elementary school children to interpretations by established artists.All told, Mr. Miller cataloged 420 murals, but he expects that number to grow.Sacramento officials have been embracing public art as a way to enliven the city.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

The City Council and Sacramento County supervisors are scheduled to meet in a joint session this month to discuss the proposal.Some critics are skeptical, questioning how the costs will be met.\u201cThat\u2019s the essential first step,\u201d said Mark Merin, a civil rights lawyer who has advocated for the homeless in Sacramento. \u201cWithout that there\u2019s no foundation on which to build a program.\u201dWe caught up with Mr. Steinberg by phone. These are edited excerpts from the conversation:\u2022 Do you think Sacramento could solve the problem of homelessness?Well I think we need to aim very high. But I also have no illusions. And we talk about a concept called \u2018functional zero,\u2019 which means that we ought to have more permanent housing and supportive services than the number of homeless people. And then the goal is to match them up. But no, I\u2019m not talking about trying to absolutely fix it. I think that\u2019s the aspiration. But I think it\u2019s our obligation and our opportunity to make it much better.\u2022 How does your approach differ from what\u2019s been tried before?We have a lot of tools in place and we also know what works. What works \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen it \u2014 is assertive outreach by clinically trained outreach workers, case management, single points of entry, supportive services, especially mental health and substance abuse services, and an absolute commitment to increasing the inventory of permanent housing.\u2022 How do you overcome local resistance to adding housing for the homeless?When the inevitable question of \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 arises, I think it\u2019s a different discussion when you say to people: \u2018The status quo is having an impact on your neighborhood and on your neighborhood and city park. It\u2019s having an impact on your business corridors. And it\u2019s better to house people with services than to allow people to live on the street.\u2019We are so far removed from pinching ourselves and remembering what this is really about, that we tolerate this social condition in 2017 California in America.

{"Headline": "Xiaomi, Chinese Phone Maker, Losing Its Global Face as Hugo Barra Exits", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Xiaomi, the smartphone start-up that showed the potential and the limits of a new generation of Chinese technology companies, is losing its most familiar global face.But his departure comes as some of that promise looks to be in doubt. Xiaomi grew quickly in China by selling cheaper smartphones with premium features, initially only online. It has had mixed success outside China, however. At home, it faces rising competition from big, deep-pocketed rivals like Huawei Technologies and other scrappy upstarts like the Chinese brand OnePlus.In a note about his resignation on Facebook, Mr. Barra, who joined Xiaomi in 2013, called his time there \u201cspectacular\u201d and said that he was moving on for personal reasons.\u201cBut what I\u2019ve realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health,\u201d he wrote, adding that he was moving back to Silicon Valley to be closer to friends and family.Bryan Ma, an analyst at IDC, said that Mr. Barra\u2019s departure was a blow to the company and that it called into question the future of Xiaomi\u2019s fledgling overseas business.\u201cThe question is, Who will replace him? Will that person be as effective an ambassador?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing fine in India, but what happens for everything else? Where does this all sit in the grand plan they had several years ago to expand to a bunch of markets?\u201dXiang Wang, a veteran of Qualcomm who has led Xiaomi\u2019s supply chain and intellectual property rights teams, will take over Mr. Barra\u2019s responsibilities and lead Xiaomi\u2019s global business, Xiaomi said. Mr. Barra did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Barra, the vice president responsible for Xiaomi\u2019s global division, presided over international expansion. Unlike China\u2019s other major internet companies, Xiaomi made an early decision to expand beyond China\u2019s borders, targeting markets like India, Myanmar and Brazil.Mr. Barra, a widely recognized name in the tech world, was often the public face of that expansion. Orchestrating product releases in new markets and acting as an ambassador, he often gave talks in local markets to build buzz.Xiaomi has done relatively well in India, which accounted for about 18 percent of the company\u2019s total phone shipments in the third quarter of 2016, according to IDC.In other markets it has been less successful. For instance, after a high-profile release of its phones in Mr. Barra\u2019s home country of Brazil in 2015, the company has not been able to establish a significant beachhead there.Competition has intensified in China from Huawei, OnePlus, Lenovo Group Limited and other companies getting into the handset business. From the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016, Xiaomi\u2019s market share in China dropped to 8 percent from 16 percent, according to IDC.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Alexa Fits Into Amazon\u2019s Prime Directive", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyWhen \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation\u201d first aired in the 1980s, it envisioned a number of technological advances for humankind\u2019s future. Set in the 24th century, the show featured 3-D printers, visors that could provide artificial sight and a virtual reality simulator called the holodeck. But perhaps its most prescient creation was the supercomputer onboard the ship. The software \u2014 usually referred to only as \u201cComputer\u201d \u2014 could locate people, open doors and retrieve answers to complicated questions. Crew members spoke their requests, and an always-present helper responded within seconds.Amazon brought a version of that computer to life recently \u2014 albeit a few centuries earlier than \u201cStar Trek\u201d predicted. Last July, David Limp, a company executive who works on the product, said in an interview with Fortune that the idea of an all-knowing machine, with access to all the world\u2019s information, had captured his imagination since the first time he saw it on television. It took, he said, a team of 1,000 engineers to write its code, and when the device was finished, Amazon decided to call it Alexa, shorthand for Alexandria, as in the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt. It is designed to work primarily with a suite of wireless speakers, also made by Amazon, called Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.The company bills Alexa as a smart personal assistant, one that can play your favorite song or read you a book or recite a recipe as you cook. You can also make purchases through Amazon simply by asking. The possibilities are seemingly endless, because Alexa can learn new \u201cskills\u201d (as Amazon likes to call them) from third-party developers who integrate Alexa into their own products. And developers have leapt at the opportunity to do so: At the beginning of 2016, there were 135 skills designed to work with Alexa, but this year that number increased to more than 7,000. Alexa can now order you an Uber or a pizza, check your bank balance, control your TV, turn your lights on and off and even measure your car\u2019s carbon-dioxide emissions. \u201c\u2009\u2018Alexa, buy me coffee\u2019 is just a fraction of what it\u2019s going to be over time,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an internet analyst who covers Amazon for the equities firm Macquarie Securities. \u201cWhat can they improve with the voice activation? Some of that has yet to be seen.\u201dAlexa has already evolved from an experimental device to an irresistible household fixture \u2014 perhaps surprisingly, given Amazon\u2019s spotty track record with hardware. Kindle e-readers are popular, but the company\u2019s attempt at a smartphone flopped hard. Schachter told me that part of Alexa\u2019s success was luck, in that there were few other shiny consumer offerings on the market this holiday season and the price point was affordable. But something about the future-feel of this device, its ease and convenience, has captivated a mass audience, even the most privacy-conscious among us. Alexa is always listening, ready to be of service. (This has already backfired: When a newscaster relayed a story about a little girl using her Alexa to order a dollhouse, it triggered dozens of Alexas in the homes of people watching the broadcast to also try to order one.)Five years ago, few would have guessed that Amazon would already be ahead of the top tech companies vying to be leaders in home automation. But Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of the company, has been shaping this vision since the earliest days of Amazon. I recently revisited \u201cThe Everything Store,\u201d a 2013 book by Brad Stone about how Bezos transformed the start-up from an online bookstore into the e-commerce behemoth it is today. \u201cBezos\u2019 long-term goal is to sell everything, everywhere,\u201d Stone writes. \u201cHe will attempt to move faster, work his employees harder, make bolder bets and pursue both big inventions and small ones, all to achieve his grand vision for Amazon \u2014 that it be not just an everything store, but ultimately an everything company.\u201dThe fact that I live in New York, a city that thrives on accessibility, might explain why I was slow to grasp the appeal of Alexa. Here we have bodegas on every corner, most open 24 hours, in case you need to pick up a roll of toilet paper or a bottle of hot sauce in the middle of the night. But most Americans don\u2019t live with the luxury of that immediacy. I didn\u2019t really understand this until the holidays, when I went home to visit my mom in Virginia and we ran out of seltzer. Carbonated water is not an essential item. But in that moment, it would have been easier to quickly tell Alexa to place an order for us and forget about it until it arrived two or three days later, rather than try to remember to pick up a case of Poland Spring the next time someone made the 20-minute drive to the store. That\u2019s the entire enticing promise of Amazon and Alexa: a much more efficient and manageable life, one in which you can outsource mundane tasks while you do something more important, like spend time with your family.It\u2019s not hard to imagine that Alexa might be displaced as rivals introduce their own efforts. Facebook is working on an intelligent assistant, called Jarvis (named for the smart computer that helps Tony Stark, or Iron Man, navigate his surroundings), as is Microsoft. There are rumors that Apple is working on a major update for Siri. Google is currently Amazon\u2019s closest competitor. The company has spent decades organizing the world\u2019s information and learning about our habits and preferences in the process, so that it will one day know what we want even before we do. Search, then, will evolve away from the actual act of searching to the act of surfacing. The company is working on a version of artificial intelligence called Google Assistant to perfect that very ability.But while Google is working to anticipate your needs, Amazon is readying itself to be the only place you need to go to fulfill them. Thinking about Amazon\u2019s restraints \u2014 the company has never tried to introduce a social network or an email service, for example \u2014 you can understand something about the future Amazon seems to envision: A time when no screen is needed at all, just your voice.Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of CB Insights, a trend-forecasting start-up in New York, told me that Amazon has something that its competitors only dream of \u2014 consumer attention and trust. \u201cIn the last few years, Amazon has become the search engine for consumer products, instead of Google,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to buy something, and you already have an Amazon account, you\u2019re probably going to just buy it there. With Google, you still have to go to Amazon or Walmart.\u201d Amazon is investing in supply trailers, drones and fulfillment centers to develop its own postal service and delivery system. And it\u2019s still pushing its Dash buttons, those small pieces of hardware with one purpose: to order a single item from Amazon, like laundry detergent or dish soap. They seem unnecessary, until you consider them with all of Amazon\u2019s other efforts: It\u2019s not just an everything store, or even an everything company, but an everywhere (and anytime!) store.The various products that Amazon is planning to roll out \u2014 including Pantry and Fresh, its grocery service \u2014 can be easily baked into default Alexa services. Restaurants, the company\u2019s version of Seamless, already is. All this in turn brings in more money for Amazon. As Limp put it back in July: \u201cThe nice thing about the Amazon device business is that when we sell a device, generally people buy more bluejeans. And little black dresses. And shoes.\u201dThere\u2019s a theory that behavioral economists use to explain our consumption habits called \u201chyperbolic discounting,\u201d which is the tendency to choose short-term rewards over long-term gains. The \u201cmarshmallow test\u201d of the 1960s tested the ability of preschoolers to resist temptation \u2014 the titular marshmallow, within reach \u2014 with the promise that they would be rewarded with two if they waited. In the experiment\u2019s most popular interpretation, those who had self-control grew up to be much more successful than those who did not. It is one of the most formative studies in self-control and how people make decisions. Alexa is the ultimate marshmallow test, and most of us are failing. We are being conditioned, as a population, to never wait, to never delay our gratification, to accept thoughtless, constant consumption as the new norm. But how we think about consumption and willpower carry enormous implications for the environment and the culture of society as a whole.

Much depends on the resilience of the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which acts as California\u2019s largest water storage facility by replenishing depleted rivers and reservoirs after the winter.And while Northern California has seen copious precipitation since the fall, other parts of the state \u2014 notably, in the San Joaquin Valley and the Central Coast \u2014 remain severely parched.\u201cWhere the drought impacts are strongest, they\u2019re not seeing the bulk of this precipitation,\u201d said Michael Anderson, the state climatologist. \u201cSo location matters.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have metered paywalls.)\u201cMoonlight\u201d won for best picture drama.Ms. Powell, 42, a documentary filmmaker, had never heard of the park.

{"Headline": "Researchers Created Fake News. Here\u2019s What They Found.", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceHunt Allcott of New York University and Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford commissioned a survey in late November hoping to discern just how deeply some of the fake news embedded itself with American voters. The two asked people, among other things, whether they had heard various pieces of news that reflected positively or negatively on one of the candidates \u2014 of three varieties.There was completely true news: Hillary Clinton called some Trump supporters a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d for example, or Mr. Trump refused to say at a debate whether he would concede the election if he lost.There was fake news, as identified by fact-checking sites like Snopes and PolitiFact \u2014 big things like the Pope Francis story and smaller items, like Mr. Trump threatening to deport the \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to Puerto Rico.The third category was most interesting. The researchers created \u201cfake fake\u201d news. That is, they invented some headlines that were the type of thing fake sites produce, but had never actually been published during the campaign. One of these placebo headlines was that \u201cleaked documents reveal that the Clinton campaign planned a scheme to offer to drive Republican voters to the polls but then take them to the wrong place,\u201d and its inverse in which it was the Trump campaign scheming to take Democrats to the wrong polling place.There is some good news in that more people reported having heard, and believed, the true statements than the false statements. Only 15.3 percent of the population recalled seeing the fake news stories, and 7.9 percent recalled seeing them and believing them.The more interesting result: Those numbers are nearly identical to the proportion who reported seeing (14.1 percent) and believing (8.3 percent) the placebos, the \u201cfake fake\u201d news stories. In other words, as many people recalled seeing and believing fake news that had been published and distributed through social media as recalled seeing fake news that had never existed and was purely an invention of researchers.That\u2019s a strong indication about what is going on with consumers of fake news. It may be less that false information from dubious news sources is shaping their view of the world. Rather, some people (about 8 percent of the adult population, if we take the survey data at face value) are willing to believe anything that sounds plausible and fits their preconceptions about the heroes and villains in politics.\u201cFalse remembering is incredibly correlated with people\u2019s priors,\u201d Mr. Gentzkow said. \u201cOne way to think about it is we know our memories are very imperfect. And if you ask me if I saw something, I\u2019m partly asking myself how likely it is that I saw it. People are doing inference.\u201dMr. Allcott and Mr. Gentzkow do some math around how influential each fake news story would need to have been on people who read it to have meaningfully affected the election results. They conclude that a single news article would need to have been as persuasive as 36 television campaign ads to have been the difference between a Trump victory or loss.But there\u2019s a bigger, and perhaps more worrying, implication of this research. It suggests that the most straightforwardly fraudulent forms of fake news are a small part of what is shaping how people understand the world. People\u2019s hunger for information that suits their prejudices is powerful, and in the digital media age, a pile of it emerges to satisfy that demand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sticker Shock, and Maybe Nausea, Hamper Sales of Virtual Reality Gear", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For a technology to crack the mainstream, there is an unspoken understanding: It shouldn\u2019t make the people who use it want to throw up.And yet there was a reminder, at last week\u2019s International CES trade show in Las Vegas, of how far virtual reality has to go until everyone is ready to fasten 3-D goggles to their faces. At a news conference, Intel, the chip maker, provided virtual reality headsets to about 250 attendees so they could watch a 3-D video from the perspective of sky divers hurtling out of a helicopter in wingsuits. Intel also passed out motion sickness bags to everyone, in case anybody felt inclined to vomit, an unfortunate side effect of turbulent virtual reality experiences for some people.Laura Anderson, an Intel spokeswoman, said the company had provided the bags \u201cout of an abundance of caution and to be tongue in cheek about our immersive experience.\u201d No one used the bags, she said.It is time for a reality check for virtual reality, one of the most hyped technologies of last year. Sales of the most capable headsets have been sluggish by most estimates, held back by high costs, a lack of must-have content, and the complexity and awkwardness of the products. Less expensive mobile headsets that use smartphones as their screens are selling better, but are far more limited in what they can do.\u201cThis is going to be a long slog, as the technology continues to improve, more content becomes available and awareness increases,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research.That deal sparked a wave of start-ups creating products for virtual reality and a related technology called augmented reality, which overlays digital imagery on a view of the real world, as seen through smartphones and headsets. Last year, $1.48 billion was invested in start-ups in that category, compared with $331 million the prior year, estimated Pitchbook, a financial data firm.Many of those start-ups were funded before major headsets went on sale to the public. Entrepreneurs raising money in the future are likely to encounter tougher questions about what kind of use their products are getting.\u201cAll the major headsets have launched \u2014 the numbers are coming in,\u201d said Alex Rosenfeld, the founder of Vrideo, a start-up that acted as a YouTube-like hub for virtual reality videos. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have some companies here that don\u2019t survive. If the industry is going to continue to attract dollars, there\u2019s going to have to be real numbers.\u201dThe companies that make the major headsets do not report their sales, and all of them said they were pleased with the results so far. SuperData Research, a technology research firm, estimated that Oculus had sold 360,000 headsets and HTC 450,000 since their products went on sale in March and June, respectively. Both of those headsets require high-end PCs with powerful processors.The firm estimated that Sony, which began selling a virtual reality headset in October, has sold about 750,000. Sony\u2019s headset was seen as a potentially big boost to the virtual reality industry because it is less expensive than rival headsets and relies on a PlayStation 4 console, more than 53 million of which have already been sold.A bundle with the PlayStation VR headset and specialized controllers sells for $500, while comparable bundles from HTC and Oculus sell for just under $800 each. Less expensive Sony and Oculus headsets are available without controllers designed for virtual reality. Still, the Sony sales were fewer than SuperData and others had expected.\u201cThe holidays were pretty disappointing for many in the industry,\u201d said Doug Renert, a venture capitalist with Tandem Capital. \u201cI\u2019m not all that surprised.\u201dIn a bright spot, Samsung said last week at CES that is had shipped more than five million of its Gear VR headsets, which act as a cradle for a mobile phone, with lenses that create a 3-D image from the phone\u2019s screen. Samsung often runs promotions in which it gives away a headset with the purchase of a Samsung smartphone.Price drops on technology are likely to be a big factor in mainstream acceptance of virtual reality. Starting Monday, a company that makes gaming PCs, CyberPower, will begin selling a $499 computer that can play virtual reality content when used with an Oculus headset. That is hundreds of dollars less than the normal cost.Ergonomic challenges with virtual reality headsets are likely to take longer to overcome. The more powerful headsets must be tethered by thick cables to PCs or consoles, which can tangle up players\u2019 legs when these rigs occlude their view of the real world.\u201cWith wireless, V.R. will be ready for the mass market,\u201d said Mykola Minchenko, chief executive of Sixa, which plans to sell its adapter for $200.Mr. Renert, the venture capitalist, said his firm had invested in several start-ups working in virtual reality, including Sixa, despite slow sales of headsets, though the companies are working on technologies in other categories, too. He is confident that virtual reality will one day be a mainstream technology, comparing its evolution to touch-screen devices from Apple that were flops and hits.\u201cWe\u2019re not at the Newton stage, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at iPhone stage,\u201d Mr. Renert said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Subway Bastion Falls: Cell Service Goes Underground", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byNew York City\u2019s crowded and clanking subway system is hardly an oasis of peace, but its subterranean stations were among the last places in the noisy city where cellphones remained silent.Not anymore.Starting this week, nearly all underground stations now have cell service and Wi-Fi.Many New Yorkers rejoiced when the signal suddenly appeared. They checked work emails. They texted friends. They updated their Facebook statuses. Moments later, they began to realize what they had lost \u2014 a blissful respite from the harried world above.\u201cAfter my initial joy at being connected underground, I realized: Now my emails, my texts and my digital world will follow me everywhere I go,\u201d said Launa Schweizer, 47, a teacher who lives in Brooklyn. \u201cWill I stop reading poetry on the subway?\u201dSome riders complained that platforms would soon be filled with people talking loudly on their cellphones or that they would confront the same irritant encountered above ground: people walking while staring down zombielike at their mobile devices. For now, at least, the digital intrusion will not extend much beyond stations since the networks do not yet reach most subway tunnels.Still, the wiring of subway stations reflects a broader wave of easing communication for travelers. Federal regulators are even considering allowing phone calls on airplanes.Many commuters were thrilled to learn that cell service was now widespread \u2014 at 277 stations in a system that extends across 472 stations, many of which are aboveground and already had cell service. They can now make phone calls during emergencies. They can coordinate shifting plans with friends. Perhaps best of all, when a train is inevitably delayed, a rider can check the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s website for an explanation.\u201cAll the other stations have it too, and I\u2019m loving it,\u201d Yolanda Hung, 35, a nail stylist, said as she downloaded a list of appointments to her phone at the Whitehall stop in Lower Manhattan.\u201cThis is a frill,\u201d David Gurin, 76, a retired city transportation official, said as he waited for a train at the newly connected station at Fourth Avenue and Ninth Street in Brooklyn. \u201cGood, regular, frequent subway service is far more important than having cellphones.\u201dBeth DeFalco, a spokeswoman for the authority, said officials were, in fact, working to improve subway service, noting that the authority\u2019s $29.5 billion capital plan would pay for new signals and other upgrades.\u201cFree Wi-Fi and cell connectivity underground doesn\u2019t come at the expense of service improvements for riders,\u201d Ms. DeFalco said in a statement.The authority and Transit Wireless are currently testing technologies to bring Wi-Fi and cell service to subway tunnels too, Ms. DeFalco said.At the Ninth Street subway station in Brooklyn on a recent morning, a countdown clock was installed above the platform but not yet turned on. A woman sat on a bench using the station\u2019s new cell service to chat on her phone. Samantha Lopez, a nonprofit executive in her 40s, was reading a print copy of the novel \u201cSweetbitter.\u201d She said she preferred to read on the subway and would only occasionally use cell service.\u201cI\u2019m worried a little about all the noise if people are talking all the time \u2014 the cacophony of all these voices together,\u201d she said.More than a third of the subway runs aboveground, and subway riders have long been able to use their cellphones on those parts of the system. A team of professors and dozens of students from Hunter College studied subway behavior and found that riders were more likely to use mobile devices aboveground, where they have had reliable service.Mike Owen Benediktsson, an assistant sociology professor involved in the study, said hardly any riders talked on their phones, even when they had service on trains running aboveground, because of the unwritten etiquette rules of the subway.\u201cIt reflects the social norm of preserving your own privacy and respecting the privacy of others in a public space,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to change immediately just because the technology is changing.\u201dAnother Brooklyn subway rider, Camille Francis, 23, said she would use the new service to play music on Spotify and to immediately alert her friends when she sees rats on the tracks \u2014 a ritual they call \u201csqueaky sightings.\u201d And now she can also use Google Maps to find a new route if her train is delayed.\u201cBefore, I\u2019d have to try to read the map and feel slightly archaic like I\u2019m Nicolas Cage in \u2018National Treasure,\u2019\u201d she said in reference to the film about the hunt for a treasure map.Advertisement"}

More than anything else, our intimate relationships, or lack thereof, shape and define our lives.While there have been many schools of thought to help us understand what strains and maintains human bonds, from Freudian to Gestalt, one of the most rigorously studied may be the least known to the public.By the end of our first year, we have stamped on our baby brains a pretty indelible template of how we think relationships work, based on how our parents or other primary caregivers treat us. From an evolutionary standpoint, this makes sense, because we need to figure out early on how to survive in our immediate environment.\u201cOur attachment system preferentially sees things according to what has happened in the past,\u201d said Dr. Amir Levine, a psychiatrist at Columbia University and the co-author of the book \u201cAttached,\u201d which explores how attachment behaviors affect the neurochemistry of the brain. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like searching in Google where it fills in based on what you searched before.\u201dWhat these protocols have in common is promoting participants\u2019 awareness of their attachment style, and their related sabotaging behaviors, as well as training on how to balance vulnerability and autonomy in relationships.Indeed, if you look at the classic categories of attachment styles \u2014 secure; insecure anxious; insecure avoidant; and insecure disorganized \u2014 it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out which one applies to you and others in your life. The categories stem from tens of thousands of observations of babies and toddlers whose caregivers leave them briefly, either alone or with a stranger, and then return, a test known as the \u201cstrange situation.\u201d The labels can also apply to how adults behave toward loved ones in times of stress.Secure children get upset when their caregivers leave, and run toward them with outstretched arms when they return. They fold into the caregiver and are quickly soothed. A securely attached adult similarly goes to a loved one for comfort and support when they, say, are passed over for a promotion at work or feel vulnerable or hurt. They are also eager to reciprocate when the tables are turned.Children high on the insecure anxious end of the spectrum get upset when caregivers leave and may go to them when they return. But these children aren\u2019t easily soothed, usually because the caregiver has proved to be an unreliable source of comfort in the past. They may kick and arch their back as if they are angry. As adults, they tend to obsess about their relationships and may be overly dramatic in order to get attention. They may hound romantic interests instead of taking it slow.Insecure avoidant children don\u2019t register distress when their caregivers leave (although their stress hormones and heart rate may be sky high) and they don\u2019t show much interest when caregivers return, because they are used to being ignored or rebuffed. Alternatively, a parent may have smothered them with too much attention. Insecure avoidant adults tend to have trouble with intimacy and are more likely to leave relationships, particularly if they are going well. They may not return calls and resist talking about their feelings.Finally, insecure disorganized children and adults display both anxious and avoidant behaviors in an illogical and erratic manner. This behavior is usually the lingering result of situations where a childhood caregiver was threatening or abusive.He added that having secure attachments is not about being a perfect parent or partner but about maintaining communication to repair the inevitable rifts that occur. In the daily battering of any relationship, Dr. Fonagy said, \u201cif free flow of communication is impaired, the relationship is, too.\u201dKate Murphy is a journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Helping Mobile Publishing? Some Publishers Are Not So Sure", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last month, Federico Viticci, who runs MacStories, a news site devoted to Apple and its products, made a change in how the site publishes articles for mobile gadgets. MacStories, he declared, would no longer support a Google-backed method for faster loading of mobile web pages, called AMP.AMP has since delivered on its promise of faster mobile web pages. Even so, publishers \u2014 of smaller sites, especially, or individual bloggers \u2014 are beginning to worry about giving too much control to Google in exchange for zippier web pages. What\u2019s more, Google\u2019s approach to AMP has rankled some critics already suspicious of the company\u2019s outsize influence on the internet.Much of the publishers\u2019 unease is rooted in Google\u2019s presentation of AMP stories, which appear as if they are Google articles. That\u2019s because Google, to speed up AMP, stores copies of publisher\u2019s pages and serves them from its own internet network. So when a reader clicks an AMP link, the address bar at the top of the page displays google.com instead of the actual web address from the publisher.\u201cIt looks like a Google story,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a web search news site. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why you\u2019re getting the nervousness from some of these publishers.\u201dGoogle said that it had designed AMP to prioritize speed and that it wanted to help \u2014 not harm \u2014 publishers, who get full accounting of traffic, data and advertising revenue. Publishers also retain control of their content and design. Google said serving up articles from its own internet network was the best way it knew to achieve the AMP speeds, which are as much as four times faster than a regular mobile web page.\u201cWe always try to present the content that is the best experience,\u201d said David Besbris, Google\u2019s vice president of engineering.Google started AMP in 2015 because it worried that competitors like Facebook were drawing web surfers inside their networks with faster-loading articles and keeping them there. For Google, those rival sites were siphoning people away from the open internet, where the search company \u2014 which created the internet\u2019s most valuable property by organizing the expanse of the World Wide Web \u2014 typically operates.Now articles that use AMP appear prominently in Google search results on mobile devices. A Google search for \u201cDonald Trump\u201d on a smartphone brings back a horizontal carousel of articles from media organizations like Slate and The Wall Street Journal at the top of the page. If someone clicks the first story in the carousel, he or she is moved into a browser and can swipe instantly from one story to another without leaving Google\u2019s network.Another benefit of AMP for Google is that it keeps activity on the web, and away from apps. More browsing on the internet means more web searches, and, in most cases, that means more Google. This is even more pronounced on mobile devices, where Google accounts for about 95 percent of all global web searches, according to StatCounter.David Gehring, a former Google employee and the chief executive of Relay Media, a company that works with publishers to convert pages to AMP, said the format had been positive for publishers grappling with shrinking revenue in the shift from print to online advertising. He estimated that up to 10 percent of mobile web content was already on AMP.Yet Mr. Gehring also said Google suffered from \u201ctone deafness\u201d when it came to explaining the benefits of AMP, such as the ability for publishers to syndicate articles across the mobile web without losing advertising or traffic.\u201cIt made me feel like my site wasn\u2019t my own,\u201d Mr. Kras said.Still, Mr. Kras decided to keep AMP because it was fast. \"For that, a lot of little things can be (temporarily) forgotten,\u201d he said.Several bigger publishers say they are pleased with AMP and do not see anything worrisome with Google.\u201cGoogle has been a good partner,\u201d said Mark Silverstein, the head of business development at The Huffington Post, which is planning to push almost all of its news content into AMP. \u201cWhen they make decisions, they do a good job of explaining why they reached that decision.\u201dEmily Smith, head of content operations at Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s Wired magazine, said supporting AMP had pushed its mobile articles to the top of search results. For web surfers conditioned to believe that the most relevant information is presented first in search results, it\u2019s important for a media organization to be near the top.\u201cIt\u2019s like being above the fold in a newspaper,\u201d she said.About 15 percent of The Washington Post\u2019s traffic comes from AMP pages. The Post is now using the lessons from AMP to move its articles to a separate, faster-running mobile platform that runs like an app but does so over the web.Joey Marburger, director of products for The Post, said that its readers were scrolling further on AMP stories, but that it was building its own fast system to gain greater control over ads and features.\u201cWe have to be where our readers are coming from,\u201d Mr. Marburger said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also important to have more control over our own content.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In tech right now, it is also very valuable.That would require downloading an app and carrying a smartphone in the car. It would enable drivers to do things like get weather reports, stream music, juggle their calendars or remotely lock and unlock their cars. And, of course, shop on Amazon while driving.Other tech companies are also getting into using \u201cconversational computing,\u201d or voice commands, in cars. Apple has CarPlay software for dictating messages or getting map directions while behind the wheel. Google has Android Auto for something similar.In all, there seemed to be more than a dozen companies with Alexa capabilities at CES. Notably, Huawei, a Chinese electronics company, said its flagship Mate 9 phone would have Alexa preinstalled. That\u2019s particularly impressive, because the Mate 9 uses Google\u2019s Android operating system and thus has access to Google Voice, a voice assistant.Why the big push now?\u201cIf you own the voice-user interface, you own lots of data, and you know what people are talking about. That gives you a much better chance of selling them something,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, the president of Moor Insights & Strategy, a tech analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s also a Trojan horse for getting people to use A.W.S.\u201d (Amazon Web Services is by far the most profitable part of Amazon.)User data, direct digital knowledge of what people are doing with your products and in the world, is perhaps the most valuable currency in a world dominated by online life. It is the best way to know how your products are going over, and what to build next.Amazon collects lots of shopping data from its retail website, and now has the most information on how people use cloud computing systems like A.W.S., but it has an uneven record in many other areas. Its phone was a dud, and it has a relatively modest business in tablets mostly used for reading. It has no operating system of its own to speak of, and that is often how companies like Apple and Google obtain some of their best data.If the company can capture voice computing, it can gain lots of insights without having to build lots of low-margin hardware. Easy to see why the push is on.Advertisement"}

Aside from the venture capitalist and noted contrarian Peter Thiel, few in tech openly supported Mr. Trump.It is not difficult to understand why.While the tech industry might appreciate the lower taxes and less regulation that Mr. Trump has promised, the industry is globalist to the core. If you want to be an internet company, you\u2019d be better be willing to operate all over the world. And if you want to compete with the likes of Google and Apple, you\u2019d better be willing to hire engineers and salespeople from all over the planet.That\u2019s a worldview in direct conflict with Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalist politics (though his own company certainly operates in many countries).What\u2019s more, despite their many faults \u2014 from comical self-regard to a habit of ignoring regulations found to be inconvenient \u2014 tech executives are an optimistic bunch.

{"Headline": "For 5 Contest Finalists, a $20 Million Dash to the Moon", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byThe surface of the moon may soon be dotted with corporate logos, and its craters labeled with slogans. Families might be able to send their loved ones\u2019 ashes \u2014 or even their pets\u2019 remains \u2014 for lunar burial.Entrepreneurs hope that commercial ventures expand in lucrative ways in later years. In a farther, fanciful future, for example, the moon could be mined for platinum, a valuable metal, or helium-3, to be used as fuel for fusion energy reactors that do not yet exist.Private access to the moon grew a little closer to reality on Tuesday, when the X Prize Foundation, with prizes financed by Google, chose five teams of private entrepreneurs who say they can get to the moon by the end of this year.If any of them succeeds \u2014 the deadline has been pushed back several times \u2014 it could usher in an era of extraterrestrial commerce and renew interest in our long-ignored moon.\u201cIt\u2019s incentivized this whole business of the niche space economy,\u201d said Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, a senior director at the X Prize Foundation, which runs the contest.The X Prize Foundation was founded by Peter H. Diamandis, an entrepreneur who wanted to use competitions to encourage technological innovation in the way that aviation prizes in the early 20th century helped transform airplanes from a dangerous avocation of barnstormers to a commonplace mode of transportation.The first X Prize award of $10 million in 2004 went to the first private spaceship that could take people 62 miles up, into outer space. That led to the founding of Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic, which aims to take tourists to the edge of space for a few minutes of weightlessness.The foundation began a similar competition in 2007 to point attention to the moon. To win the top $20 million prize, a spacecraft must land on the moon, move 500 meters and send back video and photographs. The second team to accomplish the task wins $5 million. The contest also offers $5 million in bonus prizes, for feats like surviving the cold lunar night and traveling more than 5,000 meters on the surface.The next 11 months are a dash to finish team designs, assemble spacecraft and prepare for launching. And the teams differ on their approaches.Rahul Narayan, the leader of Team Indus, said the engineers had to develop their own computer, software, power system and other components when the initial approach of buying off-the-shelf satellite parts did not work out, increasing costs. Mr. Narayan now estimates the price tag at $70 million to $75 million.The Hakuto team, with a $10 million budget, is not building a lander at all, but hitching a ride for its rover with Team Indus. If Team Indus is the first to land on the moon, its rover and Hakuto\u2019s will race to travel the 500 meters to capture the $20 million prize. Both rovers have a top speed of about 4 inches a second.\u201cWe think that we can beat them on the moon,\u201d said Takeshi Hakamada, the leader of Hakuto (pronounced HOCK-tow).For SpaceIL and Synergy Moon, the main goal is not starting a business, but inspiring the next generation. \u201cKind of like Jacques Cousteau did with ocean exploration,\u201d said Kevin Myrick, a founder of Synergy Moon.Eran Privman, the chief executive of SpaceIL, said attracting the interest of venture capitalists would have been difficult for the company, because the return on investment would have been a couple of decades in the future. So instead of trying to be a profitable business, his team seeks to inspire children in Israel. \u201cJust like Apollo in the United States in the \u201960s,\u201d he said.Moon Express, based in Cape Canaveral, Fla., has followed a more conventional business path, soliciting investors. It is building a scaled-down lander to fit into a small, $5 million rocket called Electron, developed by a start-up company, Rocket Lab.It will carry a reflecting mirror experiment that bounces back laser beams from Earth, the same type of experiment that Apollo astronauts left behind on the moon. The lead scientist for the experiment, Douglas Currie, a retired physicist from the University of Maryland, was a key member of the Apollo laser experiments.SpaceIL and Moon Express are eschewing rovers. To fulfill the 500-meter requirement, both instead intend to have their landers lift off and land again.And the companies all still face challenges. Moon Express\u2019s ride, the Electron, has yet to launch even once. \u201cIt\u2019s not a blind bet,\u201d Mr. Richards said, but he conceded that it was also not a sure thing. Synergy Moon also plans to launch on an unproven rocket.Yet even some of teams that have dropped out have not given up.Astrobotic, which now plans to launch its spacecraft in 2019, has announced partnerships with DHL, the delivery company, and signed up customers for its trips including Elysium Space, which plans to offer the possibility of sending human remains to the moon. \u201cThe X Prize is not really the core driving thing anymore,\u201d said John Thornton, Astrobotic\u2019s chief executive.Robert Boehme, the leader of Part-Time scientists, said his team \u2014 which is backed by Audi, the carmaker \u2014 had a contract to launch in mid-2018. \u201cIt\u2019s too risky to try to accelerate it,\u201d he said.Its rover will have the four-ring Audi logo on the front and be called the Audi lunar quattro, echoing the name of one of Audi\u2019s cars.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the price of platinum. It is currently more expensive than gold; it is not the case that platinum is \u201cfar more valuable than gold.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medicaid\u2019s Data Gets an Internet-Era Makeover", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byJini Kim\u2019s relationship with Medicaid is business and personal.Andrew M. Slavitt, acting director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, described the cloud database as \u201cnear historic.\u201d Largely because Medicaid information resides in so many state-level computing silos, Mr. Slavitt explained, \u201cwe\u2019ve never had a systemwide view across the program.\u201dHealth data on its own \u2014 billing, diagnostic and treatment information, typically recorded in arcane, shorthand codes \u2014 is not very useful. But if it can be aggregated and analyzed economically and quickly, that data is seen as a vital ingredient in transforming health care.The health care marketplace in the traditional fee-for-service model values volume. More doctor visits, hospital stays, operations and pills mean more revenue and profit for health care providers. But the push in recent years has been toward what is known as value-based health care. In the value model, medical groups are paid for outcomes: patients treated more efficiently and people who are healthier.But that transition only becomes possible with accurate, reliable data as the raw material for measuring outcomes and discovering what works and what does not. That is the reason for the excitement about and investment in health information technology, and the goal of the Medicaid work with Nuna. The data set will be stripped of identifying information before it is released to researchers.Ms. Kim, 35, a former Google product manager, has firsthand experience with Medicaid. Her brother, Kimong, who is a year younger, is severely autistic. When he was 8, Kimong started having monthly grand mal seizures, which are characterized by loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. The ambulance, hospital, doctor and therapy bills piled up. As a 9-year-old, Ms. Kim helped her Korean immigrant parents complete the Medicaid application forms.\u201cOur family would have gone bankrupt without Medicaid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt saved us.\u201dThe Medicaid system covers millions of working families, older people, children and people with disabilities. In fact, 40 percent of Medicaid spending goes to the disabled. Half of long-term care in America, mainly for older people, is through Medicaid. And nearly half of the children born in the United States are in the Medicaid system.The trouble with traditional health data warehouses, specialists say, is that they resemble digital vaults. It is difficult and time-consuming to get information in or out, and only people with specialized skills can use them.But the new cloud-based technology, using internet-era software, is flexible and interactive. It opens the door to real-time monitoring of emerging disease clusters, billing patterns and program effects. For example, did the percentage of low birth-weight babies decline after a Medicaid program was put in place? If so, how much?\u201cThis kind of data can help move health care policy from a partisan ideological debate to one informed by knowing who the people affected are and what will likely happen to Medicaid recipients,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research organization.\u201cHealth care is hard, and humility is important,\u201d Ms. Kim said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just put technology on something and assume it\u2019s going to work. You really have to understand the ecosystem in health care.\u201dThat government experience, Ms. Kim said, \u201cpaved the way\u201d for Nuna\u2019s work with Medicaid data. It demonstrated, she said, that internet technology and software methods could be applied to government health data from the mainframe era.Her brother is still on Medicaid, and caring for him is a family affair. Ms. Kim lives with her parents and Kimong in Hercules, Calif., in the Bay Area, about 10 miles north of Berkeley. When excited, Kimong waves his arms. When frustrated, he bangs his head against a wall. He can be loud and disruptive when he is anxious, and the family has been escorted off a few plane flights. \u201cHe\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Ms. Kim said.To relieve her parents, Ms. Kim takes Kimong with her to work some days. He can only say a few words, and one of them became the start-up\u2019s name \u2014 \u201cNuna,\u201d or \u201cbig sister\u201d in Korean.Nuna, founded in 2010, had only one full-time employee, Ms. Kim, until 2014, when it got an early round of venture financing. And no one was paid until then. David Chen, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief data officer, holds a Ph.D. in bioinformatics from Stanford University, but he also was a data scientist at Netflix for three years while Nuna was getting off the ground.Nuna is applying the technology and lessons learned from its Medicaid work to pursue business from private health plans, especially at large companies, to help them improve the efficiency and quality of care for workers.Ms. Kim expressed pride in her start-up\u2019s work, but also a sense of personal satisfaction. \u201cThis is my love letter to Medicaid for saving my family,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cyberwar for Sale", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "FeatureAfter a maker of surveillance software was hacked, its leaked documents shed light on a shadowy global industry that has turned email theft into a terrifying \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 political weapon. Supported byNow Lagunes was worried. Around 1 o\u2019clock, she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her. She reached him at a restaurant, where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies. \u201cI did not send you an email,\u201d he insisted. A consultant with the campaign \u2014 who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates \u2014 overheard the conversation. He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages: emails with vague subject lines, asking the recipient to review a document or click a link. The campaign, he realized, had been hacked.In the vote for party leader, Lagunes and her allies in Puebla \u2014 a two-hour drive southeast from Mexico City \u2014 were supporting the challenger, a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots. But the incumbent was backed by Puebla\u2019s powerful governor, Rafael Moreno Valle. One of Mexico\u2019s rising political stars, Moreno Valle is close to Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and has forged an alliance between PAN and Nieto\u2019s centrist Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI, long the dominant force in Mexican politics. Since winning the governorship in 2010, Moreno Valle\u2019s opponents say, his ambitions have grown, and he has resorted to increasingly harsh measures to keep Puebla state \u2014 including members of his own party \u2014 under control. \u201cIn the beginning, the governor was low-profile and respectful,\u201d Rafael Micalco, a former leader of PAN in Puebla state, told me. \u201cWhen he became governor, he transformed. Now he controls the party through threats.\u201dThis race to retain control of the party leadership in 2014 was a crucial test for the governor, who was rumored to be considering a run for Mexico\u2019s presidency in 2018. (This past September, Moreno Valle publicly announced his intent to run.) Clashes between the two camps were especially intense in Puebla, where backers of the challenger, Ernesto Cordero, claimed that the governor was using public money to support the incumbent, Gustavo Madero, though the governor\u2019s office has denied these charges. Shortly before the election, Madero\u2019s campaign manager said that Cordero\u2019s side was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the process. \u201cTheir strategy is clear from the outset,\u201d he said in an interview with a Mexican magazine. \u201c\u2009\u2018If I win, good. If not, I was cheated.\u2019\u2009\u201dAfter Lagunes\u2019s call on Election Day, her colleagues rushed from the restaurant back to their local headquarters, a hotel conference room that they had nicknamed \u201cthe bunker.\u201d All morning, they had been trying to reach their field network, a group of 40 Cordero canvassers who were working to get out the vote in Puebla state. But the field network seemed to have gone dark. Few of the canvassers were even answering their phones. Hackers, the team concluded, must have found the list of the canvassers\u2019 names and phone numbers \u2014 widely circulated by email within the campaign \u2014 and begun to intimidate them.\u201cThe day before,\u201d the consultant told me, the field network was \u201cmotivated and eager to do this work. After the hack, it was very hard to reach them. The few who did answer said that they had received phone calls saying that their lives were at stake. They were worried that if they went out, they or their families would get hurt.\u201dAccording to another worker on Cordero\u2019s campaign, who also requested anonymity, citing fear of reprisal, the message to the canvassers was simple and direct: \u201cWe know who you are. If you don\u2019t want any trouble, shut down your cellphone and stop your activity.\u201d The worker added: \u201cIt\u2019s an authoritarian regime.\u201dAnd so, like Lagunes, Podesta fell into a trap. The button appeared to lead to an official Google page, but it was in fact a meticulously personalized fake, with a domain address linked to a remote cluster of atolls in the South Pacific. The details were designed to trick Podesta into entering his password. This technique is known as \u201cspear phishing.\u201d It is an especially potent weapon against companies and political organizations because it needs to succeed only one time, against one target. After that, attackers can use the trusted identity of the first compromised account to more easily lure colleagues into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links. Not only will a working email password yield years of intraoffice chatter, invoices, credit-card bills and confidential memos; it can often be leveraged into control of other personal accounts \u2014 Twitter, Facebook, Amazon \u2014 and even access to company servers and internet domains.The White House, C.I.A. and F.B.I. have all claimed that, based on classified evidence, they can trace the hacks of Podesta\u2019s email account (and other hacks of people close to the Clinton campaign) back to the Russian government. But with the rise of private firms like Hacking Team, penetrating the email accounts of political opponents does not require the kind of money and expertise available to major powers. A subscription-based website called Insider Surveillance lists more than a dozen companies selling so-called ethical malware, including Milan-based Hacking Team and the German firms FinFisher and Trovicor. Compared with conventional arms, surveillance software is subject to few trade controls; a recent attempt by the United States to regulate it under a 41-country pact called the Wassenaar Arrangement failed. \u201cThe technology is morally neutral,\u201d says Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency. \u201cThe same program that you use to monitor your babysitter might be used by Bashar Assad or Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to keep track of whomever they don\u2019t like.\u201dHacking Team has fewer than 50 employees, but it has customers all over the world. According to internal documents, its espionage tool, which is called the Remote Control System, or R.C.S., can be licensed for as little as $200,000 a year \u2014 well within the budget of a provincial strongman. After it has been surreptitiously installed on a target\u2019s computer or phone, the Remote Control System can invisibly eavesdrop on everything: text messages, emails, phone and Skype calls, location data and so on. Whereas the N.S.A.\u2019s best-known programs grab data in transit from switching rooms and undersea cables, the R.C.S. acquires it at the source, right off a target\u2019s device, before it can be encrypted. It carries out an invisible, digitized equivalent of a Watergate-style break-in.The United States government is almost certainly the world\u2019s most formidable repository of hacking talent, but its most powerful cyberweapons are generally reserved for intelligence agencies and the military. This might explain why, according to company documents, at least two federal law-enforcement agencies have been Hacking Team clients: the F.B.I., beginning in 2011, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, beginning in 2012. The F.B.I. contract paid Hacking Team more than $700,000; the D.E.A. appears to have used the software to go after targets in Colombia.Documents show that the company has also sold its software to some of the world\u2019s most repressive governments. Some, like those of Honduras, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are Western allies. Other countries, like Uzbekistan and Turkey, have a more troubled relationship. A few are openly hostile to the West. Between 2012 and 2014, Hacking Team was paid nearly one million euros by the government of Sudan, a United States-designated state sponsor of terrorism. Even more notable, in light of recent events, is the three-year relationship that Hacking Team carried on with the F.S.B., one of Russia\u2019s main intelligence agencies. As with Puebla, Hacking Team used a middleman, a research agency called Kvant, to handle its sales to Russia. Between 2012 and 2014, the agency paid Hacking Team 451,000 euros to license the Remote Control System.Hacking Team claims that it draws the line at customers who commit \u201cgross human-rights abuses\u201d and that it sells exclusively to governments operating within the laws of their own countries. In at least one case, David Vincenzetti, Hacking Team\u2019s founder and chief executive, told a salesman to hold off on a potential Mexican client. \u201cWe sell to official, governmental LEAs\u201d \u2014 law-enforcement agencies \u2014 \u201cand security agencies ONLY,\u201d Vincenzetti wrote in an email. But at other times, a more casual attitude prevailed inside the company. \u201cIf one sells sandwiches to Sudan, he is not subject, as far as my knowledge goes, to the law,\u201d one Hacking Team lawyer wrote in an internal email. \u201cHacking Team should be treated like a sandwich vendor.\u201dWhen asked about its arrangements in various countries, the company responded that it \u201cdoes not comment on confidential business dealings.\u201d Its American spokesman, Eric Rabe, did tell me that neither Russia nor Sudan is a current Hacking Team customer. (The relationships, Rabe wrote, ended in 2014, Russia because \u201cthe Putin government evolved from one considered friendly to the West to a more hostile regime\u201d and Sudan \u201cbecause of concerns about the country\u2019s ability to use the system in accordance with the H.T. contract.\u201d) Separately, the company confirmed that the state of Puebla was, in fact, a former client.With the source code for the Remote Control System now public, the company and its clients had to stop using it temporarily. By the end of the year, though, Hacking Team had updated its product and was trying to rebuild its reputation. I was curious whether a company that profited from online breaches could recover from its own. Eric Rabe, the American spokesman, sounded eager to meet me for coffee in Philadelphia. A grandfather and former television-news anchor, he exudes square-jawed credibility. \u201cIf you disagree with someone on the internet,\u201d he said, of the Hacked Team files, with a wave of his hand, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to have a public-policy debate. Just go destroy them.\u201dA couple of months later, I went to Milan to visit Hacking Team\u2019s headquarters, a stately gray apartment building with boxes of limp flowers adorning a few of its sooty sills. Waiting to demonstrate the company\u2019s software were Rabe; Philippe Vinci, a company vice president; and Alessandro Scarafile, a young engineer. Scarafile had gathered a Dell desktop computer and three smartphones: iPhone, BlackBerry and Android. The screen from his own laptop, which represented the console of a client intelligence agency, was projected on the wall. Several icons represented the various streams of data that could potentially be acquired by gaining control of the target\u2019s computer: images from built-in cameras, sound from built-in mikes, screenshots, detailed records of applications opened and bitcoins transferred, a continuous log of location with latitude and longitude, and logs of address books, calendars, phone calls, Skype calls and passwords, as well as websites visited. A key logger recorded every key that was pressed. It was a lot to keep track of. Two other views, called \u201cline of events\u201d and \u201cline of actions,\u201d assembled the information into chronological order.Scarafile, who was playing both the customer and the target, or \u201cbad guy,\u201d turned on the Dell. Judging by the background on the desktop, a gothic scene framed by castlelike silhouettes, our target seemed to be planning a terrorist attack from Transylvania.Whatever the method of infection, the malicious code, known as an \u201cagent,\u201d then communicates with its masters anonymously, its dispatches routed through a series of dedicated servers scattered around the world. Even if the target gets suspicious and figures out that something is wrong, this chain of servers makes it nearly impossible for him to figure out exactly who is using Hacking Team\u2019s product to spy on him.For the demo, Scarafile opted for the third method, which he referred to as \u201ca bit of social engineering.\u201d Using the customer\u2019s computer, he sent the target an email with a Word file attached. Then he returned to the target\u2019s computer and double-clicked on it, just as Lagunes had clicked on the link in her inbox. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d he said, \u201cthis system is currently infected, or monitored, by the Remote Control System.\u201d It would remain so even if the suspect turned off his machine or logged out.On the timeline, the target appeared as a stubbly lout in an undershirt, named \u201cJimmy Page ... head of the terrorist cell.\u201d Using Jimmy Page\u2019s Dell, Scarafile logged into Page\u2019s Gmail, Facebook and Twitter. He opened up Skype, perused Page\u2019s criminal colleagues (Don Corleone, Harry Potter, Keyser Soze) and left one of them a voice mail message from Page\u2019s phone. Accessing a USB drive attached to the infected computer, Scarafile opened an encrypted file that turned out to contain an order to \u201ckill David Vincenzetti.\u201d R.C.S. captured it all, including periodic snapshots of Scarafile, as Page, at work.\u201cI don\u2019t like the words \u2018inject\u2019 and \u2018infect,\u2019\u2009\u201d Vinci, the vice president, said. \u201cR.C.S. is deploying the agent into the device of the target because you want to monitor some of his activities. Exactly the way that law enforcement is listening to some of your phone calls, right?\u201d\u201cI think the Iran deal is just terrible,\u201d Vincenzetti said, and then added, sarcastically, \u201cOh, it\u2019s such a very peaceful expansion. Very peaceful.\u201d\u201cThat is not an official company position,\u201d Rabe interjected.Vincenzetti, now 48, is a familiar type \u2014 a ferociously competitive, driven entrepreneur whose existence is organized around his work. He has a wife, who was born in Morocco, and no children. His small, heavy-lidded eyes can make him seem sleepily blas\u00e9. On the morning we met at Hacking Team\u2019s offices, he wore jeans, a navy-blue cardigan and a striped shirt, unbuttoned to midchest. He seemed more comfortable on his feet than sitting down. As we talked in a conference room, he periodically leapt to his feet and stalked around the table, considering in turn the espresso machine, the view from the window, a case of bottled water.\u201cIf I wanted to break into this room, how would I do it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere is a door, and there are two windows.\u201d He pressed his hands against the glass panes. \u201cThe perimeter is the first thing you must secure,\u201d he continued. Securing data was what he did earlier in his career. Now he had moved on. \u201cIf you cannot break into a bank, you cannot protect a bank. So when you are in security, really there is no difference between thinking offensively and defensively.\u201dIn the mid-1980s, Vincenzetti\u2019s parents, a salesman and a schoolteacher, bought him a Commodore 64, one of the earliest personal computers. He soon created a Pac-Man clone, a Tron lightcycle-style game and a text-based adventure game. As a computer-science student at the University of Milan in the \u201990s, he became fascinated by cryptography; he corresponded with programmers around the world about new cryptographic theories and wrote code for email encryption. In his senior year, he was appointed to administer the university\u2019s internal network, a post that was usually reserved for a graduate student. Vincenzetti remembers these early days as a time when \u201ceverything was free and no one was trying to harm you. We were wide open and accessible. All the best were called hackers, and I was a hacker.\u201dVincenzetti left university early and founded three companies, all of them focused on defensive cybersecurity. After he founded Hacking Team in 2003, he tried to sell his services to Italian police agencies but found them skeptical that Mafiosi and other high-level criminals would ever bother to encrypt their communications. In Italy, the police were also used to getting whatever they needed through wiretaps, arranged with varying degrees of formality through their contacts at telecommunications firms. But after the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which were coordinated via cellphones and the internet, police officers and intelligence agents not just in Italy but all across Europe became interested in contracting with offensive-hacking vendors, part of an emerging arms race over consumer-grade encryption. The growth of Skype made it easy for users to encrypt their communications, and the authorities were eager to pay for countermeasures like the Remote Control System. Singapore, Hacking Team\u2019s first non-European client, signed on in 2008. The company\u2019s Middle Eastern business took off in 2011, a boom that coincided with the beginning of the Arab Spring.All Hacking Team customers sign contracts agreeing to comply with local laws. The company says that it vets potential customers and studies reports from journalists and human-rights groups, looking for \u201cobjective evidence or credible concerns\u201d that its products are being abused. But when it comes to Hacking Team\u2019s own interactions with customers, leaked documents suggest that employees have sometimes turned a blind eye. In the case of the Puebla government and other Latin American customers, Hacking Team employees appeared to ignore warnings suggesting that the Remote Control System was being used to gather intelligence on the political opposition. On multiple occasions, customers emailed Hacking Team attachments with election-related content, including polling data, party registration forms and invitations addressed to and signed by elected officials. Rather than ask what these files had to do with fighting crime and drug trafficking, Hacking Team support-staff members simply emailed them back, as requested, with an embedded \u201cexploit,\u201d turning the document into a surveillance tool to be used against whomever it was sent on to. Asked about these cases, Rabe replied that customers \u201care not supposed to be using it for political purposes, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that an Italian computer programmer,\u201d i.e., a support technician, \u201cwould have seen these files and known what was going on. ... I think that\u2019s a stretch, that an Italian software guy could know that an individual is a dissident.\u201dShortly thereafter, R3D published three invoices from the Hacked Team cache showing that one state government \u2014 that of Jalisco, on the Pacific Coast \u2014 had paid the company nearly half a million euros for the Remote Control System. Soon other documents were found in the leak to implicate several more states, including Puebla, though most of the states denied ever using the software. (Jalisco later admitted to purchasing the system, which it claimed was for its prosecutor\u2019s office.) The story failed to get much traction in the Mexican press, except in Puebla, after R3D connected with Lado B, a small online-news collective there. The site\u2019s name translates to \u201cB Side,\u201d as in the back of a hit single \u2014 symbolizing its dedication to telling stories that would otherwise go untold.Lado B\u2019s editor, Ernesto Aroche, was not surprised that Puebla\u2019s government had been using the Remote Control System. In Moreno Valle\u2019s six years as governor there, he has spent lavishly on new surveillance systems, including multiple \u201csecurity arches,\u201d highway-spanning structures that scrutinize traffic with video cameras and X-rays, and whose cost had raised some questions in the local press. Beginning in 2013, Aroche began noticing solicitations on the Puebla-state website for hidden cameras and other spying equipment. When he filed a public-records request about them, the government\u2019s form response indicated that these orders had never been filled, but Aroche was skeptical, given the mounting evidence that Moreno Valle\u2019s administration had begun using its security apparatus for political purposes. There were periodic break-ins of homes belonging to dissident politicians and journalists, with the burglars sometimes taking little besides their victims\u2019 laptops. Politicians would answer calls from unknown numbers, only to hear their own taped conversations played back to them. Another journalist, Fernando Maldonado, received an unmarked envelope full of what were purportedly transcripts of 400 private phone calls made by Puebla politicians.As Aroche and R3D sifted through the Hacked Team file dump, they discovered that the files on Puebla had more detail than those dealing with Hacking Team\u2019s other Mexican accounts. The Puebla client often wrote emails asking for help with infecting a particular document with a malicious virus. Some of these came from an account \u2014 soporteuiamx@gmail.com \u2014 that also appears in many of Hacking Team\u2019s internal support tickets. One of those tickets documents a client\u2019s request for help in infecting an attachment: an invitation to attend an event for a Mexican political organization, signed by Violeta Lagunes and addressed to another party colleague opposed to the governor.Aroche interviewed politicians and journalists who were on the receiving end of the infected emails contained in the Hacked Team trove. According to a 2015 article that Lado B published in conjunction with a politics website, the Puebla group sent Hacking Team at least 47 requests to infect specific files that it would then forward on to their targets. Almost all of those files had to do with political issues. Going through the Hacked Team materials, Aroche found the name of a Puebla government employee who seemed to be working within the spying operation. \u201cBefore, we had been talking about ghosts,\u201d Aroche told me. \u201cNow, we could prove it. We started putting names on the actors.\u201dMore than a year later, there have been no political repercussions for the governor or his allies in Puebla. I met Aroche this fall at the Lado B offices, a small room facing a courtyard in a crumbling stone building from Puebla\u2019s colonial days. The only suggestion of Lado B\u2019s presence was a small sticker on the window. Inside, Aroche was thumbing through an envelope of documents that he had wrung out of the state government. Two redacted contracts signed by Puebla officials showed an arrangement between the state government and a company called Sym Servicios Integrales, which Aroche\u2019s reporting had identified as an intermediary for Hacking Team. The details of what had been purchased were redacted. \u201cThese contracts demonstrate that the Puebla government had a commercial relationship with this company,\u201d Aroche said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if they\u2019re a little bit stained \u2014 I dropped some coffee on them.\u201d (Sym Servicios Integrales says it \u201cnever sold H.T. technology to the state of Puebla.\u201d)In a brief written statement from Sagrario Conde Valerio, a spokeswoman, the government of Puebla denied allegations of spying and claimed that \u201cno relationship exists nor has ever existed between the government of Puebla and the company \u2018Hacking Team.\u2019\u2009\u201d The government declined to respond further to a list of questions.But a former official from Moreno Valle\u2019s administration claimed to me that more than $1 million was being diverted from the state budget each year to fund the political-espionage unit. Documents from the Hacked Team archive indicate that Hacking Team received an order from the government of Puebla for 415,000 euros in the spring of 2013, and that Hacking Team booked hotel rooms for three of its associates who traveled to Puebla in May of that year.Some of the R.C.S. training, I was told, took place in a green building on a residential street. When I visited the purported site this fall, lettering above the door said that the building was once a school. Now it had bars across the door and mirrored windows. Neighbors told me it had been abandoned for several months. \u201cPeople would come and go,\u201d one woman said. \u201cThey were very secretive. They would drop off equipment, take away equipment. Then one day, about a year ago, they came and took everything away and left.\u201d Another neighbor said that he often saw a state-police car parked in front of the house and a man with a limp entering and leaving \u2014 a former Mexican intelligence agent, according to someone who was present during the Hacking Team training.Mexico is Hacking Team\u2019s biggest export market, accounting for nearly six million euros in sales, according to leaked documents. Ostensibly, the Remote Control System is intended for fighting criminals and drug traffickers there. (\u201cThere have been reports that the software was used in the apprehension of Chapo Guzman,\u201d Rabe told me, referring to the Mexican drug lord. \u201cI can\u2019t confirm it.\u201d) The files indicate that at least seven other Mexican state governments were Hacking Team clients, but because they did not use email to the same extent as Puebla, their activities are harder to track. Multiple former Hacking Team employees told me that abuses of the software were not limited to Puebla. One former employee described having the system set up inside a mayor\u2019s office.Katitza Rodr\u00edguez, international-rights director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Mexican law allows for interception of communication, like the wiretapping of phone lines, but it does not grant precise legal authority to use new, powerful invasive tools like those created by Hacking Team. And she argues that it is much more dangerous in Mexico than in other Western countries, where checks and balances are stronger. \u201cThis is much more intrusive than the interception of a phone call,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are not only listening; they are taking over your laptop. Mexico needs to have a full debate in Congress about what legal safeguards are needed for this kind of surveillance or if the government should be using it at all.\u201dAmerican expansion by companies like Hacking Team may not face much resistance from the federal government, which is becoming more accepting of electronic surveillance as part of normal police work. Last year, the Justice Department successfully changed the rules of criminal procedure, making it easier for federal agents to hack into multiple computers with a single warrant. Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who tried to block the change, complained that it gives \u201cunlimited power for unlimited hacking.\u201d In a 2014 address, now referred to in cybersecurity circles as his \u201cGoing Dark\u201d speech, the F.B.I.\u2019s director, James Comey, argued that the encryption built into Apple products posed a threat to public safety \u2014 enabling not only terrorism but also drug trafficking, child abuse and hit-and-runs. Instead of \u201ca safe that can\u2019t be cracked,\u201d Comey wanted technology companies to lend him the combination. \u201cThe law hasn\u2019t kept pace with technology, and this disconnect has created a significant public-safety problem,\u201d Comey said. \u201cWe call it \u2018going dark.\u2019\u2009\u201dAs the United States government has argued for weaker protections around personal communications, American businesses have been spreading more powerful surveillance tools around the world. Many foreign law-enforcement agencies already buy electronic-surveillance products from SS8 \u2014 a company backed by the storied venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers \u2014 as well as from the Harris Corporation, a $13 billion company based in Florida and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. At least 25 American police departments have used Harris\u2019s Stingray device, which mimics cellphone towers and can intercept cellphone calls within 200 meters. All known sales of Stingrays to local law enforcement have been authorized by the F.B.I., which has since fought in court to keep those sales secret. In Baltimore alone, Stingrays have been used more than 4,000 times, in routine drug investigations. Much less is known about another Harris product, the advanced Hailstorm, which is also sold to local police departments. Hailstorm is reportedly capable of implanting malware that can take control of a targeted phone, much like Hacking Team\u2019s R.C.S.The Hacked Team documents that offer the most revealing view of the company\u2019s ethos happen to be the most public ones. For years, as often as two or three times a day, Vincenzetti sent mass emails to hundreds of his business contacts. The recipients included numerous members of the United States military and intelligence community, as well as government employees from the city of Cincinnati and the Internal Revenue Service. In these messages, Vincenzetti often addresses this audience collectively as \u201cgents.\u201d The news he cites is a reminder of how the geopolitical winds have been blowing in favor of Hacking Team and other self-described allies of law and order. In Vincenzetti\u2019s world, the system is always, as George Tenet famously said about pre-Sept. 11 intelligence, \u201cblinking red\u201d: the imploding Middle East; a restive, nuclear-armed Russia; battalions of ISIS-trained jihadis roaming around Europe with their encrypted thumb drives and dark-web expertise. Against this backdrop of ever-increasing danger, concerns about human rights are na\u00efve at best.Vincenzetti\u2019s emails vividly exploit this sense of danger and alarm. He writes about shadowy gangs of Iranian hackers using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag to inject malware into French laptops. He celebrates the conviction of Ross Ulbricht, a.k.a. the Dread Pirate Roberts, creator of the Silk Road website. After the arrests of two Uzbek men in Brooklyn for telling informants that they wanted to join up with ISIS, Vincenzetti writes of \u201ca very serious terrorist plot on American soil foiled.\u201dHe went on to tap out this sales pitch:The time has come for a technologically MORE SOPHISTICATED, and much more effective, internet supervision ... something capable to penetrate the core of the terrorists\u2019 HIDDEN forums. And such a (quite unique) technology EXISTS.The following day, he gave a few more hints:I am talking about a NEW technology capable of neutralizing their encryption-based protective layers in order to track them, identify them, locate them, chase them and finally bust them. Something operating on a massive scale. Something different. I am talking about a novel, superior, next-generation mass-surveillance technology.The tone of Vincenzetti\u2019s sales patter was strangely upbeat, especially considering his dire forecasts. It was almost as if he were in the business of selling microwave ovens or sandwiches, not tools through which the private lives of criminals (and whoever else) could be fully laid bare.Vincenzetti\u2019s unstated equation \u2014 privacy is secrecy, and secrecy is terrorism \u2014 is less controversial than it might appear. A supportive echo can be heard in many public statements from American officials, which Vincenzetti often cut and pasted into his mass emails. The former attorney general Eric Holder called for \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial tools that allow us to be pre-emptive.\u201d When Comey warned that \u201cencryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place,\u201d Vincenzetti forwarded it along approvingly, with the tagline: \u201cWe DO have an answer to many if not all of his concerns.\u201d And when, in May 2015, Comey warned of a \u201cthreat\u201d that had \u201cmorphed\u201d into \u201ca chaotic spider web,\u201d Vincenzetti sent word to his \u201cgents\u201d as well.One month later, an anonymous hack revealed Hacking Team\u2019s own invisible spider web, and one year later, during the run-up to Election Day, came the internal emails of the Democratic Party. By then it was clear that tools for digital burglary had spread well beyond the hands of regular police officers. Comey had argued for weaker safes; Vincenzetti was selling longer crowbars. They could be used to chase Jimmy Page, arrest Chapo Guzman, fight crime, smear a political opponent or just keep tabs on someone, anyone. To be hidden is to be a terrorist \u2014 this was the heart of his pitch. Any digital redoubt that could resist being pried open was a public risk and a private opportunity.An article on Jan. 8 about surveillance software erroneously included one company among those that sell so-called ethical malware. The Israeli company Nice no longer sells such software; it sold its intelligence division in May 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rangers\u2019 Pavel Buchnevich, Rookie From Russia, Settles In", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byThe throng of reporters, photographers and team officials who flock to the Rangers\u2019 locker room at Madison Square Garden after a game will include, at least for now, a member of the game-day staff named Kristina Piseeva, equipped with a notebook and pencil.Piseeva has been hired, in part, to serve as an interpreter for Pavel Buchnevich, a rangy and powerful 21-year-old forward from Cherepovets, Russia, who is in his first N.H.L. season. The Rangers did the same thing for Alex Kovalev, then 19, when he arrived from Russia in 1992.Upon request, Piseeva will summon Buchnevich, ask him to sit at his stall and translate questions from English to Russian and answers from Russian to English. For example, Buchnevich was asked recently what it was like to live in the United States for the first time.\u201cYou always have to rush, rush, rush,\u201d Buchnevich said through Piseeva. \u201cYou always have to be in a hurry.\u201dThis is apparently true for Buchnevich in more ways than one. Besides learning to adapt to a style of play that puts much more emphasis on defense, Buchnevich is determined to complete a crash course on blending in with his new team and a new culture.For instance, Buchnevich asked to live with an English-speaking family in Connecticut last summer when he trained with Ben Prentiss, the Rangers\u2019 strength and conditioning coach.John Rosasco, the team\u2019s public-relations director, said Buchnevich, who is the youngest player on the Rangers and the only Russian, had often used Google Translate on his phone to help him find the right English words. Buchnevich also likes to hang out on the road with two rookie teammates, both of them Americans \u2014 defenseman Brady Skjei, from Minnesota, and forward Jimmy Vesey, from Massachusetts.\u201cIt\u2019s still kind of funny sometimes when he tries to say stuff,\u201d Vesey said. \u201cHe\u2019s a funny kid, and his broken English makes him even funnier. But he\u2019s done really well. I couldn\u2019t imagine being in his position with not much English, and he\u2019s settled in nice.\u201dBuchnevich, who is 6 feet 2 inches and 193 pounds, was the Rangers\u2019 third-round pick in the 2013 N.H.L. entry draft but played the last three seasons for Severstal Cherepovets and SKA St. Petersburg in the Kontinental Hockey League, scoring 36 goals in 146 games.He made the Rangers\u2019 opening-night roster this season but played only two games before he injured his back. He returned after a five-game absence to score four goals in eight games before reinjuring himself and sitting out for two months.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time for me not playing for such a long time,\u201d Buchnevich said through Piseeva. \u201cOf course it was tough because I want to help out my team. I did not really see my team. I was training. I was going through the therapy.\u201dEven before Buchnevich\u2019s return to the Rangers, though, his talent had already become apparent to Coach Alain Vigneault.\u201cHe\u2019s a player who wants to make plays with the puck,\u201d Vigneault said. \u201cHe\u2019s good at seeing the ice and finding his teammates.\u201dVigneault said he thought that Buchnevich had initially been a little too unselfish. \u201cBut there\u2019s no doubt that the skill level is really good,\u201d Vigneault said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good young player there who we\u2019ve got to mold into a pro, and he\u2019s going through the process right now, and he\u2019s going to get better.\u201dAnother observation Vigneault made about Buchnevich: His English is better than you think.\u201cThe only time he doesn\u2019t want to understand is when sometimes I\u2019m telling him, \u2018There are things I want you to \u2026\u2019 and he\u2019s like: \u2018Eh? Eh?\u2019\u201d Vigneault said playfully. \u201cHe understands everything. Everything.\u201dThe Rangers\u2019 captain, Ryan McDonagh, offered his own assessment of Buchnevich\u2019s communication skills.\u201cI\u2019d heard his English wasn\u2019t very good, but I was pretty surprised,\u201d McDonagh said. \u201cHe can hold a conversation, and he\u2019s picked up on things pretty well. Systems-wise, it\u2019s pretty easy to talk to him about that.\u201dBefore and after he was injured, Buchnevich was assigned to a forward line that included left wing Rick Nash and center Mika Zibanejad, who was acquired in the off-season from Ottawa and has had an injury of his own this season \u2014 a broken leg sustained in November that caused him to miss 25 games.However, Buchnevich and Zibanejad were back in the lineup together for a Jan. 17 game against Dallas at Madison Square Garden, combining for three goals and two assists in a wild 7-6 loss. Buchnevich then scored again in a 5-2 victory over Toronto on Thursday.\u201cI try to keep it as simple as I can, as far as English goes,\u201d said Zibanejad, a Swede who is fluent in English but speaks no Russian. \u201cI do a lot of pointing, a lot of showing on the board on the bench. He\u2019s smart enough to figure that out, putting it in a way where he understands it.\u201dThe hardest part, Zibanejad said, has been communicating quickly with Buchnevich on audibles off face-offs during games, but Zibanejad said they had made progress since the start of the season. Zibanejad now sees benefits to the steeper learning curve for Buchnevich.\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of good that he doesn\u2019t have a Russian friend here because he would kind of have escaped to that,\u201d Zibanejad said. \u201cHere, he\u2019s forced to talk English, and I think people are willing to help him out. It\u2019s a good opportunity for all of us.\u201dBuchnevich is not quite ready to get rid of Piseeva as his translator. He said through Piseeva that he had been to Brooklyn but had yet to visit the Brighton Beach neighborhood and its Russian shops and restaurants. As comfortable as that experience might be, he wants to extend his boundaries rather than look for familiarity.\u201cHe\u2019s come a long way,\u201d Skjei said. \u201cAnd he keeps getting better and better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Davos Brings the Global Elite Together", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byHeads of state, captains of industry, prominent academics, philanthropists and a retinue of journalists, celebrities and hangers-on will descend Tuesday on Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum.For most of the year, Davos is a resort town high in the Swiss Alps with a population of just 11,000. But for two weeks each January, the town\u2019s population swells to 30,000 as the global elite meet for a series of meetings and discussions about \u201centrepreneurship in the global public interest,\u201d in what could be described as world\u2019s most expensive networking event.Beyond the events on the conference\u2019s official calendar are an even more exclusive series of parties, dinners and outings.Founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a German economics professor, the European Economic Forum began as a conference for European business leaders to discuss catching up with American management processes. Two years later, the conference had shifted its focus to global economic and social issues, and the first political leaders were invited to attend.In 1987 the organization was renamed the World Economic Forum, and its annual conference was well enough known to be referred to simply as Davos. The conference has been the site of several historic meetings, including two in 1989: the first ministerial-level meeting between North and South Korea, and another between the leaders of East and West Germany.As the prestige of the conference grew, more politicians, thought leaders and celebrities began attending the event.More than 2,500 people will attend this year\u2019s conference from 90 different countries. Most of the participants are corporate executives, but more than two dozen heads of state and government are expected to attend.Theresa May, the prime minister of Britain, and Xi Jinping, president of China, are attending the conference for the first time this year. Mr. Xi is the first Chinese president to attend the event.But even world leaders are often seen craning their heads for a glimpse at the boldfaced names in attendance. The singer Shakira and the actor Forest Whitaker are to receive awards this year. Expected attendees include Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook; the actor and activist Matt Damon; the Formula One driver Nico Rosberg; and Jack Ma, the Chinese billionaire and founder of Alibaba.Though gender equality is often discussed at the forum, just 17 percent of last year\u2019s participants were women, according to the forum.All of those dignitaries need security. During the conference, Davos transforms into a veritable fortress. Roadblocks restrict traffic on the city\u2019s main streets and checkpoints spring up outside each venue. At the Congress Center, where the main panels take place, and at each hotel that hosts parties and talks, attendees pass metal detectors, armed guards and beneath the watchful eyes of sharpshooters.In the past, the conference was targeted by protesters associated with the anticapitalist Occupy movement. In 2013, members of the Ukrainian activist group Femen were arrested after a topless demonstration.The Swiss government estimated it will spend 8 million Swiss francs, about $8 million, on security, but said that number could increase if there were a credible threat to the conference.\u201cSwitzerland is still not regarded as a priority target for jihadist terrorists,\u201d the Federal Council said on its website. \u201cOn the other hand, even on Swiss soil, the interests of states participating in the military coalition against the so-called Islamic State face an increased threat.\u201dThe annual meeting runs on a tiered system of colored badges denoting just how important one is, or is not. White badges are for attendees able to attend any official event and make full use of the forum\u2019s facilities. Orange badges are reserved for the 500 journalists who cover the forum, but are not allowed at some parties. Other badges, like purple ones, denote technical or support staff and limit their holders to a few areas.If that system were not complicated enough, local hotels like the Belvedere and the InterContinental often sell their own badges to the bankers and consultants who descend upon Davos \u2014 but not the forum itself \u2014 to strike deals and chat up clients. These souls camp out at the hotels, renting rooms for business meetings by day and soiree hopping at night.Most of the events center on talking. But beyond lectures and panel discussions, the agenda also features more esoteric attractions. One notable event is a simulation of a refugee\u2019s experience, where Davos attendees crawl on their hands and knees and pretend to flee from advancing armies.It is one of the most popular events every year.The theme of this year\u2019s conference is \u201cResponsive and Responsible Leadership.\u201d But attendees like to play as hard as they work.There are several official cocktail receptions, but the action really lies in a galaxy of events hosted by corporations. Some are small, intimate dinners that feature the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio and Bono.Others are dazzling affairs: JPMorgan Chase, for example, has previously taken over the Kirchner Museum Davos for drinks with its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister.Google\u2019s annual party at the InterContinental Hotel has become the hottest ticket in town. The investor Anthony Scaramucci, now an adviser to Donald J. Trump, for years has hosted a reception at the famed Hotel Europe featuring a sometimes eye-popping list of high-end Champagne and Bordeaux red wine.A more recent up-and-comer is hosted by Salesforce.com, a business software maker, whose chief, Marc Benioff, is one of the forum\u2019s most ardent boosters. Last year\u2019s Salesforce party included Mr. Benioff flying in scores of fresh flower leis and a band from Hawaii, as Eric Schmidt of Google and other tech notables danced in a corner.Several years ago, Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame, hosted an over-the-top gathering that featured stuffed animal heads shooting laser beams out of their eyes. And the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska has thrown opulent gatherings at a nearby villa where the Champagne flowed freelyFor a nightcap, the Davos crowd traditionally retires to the Tonic Bar at Hotel Europe, sipping cocktails while the forum fixture Barry Colson leads the crowd in Billy Joel singalongs.Michael J. de la Merced reported from San Francisco, and Russell Goldman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg, in Suit, Testifies in Oculus Intellectual Property Trial", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byDALLAS \u2014 A few years ago, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook and one of tech\u2019s shrewdest seers, made a huge bet on a new technology, virtual reality, buying Oculus VR, one of the most prominent start-ups in the industry, for more than $2 billion.That frank assessment came from Mr. Zuckerberg on Tuesday in a federal courtroom of all places, where Facebook is tangling with a games publisher that has accused Oculus of stealing technology that went into the creation of the Oculus virtual reality headset. The trial offered a window into how Mr. Zuckerberg views the progress of one of his biggest bets, and a glimpse of Facebook\u2019s approach to making deals in Silicon Valley.\u201cI don\u2019t think that good virtual reality is fully there yet,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, who wore a suit and tie while testifying, instead of his regular uniform, a T-shirt and jeans. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take five or 10 more years of development before we get to where we all want to go.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg spoke during a court appearance, in which he was questioned about the Oculus deal. He denied accusations that Oculus had taken technology it did not own, and said he had never before testified in a courtroom.While fights over ownership of prominent technologies are common, this one defied some predictions by reaching a jury trial, which started in a federal court here in early January.\u201cWe are highly confident that Oculus products are built on Oculus technology,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cThe idea that Oculus products are based on someone else\u2019s technology is just wrong.\u201dFacebook could face as much as $2 billion in damages if it loses the suit. While there is still excitement throughout the technology industry over virtual reality, most headsets, including those from Oculus, are not selling in big numbers because of high prices and limited content for them.On Tuesday, a lawyer representing Oculus and Facebook asked Mr. Zuckerberg whether he had realized his goal of creating a new computing platform. \u201cThese things end up being more complex than you think up front,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf anything, we may have to invest even more money to get to the goals we had than we had thought up front.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg added that Facebook probably will have to invest more than $3 billion in the next decade to reach its goal of providing hundreds of millions of people with a good virtual reality experience.Later, a Facebook spokeswoman said that nothing had changed about the company\u2019s commitment to virtual reality. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said for years, VR is the next computing platform, and Facebook\u2019s Oculus team is leading the way,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Tera Randall.The core of ZeniMax\u2019s case is that one of its former employees, John Carmack, shared ZeniMax virtual reality technology with Palmer Luckey, a founder of Oculus, during the company\u2019s early days, technology for which ZeniMax was never compensated. Mr. Carmack, a game industry stalwart behind games like Doom, later joined Oculus.A lawyer for ZeniMax used some of his time questioning Mr. Zuckerberg to bolster the company\u2019s argument that Facebook rushed through its review of Oculus when buying it, overlooking details about its dispute with ZeniMax.In response to questioning from the lawyer for Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg said that the company spends weeks, months or even years thinking about the issues that lead it to make acquisitions. He said Facebook \u2014 which has also acquired Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 believes that negotiating deals quickly is important in an environment where it is often competing with companies like Google, Apple and Twitter.\u201cBeing able to move quickly not only increases our chance of getting the deal done, but it keeps us from having to pay a lot more as the deal process drives out,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.For companies that waffle about selling out to Facebook, the social network is willing to deploy fear as a tactic. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to help convince people that they want to join you, helping them understand all the pain they would have to go through is a valuable tactic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s a little less of what I tend to focus on.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said that Mr. Iribe was originally asking for $4 billion for Oculus. He settled for $2 billion, though Facebook also agreed to $700 million more in compensation to retain important Oculus team members and $300 million in pay for hitting certain milestones. Facebook\u2019s code name for the Oculus deal was Inception.Unlike Facebook, ZeniMax is not household name, but many of the games it publishes, including Fallout and Elder Scrolls, have a passionate following. It also has a board of directors stacked with famous names, including the Hall of Fame baseball player Cal Ripken Jr., the director Jerry Bruckheimer, CBS chief Leslie Moonves, and Donald J. Trump\u2019s brother Robert.A lawyer for ZeniMax asked Mr. Zuckerberg about his reaction to ZeniMax\u2019s lawsuit, which was filed not long after Facebook publicly announced its intention to buy Oculus.\u201cIt is pretty common when you announce a big deal or do something that all kinds of people just kind of come out of the woodwork and claim that they just own some portion of the deal,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cLike most people in the court, I\u2019ve never even heard of ZeniMax before.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google, in Post-Obama Era, Aggressively Woos Republicans", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Few companies have been as intimately tied to the Democratic Party in recent years as Google. So now that Donald J. Trump is president, the giant company, in Silicon Valley parlance, is having to pivot.The shift was evident a day after Congress began its new session this month. That evening, about 70 lawmakers, a majority of them Republicans, were feted at the stately Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building, where they clinked champagne and bourbon glasses and posed for selfies with the 600 guests assembled in their honor.The event\u2019s main host was not from the Republican establishment. Instead, the party was primarily financed and anchored by Google.Now, the tech giant is scrambling to forge ties with Mr. Trump\u2019s new administration and to strengthen its relationship with a Republican-dominated Congress. Most important, Google is trying to change the perception that it is a Democratic stronghold.\u201cGoogle has a target on its back because it is fundamentally viewed as a Democratic company,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser to Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. \u201cEven though it has reached out to Republicans, it can\u2019t shake the image.\u201dGoogle said it had long had Republican lobbyists and had not changed its strategy.\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with both Republicans and Democrats for over a decade, advocating policies to encourage economic growth, innovation and entrepreneurialism,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to do exactly that.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Schmidt added, \u201cEric has a long record of working constructively and energetically on important technology issues with American and world leaders across the political spectrum.\u201dOther Silicon Valley tech companies, like Facebook, are in a similar predicament. The perception is that they lean left and their executives backed Mrs. Clinton. Many are now also pledging to work with Mr. Trump and paid court to the new president at a December tech summit meeting.One week into the administration, Google and other tech companies began to push back, criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration bans. The company said an estimated 187 employees were affected by the order and it urged any of those employees who were abroad to work with the company to return safely to the United States.\u201dIt\u2019s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in a memo to employees over the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ve always made our views on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.\u201dNow warning shots against Google have been fired by those in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle. Some of the president\u2019s advisers have debated whether the tech behemoth deserves more antitrust scrutiny, according to two people briefed by the new administration\u2019s transition team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Mr. Trump\u2019s team is particularly wary of one Google executive \u2014 Mr. Schmidt \u2014 who has been allied with Democrats. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Mr. Schmidt counseled Mrs. Clinton on strategy. A photo of him wearing a staff badge at her election-night party circulated widely in the conservative media.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, including his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, have complained about Mr. Schmidt\u2019s funding of a start-up called the Groundwork, which provided data and other technology for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. They also suspected Google was skewing search results in favor of Mrs. Clinton, said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201cMr. Schmidt spent millions and millions of his personal money to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cIt takes a particular amount of gumption to pretend that never happened.\u201dFor many years, Google\u2019s support of Democrats was plain. Google\u2019s political action committee and employees ranked third in all donations to Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign at $804,240, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2008, Google\u2019s PAC and employees were sixth with $817,855. The company did not rank in the top 20 for donations to Mr. Obama\u2019s Republican opponents in either of those elections.About five years ago, Google began diversifying its bets. The company forged ties with the Republican-dominated House of Representatives and started addressing the beginning of an antitrust investigation into whether the company was using its search dominance to suppress competing travel, map and restaurant sites.During his presidency, Mr. Obama also repeatedly supported proposals backed by Google, including net neutrality in 2015 and cable set-top box reforms last year.\u201cGoogle was very much treated as the golden child by the Obama administration,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, which has been critical of Google for privacy policies.At the party, several Republican lawmakers were positive about their tech host, brushing off questions about the company\u2019s heft and power.\u201cWhen I think of technology and Google, I don\u2019t think of dominance,\u201d said Representative Bradley Byrne, a Republican from Alabama. \u201cI think of innovation.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from Washington and Dai Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "What to Know About CES 2017", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byTo average people, the name of the International CES, formerly known as the International Consumer Electronics Show \u2014 one of the largest tech conventions, taking place in Las Vegas this week \u2014 will seem dated, if not highly misleading.Tech companies often use the annual trade show as a marketing mechanism to bombard people with news about products that will have little, if any, impact on consumers. And the word \u201celectronics\u201d is awkward in an era when tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook are focusing innovations on areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Yet there are a few product categories worth following this week: high-definition television sets, smart-home accessories and drones. Here is a briefing on things you might want to know as the show unspools this week.But this week, CES will make it clear that buying a 4K television set finally makes sense. TV makers will announce a host of improvements to 4K features, including color technologies like high dynamic range, a software feature that enhances the contrast and color profile of a picture, and wide color gamut, a technology that shows a wider range of colors. Some TV manufacturers, like LG, will introduce TVs that are only a few millimeters thick and easily mountable on a wall. Toward the holiday season, prices on many high-quality TVs with these features will probably drop significantly, as they have in previous years, to roughly $800 to $1,300. In addition, there are now many devices capable of playing 4K content, including 4K Blu-ray players, Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 Pro console and Roku\u2019s higher-end streaming devices.For consumers, voice assistants have broken down the complexity of interacting with smart-home devices, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst for Creative Strategies, which was among the first market research firms in Silicon Valley. (It\u2019s easy for anyone to say \u201cAlexa, turn on the lights.\u201d) And for companies that sell home accessories like locks and thermostats, it has never been easier to make a convenient smart-home product because the companies can now team up with the tech giants. \u201cNow there\u2019s an ecosystem to plug into and build support around, and I think that\u2019s going to help a lot,\u201d Mr. Bajarin said.What that means is that in the next year or two, shopping for a smart-home accessory will be as simple as looking up a type of product and finding one that matches up with your Apple, Google or Amazon device. That\u2019s a lot simpler than with older accessories, which required you to install extra hubs and download additional apps to work with your smartphone.\u201cWhen you go to Amazon.com or the Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s to buy a connected dead bolt from us, what you can expect from us is we want to make sure that lock is going to work with whatever platform you choose,\u201d said Rob Martens, a futurist at the lock company Schlage. Remember that annoying drone buzzing around and taking pictures of people at the beach? That problem is only going to get worse: Drones are getting cheaper, and lesser-known Chinese companies are increasingly getting into the drone business to drive prices down even further. Cheaper drones are expected to have a strong presence at C.E.S., and some popular drones representing well-known brands have already dipped in price. DJI\u2019s Phantom 4, for example, is now $999, down from about $1,400 last year. Mr. Bajarin of Creative Strategies said consumers should also expect to see drones made in China by lesser-known brands that cost as little as $600. Also in store, he said, are drones with smarter tracking abilities and extra photography angles, among other features.Advertisement"}
