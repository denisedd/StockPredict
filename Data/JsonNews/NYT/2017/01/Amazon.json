A white-haired Christian pastor greets his friend, a Muslim imam, and the two converse and laugh over a cup of tea, wincing about their creaky knees as they prepare to part ways. Later, it spurs the same idea in each for a gift: kneepads sent via Amazon Prime. (It is a commercial, after all.)The piano notes accelerate as the men open their deliveries with smiles, and then each uses the item to kneel in prayer: one at a church, the other at a mosque. The final chords fade.\u201cThis type of a project is definitely a first for us,\u201d said Rameez Abid, communications director for the social justice branch of the Islamic Circle of North America, one group Amazon worked with. \u201cThey were very aware that this was going to cause controversy and might get hate mail and things like that, but they said it\u2019s something that they wanted to do because the message is important.\u201d\u201cFor me as a Muslim woman, I represent something right now in the country that for some people incites fear,\u201d said Ms. Haydar, 28, who wears a hijab and hails from Flint, Mich. \u201cThis normalizes the narrative that we are just human beings.\u201d\u201cWith the kind of gay parent issue, we\u2019ve gotten a little closer to acceptance, but the Muslim issue in America is still pretty raw for a lot of people,\u201d said Kevin Brady, an executive creative director at the ad agency Droga5, which worked last year with Honey Maid on a commercial about white and Muslim-American neighbors. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be, but it\u2019s one that I think brands took an extra step of courage to really go out there with in 2016.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think diversity is a political statement,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an issue of universal humanity.\u201dFor its ad, Amazon was painstaking in its attention to detail, checking with religious groups about costuming and background imagery, and sending over final proofs of the ad for review, said Mr. Abid and Antonios Kireopoulos, an associate general secretary of the National Council of Churches, another group Amazon consulted.The response from her community was positive, she said. Such ads are \u201cencouraging for the younger generations, like those who are afraid to mention that they\u2019re Muslims,\u201d she added. \u201cMy daughters are more confident now, and I believe their friends who are Muslims, they know that we\u2019re accepted and we\u2019re loved.\u201dWith more Americans dwelling in siloed information bubbles, commercials have the potential to reach audiences with diverse viewpoints. Amazon said its ad had aired during programs including the \u201cToday\u201d show, \u201cEmpire\u201d and \u201cBlue Bloods,\u201d while Microsoft said its placements had included \u201cThe Voice,\u201d \u201cPitch\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d\u201cI imagine the violence will unfortunately continue, so it will take more vigilance on the part of community leaders and everyday believers to work together,\u201d he said.Ms. Haydar is hopeful about the potential.\u201cIn 10 years, this commercial might have lived on in the heart of some young kid who saw a Muslim woman in a commercial and didn\u2019t see the boogeyman in my face, and instead saw a normal human being,\u201d she said. \u201cThen if somebody says something about Muslims that\u2019s kind of crazy, maybe that kid can say, \u2018I saw this commercial, and she actually just seemed kind of normal.\u2019 You don\u2019t know what the reverberations look like.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Hands to Heads to Hearts", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported bySoftware has started writing poetry, sports stories and business news. IBM\u2019s Watson is co-writing pop hits. Uber has begun deploying self-driving taxis on real city streets and, last month, Amazon delivered its first package by drone to a customer in rural England.Add it all up and you quickly realize that Donald Trump\u2019s election isn\u2019t the only thing disrupting society today. The far more profound disruption is happening in the workplace and in the economy at large, as the relentless march of technology has brought us to a point where machines and software are not just outworking us but starting to outthink us in more and more realms.Once scientific methods became enshrined, we used science and reason to navigate our way forward, he added, so much so that \u201cthe French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes crystallized this age of reason in one phrase: \u2018I think, therefore I am.\u2019\u201d Descartes\u2019s point, said Seidman, \u201cwas that it was our ability to \u2018think\u2019 that most distinguished humans from all other animals on earth.\u201dThe technological revolution of the 21st century is as consequential as the scientific revolution, argued Seidman, and it is \u201cforcing us to answer a most profound question \u2014 one we\u2019ve never had to ask before: \u2018What does it mean to be human in the age of intelligent machines?\u2019\u201d\u201cIt will be all the things that the heart can do,\u201d he explained. \u201cHumans can love, they can have compassion, they can dream. While humans can act from fear and anger, and be harmful, at their most elevated, they can inspire and be virtuous. And while machines can reliably interoperate, humans, uniquely, can build deep relationships of trust.\u201dTherefore, Seidman added, our highest self-conception needs to be redefined from \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d to \u201cI care, therefore I am; I hope, therefore I am; I imagine, therefore I am. I am ethical, therefore I am. I have a purpose, therefore I am. I pause and reflect, therefore I am.\u201dWe will still need manual labor, and people will continue working with machines to do extraordinary things. Seidman is simply arguing that the tech revolution will force humans to create more value with hearts and between hearts. I agree. When machines and software control more and more of our lives, people will seek out more human-to-human connections \u2014 all the things you can\u2019t download but have to upload the old-fashioned way, one human to another.Seidman reminded me of a Talmudic adage: \u201cWhat comes from the heart, enters the heart.\u201d Which is why even jobs that still have a large technical component will benefit from more heart. I call these STEMpathy jobs \u2014 jobs that combine STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) skills with human empathy, like the doctor who can extract the best diagnosis from IBM\u2019s Watson on cancer and then best relate it to a patient.Economies get labeled according to the predominant way people create value, pointed out Seidman, also author of the book \u201cHow: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything.\u201d So, the industrial economy, he noted, \u201cwas about hired hands. The knowledge economy was about hired heads. The technology revolution is thrusting us into \u2018the human economy,\u2019 which will be more about creating value with hired hearts \u2014 all the attributes that can\u2019t be programmed into software, like passion, character and collaborative spirit.\u201dIt\u2019s no surprise that the French government began requiring French companies on Jan. 1 to guarantee their employees a \u201cright to disconnect\u201d from technology \u2014 when they are not at work \u2014 trying to combat the \u201calways on\u201d work culture.Leaders, businesses and communities will still leverage technology to gain advantage, but those that put human connection at the center of everything they do \u2014 and how they do it \u2014 will be the enduring winners, insisted Seidman: \u201cMachines can be programmed to do the next thing right. But only humans can do the next right thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Nearly 100 Dead in Prison Riots, Brazil\u2019s Government Faces Crisis", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazil\u2019s government is struggling to cope with overcrowded and violent prisons that have seen nearly 100 inmates killed within a week, with many beheaded and dismembered.This is one of the most serious crises that Michel Temer, the president of Brazil, has faced since assuming power last year after the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff.Critics have described the Temer administration\u2019s response as inadequate and called the refusal by all spheres of government to accept responsibility as \u201cabsurd.\u201d\u201cThis is a challenge to civilization,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mois\u00e9s, a professor of political science at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cIt was not a good response.\u201dAfter 56 prisoners were killed in a riot between rival drug gangs that began on Jan. 1 at the privately run An\u00edsio Jobim Penitentiary complex in Manaus in Amazonas state, followed by four killed the next day at a nearby jail, it took Mr. Temer three days to respond.He called it a \u201cterrible accident\u201d and said that because a private company ran the prison where the killings happened, the state bore no clear responsibility.His comments were widely ridiculed.\u201cThe majority saw the president\u2019s declaration as disdainful to the seriousness of the situation,\u201d The Sensationalist, a widely read satirical website, said.\u201cThe government treated this tragedy as if it was unforeseen. This is absurd,\u201d said Maria Laura Canineu, the director in Brazil of Human Rights Watch.Ms. Canineu pointed to a December 2015 report from the National Mechanism for the Prevention and Combat of Torture, a group of independent researchers linked to the Ministry of Justice, that described a potentially explosive situation at the An\u00edsio Jobim prison, where prisoners were scared they could be tortured and killed in a riot.Adding to the recent carnage, 33 died on Jan. 6 in a prison riot outside Boa Vista, in Roraima, north of Brazil.Police officers said two rival drug gangs, the First Capital Command and the Family of the North, are involved in a bloody war for control of lucrative Amazon drug smuggling routes and are behind the grisly murders in recent days.Murders and robberies have soared in the city of Manaus since the prison killings, said Gerson Feitosa, a police corporal and president of a local police association.\u201cPeople are scared,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the massacre, the war on the streets has started.\u201dAlexandre de Moraes, the minister of justice, released a draft of a National Plan of Public Security on Jan. 6. First announced in October, the proposal aims to reduce homicides, modernize the prison system and improve cooperation between security agencies and neighboring nations in the fight against cross-border organized crime.It includes building five new federal prisons for 220 dangerous prisoners, $248 million for states to build new jails and $94 million for cellphone blockers, body scanners and ankle bracelets.Robert Muggah, founder of the Igarap\u00e9 Institute in Rio de Janeiro, which specializes in public security and drug policy, said that the plan included welcoming innovations, like a target to reduce homicides by 7 percent a year, but that it was too focused on law and order.\u201cThe fight against drugs will fail if it\u2019s reduced to eradicating drug production and seizing drugs,\u201d Mr. Muggah said. Drug use and possession should be decriminalized, he said.Violence has been a problem for decades in Brazil\u2019s overcrowded prisons, where drug gangs rule and decapitations are common.And memories are still fresh in Brazil of the violence that terrorized S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s biggest city, in 2006, when fighting between the police and the First Capital Command gang killed almost 200 people.In addition to the criticism faced by the Temer administration, the Amazonas state government faces a number of serious accusations.A report by state prosecutors dated Jan. 4 requested that private prison contracts be rescinded because of the \u201clack of control of security and inefficient management.\u201dIn 2012, 3 percent of Brazilian inmates were in privately run prisons.Prosecutors said the state government paid Umanizzare, the company running An\u00edsio Jobim prison, around $1,458 a month for each prisoner, nearly twice the Brazilian average of $745 cited by the president of Brazil\u2019s top court, C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia, in November.The state government is also said to have negotiated peace in the state\u2019s prisons with the Family of the North in July 2015.An investigation that year by Brazil\u2019s Federal Police into the gang said that one of its jailed leaders met with a state government official and helped end the occupation of parts of two secure wings at another Manaus prison by the rival gang, the First Capital Command. The drug leader, in return, was promised he would not be transferred to a high-security federal prison.\u201cThe Northern Family came out strengthened from this regrettable episode,\u201d the report said.The Amazonas state governor, Jos\u00e9 Melo, has denied that any negotiation took place. Last week, Mr. Melo also said there were \u201cno saints\u201d killed in the Manaus massacre.A similar view was expressed by the youth secretary in Mr. Temer\u2019s administration, Bruno J\u00falio. \u201cThere has to be a massacre every week,\u201d he said. Amid widespread outrage over the comment, Mr. J\u00falio quit hours later.The killings are continuing.On Sunday, four more prisoners died in Manaus, three of whom were beheaded.More than 100 prisoners who escaped in the riot from An\u00edsio Jobim prison are still at large. And Manaus police officers said they need more than just talk to combat a growing drug trade across a vast state.\u201cWe don\u2019t have structure to combat this,\u201d said Rafael Costa e Silva, an investigating officer and police union representative in Manaus.Paula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Clearing Out the App Stores: Government Censorship Made Easier", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThere\u2019s a new form of digital censorship sweeping the globe, and it could be the start of something devastating.These moves may sound incremental, and perhaps not immediately alarming. China has been restricting the web forever, and Russia is no bastion of free speech. So what\u2019s so dangerous about blocking apps?Here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s a more effective form of censorship.But that\u2019s not the end of this story. The banning of apps highlights a deeper flaw in our modern communications architecture: It\u2019s the centralization of information, stupid.\u201cI think the app store censorship issue is one layer of ice on the surface of the iceberg above the waterline,\u201d said Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School and a leader in the free software movement of activists who have long been warning about the dangers of centrally managed, commercial software.For more than a decade, we users of digital devices have actively championed an online infrastructure that now looks uniquely vulnerable to the sanctions of despots and others who seek to control information. We flocked to smartphones, app stores, social networks and cloud storage. Publishers like The New York Times are investing in apps and content posted to social networks instead of the comparatively open World Wide Web. Some start-ups now rely exclusively on apps; Snapchat, for instance, exists only as a mobile app.Compared with older forms of distributing software, apps downloaded from app stores are more convenient for users and often more secure from malware, and they can be more lucrative for creators. But like so much else online now, they risk feeding into mechanisms of central control. In most countries, the Apple and Google app stores are the only places to find apps for devices running their respective operating systems. (There are more choices for Android app stores in China, where Google does not offer its store.)The internet\u2019s earliest boosters considered it a magical tool to liberate people from restrictions on speech. The easy banning of apps suggests that if we let it, the internet could instead become something quite the opposite \u2014 one of the most efficient choke points of communication the world has ever seen.As the threat of nuclear attack diminished and the internet grew, its decentralized design became as much a political selling point as a technical one.What the creators and early proselytizers of the internet did not foresee was the rapid commercialization of the network. The internet that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Gilmore envisioned was built and maintained by collectives of users; the one that users flocked to was tamed by companies whose very success turned them into some of the largest corporations on the planet.The internet is now no longer \u201ceverywhere and nowhere.\u201d Just about all of its economic value is instead connected to two very specific somewheres: the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, the homes of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook, the four monstrously large companies that own the internet\u2019s central information platforms. As these companies began to build ever-larger empires online, they have evolved into convenient choke points \u2014 the very points of control that the internet was designed to eliminate.Apple offered this statement in response to my queries on how it decides to take down apps: \u201cFor some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China, and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.\u201d Google declined to comment.But Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights activist organization, said the internet giants were not without leverage in this fight.\u201cThe flip side of that is, is China going to block the entire Apple App Store over a single app?\u201d she asked. Interestingly, the internet giants\u2019 hold on every aspect of online life works toward their advantage in battling governments.\u201cThe bigger a company is, the bigger the risk that blocking them will lead to riots in the streets because you have come between people and their pictures of cats,\u201d Ms. Galperin said. \u201cThose are the companies that governments are going to be more wary of blocking, and they should be the ones that stand up to government pressure. They have a special responsibility.\u201dUsers and app developers who are now at risk of being censored also bear some responsibility. When I asked Mr. Moglen at Columbia about app bans, he was incensed that I didn\u2019t recognize The New York Times\u2019s own complicity in this story.The Times, he argued, could have stuck with the old way of publishing news. The company could have declined to create a downloadable app and instead invested all of its engineering resources into making its news available on the web, anonymously. The Times could have refused to profile users for advertising purposes, or to have its articles hosted on Facebook, or to monitor what people read in order to recommend more articles to keep people engaged. In short, The Times could have refused to play the modern digital-publishing game. But like every other publisher, it went along.\u201cWhat did you expect would happen?\u201d Mr. Moglen asked. \u201cChina didn\u2019t have to build a Great Firewall to do this. You all offered them an opportunity to piggyback onto your disrespect for the privacy and integrity and autonomy of your readers and users.\u201dI don\u2019t agree with Mr. Moglen that The Times disrespects its readers by offering a news app. (I think it\u2019s a very nice app.) But he is right that a lot of people online walked blindly into the no-win position we are in now, where our only recourse against censorship might be the good will of a few giant corporations that control most of the internet.There has to be some other way. Let\u2019s maybe work on finding it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Coming From Automakers: Voice Control That Understands You Better", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byWheelsEVERY once in a while, just for laughs, Kevin Smith-Fagan tries to call a friend of his, Priscilla, using the voice-recognition system in his 2013 Chevrolet Volt.\u201cI\u2019ve tried it so many times and it never gets it right,\u201d said Mr. Smith-Fagan, an executive at a public television station in Sacramento. \u201cIt always thinks I\u2019m saying \u2018Chris,\u2019 and I have like five people named Chris in my phone book, so it\u2019s always interesting to see who\u2019s getting the call.\u201dVoice control systems have been in cars for more than a decade, and great strides have been made in the technology\u2019s ability to understand human speech. But many people still find these systems too unreliable, or annoying, to use for more than the most simple tasks, like \u201cCall Mom.\u201dThat isn\u2019t stopping auto and tech companies from trying to give drivers the ability to do even more things by talking to their cars \u2014 while keeping their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. The efforts have some added urgency now, as states pass stricter laws aimed at curbing distracted driving. Under a California law that went into effect Jan. 1, holding or operating a phone while driving is now prohibited.This week at the International CES, the giant electronics conference in Las Vegas, Ford Motor announced that owners of its cars would soon be able to use Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice-activated assistant in their vehicles. Drivers will be able to ask for a weather report, stream music from Amazon Music or add appointments to their calendars. They will also be able to use Alexa from home to start or unlock their cars remotely.But the automaker also envisions drivers using Alexa to help with other tasks \u2014 like shopping on Amazon. Stuck in traffic? You can take care of Valentine\u2019s Day by saying, \u201cAlexa, order flowers on Amazon.\u201dOther companies are moving in the same direction. Apple\u2019s Siri can be used to control iPhone functions in cars, and Apple\u2019s CarPlay software allows drivers to dictate text messages while driving, as well as program destinations into Apple Maps and have the route plotted on the car\u2019s display. Google\u2019s Android Auto can do the same.In the last year, carmakers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and General Motors have also introduced improved voice-recognition systems that can understand normal spoken words for many tasks. Older systems required drivers to learn specific commands.With newer models, owners can program in a destination just by saying the address, as if speaking to another person. In older cars, the state, city and street had to be given separately, one at a time \u2014 and if you were lucky, each was correctly understood.While more advanced systems like Alexa will make it easier for drivers to use voice commands, there are still hurdles. The biggest is just changing habits, and persuading people to try talking to their cars.On the day before Thanksgiving, Frank Krieber bought a 2016 Dodge Challenger, granite gray, with a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 engine, and the latest version of the Uconnect infotainment system. A few days later, when he set off on a road trip to Florida from his home in Michigan, he synced his phone to the car, but didn\u2019t bother to use the voice-recognition capabilities to enter destinations or handle other tasks.\u201cI probably should use it, but it\u2019s just easier to put in an address manually, so I haven\u2019t really played around with it,\u201d said Mr. Krieber, a sales executive for a computer company. \u201cMy experience so far has been, when you tell it to do something, it doesn\u2019t do what you want.\u201dOlder cars used voice-recognition systems that were built into the car and had limited computing power and memory. Now that more and more cars have wireless connections, the voice-recognition processing can be done via the internet in distant computers and servers, what the tech industry calls the cloud.That is an advantage that Ford sees in using Alexa, said Don Butler, Ford\u2019s executive director for connected vehicle and services. \u201cIf you have the voice recognition done outside the car, people will see a much greater ability to interpret normal, everyday speech,\u201d he said.With Alexa, a user will need to download an Alexa app to a phone and carry the phone in the car, creating the connection with the cloud.Ford and Amazon have also developed a way to get Alexa to work seamlessly with a Ford car\u2019s own built-in entertainment and navigation systems. Alexa will first be available in a few months in battery-powered and hybrid models like the Focus Electric and Fusion Energi, and later in other Ford models.\u201cYou can ask Alexa where the nearest Starbucks is, and have her program the address into the Ford navigation system for you,\u201d Mr. Butler said.For Amazon, the collaboration with Ford is another illustration of a broader push by technology giants to push their versions of voice assistants, which are made to perform simple tasks like turning on lights at home, playing music and fetching sports scores from the internet.Apple was an early entrant into the market with its Siri assistant for iPhones. Google has its Assistant and a new connected speaker featuring the voice technology called Google Home. And Samsung, which has announced plans to buy the audio and automobile technology company Harman International Industries, last year agreed to acquire a voice assistant start-up, Viv Labs.Many analysts believe Amazon has vaulted to a leadership position in the race with the surprise success of the Echo family of smart speakers. While Amazon does not reveal sales figures for its devices, the company recently said that the Echo speaker and a smaller device called Echo Dot were the best-selling products on Amazon last year.Amazon has been more aggressive than other tech giants in getting other companies like Ford to integrate Alexa into their products. Dozens of other companies were expected to announce plans at CES to allow people to control their devices using Alexa.The satellite television provider Dish Network said people who use its Hopper digital video recorders would be able to use Alexa voice commands to change channels and play movies. Lenovo, the computer maker, announced its own Alexa-based speaker, Lenovo Smart Assistant. The maker of Seiki, Westinghouse Electronics and Element Electronics televisions said it would build Alexa into the remote controls for some 4K sets from those brands.In California, Mr. Smith-Fagan would welcome better voice recognition. \u201cWith the new law we have, I\u2019m kind of worried, because everyone\u2019s going to have to find a way to use the phone without touching it with your hands,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uneasy About the Future, Readers Turn to Dystopian Classics", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byBooks News\u201cMake Margaret Atwood Fiction Again!\u201d one sign read. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale is NOT an Instruction Manual!\u201d read another.\u201cThere were a honking huge number of them,\u201d Ms. Atwood said.\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which takes place in near-future New England as a totalitarian regime has taken power and stripped women of their civil rights, was published 32 years ago. But in recent months, Ms. Atwood has been hearing from anxious readers who see eerie parallels between the novel\u2019s oppressive society and the current Republican administration\u2019s policy goals of curtailing reproductive rights.In 2016, sales of the book, which is in its 52nd printing, were up 30 percent over the previous year. Ms. Atwood\u2019s publisher has reprinted 100,000 copies in the last three months to meet a spike in demand after the election.\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is among several classic dystopian novels that seem to be resonating with readers at a moment of heightened anxiety about the state of American democracy. Sales have also risen drastically for George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d and \u201c1984,\u201d which shot to the top of Amazon\u2019s best-seller list this week.To many observers, her comment evoked Orwell\u2019s vision of a totalitarian society in which language becomes a political weapon and reality itself is defined by those in power. The remarks prompted a cascade of Twitter messages referencing Orwell and \u201c1984.\u201d According to a Twitter spokesman, the novel was referenced more than 290,000 times on the social network this week. The book began climbing Amazon\u2019s best-seller list, which in turn drove more readers to it, in a sort of algorithm-driven feedback loop. It amounted to a blizzard of free advertising for a 68-year-old novel.On Wednesday, the CNN host Van Jones read a famous passage from the novel about efforts to force citizens to \u201creject the evidence of your eyes and ears,\u201d and urged his viewers not to become complacent when faced with a barrage of falsehoods. \u201cLet\u2019s not go down the Orwellian road, and I hope that\u2019s not where Trump is trying to lead us,\u201d he said.Of course, it is not the first time that readers and pundits have invoked the novel to criticize the actions and statements of a government. It is such a standard trope that Orwell\u2019s name has become an adjective. And because so many American readers are exposed to the novel in high school or college, most people have a passing familiarity with its basic themes about the dangers of authoritarianism, and use phrases like \u201cbig brother\u201d as a shorthand to describe a multitude of things, from Google to homeland security.\u201cIt\u2019s a frame of reference that people can reach for in response to government deception, propaganda, the misuse of language, and those are things that occur all the time,\u201d said Alex Woloch, an English professor at Stanford University who has written about the roots of Orwell\u2019s political language. \u201cThere are certain things this administration is doing that has set off these alarm bells, and people are hungry for frames of reference to understand this new reality.\u201dThe sudden prominence of such novels reflects a renewed public interest in decades-old works of speculative fiction as guides for understanding our current political moment. Readers who are grappling with a jolting shift in American politics, when easily verifiable facts are subject to debate and civil liberties and democratic norms feel fragile, are turning to dystopian novels for guidance and insight.\u201cMany of these books are becoming more important to the average American reader because they want to know what\u2019s next, because we\u2019ve never been through this before,\u201d said the novelist Gary Shteyngart, author of the dystopian novel \u201cSuper Sad True Love Story. \u201cLanguage is being used to destabilize people\u2019s perception of reality, and that\u2019s very new to this country.\u201dReaders may also be returning to the comfort (if you can call it that) of familiar dystopian novels because these stories offer moral clarity at a time when it can be difficult to keep up with the convulsions of the daily news cycle, and the fire hose of information and disinformation on social media.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a feeling that nonfiction has failed us, that journalism has not been able to keep up with things,\u201d Mr. Shteyngart said.\u201cThe book has certainly been known and alluded to since its publication, but now it\u2019s really caught on because there are so many astonishing parallels to the present,\u201d said Michael Meyer, an emeritus English professor at the University of Connecticut, who wrote an introduction to the novel. \u201cIt\u2019s a satire about the politics of someone like Trump.\u201dThe novel \u201c1984\u201d is a reliable best seller \u2014 it was an instant hit when it was first published in 1949, and it continues to sell some 400,000 paperback copies in the United States annually. Still, the recent demand caught the publisher and some booksellers off guard. Signet, which publishes the mass-market paperback edition of \u201c1984,\u201d is reprinting 200,000 more copies of the book, and another 100,000 copies of \u201cAnimal Farm.\u201d (Its edition of \u201c1984\u201d is currently out of stock on Amazon.)\u201cWe\u2019re getting significant reorders from all our accounts,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cWe\u2019ve printed, just this week, about half of what we normally sell in a year.\u201dPublishers and book retailers have been quick to seize the momentum and take advantage of renewed interest in decades-old titles. The Amazon page for \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d now features a bold print quote from Salon, calling the book \u201cthe novel that foreshadowed Donald Trump\u2019s authoritarian appeal.\u201d This week, Penguin started an online advertising and social media campaign to promote \u201c1984,\u201d which included posts with quotes from the novel on Facebook and Instagram.There\u2019s perhaps another reason that readers are returning to \u201c1984\u201d and other dystopian classics during unsettling times. Sometimes, it\u2019s nice to be reminded that things could be worse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Instant Pot: Here\u2019s Why Cooks Love It", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetitePeople have fallen in love with their Instant Pots.They may like their blenders, cherish their slow cookers and need their food processors.If you\u2019re a cook and got through last year without bumping into people who couldn\u2019t stop talking about their Instant Pots \u2014 or any of the other multifunctional electric pressure cookers on the market (Breville and Cuisinart both make versions) \u2014 then you won\u2019t have to wait much longer.Electric pressure cookers is one of the fastest growing kitchen appliance sectors on the market, with sales doubling and tripling over the last four years, according to Robert Wang, the C.E.O. of Instant Pot Company.When the Instant Pot debuted in 2009, it was one of the first brands to hit North America; electric pressure cookers were already gaining popularity in China. In 2010, approximately 300,000 electric pressure cookers were sold in the United States and Canada, said Dr. Wang. By 2015, that number rose to over three million. (He declined to give exact sales figures, as did representatives from Breville and Cuisinart.)So why do electric pressure cookers inspire such a devoted following?I bought one to find out.A confession: I already own a stovetop pressure cooker, the conventional kind that you would heat over a burner and then regulate yourself. It is currently supporting a colony of dust bunnies in the back of my highest cabinet, behind the panini press. I never got over my fear of exploding split-pea soup to use it with any regularity.What makes this newest generation of electric pressure cookers different is that it is designed with a slew of self-regulating safety features, including sensors to monitor the unit\u2019s temperature and amount of pressure. All you do is plug it in and tap a button, and it does everything else. It\u2019s as user-friendly as a slow cooker \u2014 except that it gets dinner on the table a day or so faster.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Paleo or vegan or just trying to eat better, pressure cooking is the answer for healthy fast food,\u201d Ms. Sass said.After cooking a pork shoulder in the electric pressure cooker, I could easily see why the appliance has struck a chord, with the Paleo community in particular: It cooks large hunks of meat superbly and speedily. After a mere 90 minutes, the meat was spoon tender and deeply flavored, even before I covered the soft shreds with spicy barbecue sauce. The same recipe made in my slow cooker took seven hours, and the meat wasn\u2019t quite as uniformly juicy.It was that pork shoulder that turned me into a believer.Lamb shanks were velvety soft in 40 minutes, short ribs fell off the bone in 30, and spare ribs were porky perfection in 20 minutes.Perhaps most convenient, the collagen-rich beef bone broth that took two days to cook down in my slow cooker was ready in an afternoon, without making the whole house smell like soup (which is nice for the first couple of hours but then gets really old).But the electric pressure cooker does have its shortcomings. The most notable failure in the meat category was the whole chicken. The recipes I tested came out with slack and soggy skin, and either stringy and dry white meat or undercooked dark meat. I did have more success with sake-steamed skinless chicken breasts, which were evenly cooked and perfumed with the delicate rice wine and fresh ginger. A nice dish, though how often does one really want to eat steamed skinless chicken breasts?I didn\u2019t like it much for vegetables either, most of which don\u2019t benefit from the intense pressure of high-heat steam (beets and artichokes being the important exceptions here). Broccoli, kale, zucchini, fennel, brussels sprouts and mushrooms turned limp and unappealing.They also took longer to cook than if I had used a skillet on the stove. The manual tells you an ingredient only needs, say, five minutes to cook, but that doesn\u2019t take into account the 10 to 15 minutes required for the machine to build pressure, in addition to the time needed to release the pressure, which brings the total to around 20 minutes. I can do a lot of great things to vegetables with a skillet, some olive oil and garlic in 20 minutes. In general, this is a good rule of thumb: If something takes 20 minutes or less to cook conventionally on the stove, use the stove.Another pressure cooker downside: They just don\u2019t do crisp or crunchy. Although most cookers allow you to brown meats and vegetables on the saut\u00e9 function before cooking, any crunchy bits will wilt under the pressurized steam once you lock on the lid. Though I might use the pressure cooker for potatoes if I were going to mash them, I would never be able to achieve anything like the crisp-edged roasted potatoes I can get in the oven. And in the future, I\u2019ll stick to roasting my whole chickens, so I can crunch on the shards of browned, salty skin.The key to pressure cooker happiness is choosing recipes in which softness and succulence is the goal, and which traditionally take hours to get there.For example, I\u2019ll never go back to a Dutch oven for chili, which I made in the electric pressure cooker in an hour starting from dried beans.\u201cPeople want to use their pressure cookers for everything, but they\u2019re better for some things than others,\u201d Ms. Sass said. \u201cStick to soups, stews, beans and risotto. It makes fabulous risotto.\u201dI also like the machine for polenta, which eliminates the stirring (and the splatters of molten blobs).I also tried out some of the other functions, including the slow cooker, rice cooker and yogurt maker settings. The unit worked as well as my separate, stand-alone slow cooker, though I can see a future in which I pressure-cook more, and slow-cook less; the results are similar, but one is a whole lot faster. For cooking rice, I preferred both the brown and white rice I made in my separate rice cooker. The pressure cooker was faster, but the rice a bit heavier and chewier. And for yogurt, which I\u2019d gotten into the habit of making every other week on the stove, I have to admit that the machine worked like a dream.So after all that cooking, did I fall in love with the electric pressure cooker?It takes up a lot of space, it\u2019s not at all intuitive, and I hate not being able to check on my food as it cooks. But even so, I don\u2019t plan on giving mine up anytime soon.My friend Robin, who bought an Instant Pot six month ago, summed it up well.\u201cI\u2019m out of the honeymoon phase,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we\u2019re settling into a relationship. And I\u2019ve accepted its limitations, like the fact that there\u2019s no reason to ever make oatmeal or rice in it. But between the lamb stew and the butternut squash soup, I know we will be together forever.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Data Could Be the Next Tech Hot Button for Regulators", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byWealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on.Now data \u2014 gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations \u2014 is increasingly a focus of technology competition. And academics and some policy makers, especially in Europe, are considering whether big internet companies like Google and Facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation.In recent years, Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion, privacy or antitrust investigations. But in the coming years, who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in American tech giants.As government regulators dig into this new era of data competition, they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make. Using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit, for example. And higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services.The competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990s about software and Microsoft. The worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers, and gather more data, a powerful \u201cnetwork effect\u201d effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform, like Google in search or Facebook in consumer social networks.Evidence of the rising importance of data can be seen from the frontiers of artificial intelligence to mainstream business software. And certain data sets can be remarkably valuable for companies working on those technologies.Microsoft is betting LinkedIn, combined with data on how hundreds of millions of workers use its Office 365 online software, and consumer data from search behavior on Bing, will \u201cpower a set of insights that we think is unprecedented,\u201d said James Phillips, vice president for business applications at Microsoft.IBM estimates that 70 percent of the world\u2019s data is not out on the public web, but in private databases, often to protect privacy or trade secrets. IBM\u2019s strategy is to take the data it has acquired, add customer data and use that to train its Watson artificial intelligence software to pursue such tasks as helping medical researchers discover novel disease therapies, or flagging suspect financial transactions for independent auditors.\u201cOur focus is mainly on nonpublic data sets and extending that advantage for clients in business and science,\u201d said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s Watson and cloud businesses.At Google, the company\u2019s drive into cloud-delivered business software is fueled by data, building on years of work done on its search and other consumer services, and its recent advances in image identification, speech recognition and language translation.For example, a new Google business offering \u2014 still in the test, or alpha, stage \u2014 is a software service to improve job finding and recruiting. Its data includes more than 17 million online job postings and the public profiles and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of more than 200 million people.Its machine-learning algorithms distilled that to about four million unique job titles, ranked the most common ones and identified specific skills. The job sites CareerBuilder and Dice are using the Google technology to show job seekers more relevant openings. And FedEx, the giant package shipper, is adding the service to its recruiting site.That is just one case, said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google\u2019s cloud business, of what is becoming increasingly possible \u2014 using the tools of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, to sift through huge quantities of data to provide machine-curated data services.\u201cYou can turn this technology to whatever field you want, from manufacturing to medicine,\u201d Ms. Greene said.Fei-Fei Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is taking a sabbatical to become chief scientist for artificial intelligence at Google\u2019s cloud unit. She sees working at Google as one path to pursue her career ambition to \u201cdemocratize A.I.,\u201d now that the software and data ingredients are ripe.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have the current era of A.I. without the big data revolution,\u201d Dr. Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s the digital gold.\u201dIn the A.I. race, better software algorithms can put you ahead for a year or so, but probably no more, said Andrew Ng, a former Google scientist and adjunct professor at Stanford. He is now chief scientist at Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant, and a leading figure in artificial intelligence research.Rivals, he added, cannot unlock or simulate your data. \u201cData is the defensible barrier, not algorithms,\u201d Mr. Ng said.Advertisement"}

While a consumer can delay an iPhone purchase or shop somewhere other than Amazon, Google\u2019s search engine is an indispensable tool for anyone using the internet. The shift to mobile devices, once considered a threat to Google\u2019s search business, has only strengthened it.Google\u2019s market share on desktop search is around 78 percent, but it is above 90 percent on mobile devices, according to research from NetMarketShare.com. What is more, on smaller mobile displays, Google\u2019s ads occupy a large portion of the screen \u2014 making it more likely a user will click on them.Clicks on Google ads increased 36 percent in the quarter, but what advertisers paid for each click decreased 15 percent.Google is also sitting on many of the internet\u2019s most valuable properties \u2014 the places where people go to stay in touch on email, find driving directions or seek out entertainment.While clicks on Google\u2019s ads across the internet are rising, they are growing faster on its own websites like YouTube. Alphabet does not break out results for YouTube, but the site continues to amass a huge audience. Google said more than a billion people watched YouTube every month, viewing hundreds of millions of hours of its videos every day.Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said company assets like search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play, constituted \u201cprime time in the mobile era.\u201dEven Alphabet\u2019s unexpected hiccups are a little dull. The company\u2019s earnings per share were $7.56, or 11 cents below analysts\u2019 estimates. It said the reason for the shortfall was that it paid more in taxes. The company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 percent, compared with 5 percent in the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet said it paid more in United States taxes but did not explain why.Alphabet shares were down 2 percent in after-hours trading. The stock reached a record high on Wednesday.While the dominance of the Google search engine seems unassailable today, Alphabet is investing heavily in new technologies that may threaten its stronghold. Devices like the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated smart speaker, portend a future where artificially intelligent digital assistants fetch information without needing to access a search engine directly.Google did not provide figures for how those products sold, but the \u201cother revenue\u201d category, which included hardware sales along with revenue from Google Play, rose 62 percent to $3.4 billion.Part of the company\u2019s financial stability came from Google\u2019s creation of Alphabet in 2015. The reorganization into a holding company split the company\u2019s core search business from a growing list of fledgling operations, like the newly minted Waymo \u2014 what used to be Google\u2019s self-driving car project until it was spun off as an independent Alphabet company in 2016.Under the watch of Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, the company has scaled back costs and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 the ambition of its speculative investments into new technologies. During the quarter, Alphabet said quarterly revenue from \u201cother bets\u201d rose 75 percent to $262 million, while operating losses narrowed to $1.09 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.Advertisement"}

She meets Scott (David Hoflin), an aspiring writer who barely avoids being shipped off to fight thanks to the armistice. He soon whisks her out of there, which is fortunate since it means we no longer have to listen to David Strathairn, who plays her strict and humorless father, mouth lines like: \u201cZelda Sayre, you come back here. You do not walk away from your father when he is addressing you.\u201dThat\u2019s too bad, because some of them probably could have been more interesting than the central couple, who, as played by Ms. Ricci and Mr. Hoflin, are entirely devoid of the thing that the real Fitzgeralds apparently had in abundance: chemistry. Without any sign of a romantic spark, it is not clear why they would endure one another and stay together.There is exactly one sizzling moment in the 10 installments, and it has nothing to do with the couple\u2019s supposedly fiery romance. It occurs in Episode 7, when Scott, returning to Princeton to talk about his novel, lashes out at the stuffy professors he studied under there.\u201cIt\u2019s not a book that any of you will ever assign, or value, or even understand,\u201d he says. \u201cNo book of mine will ever be. And all the writing I\u2019ve done and will do is in spite of you. You teach with two goals: to prop up literature that is long dead and to curry favor with the wealthiest students just so you can indulge in the fantasy that you belong to their world.\u201dToo bad the moment passes so quickly. The 10 episodes don\u2019t get very far into the couple\u2019s history \u2014 by the end, Scott is still struggling to produce another successful book, his problems with alcohol are only beginning to emerge, and Zelda\u2019s mental instability has yet to make its presence felt. Clearly, Amazon intends to milk this premise a bit longer, but the first round is so dreary that it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone clamoring for more.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Seem Invincible. That Worries Lawmakers.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech \u2014 from IBM to Hewlett-Packard to Cisco to Yahoo \u2014 were eventually outmaneuvered by start-ups that came out of nowhere.The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place.Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable.In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world\u2019s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will.The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump\u2019s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds.This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year.Let\u2019s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends \u2014 mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs.Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech \u2014 on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance.The Five aren\u2019t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple\u2019s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet\u2019s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren\u2019t entirely safe from competition from start-ups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot.Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from start-ups; today\u2019s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five.But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you\u2019re supposed to in America \u2014 by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren\u2019t considered that bad. They weren\u2019t causing environmental disasters. They weren\u2019t selling cigarettes. They weren\u2019t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five\u2019s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn\u2019t I called them the Fabulous Five?Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with.During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos\u2019s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry\u2019s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public.For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised \u2014 entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others.\u201cDuring the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U.S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,\u201d said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them.During Mr. Genachowski\u2019s term at the F.C.C., and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201d which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies.But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. \u201cThe next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things \u2014 battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,\u201d he said.That\u2019s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger \u2014 their benefits to society as well as their potential costs \u2014 when deciding how to police them.But there\u2019s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today\u2019s start-ups. The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining, voice-activated assistants, self-driving cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five.That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more; and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump, please remember: It\u2019s a hot mike, so watch yourself with the P-word \u2014 Putin, that is. He is probably listening. Don\u2019t make Rex W. Tillerson of Exxon Mobil, our next secretary of state, have to call his \u201cfriend\u201d to explain things.On the menu this evening: crow.

And by the way, the barbecue stations during cocktail hour were provided courtesy of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7.Finally, for the business executives in the room who are wondering if this free meal violates your conflict-of-interest policy, don\u2019t worry; see what your legal department says when you tell it, \u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for the president, it\u2019s good enough for me.\u201dNow, on to the toasts \u2014 and some predictions for the new year.Let\u2019s start with predictions, given that everyone, myself included, seemed to be so wrong about everything in 2016 \u2014 Trump, Brexit, the way the stock market would go. Instead of offering conventional predictions, I\u2019m going to offer up some Black Swans \u2014 things that were considered unthinkable but may now be thinkable, in a blue-sky, the-world-is-upside-down kind of way. Consider some of these thought experiments, if nothing else.This one may be slightly more plausible: Masayoshi Son, the billionaire controlling shareholder of Sprint \u2014 and a newfound friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who pledged to invest $100 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs \u2014 makes a bid to merge Sprint with T-Mobile. Under most antitrust analysis, such a deal would be dead on arrival. But perhaps under a new business-friendly administration \u2014 and given Mr. Son\u2019s public support for the president-elect \u2014 the transaction gets the green light?Here\u2019s another: With the possibility that the Trump\u2019s administration will undo net-neutrality laws that allow content companies to transmit unlimited data over cable company pipes, Netflix will finally accept a takeover bid \u2014 from Disney, which has been looking for a way to create an even stronger direct relationship with its customers. It would be Robert A. Iger\u2019s final megadeal before his contract expires in 2018. It would also pave the way for Mr. Iger to hire digitally savvy Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, a Disney board member, to take over for him.John G. Stumpf, the chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo, wasn\u2019t supposed to end his career this way. He is a reasonable and \u2014 dare I say \u2014 decent man, yet he led a bank engaged in one of the most blatant financial scandals in recent memory. Wells opened up millions of accounts without the permission of its customers, just to goose internal numbers. In truth, customers lost only $1.5 million, which, if we\u2019re being honest, is minuscule for a bank the size of Wells Fargo. The problem is that Mr. Stumpf treated it as a blip on the radar screen and ignored the significant damage his bank was doing to real people. And when he was called to account, he didn\u2019t have the right answers. Ultimately, he resigned, which was the right decision. But it could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 all been avoided.President and Michelle Obama couldn\u2019t make it to dinner (the venue might have been a turnoff). But whatever you think of his stewardship of the nation, he deserves our thanks. For those of us who pay attention to economic statistics, Mr. Obama walked into the worst economic crisis in recent history. We are now in the longest economic expansion and monthly job creation in history. Was he alone responsible? No, but it happened on his watch. Could we have gone faster with different policies? Very possibly. We will see just how much faster we can grow and if there is a cost to doing so under the next administration. Was he perfect? Of course not. But in a town that\u2019s filled with scandals and red flags about conflicts of interest \u2014 which are often skewered in this annual column \u2014 the Obamas stand out for avoiding those questions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hey, Mike Tyson. I Can Beat You Blindfolded.", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byAs his summer break from the University of Connecticut drew to a close last August, Alex Tan had one more goal before school began: to reclaim a world record in video gaming.His aim: To finish the game as fast as possible while blindfolded.When Mr. Tan learned his record had fallen, he said he knew he could do better. \u201cThat was my motivation to come back and do it again,\u201d he said, adding that he began playing blindfolded simply \u201cbecause nobody\u2019s done it yet.\u201dBlindfolded speed-runners have rushed through classic 2-D games, including Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Mike Tyson\u2019s Punch-Out!!. These older games tend to have smaller levels and significantly shorter playtimes than newer 3-D games, making it possible to play through them in minutes rather than hours (though at least one blindfolded gamer has posted a 100-plus-hour play-through of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, a 3-D game that took him more than a year to complete).But gaming without sight may be even more counterintuitive since games depend on a near-constant tether of visual feedback to guide players. One of the first recorded attempts came in 2011 when a speed-runner tried to play through the original Super Mario Bros. while blindfolded at a gaming charity marathon \u2014 but failed. In 2014 and 2015, Mr. Tan and others began to break through, completing full runs and establishing records for others to challenge.So how does playing video games work without visual cues? The speed-runners say they rely on a game\u2019s sound effects and music to know where they are in the process. Jacob Criminiski, 23, who has completed multiple blindfolded speed-runs of the Game Boy game Pok\u00e9mon Blue, with the fastest time of 19:50, said he used the sounds of hitting walls to orient himself, and timed direction changes to certain beats of the game\u2019s soundtrack in specific locations.\u201cIt\u2019s really just about finding those little things that make it easier,\u201d said Mr. Criminski, a student at the University of Dayton in Ohio. \u201cAs soon as you hit a wall, there\u2019s a little bonking sound. You find 20 things that make it easier, and you add them all together and it turns into something that\u2019s pretty easily done.\u201dOnce the patterns and timing are committed to muscle memory, it can be recalled anywhere, with or without sight. \u201cIt\u2019s something that never goes away once you can do it, which is what\u2019s cool about it,\u201d he said.Jack Wedge, 30, said he began blindfolded speed-running in 2015 while stuck at home during a snowstorm on Prince Edward Island, Canada, where he works for a local delivery service. He had seen an attempt at a blindfolded run of one of his favorite games, Mike Tyson\u2019s Punch-Out!!, at a charity stream extravaganza in 2014. That player had made it to the game\u2019s final fight against Mike Tyson before losing by a TKO.With several days off because of the inclement weather, Mr. Wedge decided to try finishing the job.\u201cI had to learn to anticipate when things were coming, and I could tell I\u2019d gotten something wrong when I heard the sound of me getting hit,\u201d Mr. Wedge said. After a week of practice, he finished the game blindfolded in just over 25 minutes.The accomplishment made Mr. Wedge a minor celebrity when several gaming websites picked up the video of his play-through, which he had posted on YouTube.\u201cA lot of people around town heard about the video going viral before I did,\u201d he said. \u201cA couple people even stopped hanging out with me over it, because they thought the whole thing was too nerdy.\u201dAnil Chirayath, community program manager of speed-running for Twitch, said the increase in blindfolded speed-running has been driven, in part, by the connection it builds between player and audience.\u201cBecause of that shared journey, when speed-runners reach a goal and viewers witness and share in that success, it is an unforgettable experience for all involved,\u201d he wrote in an email.Mr. Tan, the Super Mario World player, said he started to play blindfolded in early 2015 after seeing a Twitch streamer with covered eyes play through the first level of the game. Mr. Tan wondered if he could finish the whole game \u2014 after all, he had already played Super Mario World so many times that he could see almost every level in his head.It turned out he could. After setting the record for speed-running blindfolded through the game in 2015, Mr. Tan\u2019s video was covered on the websites of USA Today, Sports Illustrated and others. Mr. Tan began doing daily drills to improve once he was beaten by the Japanese player Dodaimurige, who did not respond to a message for comment.\u201cFor most of the games, there\u2019s no celebratory thing for world records, so it doesn\u2019t feel as special,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it still feels really good to the person because the rest of the community knows they worked really hard to get that world record.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trust me, we can deforest a lot more if we have to.\u201dMr. Lima\u2019s readiness to voice publicly what many Brazilians say in private reflects, perhaps, a yearning for the spotlight. As he roams the backlands rodeo circuit in his Mitsubishi Titan pickup, the competitions where Mr. Lima works are often as much about him as they are about bull-riding buckaroos.At a rodeo here in Goi\u00e2nia on a recent Friday night, scantily clad female dancers warmed up the arena before Mr. Lima burst onto the scene around midnight, his arrival heralded by fireworks, a nightclub smoke machine, cannons discharging confetti into the air and a dance involving a good deal of strutting by Mr. Lima himself.After singing Brazil\u2019s national anthem, he led competitors in a lengthy prayer before getting on with the event. He often cracks jokes, exudes pride in Brazil\u2019s ranching culture and bursts into song while describing the technical aspects of the cowpokes competing for prize money.\u201cI love the United States and recognize how much we owe to the rodeo scene up there, but the folks in Brazil expect a little more from their rodeo announcers,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat am I, essentially? A storyteller.\u201dMr. Lima got into radio announcing after studying three things: law, journalism and how to be a clown. He said it was during his time at clown school in Rio, when he was trying to find a way into show business, \u201cthat I learned the valuable lesson of laughing at my own failures.\u201dA self-described \u201cbastard son of a rancher,\u201d Mr. Lima was raised by his mother, a shopkeeper, in Barretos, a city in S\u00e3o Paulo State that has long been an epicenter of the Brazilian rodeo scene. Mr. Lima travels extensively throughout the year to various farming regions, but still lives in Barretos with his wife and son.\u201cObviously, I needed a new name, something that spoke to the greatness of the interior of Brazil,\u201d he said about his stage name. Cuiabanno refers to people from Cuiab\u00e1, the frontier capital of Mato Grosso, a western state with burgeoning farming enterprises.In a country where animal-rights activists have grown more vocal in recent years, not everyone appreciates Mr. Lima\u2019s exaltation of Brazil\u2019s agribusiness prowess.\u201cCuibanno is nothing more than an amusing court jester in a rodeo scene dominated by wealthy ranchers and corporate sponsors,\u201d said Leandro Ferro, president of I Hate Rodeo, a nonprofit group in S\u00e3o Paulo seeking to raise awareness about claims of animal cruelty at Brazil\u2019s rodeos.Mr. Lima chafes at such criticism, contending that his critics are unrealistic about the significance of agriculture and ranching in contemporary society. \u201cNot everyone can go organic, eating leaves in expensive pretty packages,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world needs animal protein, and Brazil supplies it.\u201dDespite championing such feats, along with his own rising prominence, Mr. Lima contends that elites in cities like S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio opt to ignore the signs around them that Brazil\u2019s ranching culture, with its conservative values, is gaining prominence.In Brazilian politics, for instance, a powerful bloc representing large landowners and large-scale agricultural interests exerts considerable sway in Congress. And a subgenre of Brazilian country music called \u201csertanejo universit\u00e1rio,\u201d tapping the aspirations of the college-educated middle class, has surged in popularity.\u201cWe produce the country\u2019s wealth and increasingly the culture that people consume, but the interior of Brazil remains neglected,\u201d Mr. Lima said. \u201cSomething in this equation has got to give.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Carlos Paix\u00e3o de Oliveira, a prosecutor in Roraima, publicly criticized the management of the facility in October, when inmates from the P.C.C. gang killed at least 10 rivals from Red Command.Mr. Oliveira suggested at the time that the prison should be demolished and replaced.\u201cIf they want, the inmates will carry out a new slaughter in there, because no one has control of that prison,\u201d he said.Despite the writing in blood on Friday proclaiming the supremacy of the P.C.C., the authorities contended that the latest killings did not involve score-settling between gangs but a power struggle within the P.C.C. itself, or an effort to project power by the gang.\u201cWe\u2019ve been on guard about something like this for some time, transferring prisoners from Red Command to other units,\u201d said Uziel Castro, the top security official in Roraima. \u201cWe think this had to do with an internal battle.\u201dHuman rights groups compare the current string of uprisings to the Carandiru prison massacre in 1992 in S\u00e3o Paulo, when the police stormed the facility and killed 111 inmates. An appeals court recently voided the convictions of 73 police officers for their participation in the killings.The problems in Brazil\u2019s prisons that led to earlier episodes of carnage have intensified with the growing drug trade, security experts say. Brazil\u2019s prison population has swelled this century as the authorities lock up more people on minor drug offenses.\u201cThis war between the criminal factions is worsening,\u201d said Antonio Cl\u00e1udio Mariz de Oliveira, a former security official in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThe problem is largely a result of the lack of attention towards the prison system, both by the government and the public.\u201d\u201cPeople only react when there\u2019s an episode like this,\u201d said Mr. Mariz de Oliveira. \u201cThen they forget about it until the next one.\u201dIndeed, some elected officials have expressed the hardened views held by crime-weary voters. Jos\u00e9 Melo, the governor of Amazonas State, said \u201cthere were no saints\u201d among the dozens of inmates killed in the state\u2019s prisons this week, calling the victims murderers, rapists or gang members.At the same time, officials in Mr. Temer\u2019s administration have tried to play down the prison crisis. \u201cThe situation is not out of control,\u201d said Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes.Paula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Vinod Sreeharsha from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

I saw it while fumbling through invoices in the office: \u201cHow to Date a White Woman: A Practical Guide for Asian Men.\u201d\u201cSteve has a chance now!\u201d screamed Joe.For those still wondering, yes, Joe, myself and Steve are all Asian-American men. Steve had just been on his first date with a complicated, whole human being who happened to be white and female. Joe, in all his excitement for Steve, decided to roast him by purchasing a used copy of the book for $20.I took a photo, posted it on Instagram, and some 8,000 likes later the book price shot up to over $500 on Amazon, since there were only five copies available. There were over 500 comments on the photo as well, but unanimously no one actually believed the book to be of any utility outside being a gag gift.Asian World Press published the book in 2002. If you go to their web 1.0 site, you\u2019ll see it is the only book shown among dead links for construction, business and travel guides. Asian World Press feels like an accident and the book a severe miscalculation. But even if we agree that publishing a dating book pegged specifically to Asian men who want to date white women is unconscionable in 2002 \u2014 and much more so in 2017 \u2014 there are still people who believe Asian men are inept and undesirable to any women outside their race.Steve Harvey is one of these people.As my therapist would say, I have a lot of \u201cfeeling\u201d about his sentiments.As a kid, you believe the things you\u2019re told about yourself. But as I grew, I started to see things unravel. I wasn\u2019t subordinate, I didn\u2019t count good, I hated bowing, and outside downloading GIFs of Daisy Fuentes, I was terrible with computers. My first reaction, and the reaction of everyone at Chinese language school as well, was that I was defective and destined for life on a rack at T.J. Maxx begging to get chosen despite my imperfections. So many Asian-Americans I grew up with bought into the expectations the dominant culture placed on them and did everything they could to meet them. I recognized from a young age that I couldn\u2019t and began to plan for life on the margins.I realized that people on the margins aren\u2019t afforded the privilege of being complicated, whole, human beings in America; we have to create that existence ourselves, and it is that experience that I feel fundamentally binds us. Over time, I began to find solidarity with my singularity and difference. Yet the one joke that still hurts, the sore spot that even my closest friends will press, the one stereotype that I still mistakenly believe at the most inopportune bedroom moments \u2014 and I know Joe and Steve do as well \u2014 is that women don\u2019t want Asian men. Attractiveness is a very haphazard dish that can\u2019t be boiled down to height or skin color, but Asian men are told that regardless of what the idyllic mirepoix is or isn\u2019t, we just don\u2019t have the ingredients.That doesn\u2019t mean we give up. Steve goes to the gym; Joe buys every piece of Supreme clothing he can afford; and I\u2019ve got jokes. They\u2019re the cultural modifications we see as antidotes to our issues with masculinity. But no matter how successful I was, how much self-improvement was made, or how aware I was that stereotypes are not facts, there were times I thoroughly believed that no one wanted anything to do with me. I told myself that it was all a lie, but the structural emasculation of Asian men in all forms of media became a self-fulfilling prophecy that produced an actual abhorrence to Asian men in the real world.That\u2019s why this Steve Harvey episode is so upsetting. He speaks openly about issues facing the black community, he is a man of God, and he has a huge platform to speak from. Unfortunately, he\u2019s also the type of guy who orders Krug champagne for himself and Cook\u2019s for every one else. For his own personal profit, he\u2019s willing to perpetuate the emasculation of Asian men regardless of how hypocritical it is. He isn\u2019t the only one doing this in 2017, but as I told myself on New Year\u2019s, I\u2019m not drinking anymore of this Cook\u2019s they\u2019re trying to pour, and neither should you.Eddie Huang, a restaurateur and television host, is the author of \u201cFresh Off the Boat: A Memoir\u201d and \u201cDouble Cup Love.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company misfired along the way as it competed head-on with Google in internet search and Apple in smartphones.Microsoft\u2019s shares, which languished for years, are now trading near record highs. After its results were released, the company\u2019s stock rose almost 1 percent to $64.27.For the quarter, Microsoft reported net income of $5.2 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with $5.02 billion, or 62 cents a share, during the period a year earlier.Revenue rose to $24.09 billion from $23.8 billion a year ago.With adjustments to exclude results from LinkedIn and the impact of nearly $2 billion in deferred revenue related to its Windows 10 operating system, Microsoft earned 84 cents a share and revenue of $25.84 billion, exceeding the estimates of Wall Street analysts, who also excluded those items from their forecasts.The average analyst estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters had called for Microsoft earnings of 79 cents a share and revenue of $25.28 billion.Sales from the company\u2019s Azure cloud computing business, which caters to businesses that want to move basic computing functions into Microsoft\u2019s data centers, increased 93 percent from a year ago. Revenue for intelligent cloud, Microsoft\u2019s name for the category that includes Azure, rose 8 percent to $6.9 billion.\u201cWe know their cloud business is doing well,\u201d said Christopher Voce, an analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cThey delivered on that front.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s Office business also had strong results as more of its customers signed on to use a subscription version of Office 365 software. Revenue in the Microsoft category dominated by Office rose 10 percent to $7.4 billion.The category also benefited from $228 million in revenue that LinkedIn brought in for Microsoft after the acquisition closed. LinkedIn showed an operating loss during that period of $201 million.One of the biggest surprises of the quarter was a 5 percent increase in the revenue Microsoft received from personal computer makers for licenses to its Windows software. Windows revenue that Microsoft received from agreements with corporate customers rose by the same amount.The personal computer market has been in a slump for years as buyers have shifted to newer categories of devices like tablets and smartphones. In the last three months of 2016, worldwide personal computer shipments fell 3.7 percent, according to Gartner, the technology research firm.But Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., still occasionally outperforms the overall market, especially during a surge in sales of higher-end personal computers. In an interview, Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said that corporations were increasing their deployments of Windows 10 on their personal computers and that innovative new machines aimed at consumers sold well.\u201cWe\u2019re feeling very good about growth in the PC segment,\" Ms. Hood said.Advertisement"}

Not anymore.Those stores have been outmaneuvered by online retailers like Amazon and discount retailers like T. J. Maxx. And now the pace of change is accelerating, transforming the retail industry faster than expected.The results? A rude awakening for some of the country\u2019s biggest retailers. And for malls, a reshaping that, in many ways, mirrors a growing economic divide.These changes are \u201chappening at a tremendous speed,\u201d said Bernard Sosnick, a retail analyst at Madison Global Partners.\u201cIt\u2019s putting pressure on all stores, best and worst, but the worst just don\u2019t have a place in retailing anymore as sales decrease,\u201d Mr. Sosnick said. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to sacrifice them, shutter them, to help the others survive and stabilize sales.\u201dThe exits highlight the growing dichotomy between America\u2019s highest-end shopping centers, the type with Tesla dealerships and Apple stores, and those on the lower end of the spectrum, which are struggling to fill space and attract national brands. The stores being closed by Sears are not profitable. And Macy\u2019s chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren, said many of the stores it was closing were \u201cno longer robust shopping destinations.\u201dGreen Street Advisors, which tracks the mall industry, said in a report last year that more department store closures \u201cshould ultimately result in a larger number of malls becoming irrelevant retail destinations.\u201dEven among more successful malls, it is clear that department stores are far less important than they once were as they attract fewer customers.While mall owners once relied on four or five department stores to serve as so-called anchor tenants, offering them cheap rent in exchange for reliable foot traffic, they may now simply need one or two department stores and otherwise seek anchors in off-price chains like T. J. Maxx, restaurants and movie theaters, Green Street Advisors said.\u201cTen or 15 years ago, if a department store left a mall, it was really a problem for the developer,\u201d Les Wexner, the longtime chief executive of L Brands, which owns Victoria\u2019s Secret, told analysts and investors in November. \u201cNow, many of the developers are trying to buy back the space from the department stores because they\u2019re an economic detriment and they can recycle that space.\u201dThe business of department stores has been attacked from all sides in recent years. Online, consumers can purchase directly from brands or on Amazon, which has invested heavily in fashion.Offline, the chains have had to contend with discount retailers like TJX, the owner of T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and Home Goods, which compete hard on price and brand names, as well as fast-fashion sellers like H&M and outlet centers. Department stores also face competition from beauty chains like Sephora and Ulta.\u201cEveryone is carving away at different parts of the business,\u201d said Liz Dunn, the chief executive of Talmage Advisors, a retail consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that these retailers that have this rent advantage can\u2019t seem to make it worth it.\u201dNowhere is this shift more evident than in apparel. Two years ago, annual sales at TJX eclipsed those of Macy\u2019s for the first time, as the company drew consumers to its relatively smaller stores with a treasure-hunt-like experience and brand-name discounts. TJX posted $29 billion in sales for the year that ended Jan. 31, 2015, while Macy\u2019s revenue was $28 billion, a gap that has widened since then.Some of the money Macy\u2019s will save with its closures and job cuts will be diverted to its own version of T. J. Maxx, called Macy\u2019s Backstage, an effort akin to off-price chains like Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off 5th. Macy\u2019s, which operated 22 of the Backstage stores at the end of October, said it will open 50 more in the next two years. Many will be within current Macy\u2019s locations.Still, the stores remain exposed to changing conditions. The real estate industry ranks malls with letter grades like report cards, assigning \u201cA++\u201d to the highest-end locations that make nearly $1,000 in sales per square feet and a \u201cC\u201d to those that generate one-third or less of that and are at risk of closing. Sears, Macy\u2019s and J. C. Penney, the biggest mall anchors, are also the most exposed to C malls, according to Green Street Advisors.\u201cThe recognition now is that you can\u2019t have this long dragging tail and you\u2019ve got to cut it off right now so you can concentrate on the best stores,\u201d Mr. Sosnick said. \u201cThese are the retailers that went into the earliest shopping malls, and so have stores in malls that have been degraded tremendously over time, and that\u2019s what you see being closed today.\u201dBy the time Macy\u2019s finishes closing its stores, it will have shuttered nearly 200 locations since 2010. Today, it has 730 stores. At the end of October, J. C. Penney had 1,014 stores, 90 fewer than five years ago, while Sears, which also owns Kmart, had 676 full-line stores with its name, a 192-location drop in the same period.\u201cBrick-and-mortar is not necessarily dead, but you need fewer stores to achieve the same amount of sales volume,\u201d Ms. Dunn said. \u201cA lot of retailers need to shrink their store base, and that is tied to everything that\u2019s happened with digital and changing shopping patterns.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Terry J. Lundgren, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that while the trend was \u201cconsistent with the lower end of our guidance, we had anticipated sales would be stronger.\u201dHe attributed the decline to \u201cbroader challenges\u201d facing much of the retail industry.Consumers, who endured a long recession, have turned to low-cost chains like T. J.

Stores at the Marketplace Mall in Rochester; at the Oakdale Mall in Johnson City, N.Y., near Binghamton; and at the Preakness Shopping Center in Wayne, N.J., will close, the company said.Of the 68, three were closed by the middle of 2016, 63 will close in the spring and two will be closed by the middle of 2017. Three other locations were sold or are to be sold. The company said it planned to close about 30 other stores over the next few years.Some employees may be offered positions at nearby stores, but Macy\u2019s estimated that 3,900 workers would be affected by the closings. It also said it planned to restructure parts of its business, leading to a reduction of an additional 6,200 jobs. Over all, the job cuts represent about 7 percent of its work force.The company estimated that the changes would save about $550 million a year, starting in 2017.Mr. Lundgren said the company was closing stores that were \u201cunproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations because of changes in the local retail shopping landscape.\u201d Other sites were being targeted for closing to take advantage of their highly valued real estate.The company, which owns the Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s brands, has been struggling with declining traffic in its stores, where the bulk of its business is still conducted. It plans to invest some of its savings in expanding its digital business.Macy\u2019s said it now expected to earn $2.95 to $3.10 per share on an adjusted basis for its 2016 fiscal year, compared with its prior forecast of $3.15 to $3.40 per share.Shares in Macy\u2019s fell nearly 10 percent to $32.30 in after-hours trading on Wednesday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Counting the Winners and Losers From an Import-Based Tax", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byThe idea of a broad tax on importers is suddenly at the center of the Washington policy debate, with the inevitable counting of potential winners and losers.Such a tax could hit retailers the hardest if it takes full effect, with their heavy reliance on products as varied as microwave ovens from China and T-shirts from Bangladesh. But few sectors of the American economy and few consumers would be unaffected.If such a tax were imposed on imports from around the world, automakers could face hefty tax bills not only for cars imported from Mexico and elsewhere but also for the many auto parts they buy from overseas for their assembly lines in the United States. Chemical companies, supplying practically every industry, could find themselves paying more for feedstocks. And energy companies could wind up paying more for imported oil.The Republican leadership of the House Ways and Means Committee has been working in recent months on such a plan, a border-adjusted tax, as part of an effort to cut corporate tax rates. On Thursday, the plan got caught up in a discussion of ways to make Mexico pay for a proposed border wall, before the White House stepped back from endorsing that course.If a border-adjusted tax is used to offset a reduction in corporate tax rates, American exporters and their employees would rank among the winners.Yet, even in its broader form, the tax plan could be politically tricky. If a tax covers oil imports, for example, it would end up falling most heavily on rural Americans, who voted heavily for President Trump but also tend to drive farther each year than residents of heavily Democratic large cities.The tax \u201cwould be a boon for producers but it would be a negative for consumers \u2014 it\u2019s going to hit the pocketbooks of his supporters the hardest,\u201d said Ed Hirs, a managing director of Hillhouse Resources, an oil and gas company based in Houston.Even those seemingly safe from import taxes, exporters like Boeing and American farmers, could also lose sales if other countries retaliated. Banks on Wall Street could lose overseas contracts to represent initial public offerings if foreign governments responded by steering their companies to European or Asian rivals.By international standards, the United States puts few taxes on consumption, while taxing producers more heavily. The House Republican proposal would start to shift that balance, and one likely effect would be somewhat higher prices at retailers including gas stations and Walmart.Many small manufacturers without overseas factories have long favored an overhaul of the United States tax code that would increase corporate taxes on importers. The money raised from such a tax increase, they have argued, could then be used to offset a reduction in the overall corporate tax rate of 35 percent.Powerful business groups like the American Chamber of Commerce have said little about such proposals, because of deep divisions in corporate America based on who would pay the import tax and who might benefit from a reduction in corporate taxes.But Mr. Trump and his spokesman, Sean Spicer, may have complicated the House Republicans\u2019 efforts by raising the possibility of imposing such a tax on goods from Mexico first, with the money used to pay for a wall along the Mexican border to deter illegal immigration. The White House later said it was just one of the methods being considered.Linking the plan to Mexico left corporate groups mostly silent, leery of offending the president by criticizing him but also leery of offending Americans who dislike Mr. Trump\u2019s denunciations of Mexico and Mexican immigrants.Industrial labor unions in the United States have been more open to increased taxes on imports from Mexico. After the November election, Dennis Williams, president of the United Automobile Workers, expressed support generally for the president\u2019s advocacy of tariffs on Mexican imports.\u201cI think his position on trade is right on,\u201d Mr. Williams said.If a tax is imposed, the retailing industry, and particularly apparel retailers, could be among the hardest hit. Much of the clothing sold in the United States is made overseas, and retailers have little wiggle room to raise their prices to compensate for higher costs.And the timing could not be worse: Retailers, particularly apparel companies and department stores, have struggled more than other sectors of the economy to recover from the recession.Tighter budgets, Amazon and many new discount chains have conditioned shoppers never to pay full price. In recent years, that has created a discounting war that has decimated once-mighty retail titans like Macy\u2019s and other department stores.Could those same stores start charging more because of the proposed plan to raise the costs on imports?Unthinkable.But David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, said that retailers would have no choice but to raise prices.\u201cI really hope everybody understands that what they\u2019re really talking about is a 20 percent tax on the U.S. consumer,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s like building the wall and having the U.S. consumer pay for it.\u201dBut even if a 20 percent tax on imports were imposed, its effect on retail prices would be far smaller in percentage terms. That is because the value of imports is essentially calculated based on their wholesale value, which may be a quarter or less of the retail price for items like apparel. So the extra tax would fall on only a small share of the total costs of most companies.Apparel companies could be among the most vulnerable if corporate taxes rise for importers of goods from all over the world, since many of the clothes sold in the United States come from China or Bangladesh. Budget-friendly retailers in particular run the risk of alienating customers by raising costs.But while most of the retail industry is alarmed at the thought of higher import taxes, some retailers could actually win if the Republican plan goes through. Stores that operate primarily in the United States and cater to less price-sensitive shoppers could actually see their profits increase, according to some estimates. That is because the imported goods they sell actually make up a small share of their overall costs, while they spend heavily on attractive stores, American staff wages and marketing promotions.The beauty retailer Ulta is one such company, according to Goldman Sachs, which predicted that net income could actually rise by 21 percent.Ulta sells thousands of cosmetics from brands like Chloe and Clinique, many of which depend on overseas factories, according to the company\u2019s financial filings. But Ulta may benefit more from the part of the House Republican proposal that would reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate.As for the higher import taxes, \u201cthey can actually pass along some of the price,\u201d Simeon Siegel, a retailing analyst with the investment bank Nomura, said.By contrast, a tax on imports from Mexico could wreak havoc on finely balanced supply chains in the auto industry. More than two million Mexican-made vehicles were sold in the United States in 2015, according to the International Trade Administration, representing a little over a tenth of the American market. The products range from full-size pickup trucks made by General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, midsize sedans produced by Ford, and small cars assembled by foreign automakers such as Honda and Nissan.Some automakers are more vulnerable than others. The German automaker Volkswagen, for example, imports more than 30 percent of the vehicles it sells in the United States from Mexico. The figure is closer to 15 percent for the two largest American auto companies, G.M. and Ford.A 20 percent tariff would probably have to be passed on, at least in part, to consumers. That could add thousands of dollars to the sticker price of affected vehicles \u2014 and perhaps cause sharp declines in their sales.Mexico also exports about $50 billion in auto parts annually to the United States for use in American assembly plants. Tariffs on those parts would add significant costs to American-built vehicles that use them.Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated criticisms of Mexican exports to the United States have prompted several automakers, including the big Detroit companies, to announce plans to increase investment and jobs in their American factories.Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Fiat Chrysler, said Thursday that policies that force car companies to curtail or abandon Mexican production would have a major impact on the industry.\u201cThe question about repatriation of all of the manufacturing footprint into the United States has got monumental consequences to the industry over all,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said in a conference call with analysts.An earlier version of a picture caption accompanying this article misidentified a Ford Motor executive. The picture showed Mark Fields, the chief executive of Ford, not Ziad Ojakli, a group vice president.Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Legal Challenges Mount Against Trump\u2019s Travel Ban", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump faced intensifying legal challenges on Monday over his decree sharply restricting immigration from the Muslim world, as two Democratic-leaning states signaled that they would attack the policy in court and a Muslim advocacy group filed a lawsuit calling the order an unconstitutional religious test.The emerging legal actions are an aggressive effort by Democratic officials in the states to undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, amid a chaotic debate in Congress over the propriety of the policy. Many Democrats at the state level have vowed to use every instrument at their disposal to thwart or blunt the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.In Washington State, Gov. Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson, both Democrats, announced on Monday that they would file a lawsuit seeking to gut Mr. Trump\u2019s order, calling it a blunt attack on the Muslim faith that would damage businesses and individuals in the state.Mr. Ferguson said in a news conference that the suit would be broader than any litigation filed elsewhere, and would be aimed at \u201cinvalidating the president\u2019s unlawful action nationwide.\u201d He said the state\u2019s complaint would be backed by statements from major companies with their headquarters there, including Amazon and Expedia, attesting to the damaging nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s action.\u201cThis is un-American,\u201d Mr. Inslee said of the executive order. \u201cIt is wrong and it will not stand.\u201dThe Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, also a Democrat, intends to join a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union against Mr. Trump\u2019s policy, said people briefed on Ms. Healey\u2019s plans, who spoke on condition of anonymity because court documents have not yet been filed.Ms. Healey is expected to file a motion to intervene on Tuesday morning, making the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a plaintiff in the existing litigation and claiming extensive harm to state institutions, including the University of Massachusetts, where students and faculty members would be directly affected by Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban.The motion is expected to say that complying with Mr. Trump\u2019s order would force public institutions in Massachusetts to discriminate illegally on the basis of religion and national origin, the people familiar with Ms. Healey\u2019s plans said.Federal district courts in multiple states, including New York and Massachusetts, have issued temporary stays on important components of the order, preventing the government from deporting some people who had already arrived in the United States and ordering that people affected by the policy be granted access to legal counsel.It is uncertain how the legal challenges will fare in court. But they could significantly complicate Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to deliver on his campaign promises in short order, and may transform an action carried out by the stroke of a pen into a legal struggle lasting months or even years.As a political matter, the expected lawsuits from Massachusetts and Washington State could also be an important first test of Democratic state attorneys general as they seek to push back against the Trump administration.With Mr. Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, Democratic legal officers at the state level have increasingly cast themselves as a check on Mr. Trump.As an inspiration for their tactics, Democrats have cited the yearslong legal assault against the Obama administration by Republican state attorneys general, who succeeded in delaying or unwinding critical White House actions in court over the last eight years.More than a dozen state attorneys general, all Democrats, signed a letter over the weekend condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order. In addition to Washington State and Massachusetts, attorneys general in several other states are considering taking action against the executive order, but they have not yet announced specific plans for litigation.The White House has defended the executive order as a national security precaution, and advisers to Mr. Trump have insisted that it does not represent a religious test because it screens people chiefly on the basis of geography rather than religion.Groups challenging the order have described it as a kind of backdoor religious test, and have cited Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on the campaign trail denouncing Muslim immigrants and vowing to block them wholesale from entering the United States.In its lawsuit against the Trump administration, the Council on American-Islamic Relations called Mr. Trump\u2019s policy a \u201cMuslim Exclusion Order,\u201d extensively citing Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Islam during the presidential campaign and his pledge during the Republican primaries to shut off all Muslim immigration into the United States.\u201cDefendant Trump has often repeated his bigoted views on Islam and Muslims in a variety of contexts \u2014 in print, on television, and via official campaign statements,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cThe Muslim Exclusion Order is the legal manifestation of those bigoted views.\u201dStephanie Saul contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expedia Supports Lawsuit Against Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byUpdateOn Monday, the company \u2014 which is based in Bellevue, Wash., and is the world\u2019s largest online travel firm, with more than $72 billion a year in annual bookings across its 30 brands \u2014 filed a declaration as part of Washington State\u2019s lawsuit against the president. (Amazon did the same.)Mr. Khosrowshahi said 1,000 Expedia customers were affected by the ban.Expedia\u2019s declaration, filed by the company\u2019s general counsel, Robert Dzielak, outlines the damage the ban could have on the company and on the travel industry as a whole.\u201cExpedia believes that the executive order jeopardizes its corporate mission and could have a detrimental impact on its business and employees, as well as the broader U.S. and global travel and tourism industry,\u201d the company said.In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Mr. Khosrowshahi, who is a member of the board of directors of The New York Times, spoke about the declaration. Edited excerpts are below.Q. How did Expedia get involved with the lawsuit?A. The State of Washington let us know on Sunday that the suit was something they were considering and asked for our support. We are generally not aggressive against issues that do not relate to our company, but this is travel, our soul and spirit, and we felt we had to respond. Honestly, it was not a debate whether we should we be involved.How will a temporary restraining order against the ban, as requested by the State of Washington, help Expedia?The declaration is about helping our employees and the 1,000 or so Expedia travelers who are currently affected by the ban. Internally, the order has raised a fair amount of anxiety among our employees about where they can travel. We are a United States-based company but a global brand, and we have people flying to Asia, Europe and other parts of the world to do their jobs. Also, although we recruit talent from the United States to join Expedia, we also look for talent from around the world, and the ban makes it more difficult to recruit employees from the seven countries that are part of the ban.Can you explain what it entails to help the 1,000 Expedia customers who are affected by the ban and what the financial cost is to do so?We do not have a financial estimate at this point, but we are trying to help them by contacting them and getting clarity on their situation. If they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to complete their travel, we help them make alternate plans and incur the costs of those plans. We have seen the travel industry come together on this ban \u2014 all of our supply partners have been as flexible as they can be to help those impacted.Of the seven countries included in the ban, Iran, where you are from, has become a more popular tourist destination for United States citizens in the last year. Given the ban, do you expect that will change?I think it is bound to have an impact on the Iranian tourism industry. I have not been back to Iran since my family left in 1978, but I have a cousin who recently went with his family, and I can tell you that it is a wonderful place to visit with welcoming people and great food.Expedia aside, how will the ban hurt the travel industry as a whole?I think, in general, uncertain times such as terrorist attacks and wars hurt travel, so travel may become more subdued. But, on the other hand, people want to travel and explore different cultures, so it will ultimately come back.Do you think that the ban will affect international tourism to the United States?That certainly is a danger. As the perception of the United States as a welcoming place for all changes among travelers globally, the country\u2019s tourism market, which is a huge revenue generator for the economy, could get hurt.In your opinion, will United States passport holders be subject to greater scrutiny as they travel globally?I think it is tough to tell. Having a United States passport has been an incredible asset, and I hope that will continue to be the case.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Takes a Right Turn", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byMost tech executives and employees remain supportive of Democrats, especially on social and cultural issues. The Republican tilt of the PACs at Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook suggests, however, that as these companies\u2019 domains grow larger, their bottom-line interests are becoming increasingly aligned with the policies of the Republican Party.In 2016, the Microsoft PAC gave $478,818 to Republican House candidates and $272,000 to Democratic House candidates. It gave $164,000 to Republican Senate candidates, and $75,000 to Democratic Senate candidates.This was not small change. In 2016 Microsoft employees gave a total of $6.47 million.The firm first became a noticeable player in the world of campaign finance in 2012 when employees and the company PAC together made contributions of $910,000. That year, Facebook employees backed Democrats over Republicans 64-35, while the company\u2019s PAC tilted Republican, 53-46.By 2016, when total Facebook contributions reached $3.8 million, the Democratic advantage in employee donations shrank to 51-47, while the PAC continued to favor Republicans, 56-44.While the employees of the three other most valuable tech companies, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and Apple, remained Democratic in their giving in 2016, at the corporate level of Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 that is, at the level of their PACs \u2014 they have not.Tech giants can no longer be described as insurgents challenging corporate America.American consumer technology companies are getting larger, more entrenched in their own sectors, more powerful in new sectors and better insulated against surprising competition from upstarts.Among Ferenstein\u2019s findings: a minority, 29 percent, of tech company founders described labor unions as \u201cgood,\u201d compared to 73 percent of Democrats. Asked \u201cis meritocracy naturally unequal?\u201d tech founders overwhelmingly agreed.Ferenstein went on:One hundred percent of the smaller sample of founders to whom I presented this question said they believe that a truly meritocratic economy would be \u201cmostly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unequal. This is a key distinction: Opportunity is about maximizing people\u2019s potential, which founders tend to believe is highly unequal. Founders may value citizen contributions to society, but they don\u2019t think all citizens have the potential to contribute equally. When asked what percent of national income the top 10% would hold in such a scenario, a majority (67%) of founders believed that the richest individuals would control 50% or more of total income, while only 31% of the public believes such an outcome would occur in a meritocratic society.One of the most interesting questions posed by Ferenstein speaks to middle and working class anxieties over global competition:In international trade policy, some people believe the U.S. government should create laws that favor American business with policies that protect it from global competition, such as fees on imported goods or making it costly to hire cheaper labor in other countries (\u201coutsourcing\u201d). Others believe it would be better if there were less regulations and businesses were free to trade and compete without each country favoring their own industries. Which of these statements come closest to your belief?There was a large difference between tech company officials, 73 percent of whom chose free trade and less regulation, while only 20 percent of Democrats supported those choices.Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University who writes about demographic, social and economic trends, sees these differences as the source of deep conflict within the Democratic Party.The disruptive force is largely Silicon Valley, a natural oligarchy that now funds a party teetering toward populism and even socialism. The fundamental contradictions, as Karl Marx would have noted, lie in the collision of interests between a group that has come to epitomize self-consciously progressive mega-wealth and a mass base which is increasingly concerned about downward mobility.The tech elite, Kotkin writes, \u201cfar from deserting the Democratic Party, more likely will aim take to take it over.\u201d Until very recently, theconflict between populists and tech oligarchs has been muted, in large part due to common views on social issues like gay marriage and, to some extent, environmental protection. But as the social issues fade, having been \u201cwon\u201d by progressives, the focus necessarily moves to economics, where the gap between these two factions is greatest.Kotkin sees future partisan machination in cynical terms:One can expect the oligarchs to seek out a modus vivendi with the populists. They could exchange a regime of higher taxes and regulation for ever-expanding crony capitalist opportunities and political protection. As the hegemons of today, Facebook and Google, not to mention Apple and Amazon, have an intense interest in protecting themselves, for example, from antitrust legislation. History is pretty clear: Heroic entrepreneurs of one decade often turn into the insider capitalists of the next.In 2016, Donald Trump has produced an upheaval within the Republican Party that shifted attention away from the less explosive turmoil in Democratic ranks.Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed bid to finesse the inherent conflict between her dependence on corporate contributions and her need for a strong turnout by union workers, minorities and idealistic millennials embodies the Democratic Party\u2019s long term struggle.The public, at least for the moment, is not willing to support the continued compromise of principle that has been a hallmark of both parties. Trump has provided a temporary solution for the Republican Party; the Democrats need to find a legitimate and more lasting one.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chief Executive of Audio Firm Sonos Steps Down", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Over the years, Sonos has weathered competition from better known rivals like Apple and Bose to find a devoted audience among audio enthusiasts. But lately its wireless speaker has lost ground to an unexpected competitor, Amazon\u2019s Echo.Now it faces another challenge: a change in the corner office. After 14 years leading the company he helped found, John MacFarlane has resigned as chief executive of Sonos and has been replaced by one of his deputies, Patrick Spence.Mr. MacFarlane, 50, has also left the company\u2019s board of directors, though he will remain an employee to help mentor colleagues and work on other projects. He said he left the board so Mr. Spence would not feel like he was always looking over his shoulder.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be that founder who\u2019s always second-guessing,\u201d Mr. MacFarlane said.Sonos is a rarity among technology companies, started in 2002 at a time when independent hardware companies in consumer electronics, an industry dominated by much bigger players, were hard to find. Mr. MacFarlane did not take venture capital money for several years and kept the company private, shunning the usual routine of selling shares to the public or being acquired by a bigger company.Sonos \u2014 based hundreds of miles away from the glare of Silicon Valley in the seaside town of Santa Barbara, Calif. \u2014 does not have the visibility of an Apple, Facebook or Uber. But it has amassed a loyal following with its family of wireless speakers, which allow people to play music streamed from internet services like Spotify or stored on a local computer.One of the secrets to Sonos\u2019s business is that once listeners become hooked on the sound from one of the company\u2019s speakers, they tend to buy more of them so they can simultaneously play music in multiple rooms in their homes.Mr. MacFarlane said he had planned to resign as chief executive earlier, citing his wife\u2019s bout with breast cancer and his aging parents as factors. But last year he delayed his plans when Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker unexpectedly began to eat into sales of Sonos speakers.While Echo has received mixed reviews for its sound quality, its Alexa voice assistant \u2014 which allows people to quickly play music with verbal commands \u2014 has captivated the tech industry and the public. More recently, Google introduced its own Echo competitor, Google Home, with a voice assistant.\u201cI fell into that trap where I\u2019ve been watching voice recognition for years,\u201d Mr. MacFarlane said. \u201cI tried Echo in the beginning and wrote it off. I had too many distractions at that time. I wasn\u2019t playing at the level I should have been playing at in all frankness.\u201dMr. MacFarlane said the company is in a better place than it was last year. The growth of streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, both of which work with its speakers, has helped stoke demand for Sonos products. The company said the number of households with Sonos speakers grew 20 percent this past holiday quarter from the same period the previous year.Mr. Spence, 42, said Sonos understands that its competition is no longer strictly the audio companies that it faced before. \u201cWith what Amazon and Google are doing, the world has changed completely,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re part of that new world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018La La Land\u2019 Has an Oscars Edge: Its Hollywoodness", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byThe CarpetbaggerSeven and a half weeks until the Oscars, folks, and the best-picture category remains by most measures a three-horse race, with \u201cLa La Land\u201d in the lead, \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d nipping at its heels and \u201cMoonlight\u201d solidly in third. This all could be upended, of course. But in prognostication land, this is pretty much the state of play.While the all-important guilds \u2014 actors, directors and producers \u2014 have yet to dole out their awards, one of this year\u2019s lead films has what may be an unassailable edge, for it is about the very thing that mesmerizes and seduces Hollywood the most: itself.\u201cLa La Land,\u201d a festival darling, serves up song-and-dance nostalgia and starry-eyed protagonists chasing Hollywood dreams, and it benefited enormously from its premiere at the Venice Film Festival in August, when weary American tastemakers were reeling from scorched-earth political campaigns back home.\u201cFilms about Hollywood have been, some would say, disproportionately awarded by \u2026 Hollywood,\u201d Tony Angellotti, a veteran awards strategist, wrote in an email. \u201cNot to say they have not been good films, but clearly they have a leg up in being considered by the various members of the academy.\u201dBut \u201cManchester\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d might not fit into the best-picture mold.Over the past decade, best-picture Oscars that have not gone to films about entertainers have often gone to movies with a message, mirroring values that academy members are keen to espouse.Recent messagey best-picture winners include \u201cSpotlight\u201d (detailing revelations that the Roman Catholic Church protected pedophilic priests), \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d (indicting the roots and legacy of slavery) and \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d (about a good soldier in a bad war).This season there aren\u2019t a whole lot of message movies in the mix. There\u2019s \u201cHell or High Water,\u201d with its renegade evisceration of predatory lending, and \u201cHacksaw Ridge,\u201d which blends patriotism with selfless pacifism; neither, however, are considered to be among the strongest contenders.While \u201cManchester\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d are wondrous yarns, their messages are less clear. \u201cManchester\u201d highlights the might and idiosyncrasies of family bonds but remains a tough tale with an antihero at its heart. \u201cMoonlight\u201d smashes stereotypes by bringing overlooked characters to the screen, revealing the vulnerabilities of young black men. Like \u201cManchester,\u201d it isn\u2019t exactly didactic.Onward to the actors races! Most of which are being led by performers from those three exhaustively aforementioned films.Over in the best-actress category, one of the most competitive this year, pundits are betting on Emma Stone, who stars in \u201cLa La Land,\u201d with Natalie Portman (\u201cJackie\u201d), who has won an Oscar, and five-time nominee Amy Adams (\u201cArrival\u201d) as her biggest challengers. All well and good, yet the Bagger remains astounded that Annette Bening, who has garnered four Oscar nominations but never a win, isn\u2019t leading this pack by miles for her mighty, nuanced performance in \u201c20th Century Women.\u201d A topic for another day.In best supporting actor, all indicators are pointing to Mahershala Ali, who played a tenderhearted drug dealer and father figure in \u201cMoonlight.\u201d Lucas Hedges (\u201cManchester\u201d), Dev Patel (\u201cLion\u201d) and Jeff Bridges (\u201cHell or High Water\u201d) are all likely to be nominees, too.Lastly, best director. While Kenneth Lonergan (who wrote and directed \u201cManchester\u201d) and Mr. Washington will probably be Oscar finalists, right now it\u2019s looking very good for the young \u2019uns: Barry Jenkins, 37, who directed \u201cMoonlight,\u201d and the astonishingly fresh-faced Damien Chazelle, who wrote and directed \u201cLa La Land,\u201d and is all of 31.Tuesday night at the New York Film Critics Circle ceremony, where he accepted the award for best picture (Mr. Jenkins collected best director), Mr. Chazelle made a plug for the importance of escapist idealism in these times.Tra la la!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "American Apparel Could Bolster Amazon\u2019s Standing With Trump", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIn the retail-store slump, Jeff Bezos may be holding a Trump card. Amazon.com, the e-commerce giant he runs, is considering a bid for the bankrupt American Apparel, according to a Reuters exclusive, just as Macy\u2019s and other department stores are losing sales and cutting staff. A deal could be a handy way to show a president-elect suspicious of Silicon Valley that thousands of working-class jobs are being saved.This would not be the main reason for Amazon to pounce on American Apparel, whose brand proudly emphasizes that it makes all its clothing in a Los Angeles factory employing 4,500 people. The business would be a natural fit with the Amazon\u2019s in-house fashion offerings that started last year, and with earlier acquisitions like Shopbop and Zappos.Still, the acquisition might have the added benefit of assuaging Donald J. Trump. The president-elect and the tech industry disagree on everything from encryption and free trade to immigration. Mr. Trump singled out Amazon during his campaign for criticism over antitrust issues, saying the company would have \u201csuch problems\u201d if he captured the White House. Mr. Bezos also personally owns The Washington Post, which has been a vocal critic of the incoming president.Now Mr. Trump is using Twitter to threaten companies he sees as doing wrong \u2014 whether it is Boeing, assailed for overcharging on Air Force One, or the likes of General Motors and Toyota, taken to task for potentially moving American jobs abroad to save money.Buying American Apparel could help make Mr. Bezos a savior of a dying industry. Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s on Wednesday reported November and December sales that were worse than expected, wiping 14 percent off Macy\u2019s valuation and 19 percent off Kohl\u2019s on Thursday. Macy\u2019s plans to close several locations and slash more than 10,000 jobs, or 7 percent of its work force.At the same time, digital retail sales are expected to reach more than $500 billion by 2020, a third higher than 2016 estimates, according to Forrester Research. And Amazon already owns 60 percent of the pie.A deal would not cost much, either: American Apparel currently has an offer from Gildan Activewear for just $66 million. And Amazon\u2019s avowed and proved lack of interest in short-term profit means it should have no problem keeping the retailer\u2019s jobs stateside.Brandishing some \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d credibility would be a smart bet by Mr. Bezos.Advertisement"}

The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration.By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination.In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades.Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the 10th-richest man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He good-naturedly obliged.The tech companies\u2019 reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did.That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump\u2019s order proclaimed that \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d and would be suspended indefinitely.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said that his great-grandparents had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam.Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was \u201cnot the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201d Mr. Musk was born in South Africa.Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, \u201cthere was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is.\u201dBeyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world.\u201cAlmost every company\u2019s products \u2014 Google, Apple, Airbnb \u2014 has a global customer base,\u201d Mr. Levie said. \u201cThese policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors.\u201dBy early last week, the companies sensed trouble.Murtadha al-Tameemi, 24, an Iraqi-born software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out.\u201cIt may be my na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how politics and industries interact, but I don\u2019t interpret the tech community\u2019s opposition to the president as a political stance,\u201d Mr. Tameemi said. \u201cIt seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them.\u201dThe larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was \u201cconcerned.\u201d Apple said, \u201cIt is not a policy we support.\u201d Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards\u201d and said it would create \u201ccollateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dIt was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. \u201cIt feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,\u201d said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One.Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists.Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media.Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory team.That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day.In an email to employees on Saturday titled \u201cStanding up for what\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday.As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers \u2014 largely immigrants \u2014 began a one-hour work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order.Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen.\u201cAfter the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,\u201d Mr. Altman said. \u201cNow they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come.\u201dMr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p.m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Instagram Explore", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byLetter of RecommendationI hate almost everything about my iPhone: what it does (distract me), what it cultivates (inattention), what it costs ($649) and how it looks (inert). But there is one capability for which I venerate this problematic rectangle. My iPhone has alerted me to a fuller range of human weirdness than I could ever have imagined.When I lie awake in bed at night, I do what many people do and let the Explore tab of Instagram whisk me away into a wonderland of bizarre self-expression and painstaking narcissism. I explore fascistic dietary regimens and admire women who have squatted or implanted their butts into a condition that would give R. Crumb a heart attack. I encounter the possibility of owning a pet squirrel. I observe Indonesian death rituals, 3-D latte \u201cart\u201d and garden hedges that people have groomed into the shape of elephants.In this way, a smartphone becomes the modern substitute for having an imagination. Most of us are seeking a specific feeling when we go on these idle internet journeys. The feeling varies from person to person and mood to mood. Sometimes we want to feel amazed (butts). Sometimes we want to feel amused (squirrels). Sometimes we want to feel contemptuous (fascistic diets). Sometimes we want to feel horny (butts again). But occasionally we discover something that transcends momentary satisfaction. Something compelling in its mystery. Something that provokes the investigative impulse to confirm whether or not the phenomenon is, as it were, \u201ca thing.\u201dThe Explore tab is your gateway to such oddities. To access this digital Narnia, you open up Instagram and tap the icon of a magnifying glass in your account. That leads you to an overwhelming grid of pictures and videos that renews endlessly by way of an algorithm that none of us will ever comprehend. \u201cPosts are selected automatically based on things like the people you follow or the posts you like,\u201d says the Instagram help page, which does not explain how my Explore page became cluttered with hedges and ritually desiccated corpses.But I\u2019m not complaining! Unlike the algorithms used by Amazon (which are sneaky) or Facebook (which abetted the spread of fake news), Instagram\u2019s Explore feature strikes me as refreshingly non-sinister. It provides curated randomness \u2014 a category that can exist only in an era of algorithms. The distance between what I like and what Instagram thinks I might like is oceanic, preposterous, deranged. And yet the algorithm is not wrong. I press the \u201clike\u201d button on a picture of my friend, and the Explore page shows me albino crocodiles. I comment on a cute dog, and the Explore page offers circus contortionists. Suddenly I like those things, too. Lurking inside my bland device is a fire hose of peculiarity that I can blast open whenever I choose.Using the same tools and creams I keep in my medicine cabinet, Bosco had retrofitted her face into an object with 180-degree rotational symmetry, which meant that it looked the same right side up as it did upside down. (Other items with this form of symmetry include parallelograms, the letter Z, and the New York Times crossword puzzle.) Her makeup was elaborate, and her features were expressionless; the face staring into the camera was as neutral as an Advil tablet. Bosco amazed me.The algorithm sensed my excitement. When I went back to the Explore page, it was populated with images of other young makeup artists who had executed the two-face look on themselves. (The look, it turns out, is a thing.) It wasn\u2019t merely the technical chops of the makeup artists that thrilled me, but the intensity and idiosyncrasy of their self-expression. Broadcasting the weird and obscure parts of your character has not historically been a favorite pastime of teenagers, but the internet has rendered that version of adolescence obsolete. In Bosco\u2019s world, trying too hard is not a sign of loserdom but a testament to focus. In this world, a person can spend seven hours alone in her room applying liquid latex over her eyebrows to a reception of 2,700 comments saying \u201cAwesome!\u201d in a variety of languages.If I hadn\u2019t landed on Bosco\u2019s account, I would have never experienced the reality of a rotationally symmetrical teenage face. I\u2019m aware that this is not a huge deal, or even a deal of any size. But Bosco is symbolic. D.I.Y. broadcast mediums like Instagram have ushered in a golden age of personal eccentricity. In the history of humanity, the vast spectrum of private weirdness has never been so public. People use (and in many cases, waste) their time in astonishing ways. It\u2019s inspiring. If it didn\u2019t exist, a science-fiction novelist would have to invent it: a magic button that grants access to a globe-size playpen of oddballs and misfits.Molly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "Prison Riot in Brazil Leaves at Least 10 Inmates Dead", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 At least 10 prisoners have been killed in a prison riot in northeastern Brazil, the latest in a wave of fatal uprisings in the country\u2019s overcrowded prisons that have killed nearly 100 this year \u2014 with many of the victims decapitated and mutilated.The riot began around 5 p.m. Saturday at the State Penitentiary of Alca\u00e7uz, near Natal in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte, said Juliska Azevedo, a spokeswoman for the state government.In a statement, the authorities said that the riot was caused by a fight between prisoners from two wings and that at least 10 had been confirmed dead.\u201cA group of prisoners managed to get out of their cells and invade another wing,\u201d said Caio Bezerra, the secretary of public security and social defense for Rio Grande do Norte. \u201cThere were frictions, there were attacks. But police are already working to contain the situation so it does not reach other pavilions in the same prison.\u201dLate Saturday, the police had yet to regain control of the entire prison. Crowds of desperate relatives had gathered outside, and some had even fought with the police in attempts to get inside.The authorities are examining images circulating on social media, including one of three decapitated heads in a prison yard, Mr. Bezerra said.\u201cWe are verifying if that happened at Alca\u00e7uz,\u201d he said.Television reports from the scene described gunfire and showed images of inmates on the prison roof.\u201cThere was the sound of shots and a riot,\u201d Ms. Azevedo said.Killings and decapitations are common in Brazil\u2019s prisons, where conditions are sometimes described as medieval, but violence has exploded this year \u2014 the latest uprising followed the massacre of 56 prisoners during a 17-hour riot at a jail near Manaus in the Amazon state of Amazonas on New Year\u2019s Day. Many of the dead were decapitated and dismembered. Four more prisoners were killed in a nearby prison the next day.The state authorities ascribed blame for the Manaus deaths to the Family of the North, an Amazon drug gang that had attacked prisoners connected to a rival gang, the S\u00e3o Paulo-based First Capital Command. The gangs were believed to be fighting for control of lucrative drug smuggling routes.Four days later, 33 prisoners were killed and many were dismembered at a prison in Boa Vista in Roraima State, in the far north of Brazil. The state authorities said the First Capital Command was behind the killings. Then four more prisoners were killed in a third Manaus prison after being moved from the site of the first massacre.Ms. Azevedo said that the gang, known by its Portuguese acronym, P.C.C., and a Rio Grande do Norte gang called the Crime Syndicate were involved in the riot on Saturday. The prison has a capacity of about 620 prisoners but was holding 1,100, she said.Mr. Bezerra said the involvement of the gangs would be confirmed only after investigations were completed.\u201cWe are investigating if this was really an action between gangs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the gangs that act in the prisons of Rio Grande do Norte.\u201dThe Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper published photographs on its website of prisoners climbing over a wall and running through a prison yard. It quoted a Natal judge, Henrique dos Santos, who said that some cells in the jail had no bars.\u201cThe prisoners were in charge inside,\u201d the judge said, according to Estado. \u201cThe state just controlled the walls.\u201dA report on the Tribuna do Norte website quoting the president of the state prison agents\u2019 union said the riot began when weapons were thrown over the walls of the prison from \u201csupport cars\u201d and one gang invaded a wing controlled by another.Ms. Azevedo said that it was unlikely that riot police officers could retake control of the jail until daylight, and that the final death toll could be much higher.The wave of prison killings and riots has developed into a political crisis for President Michel Temer. On Saturday, the justice minister, Alexandre de Moraes, said in a television interview that the country had 650,000 prisoners \u2014 almost 300,000 more than its capacity.He has released a preliminary plan to build more high-security federal prisons and to reduce drug crime and homicides.\u201cThe system has been overcrowded for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep saying there is no magic trick to solve the problem. It is chronic in Brazil.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When I spoke to his counselor about bringing him home to say goodbye, she told me that she thought his leaving the facility now is a bad idea. (I didn\u2019t say: \u201cAnd letting his mother die without saying goodbye to him is a good idea?\u201d) I don\u2019t want to be difficult with the counselor. But can I bring this up again? And what should I tell my wife, who asks often?JACK, PENNSYLVANIAIf anyone on earth is allowed to be difficult right now, Jack, it is you. I am so sorry for your troubles. And I admire your attempt to manage these tough, competing claims with grace. To the counselor, say: \u201cI respect your opinion that my son should stay on site now. But I worry about the future repercussions of his missing his chance to say goodbye to his mom. Can we revisit this issue with his team?\u201dAs it stands, we don\u2019t know enough about the counselor\u2019s reasoning or your son\u2019s condition. You might float the idea of engaging a travel companion for your son, who could see him safely to your wife\u2019s door, then back to the facility again. Or perhaps his physical (or emotional) state is too delicate for travel \u2014 or for a traumatic visit with his dying mother. But one thing is certain: Raising this issue again with his treatment team falls squarely in the zone of loving familial behavior. Go for it.As for your wife, tell her you are working on your son\u2019s visit. Share your landmark memories of raising him, regardless of the travel outcome. And encourage her to talk all she wants \u2014 of happy times and sad. Your job isn\u2019t to fix problems right now, but to listen and hold your wife\u2019s hand, as she says all the things she needs to say. My thoughts are with you.My boyfriend and I are in our early 20s. We have been together for over two years. We live with our families and have good jobs. Recently, I\u2019ve been spending more time with his family, as it\u2019s closer to work. I\u2019ve noticed that his mother cleans his room, packs his lunch, cooks dinner for him and even schedules his appointments. (He contributes nothing in return.) I am worried about his lack of self-sufficiency, and I simply mentioned that he shouldn\u2019t depend on his mother so much. He got very defensive about their relationship. Was I out of line?DELANEYIf you want to drive a young straight guy bonkers (in my experience), call him a \u201cmama\u2019s boy.\u201d (Again, in my experience: Most of them are.) I suspect they hear it as a knock on their raging masculinity or some creepy Oedipal accusation. But, dude, if your mom is washing your underpants at 24, you have officially failed to launch.I get your worry. If your relationship progresses, you fear that you will inherit this man-child and presumably begin scheduling his teeth cleanings. But that hasn\u2019t happened yet. He isn\u2019t asking you to coddle him, correct? Try engaging him in adult tasks (a load of whites, anyone?) and praise him when he joins you. Avoid speaking with Big Mama; this is between you and your beau. You may advise him that full-time maid service will not be part of your relationship with him. But put yourself in his shoes: Who packs lunch if someone else will do it for us?For years, I worked as a lawyer at a corporate law firm. I didn\u2019t like it, but I didn\u2019t hate it. And I earned lots of money. Last year, I was fired in a reorganization and became certified as a yoga teacher. Since then, I love my work every day. My question is what to say to friends who act like I\u2019m crazy for doing a job where I earn a quarter of what I used to, and ask when I\u2019m going back to being a lawyer?ANONYMOUSWho cares what your judge-y friends think? The universe gave you a little shove, and you turned it into a beautiful upward-facing dog. (That\u2019s a yoga pose, for the three readers who don\u2019t know.)

The biggest stars often skipped those parties altogether, and instead beelined to the exclusive talent agency fests, held at the Sunset Tower Hotel and the Chateau Marmont.The Bagger first cornered the preternaturally glamorous Joan Collins, as the British actress was carefully ascending a small flight of stairs at the Fox party.\u201cI think she is one of the greatest actresses of a generation,\u201d Ms. Collins said of Ms. Streep. \u201cShe has the right to say whatever she wants.

{"Headline": "Wall Street Reassures Employees, Without Wholly Rejecting Travel Ban", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byWall Street is an industry built on courting clients around the globe and hiring some of the best and brightest, wherever they may be.Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, issued perhaps the only condemnation by a Wall Street firm of Mr. Trump\u2019s order, saying it was \u201cnot a policy we support.\u201dMr. Blankfein\u2019s carefully worded criticism still stood as one of the sharpest responses from the finance industry, where business is fundamentally about moving money across the globe. Wall Street has deep roots to immigrants. Marcus Goldman, as a case in point, was a German immigrant, as were the Lehman brothers.And Wall Street, perhaps more than any other industry except the technology business, has prided itself on hiring top job candidates from anywhere in the world. That said, some banking executives said it was unclear how much the still-evolving contours of the travel ban would affect their staffs, with some saying relatively few employees appeared to have been affected thus far.Still, the finance sector has had to confront growing nationalist sentiment in the United States and Britain, where the vote to leave the European Union, widely known as Brexit, has threatened to drive out much of that country\u2019s financial industry, which could limit global trade and the flow of both money and qualified employees.\u201cI think it would probably hurt them because they do tend to rely on the best international talent, regardless of where they\u2019re from,\u201d said Charles Geisst, a professor at Manhattan College who has studied Wall Street.But the finance industry has largely been cautious in moving into political controversy outside its focus on regulation.So perhaps it was unsurprising that Mr. Blankfein used a voice mail message sent to employees on Sunday \u2014 a time-honored Wall Street way of delivering firmwide messages \u2014 to criticize the travel ban and note that parts of the executive order had been at least temporarily suspended.In his message, Mr. Blankfein cited Goldman\u2019s business principles, which included the line \u201cBeing diverse is not optional; it is what we must be.\u201dCitigroup\u2019s chief executive, Mike Corbat, told employees in an internal memorandum on Monday that the firm was \u201cconcerned about the message the executive order sends,\u201d and he encouraged finding \u201cthe right balance between protecting the country and its longstanding role as an open and welcoming society.\u201dAnd top officials at the asset-management giant BlackRock, which oversees $5 trillion in investments and counts big Middle Eastern countries as clients, said that while they recognized the need to keep the United States safe, any approach needed to respect the law.\u201cWe, of course, all want to promote security and combat terrorism, but we believe it needs to be done with respect for due process, individual rights and the principle of inclusion,\u201d the executives, including Laurence D. Fink, a founder and the chief executive, wrote.Still, other firms took a more cautious approach, refraining from outright criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. Most companies that issued statements said they intended to focus on helping any affected employees.In an internal memo, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s top executives said that they were both \u201cgrateful\u201d for efforts to keep the United States safe and supportive of diversity. Wells Fargo also posted a statement on its employee website saying that it was still assessing what the executive order meant for its business and employees but that it was \u201ccommitted to fostering a culture of diversity.\u201dBank of America said in a message from its chief executive, Brian Moynihan, that it was working to ensure it had the most accurate information to best help affected employees.The chief executive of Morgan Stanley, James P. Gorman, wrote to his employees, \u201cContinuing to draw on talent from across the globe is a key element of Morgan Stanley\u2019s culture and ultimately to our success in serving our clients.\u201dOther firms, such as Blackstone and TPG, had declined to comment.Here are the various responses that major financial firms have sent to their employees regarding the executive order. (Some have been edited to remove internal company phone numbers.) We\u2019ll update the list with more responses as we collect them.This is Lloyd. The president has issued an executive order that, generally, bans individuals from seven different countries from entering the United States and freezes the broader refugee program. This is not a policy we support, and I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court, and some of the order has been enjoined at least temporarily.If the order were to become or remain effective, I recognize that there is potential for disruption to the firm, and especially to some of our people and their families. I want to assure all of you that we will work to minimize such disruption to the extent we can within the law and are focused on supporting our colleagues and their families who may be affected.Let me close by quoting from our business principles: \u201cFor us to be successful, our men and women must reflect the diversity of the communities and cultures in which we operate. That means we must attract, retain and motivate people from many backgrounds and perspectives. Being diverse is not optional; it is what we must be.\u201d Now is a fitting time to reflect on those words and the principles that underlie them.To: All EmployeesFrom: James GormanWe are closely monitoring developments around the new United States travel restrictions imposed this weekend. While no individual employees were impacted in their travel to date, we are concerned for those individuals and their families who could be impacted and will provide them support as needed.Any employee who has questions about upcoming travel should contact the Global Travel and Security teams.We value immensely the contribution of all our employees from all over the world. Continuing to draw on talent from across the globe is a key element of Morgan Stanley\u2019s culture and ultimately to our success in serving our clients.In light of recent executive orders in the United States regarding immigration policy, we want every one of you to know of our unwavering commitment to the dedicated people working here at JPMorgan Chase. This includes a number of our outstanding employees \u2014 all of whom have adhered to our country\u2019s immigration and employment processes \u2014 who have come to the United States to serve our company, clients and communities.Over the weekend, we have worked to reach out to all JPMorgan Chase employees on sponsored visas who are potentially impacted by the recent orders. We understand the situation is evolving quickly, so if you have any concerns about your own situation and have not been contacted, please reach out to your local immigration specialist or human resources team.With more than 140,000 employees in the United States alone, we are grateful for the hard work and sacrifices made to keep our country safe. At the same time, we understand that our country, economy and well-being are strengthened by the rich diversity of the world around us, where we are dedicated to serving customers and communities in more than 100 countries every day.Thank you.Dear Colleagues,Since the weekend, we have been reviewing the executive order on immigration, as well as statements by administration officials, to assess its impact. As a United States company and the world\u2019s most global financial institution, we are concerned about the message the executive order sends, as well as the impact immigration policies could have on our ability to serve our clients and contribute to growth. We have been advising colleagues who could be affected and will continue to support them and their families.We are proud of Citi\u2019s diversity and the fact that we hail from over 100 countries. We encourage the leaders of the United States to find the right balance between protecting the country and its longstanding role as an open and welcoming society.Dear colleagues,Since Friday, we have been in touch with many colleagues, clients and friends worldwide concerned about the United States executive order restricting travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa.As a truly global company, we are proud of the diversity at BlackRock and proud of the diversity of our client relationships. We have long had valued colleagues and clients in Muslim nations, and, from the earliest days of our company, we have worked hard to build an inclusive culture that welcomes and values the contributions of people from all parts of the world.BlackRock will continue to embrace our values and culture, notwithstanding the challenges created by this order. Indeed, we believe that it is more important than ever that we promote our principles, which we established at the founding of our company 29 years ago, including our commitment to inclusion. We, of course, all want to promote security and combat terrorism, but we believe it needs to be done with respect for due process, individual rights and the principle of inclusion.In addition to the broader implications of this order, we have been working to assess the impact it may have on travel for BlackRock\u2019s employees. At this time, we believe there are relatively few individuals whose travel will be directly impacted, but of course the full implications are still being assessed. We also are closely monitoring the repercussions for United States citizens traveling abroad.As you have likely already seen in news reports, there are protests at many United States airports. Anyone traveling either internationally or domestically should anticipate longer delays getting to or from airports and passing through immigration. If you have any questions or concerns about your travel, please call the Corporate Security hotline 24 hours a day. We will continue to keep you posted as the situation evolves.BlackRock always has and will continue to engage with and welcome people in all parts of the world. That is at the root of who we are and always will be.Larry Fink, chairman and C.E.O.Rob Kapito, presidentJeff Smith, global head of human resourcesOn Friday, President Trump signed an executive order on immigration that includes a provision blocking citizens of seven countries from entering the United States for 90 days \u2014 these countries are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.The company is currently reviewing the executive order and its implications to determine whether it has any direct effect on team members or our business.\u201cWhile we are still assessing what this change means for Wells Fargo, we know that it may have deeply personal implications for team members who may have friends or family affected by it,\u201d says chief administrative officer Hope Hardison. \u201cAs always, Wells Fargo is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion where our team members are encouraged to value and respect others for their differences. These values will continue to be of great importance as we support team members who have been affected by this executive order.\u201dBelow is a message from C.E.O. Brian Moynihan.As a global company, we depend upon the diverse sources of talent that our teammates represent. In view of this, we are closely monitoring the recent refugee- and immigration-related executive order in the United States, and subsequent developments.We are connecting with teammates who may be affected, in response to questions. We also are working to ensure we have the most accurate and timely information to best assist potentially impacted teammates. We will share information and provide updates as the situation continues to develop.Advertisement"}

Mr. Clayton is expected to face similar scrutiny on his confirmation.Sullivan & Cromwell has also been the go-to law firm for Goldman Sachs, which Mr. Clayton advised on a $5 billion investment by Berkshire Hathaway. This is likely to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs wields too much influence in the administration.But some are pleased with the choice.Mr. Clayton is viewed as a pragmatic man with experience and knowledge of financial regulatory matters. Brad Whitman, vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, said the nominee had a \u201cgreat appreciation for what drives business and growth.\u201dThis could be useful because Federal Reserve officials, optimistic as they are about economic growth, see little chance of the boom that Mr. Trump promised.This is partly because they plan to raise interest rates if growth accelerates.

{"Headline": "For C.E.O.s, a New Concern: The Activist in Chief", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byDealBookFor years, chief executive officers lived in fear they would become a target of the activist investor Carl Icahn.Now, they live in dread of a different and somewhat more unexpected kind of activist: President Donald J. Trump.As corporate executives around the globe try to understand the implications of the Trump administration on their businesses, they seem to be having an almost bipolar reaction: a euphoric sense that regulations and taxes could soon be lowered \u2014 which would likely increase their profits and paychecks \u2014 yet a simultaneous anxiety that they could become a target of one of the president\u2019s Twitter tirades, which could undo their businesses or possibly their careers.Over the last two months, dozens of chief executives have made pilgrimages to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The ritual involves being photographed in the lobby in front of the gold elevators and having your name hastily tweeted by the throngs (journalistic and otherwise) involved in the spectator sport.For the moment, the action seems to have shifted to Washington. On Monday, a bevy of executives \u2014 Elon Musk of Tesla, Kevin Plank of Under Armour and Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical among them \u2014 arrived for a 9 a.m. meeting at the White House.This meeting and similar ones, according to more than a dozen executives who have attended them, are viewed by the executive class not only as an opportunity to help shape policy in their favor, but also, perhaps more important, as a defensive measure aimed at making \u201cfriends\u201d with the new president so as to avoid his wrath later.Make no mistake: Companies are making changes \u2014 or, at least, public announcements \u2014 aimed (in part or in whole) at appealing to or appeasing Mr. Trump. Amazon said it was hiring 100,000 new employees. Ford canceled plans to build a factory in Mexico and said it would create 700 jobs domestically.The story, which garnered headlines all over the world, was a clear sop to Mr. Trump: In many ways, Foxconn\u2019s statement was seen as a hedge against the possibility that the new president, who has threatened a trade war with China and criticized Apple for manufacturing iPhones abroad, might seek to put further pressure on its business.Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, visited Mr. Trump two weeks ago and announced plans to build an online platform that he pledged would create a million jobs in the Midwest for farmers and small businesses to export goods to China. The plan had been in the works before Mr. Trump was elected, but clearly it helped grease the skids with Mr. Trump, who took Mr. Ma to pose for pictures in the lobby of Trump Tower.Mr. Icahn, a friend and supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s, who was recently named a special adviser on regulation, said in a telephone interview, \u201cYou are correct in saying my relationships with companies is somewhat analogous\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s own relationships with the leaders of them.\u201cIf they are taking advantage of the system, they should be scared,\u201d Mr. Icahn said of corporations. \u201cRemember, many of the guys I went after deserved to be scared \u2014 but in many cases, I bought stock in companies with managements I liked, and I helped them get things done with recalcitrant boards.\u201d\u201cIt will be a bumpy road,\u201d Mr. Icahn said. \u201cBut in the long run he will do a great job with the country.\u201dWhile some executives may be focused on the optics of their businesses in relation to Mr. Trump, Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, the largest money manager in the world overseeing over $5 trillion \u2014 that\u2019s with a \u201ct\u201d \u2014 suggests that each company must rethink its strategy.\u201cWe believe that it is imperative that companies understand these changes and adapt their strategies as necessary,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote in a letter to the nation\u2019s top public company executives that he is in the process of sending out. \u201cNot just following a year like 2016, but as part of a constant process of understanding the landscape in which you operate.\u201d\u201cWe will be looking to see how your strategic framework reflects and recognizes the impact of the past year\u2019s changes in the global environment,\u201d Mr. Fink added. \u201cHow have these changes impacted your strategy and how do you plan to pivot, if necessary, in light of the new world in which you are operating?\u201dOne of the big issues that companies are likely to confront \u2014 and that Mr. Trump may confront for them if they aren\u2019t lucky \u2014 is how they might use repatriated cash if tax reforms are passed in Washington. Mr. Trump has made his presidency about creating jobs. Yet many chief executives have already said that if they are able to repatriate cash at a low tax rate, they will engage in stock buybacks and mergers and acquisitions. (In the 12 months ending in the third quarter of 2016, BlackRock pointed out that \u201cthe value of dividends and buybacks by S&P 500 companies exceeded those companies\u2019 operating profit.\u201d)Mr. Fink warned that he was watching, too. \u201cIf tax reform also includes some form of reduced taxation for repatriation of cash trapped overseas, BlackRock will be looking to companies\u2019 strategic frameworks for an explanation of whether they will bring cash back to the U.S. \u2014 and if so, how they plan to use it. Will it be used simply for more share buybacks? Or is it a part of a capital plan that appropriately balances returning capital to shareholders with prudently investing for future growth?\u201dBetween Mr. Trump and the investor class, chief executives may be cornered in their offices more than ever as they try to adjust to the new reality.Adam Grant, a professor of management and psychology at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said behavioral scientists had a term to describe the way chief executives were thinking about Mr. Trump: It is called an \u201cambivalent relationship.\u201dThat sounds about right.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about corporate bosses\u2019 efforts to appeal to President Trump, referred incorrectly to the manufacturing company Foxconn, which said it might spend $7 billion in the United States to build a factory. Foxconn is based in Taiwan, not China.Advertisement"}

The second phrase takes the form of \u201c_i_ _o_\u201d or \u201c_i _a_,\u201d both vowels being short vowels. For example, at 23A, the clue \u201cWitty British judge?\u201d turns out to be POWDERED WIG WAG, which conjoins POWDERED WIG with WAG.

{"Headline": "Ask Alexa? No, Hear This Alexa", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIt started around the holidays. My eyes began to dart involuntarily to call-outs of my name on social media.\u201cJust ask Alexa,\u201d the tweets read. \u201cDesigned around your voice for hands-free convenience. Ask Alexa!\u201dAmazon has installed Alexa, its voice recognition and natural-language platform, inside more than five million Echo units the company has sold since introducing the microphone-and-speaker device two years ago. When an Echo\u2019s microphones hear the name Alexa, the device wakes and records your questions and commands. You can operate any Alexa-enabled device \u2014 in your home, office or car \u2014 with this \u201cvoice-controlled computer in the cloud.\u201dYou can use Alexa to order a car service or food delivery, or to book travel. You can also tell Alexa to buy other Amazon products, or to play audiobooks and music. Footnote: If you request Billy Joel\u2019s \u201cThe Downeaster \u2018Alexa,\u2019 \u201d however, she may stop herself mid-stanza when she hears her name and record you singing instead.The growing popularity of Alexa means we may scarcely have to talk to a human again. And, on command, she talks back: Alexa will tell you the solution to math problems or measurement conversions. Have a general knowledge query? Alexa will read you the first line of the relevant Wikipedia entry.But why \u201cAlexa\u201d? Alexa is a truncated, feminine form of the masculine Greek name Alexandros, or Alexander, and means defender or, more aptly in this case, helper of man. Amazon\u2019s senior vice president, David Limp, told Fortune magazine last year that the name was \u201cimportant\u201d for the \u201cpersonality that it creates around the persona\u201d of the service.For Amazon (not coincidentally perhaps, also a female warrior tribe in Greek mythology) to ascribe the feminine gender to its personal assistant platform conforms to that equally ancient stereotype of a deferent subject catering to the needs of her master. But \u2014 just my luck \u2014 it was the rarity of my name that led Amazon computer scientists to adopt it as the \u201cwake word\u201d for their voice-controlled bot.As Mr. Limp explained, \u201cthe phonics of that word and how that word is parsed and the fact that it has a hard consonant with the X in it is important in making sure that it wakes up only when it\u2019s asked for.\u201dThe letter \u201cx\u201d occurs only once among the top 100 American names of the last century, in the masculine form, Alexander. Since 1880, it is estimated that fewer than 100,000 American women have been named Alexa.Amazon\u2019s goal is to establish a pervasive voice-activated consumer network that fits seamlessly into users\u2019 lives. In addition to making several of its own gadgets Alexa-compatible, Amazon has licensed other companies to incorporate the platform in their products. The Ford Motor Co. will offer Alexa in three automobile models starting this month.There is a darker side to Alexa. The conversational platform aims to become so natural that we\u2019ll barely notice she\u2019s listening at all. Every time an Echo records our voice, Alexa stores the sound file in the cloud. Amazon has said that it \u201cwill not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us.\u201d But already, in December, prosecutors in Arkansas subpoenaed a murder suspect\u2019s Echo information. It remains to be seen whether courts will force Amazon to release all the data Alexa may have recorded.Amazon\u2019s promise is that Alexa is \u201calways getting smarter.\u201d Through big data collection and analytics, she will come to know us in ways we can\u2019t even know ourselves. My worry is that she will make this Alexa dumber. The platform offers endless choices, virtual connections and access to a world of information, but what this major-domo of the \u201cinternet of things\u201d may deliver is reductive banter, mindless consumerism and a universe of trivia.And Alexa may not be the only one adapting. We talk to Alexa in the peremptory tone we reserve for barking at chat bots, snarkily dismissing interlopers in our social media feeds, or frustratedly answering staccato telephone menu trees. People do not talk to their dog the way they speak to Alexa.Imperturbably obedient by design, Alexa appears to offer us a new level of control and choice, always on demand. The miracle of convenience allows us to romanticize this unilateralism to operate everything from our light bulbs, security systems, thermostats, music and media with a simple voice command \u2014 even as we disengage from people and depersonalize the institutions that enable real connection and collective agency.We think we\u2019re making the robots in our image, but perhaps they\u2019re making us in theirs. That\u2019s what it seems like, if you ask me.Alexa O\u2019Brien is a journalist who writes about capital crimes and the security state.Advertisement"}

But Not the Safety and Skill to Fly Them.", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byIf this Christmas was the season of the drone, it was also a time of crashes, losses and tweeted laments. Social media is rich with commentary about fathers (major targets) crashing drones, girlfriends with tiny blades enmeshed in their hair (mothers removed them) and crying children whose favorite present went poof in the sky.My brother got a drone this morning and he flew it at a park and the wind carried it off and he lost it. Merry Christmas.\u201cHow would you like it if your laptop flew away?\u201d Shelley Holloway\u2019s husband asked her after he lost his holiday drone. Ms. Holloway, of Clawson, Mich., had posted a note on Nextdoor, the community-based social network, saying that \u201chis Christmas has been ruined ever since.\u201d (Apparently he didn\u2019t like the ribbing.)Most drones are harmless toys \u2014 albeit ones that seem to have a shorter shelf life than a Christmas tree \u2014 and can be bought at Amazon or Walmart for under $100. But drones, particularly bigger ones, can cause major damage and injury, especially in the hands of neophytes.\u201cWe\u2019re adamant,\u201d said Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \u201cIf a drone is seen in the vicinity of a wildland fire, we will remove our aircraft, which unfortunately can cause the fire to grow exponentially.\u201dThe agency, known as Cal Fire, has adopted the warning \u201cIf you fly, we can\u2019t!\u201d It has a fleet of 50 aircraft and 31 million acres to cover. After a drone flew into what was called the Trailhead Fire in Auburn, Calif., last summer, Cal Fire grounded its aircraft for two hours.About 2.8 million drones were sold in the United States last year, about 1.2 million of them over the holidays, according to the Consumer Technology Association, a lobbying group. As of Dec. 13, just over 500,000 people had registered with the F.A.A. Surely the rest of the owners will be stepping forward soon \u2014 if they haven\u2019t already crashed their drones.\u201cMy daughter got a drone from Santa, and its first launch took off and never returned,\u201d Jim Stephens of Orinda, Calif., notified his neighbors on Nextdoor. \u201cIf you find a white and orange drone in your backyard or trees, please let me know.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Stephens said controlling the drone had been harder than he expected. \u201cI should have let her drive it \u2014 maybe we\u2019d still have it,\u201d he said. His daughter, Iris, is 6.Juan J. Alonso, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford who serves on the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s drone advisory board, suspects that many drone buyers were surprised by the power of their machines \u2014 which hobbyists typically fly at 15 m.p.h., but knowledgeable users can nudge up to 40 m.p.h.\u201cMostly people bought small drones, up to $500 or $600,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re probably novices who soon exceed capability of the drone or their own capability as a pilot. Most people have zero training.\u201dAlthough a drone can go \u201cas high as you want,\u201d Dr. Alonso said, the F.A.A. limits their altitude to 400 feet.\u201cThese are very sophisticated machines,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to make sure people use them responsibly.\u201dThe F.A.A. receives more than 100 reports a month from pilots who complain that drones have flown too close to their aircraft, an agency spokesman said. Drones have injured people and caused power disruptions.Drones seem \u201clike innocent toys,\u201d said Brad Koeckeritz, the chief of the unmanned aircraft systems division for the Department of the Interior. But last year, his department \u201chad more than 50 encounters with drones on wildfires,\u201d most of them being flown by hobbyists, he said.\u201cThe bottom line is that midair collisions with aircraft involved in low-level flight on a fire or approaching a runway could potentially have fatal consequences,\u201d he said.On Christmas Day, with Twitter full of drone drama, Faine Greenwood, a researcher on unmanned aerial technology at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, retweeted messages under the hashtag #dronecrashmas. This was the second year she has \u201cfollowed the drone-crash beat,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a major theme on Christmas Day.\u201dUnderlying the humor is concern that \u201ccrashing drones on Christmas is indicative of people not taking it seriously enough,\u201d said Ms. Greenwood, who owns five drones and writes about them for Slate. \u201cWe need to do a better job of educating them.\u201dInstead of going to the park, many consumers are flying machines right outside their front doors, without considering wind and pesky trees.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a convergence of once-futuristic technology with mainstream America,\u201d said Nirav Tolia, chief executive of Nextdoor. Over Christmas week, Nextdoor had 8,709 drone posts, mostly about drones both lost and found.\u201cIt used to be lost cats in a tree,\u201d said Kelsey Grady, head of communications for Nextdoor. \u201cNow it\u2019s drones.\u201dAnthony Melton of Sugar Land, Tex., was playing by the rules when disaster struck.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right \u2014 another drone lost in the neighborhood,\u201d Mr. Melton said in a Nextdoor post. His son was flying the drone when it was lost and he cried; Mr. Melton was too upset to sleep. Then a neighbor spotted it on his roof, and the crisis ended.For drones of all sizes, there is a learning curve. Jim Hayes, a Fox Sports reporter, tweeted his slow progress:The technology has entered the mainstream so quickly, Mr. Wynne said, that \u201ceducation \u2014 and, frankly, regulations \u2014 are trying to catch up.\u201dDrone manufacturers warn people about the dangers, but does anyone actually read those lengthy instructions before running out to try the new toy?\u201cIt is fair to say no one should take a drone out of a box and try to figure out how it works by flying it,\u201d said Brendan Schulman, vice president for policy and legal affairs at DJI, the Chinese company that dominates the personal and professional drone market for high-end aerial photography.DJI\u2019s consumer drones, which sell for $399 to $1,199, have built-in safety measures, including auto-return and landing for when the battery is low, obstacle avoidance and \u201cgeofencing,\u201d which prevents a drone from flying near airports, nuclear power plants or other sensitive locations (including anywhere in Washington, D.C.).But the market is rife with knockoffs, which may lack those features. And \u201cpilot error\u201d is a big problem.\u201cDad crashed Julia\u2019s drone into the neighbor\u2019s tree and broke it on the first flight. Merry Christmas!\u201d tweeted @RachelGriffith.Two hours later, Ms. Griffith updated the Twitterverse: \u201cHe got it working again, and immediately got it stuck in the top of a huge tree.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the location of Faine Greenwood. She was standing in Harvard\u2019s campus, not in a park near the university.An article on Jan. 9 about the propensity of inexperienced drone owners to crash their new machines misstated one part of the federal guidelines regarding drone use, based on information from a spokesman. Drone hobbyists are governed by community-based safety guidelines, which permit night flights with proper equipment, according to the Federal Aviation Administration; hobbyists are not prohibited from flying drones in the dark.Advertisement"}

Eduardo Franco of the Rio Grande do Norte police.On Sunday, the authorities initially said they had found 27 bodies, but the death toll was later revised to 26; Major Franco said there had been a mistake. Many of the bodies were mutilated.The prison has a capacity of 620 but was holding around 1,100 prisoners when the riot began, the authorities said. All of the inmates had been sentenced, Major Franco added.Wilma Batista, the director of the prison agents\u2019 union in Rio Grande do Norte, sent a photograph of two headless, mutilated corpses in a prison yard via a cellphone messaging service and said she had seen many others.\u201cWe are shocked,\u201d she said.With Brazil swamped in recession, President Michel Temer\u2019s government reeling from one graft scandal after another, and a wave of seemingly uncontrollable prison violence, many Brazilians feel they are going back to a darker recent past when crime, corruption and the economy were out of control.\u201cWe thought we had turned that page, and now it is coming back,\u201d said Mauricio Santoro, a professor of international relations and political science at the State University of Rio de Janeiro.The killings reflected the escalation of a deadly gang war that exploded when 56 prisoners were massacred in Manaus, in Amazonas State, on Jan. 1. Four more were killed the next day in another jail in the city.The state authorities attributed the Manaus deaths to the Family of the North, an Amazon drug gang that had attacked prisoners connected to a rival gang, the S\u00e3o Paulo-based First Capital Command, known by its Portuguese abbreviation, P.C.C.The gangs were believed to be fighting for control of lucrative drug smuggling routes. The P.C.C. was for years allied with a Rio de Janeiro drug gang called the Red Command. Last year, the alliance fell apart, leading to a spate of prison killings.On Jan. 6, after the Manaus massacre, 33 prisoners were found butchered at a prison in Boa Vista in Roraima State, in the far north of Brazil. The state authorities said the P.C.C. was behind the killings. Four more prisoners were killed in a third Manaus prison after being moved from the site of the first massacre.The riot on Saturday night began when prisoners linked to the P.C.C. rebelled during visiting hours, Ms. Batista said. They were in a separate prison, Rog\u00e9rio Coutinho Madruga, which is next to Alca\u00e7uz and effectively part of the same complex. She said that just six prison agents were on duty, and that they managed to free visitors before retreating to another block.\u201cThe agents saved the visitors and had to retreat\u201d because prisoners set the block on fire, Ms. Batista said.The escaped prisoners then attacked a block inside the Alca\u00e7uz jail that housed men from another gang, the Rio Grande do Norte-based Crime Syndicate, Ms. Batista said.Since 2015, many of the cells inside Alca\u00e7uz have had no bars, and prisoners wander freely 24 hours a day, Ms. Batista said.Police officers and prison guards managed to stop the killing from spreading further, but electricity to the prison was cut. The police decided to wait until dawn before entering, and they restrained desperate relatives who were trying to get inside.Lincoln Gakiya, a state prosecutor from an organized crime unit in S\u00e3o Paulo State who has specialized in the P.C.C., said its split with the Red Command was behind the crisis. The Rio gang has allied with five other gangs around Brazil, including the Crime Syndicate.\u201cThis war is for the hegemony of the drug trade,\u201d Mr. Gakiya said. \u201cThe prison system is not prepared for this gang war. There is no place to separate the gangs. The system is overcrowded, so the tendency is to get worse.\u201dA cellphone video circulating on social media showed a man with his face covered, brandishing what looked like a machete or a sword, walking among a large number of mutilated bodies in what appeared to be a prison yard. The letters P.C.C. were scrawled in what looked like blood on a wall.Although it was impossible to verify the video, the bodies visible were wearing blue shorts similar to those worn by prisoners shown in local news reports. Grisly videos like this have circulated after all of the attacks.Sublieutenant Eliabe Marques, a police officer and the president of a Rio Grande do Norte state association of police and firefighter sublieutenants, said the dispute between the P.C.C. and the Crime Syndicate had grown worse recently.\u201cIn jail, the prisoner has to join one or other of the gangs, P.C.C. or the Crime Syndicate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a phenomenon that is making the situation in Rio Grande do Norte even more serious.\u201dMs. Batista said the prison agents\u2019 union had warned of potentially explosive conditions inside the prison but had been ignored.\u201cIt is very sad, not just for the butchery, but to see organized crime face the state, the power of the state, leaving more scars on prison agents who suffer psychologically and physically from such a stressful profession,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Since its founding in 1851, the University of Minnesota has become one of America\u2019s premier research universities, with a faculty that includes professors from every facet of the academic spectrum. Part of UMN\u2019s success lies in its interdisciplinary spirit: discoveries have ranged from Norman Borlaug\u2019s disease-resistant wheat and the first bone marrow transplant by Robert Good to Karen Hsiao Ashe\u2019s landmark Alzheimer\u2019s research and Bin He\u2019s mind-controlled robotic arm. Today, UMN\u2019s professors are working to redefine the way we think about global challenges \u2014 including closing the opportunity gap, protecting human rights, ending addiction and abolishing hunger. Though there\u2019s no panacea (it\u2019s going to take corporations, the government, educators and communities working together, says Megan Gunnar, director of the Institute of Childhood Development at the University of Minnesota), faculty members are making the world a better place \u2014 one advance at a time. Kelvin Lim\u2019s interest in the brain wasn\u2019t originally addiction. \u201cI was interested in the brain because of my interest in consciousness and meditation,\u201d he says. As a medical resident at Stanford University in the mid-\u201980s, Lim \u2014 now the vice chair for research at the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Minnesota Medical School \u2014 was exposed to magnetic resonance imaging, which was then just emerging. \u201cThis imaging technology gave us a new and exciting window to examine the brain,\u201d he says. It soon became clear that this technology \u2014 a functional MRI measuring blood flow and brain activity \u2014 could shed light on the conditions that create addiction and help with treatment. \u201cWe were motivated in thinking about how the brain recovers,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s say someone enters treatment. [It\u2019s] estimated that 80 to 90 percent of people relapse within a year of their treatment. Are there ways we can better understand that? And perhaps develop better treatments?\u201d Functional MRIs can help identify parts of the brain associated with addiction. \u201cOne of the things we were interested in is how does the brain recover when people stop using drugs?\u201d says Lim. \u201cHow does that relate to their future use?\u201d Lim explains how a brain scan can show how much communication is occurring between the reward center and the decision-making parts of the brain. The stronger the communication, the higher the chance of a patient staying abstinent six months later. \u201cThis was such a fascinating and exciting discovery,\u201d he says. \u201cIt provided us with new avenues for thinking about who is at highest risk for relapsing.\u201d Lim\u2019s work in understanding addiction is just one area that\u2019s being studied at the University of Minnesota. Some researchers are also exploring a neural pathway that might serve as an \u201coff switch\u201d to drug-seeking behavior, while others \u2014 such as UMN professor George Wilcox \u2014 are investigating nonaddictive painkillers that are effective but have minimal to no exposure to the brain. \u201cIf you can reduce the number of brains exposed to these drugs, then I think we could have a win,\u201d Wilcox says. Together, the hope is to create a multipronged approach to battling addiction. In the future, this could mean targeting the brain\u2019s pathways with electrical stimulus or medications \u2014 possibly preventing the deaths of many of the 44 people who die every day from prescription drug overdoses in the United States. The approximate number of children who were reported to be abused or neglected in 2014.Though Myers\u2019s career has been spent in the world of social justice, his background is in economics. Using econometrics \u2014 which combines statistics and math to study economic systems \u2014 Myers has changed the way researchers and officials view human rights issues by identifying complex problems other methodologies might miss. Myers has studied disparities in arrests, incarceration and homeownership among minorities. \u201cWhat, specifically, about these differences ... is the underlying core problem?\u201d he asks. The desire to empower people to solve human rights abuses is shared by other researchers at the University of Minnesota. Their work ranges from collecting data on current abuses to studying historical precedents of how societies addressed past human rights problems. \u201cThe core idea behind human rights is that every individual has a claim to human dignity and to fairness,\u201d says Professor Barbara Frey, director of the Human Rights Program in UMN\u2019s College of Liberal Arts. Frey\u2019s work pushes governments to uphold these standards. \u201cThe major challenge in the field of international human rights is compliance,\u201d she says, \u201cgetting governments to comply with the obligations that they\u2019ve already agreed to.\u201d Myers believes local discriminatory practices and human rights abuses should be viewed through the larger lens of United Nations positions against racial discrimination and xenophobia. \u201cThe dilemma is that by viewing racial inequality solely through the lens of local laws ... we miss an important opportunity to reenvision solving some of the problems of inequality through an international human rights perspective,\u201d he says. In Minnesota, Myers has found a community where the results of his work can be put into practice through legislation protecting disadvantaged groups. \u201cThe thing that attracted me to Minnesota was the fact that this is a place where you can actually accomplish something,\u201d he says. \u201cThe goal is to build something that is global, something that\u2019s international, but in a compact sphere.\u201d \u201cThe population is increasing,\u201d says Vipin Kumar, a Regents professor of computer science and engineering at UMN. In a few decades, the seven billion people in the world are expected to grow to nine or 10 billion. \u201cWhen you have such a large increase in population, you have to figure out how to feed them and feed them in a sustainable way,\u201d he says. Kumar\u2019s work explores the ways in which climate change and deforestation are related to food production. For example, expansion of agriculture to meet rapidly growing demand for food and biofuels worldwide has led to massive deforestation in the tropical forests of South America and Southeast Asia. Resulting greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation exacerbates climate change, which has huge implications for water and food security for the world. Increasing temperatures are expected to degrade crop yields and changing precipitation patterns are already disrupting agricultural production. Kumar\u2019s work has used data to track how much of the Amazon rain forest is being turned into farmland, which poses huge ecological concerns long-term. Global warming is changing where and what crops can be grown, as well as agricultural yields.Changing precipitation patterns are affecting water supplies for farmers around the world, as well as limiting drinking water in drought-affected areas.Food production requires a stable climate and enough land to grow crops, but deforestation resulting from the expansion of agriculture exacerbates the problems that cause global hunger.Energy and infrastructure are needed for large-scale farming operations and food supply chains, yet rapid industrialization is also contributing to climate change.Jungles are being cleared to grow crops around the world, but slash-and-burn agriculture quickens climate change and its associated ecological risks.Global warming is changing where and what crops can be grown, as well as agricultural yields.Changing precipitation patterns are affecting water supplies for farmers around the world, as well as limiting drinking water in drought-affected areas.Food production requires a stable climate and enough land to grow crops, but deforestation resulting from the expansion of agriculture exacerbates the problems that cause global hunger.Energy and infrastructure are needed for large-scale farming operations and food supply chains, yet rapid industrialization is also contributing to climate change.Jungles are being cleared to grow crops around the world, but slash-and-burn agriculture quickens climate change and its associated ecological risks.Kumar\u2019s research is intertwined with the work of his colleagues. For example, assistant professor Candice Hirsch, a faculty member in the Department of Agronomy and Plant Genetics at UMN, works with a team studying how plants can yield more food and lessen losses caused by global climate change. \u201cWe use a lot of big data in different ways,\u201d she says. \u201cWe use all that information to model how plants are adapting to changing climates\u201d and how to help mitigate some of the risks that come with extreme environments. One takeaway from both Hirsch and Kumar is that hunger is a holistic problem and must be addressed as such. The harmful effects of a change in one area often has implications in others. \u201cThe ultimate aim is to be able to produce information that allows stakeholders to figure out relationships between food, energy, water and climate change,\u201d says Kumar. \u201cAll of these things are so interlinked that you cannot study them ... in isolation.\u201d By studying these connections, we can help combat hunger by understanding and addressing its web of causes, rather than just treating the individual symptoms. Because of the enormous data sets Kumar and other UMN professors work with, students at the University of Minnesota play a critical role in the research. A large team is needed to work on this because the algorithms have to be developed for a variety of problems, says Kumar. \u201cStudents are very excited about working on these problems because it allows them to develop new solutions in computer science that can be used in many, many other places.\u201d At UMN, professors are working to close opportunity gaps in many different ways, from studying testing methodologies to the biology of stress. Gunnar\u2019s work deals with the latter. She knew that animals neglected in infancy showed signs of stress throughout their lives, even if they were later well-cared for \u2014 and she suspected that children experiencing neglect and deprivation might display some of the same difficulties, even after they had been transferred to economically and emotionally supportive homes. Gunnar now believes a more accurate view of deprived and neglected children \u2014 including those whose mothers experienced economic and emotional stress while pregnant with them \u2014 can provide insight into what\u2019s needed for children to succeed. The problem might lie in the overproduction of the stress hormones such as cortisol, a steroid that has powerful effects on the way the body functions and the brain develops. \u201cI study how children\u2019s social relationships with their parents and other supportive caregivers help them regulate stress-reactive hormones and protect their developing brain,\u201d she says. Also working to close opportunity gaps is Michael Rodriguez, a professor at UMN\u2019s Department of Educational Psychology, who focuses on standardized testing \u2014 specifically the need for children of underserved communities to have benchmarks reflecting their specific circumstances. \u201cHow did we know if programs were really effective and meeting goals and helping kids?\u201d he says. His goal is to build a stronger understanding of the role of social and emotional learning in youth development. After observing the use of common educational tools across communities, including Latinos, Hmong and American Indians, Rodriguez felt that universal testing wasn\u2019t accounting for persistent challenges being faced by diverse communities. Rodriguez seeks to close opportunity gaps by tailoring testing benchmarks \u201cto the unique learning needs and context and experiences of kids in different communities.\u201d In so doing, he hopes to pay more attention to social and emotional characteristics in learning. Schools in communities with high poverty levels and large immigrant populations tend to have the least resources, says Rodriguez. \u201cWhen we provide spaces and opportunities in schools for kids to grow socially and emotionally, students can begin to understand how to manage their stress and trauma, and then begin to attend to the goals of being in school.\u201d The University of Minnesota has played a big role in the progress that Rodriguez and his colleagues, like Gunnar, have made to close opportunity gaps. In addition, researchers are pursuing other paths, ranging from achieving a better understanding of the development of foundational learning skills to investigating ways to more quickly diagnose autism in children. \u201cI\u2019m fortunate to be surrounded by people that are committed to equity and really want to make a difference,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cThey take the extra step in translating that research into practice.\u201d Learn the Many Ways UMN is Addressing These ChallengesPreventing Relapse and Creating Better Painkillers to End AddictionWorking with Communities and Governments to Protect Human RightsDeveloping Better Crops and Creating A Sustainable Food System to Abolish HungerImproving All Aspects of Child Development to Close the Opportunity GapThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "These Young Adult Novels Come With Back Stories: The Authors\u2019 Own", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported byATLANTA \u2014 Allison Glock and T Cooper live behind a white picket fence, an enclosure so tidy and welcoming that it seems to grin at passers-by. Its cheer is a match for their house, warmed on the inside by an upright piano, a plump sofa facing the weathered wood fireplace, and family portraits lining the walls. This is home, you may imagine, to the quintessential American family, living contentedly behind its clapboard facade.And you would be right, to a point.\u201cWe are a family of difference \u2014 not that we make a big deal of it,\u201d Ms. Glock said as she set out platters of biscuits for her husband; her teenage daughters, Dixie and Matilda; and a guest.And not that it shows at a glance. To meet them, Mr. Cooper lean and bearded in a chambray work shirt, Ms. Glock showing off a russet bob that complemented her gray-speckled top, you would be hard-pressed to say just what sets them apart.Still, differences announced themselves the other week as the family settled at the kitchen refectory table to talk, the conversation punctuated by the sounds of their pit bulls, Milton and Elvis, noisily lapping from a water bowl nearby.Ms. Glock, 48, a poet, memoirist, screenwriter and a senior staff writer for ESPN, is the daughter of a stoutly conservative Southern family. Mr. Cooper, 44, a novelist, television writer and documentary filmmaker, is a transplanted New Yorker descended from Russian Jewish immigrants. He is also transgender.Those distinctions, which bind but by no means define them, lie at the heart of their recent work. They are the married authors of \u201cChangers,\u201d a well-received series of young adult novels, each a nervy exploration of what it may be like for an adolescent to swap identities at the start of every school year.\u201cAs an L.G.B.T. family, we are writing content for the kids we used to be,\u201d said Ms. Glock, who signs the series as Allison Glock-Cooper. \u201cOur main characters are diverse in every way: race, body type, gender, sexual orientation.\u201dShe was describing in rough outlines the members of an ancient, enigmatic fictional race called Changers, teenagers required to spend each of their four years of high school outwardly transformed, having assumed a radically new identity.In \u201cBook One: Drew,\u201d readers become briefly acquainted with 13-year-old Ethan, who has just moved from New York to Tennessee and wakes up on the first day of his freshman year in the alien body of a girl (the title character): a pretty, athletic blond cheerleader he may have lusted after in his former life.Ethan-now-Drew must navigate the shoals of freshman year and find her place in the knotty high school hierarchy. In \u201cBook Two,\u201d Drew becomes Oryon, an African-American boy negotiating a truce between his former selves and his latest incarnation. He experiences not just thinly veiled racism, but also, like Drew before him, the uneasy sensation \u2014 one familiar to transgender and gender-fluid young people \u2014 of being in the wrong body.By the start of \u201cBook Three\u201d he has morphed into the overweight, hence overlooked, thornily rebellious Kim.Each character is given the task of chronicling his or her experiences before moving on to the next identity, and they are expected to settle by the end of four years on one of those identities, without the option of returning to the person they were at the start.Bummer? Not really. \u201cChoosing who you want to be \u2014 that\u2019s the ultimate choice,\u201d Ms. Glock said. \u201cFor most people that\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201dThe consciousness-altering prospect of radical transformation, explored in books like \u201cIn the Darkroom,\u201d which details the author Susan Faludi\u2019s discovery that her father had become a woman, and \u201cThe Argonauts,\u201d Maggie Nelson\u2019s gender-bending memoir; or in television fare like the Amazon series \u201cTransparent,\u201d promises to render the \u201cChangers\u201d series as marketable as it is topical, catnip to curiosity seekers and, not less, to the marginalized communities that often get short shrift in other young adult fiction.\u201cThere was a moment in publishing where transgender literature went from being published quietly, almost like samizdat, to being pushed to the front of the bookstore,\u201d said Todd Shuster, a literary agent in New York. Its appeal, like that of portrayals of other outsider groups, is becoming mainstream, Mr. Shuster suggested.\u201cAs transgender and gender-fluid people have become comfortable in accepting themselves, publishing has embraced that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Hollywood has embraced it too, to the point where it may be seen as an advantage to have that kind of character front and center in the action.\u201dMs. Glock said the books were not written with marketability in mind. \u201cWe honestly just set out to write books for kids we knew, kids we love and the kids we were,\u201d she said.In the Trump era, a period of escalating racial, ethnic and sexual strains, that objective is timely. \u201cThose tensions didn\u2019t seem unmanageable until recently,\u201d Ms. Glock said. \u201cThe weeks leading up to and after the election have created an environment that has given people permission to be more hostile.\u201dAll the more reason, the Glock-Coopers say, to get on with their work. \u201cBook Four,\u201d in progress, examines the life of a Changer who misuses his power. And though the Glock-Coopers are reluctant to reveal much about it just yet, a Changers television series is in development.\u201cThese stories give readers permission to think about what it would be like to wake up as another gender or another race,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. The work is a plea for empathy, he added, \u201can investigation of what it might mean literally to step into the shoes of another.\u201dOne may learn, as Drew does, that being pretty and popular is no shield against the envy or predations of her nastier peers. One may encounter, with Oryon, the reserves of fear and bias that are only partly concealed by a veil of civility.Oryon is compelled to sit in the school lunchroom exclusively with other black students and endure racial profiling at the hands of the local police; he is roughed up by members of a faction known as the Abiders, self-appointed keepers of the status quo. \u201cIf you learn anything as a Changer,\u201d he observes in \u201cBook Two,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s that all the supposedly bygone stereotypes and prejudices are far from bygone.\u201dFor Mr. Cooper, the book provides an opportunity as well to sort out and clear up misconceptions about what it is to be transgender. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t entail just a change of name or surgery or clothes or haircut,\u201d he said. \u201cFor so many people it is hard to understand that a man can be attracted to women but then also feel like a woman. Once he transitions into a female, that doesn\u2019t mean he suddenly wants to be with men.\u201dThat observation is reflected throughout the series. \u201cSomebody who has to live through four different iterations,\u201d Mr. Cooper said, \u201clearns that gender doesn\u2019t really affect what or whom he\u2019s drawn to.\u201dEach book is a probe into effects of gender, race and body image on the formation of identity. Those externals, along with the experiences accrued in a lifetime, do little to alter that immutable bedrock known as character, the authors argue. \u201cEach of the books is a meditation on the essentialness of humans,\u201d Mr. Cooper said.The rest, they maintain, is performance, the trying on and the subsequent discarding of masks, a process scarcely more affecting or permanent than experimenting with a new hairstyle, a pair of shredded jeans or, for that matter, a Snapchat persona. \u201cWe as humans are all in transition all of the time,\u201d Mr. Cooper said.It is a process familiar to perpetually shape-shifting teenagers, including the Coopers\u2019 daughters.\u201cI\u2019m still trying to find myself, to figure out who I am,\u201d Dixie, 16, said. \u201cBut I also feel that through different experiences, and even the wearing of different clothes, I\u2019m essentially the same person \u2014 that there is a difference between who you are and how you choose to present yourself.\u201dRaking her fingers through her mink-and-ermine-tinted hair, Matilda, 15, seemed less certain. \u201cThe way you present yourself changes the way people treat you,\u201d she said, adding with mounting conviction, \u201cThe way people treat you changes who you are.\u201dConversations with and about their daughters set the series in motion. \u201cAs they grew, it seemed like the girls woke up with different personalities day to day, minute to minute,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cWe wondered, if you were entirely transforming for every year of school what that would do to a soul.\u201dThey took a page as well from the playbook of their own lives, the series providing the Coopers a chance to exhume and examine a shared past. They were introduced, indirectly, by a New York Times book critic, who asked them to contribute to a writer\u2019s playlist. \u201cWhen I saw T\u2019s list I thought, \u2018Well, look there,\u2019\u201d Ms. Glock recalled. \u201cThere were a lot of artists on it that I love.\u201d\u201cSo I did my list and wrote you a line or two, like you do, writer to writer,\u201d she added, darting a glance at her husband.After that, she said, \u201cwe just started corresponding very sweetly, in an old-fashioned way.\u201d They discovered what Mr. Cooper, who had begun his transition several years earlier, called \u201cuncommon commonalities,\u201d among them a shared admiration for Dolly Parton and an attachment to old artifacts, especially those connected with their own quirky family histories.When Ms. Glock eventually traveled on assignment to New York, they met face to face. Though she is not typically moved by fairy tale fantasies or, as she put it, by the LMN movie of the week, \u201cWhen I saw T in person, the air was literally moving around him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was bizarre. I felt super-drawn and connected.\u201dMr. Cooper\u2019s recollections were earthier. At the time, Ms. Glock was staying at the W hotel in Union Square. \u201cWe met in the coffee shop and talked,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we went back to the W.\u201d The rest, as they say, is history.After a peripatetic romance that took the couple to Jacksonville, Fla., to spend time with Ms. Glock\u2019s family, and to what would become their farm near Hudson, N.Y., they married, the occasion commemorated with matching tattoos inscribed with the date Feb. 7, 2010.Three years ago, they moved to Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the more progressive and integrated cities,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cAt brunch, at the cinema, in the spa or on the street, there is always a wide range of folks inhabiting the same space.\u201dMs. Glock said, \u201cWe find that diversity very comforting.\u201dThere have nonetheless been hurdles. \u201cThis is still Georgia,\u201d she said. \u201cAtlanta doesn\u2019t have its race problems figured out by any means.\u201dThere is also the matter of an occasionally chilly reception to those perceived as different. \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced anger,\u201d Ms. Glock said. \u201cIt could be anything from the well-intentioned friend who, when we first got together, told me, \u2018I\u2019m worried about the kids,\u2019 to being threatened in the subway. You find that kind of thing across the board.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d she added, \u201cbut we don\u2019t want to be afraid, we don\u2019t want to be ashamed. At the same time it\u2019s hard to know what to do.\u201dThe books may well provide a template, not just for their readers but also for the authors. \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had them when I was growing up,\u201d Mr. Cooper said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Should a Congregation Have Told a Betrayed Wife?", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byThe EthicistI was a member of a Christian congregation for many years. A married father of two children started helping a widow in the parish. Evidently, they later started seeing each other. His wife thought something was up, and she asked people in the congregation whom she considered friends if they knew anything. Everyone denied knowing anything. The father ended up divorcing his wife and marrying the widow. The wife subsequently found out that some of the people she had asked about the situation had lied to her face, even as she was breaking down in front of them. She says that for a long time she was suicidal \u2014 not because her husband had cheated on her but because she had been abandoned by everyone in the parish, which must have meant that God had abandoned her, too.Would those who lied to her have been culpable if she\u2019d killed herself? Although suicide isn\u2019t typically a rational response to difficult circumstances, we can be implicated when harm comes to others through our failure to act with appropriate care. So people who behaved in a way likely to upset a person they knew was suicidal might be partly culpable. But it\u2019s not, in general, reasonable to act on the assumption that people will commit suicide if they find out you have wronged them. This woman\u2019s line of thought \u2014 that abandonment by members of her church meant abandonment by God \u2014 is the sort of confused thinking that suicidal people often engage in. It\u2019s more a symptom of the problem than a cause of it. (Of course, you can feel bad because you were involved in a terrible outcome even though you can\u2019t be blamed for it: That\u2019s what philosophers call agent-regret.) Even putting aside this hypothetical tragedy, though, your fellow congregants have something to answer for.Are you obliged to do more? That depends mostly on two things. One is whether there\u2019s anything you can reasonably do that would change the norm. You have tried and failed here already, so you may think the answer is no. The second issue is what the costs to you would be. In your view, they might include a negative effect on your college admissions \u2014 a high cost, when the prospects of changing your friends\u2019 behavior are modest. (And getting into the right college will help you find a decent group of new friends!)

{"Headline": "\u2018Where Does Cloud Storage Really Reside? And Is It Secure?\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byAsk The TimesA reader asks: \u201cWhere does cloud storage really reside? And is it secure?\u201d_____\u201cCloud\u201d data is stored on hard drives (much the way data is usually stored). And yes, it\u2019s probably more secure than conventionally stored data.What makes cloud storage different? Instead of being stored directly on your own personal device (the hard drive on your laptop, for example, or your phone), cloud-based data is stored elsewhere \u2014 on servers owned by big companies, usually \u2014 and is made accessible to you via the internet.When people think of cloud computing, they often think of internet-connected public clouds run by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. (If you use Gmail, Dropbox or Microsoft\u2019s Office 365, you are using a cloud service.) There are also consumer clouds that, for example, hold your pictures and social media posts (think of Facebook or Twitter), or store your music and email (think of Apple or Google).Each of these companies has cloud computing systems \u2014 computer servers and storage devices, connected with computer networking equipment \u2014 that span the globe. (Facebook\u2019s systems can allow more than one billion people to interact with them.) Your data is in their computers, usually stored in a regional data center close to where you live.Individual companies can also have their own clouds, called private clouds, that employees and customers access, usually over the internet and on their own private networks.Storage aside, computing clouds can also process information differently; they have special software that enables workloads to be shared among different machines. Your Facebook photos, for example, don\u2019t have a permanent home on a specific chip, but may move among computers.That is a big deal. When workloads are shared, computers can run closer to full capacity, with several programs going at the same time. It\u2019s much more efficient than stand-alone computers running one job at a time.For the people running the computers, it doesn\u2019t really matter where the data or the programs are at any one moment: The stuff is running inside a \u201ccloud\u201d of computing capability. Ideally, if one machine fails, the operation moves over to another part of the system with little downtime.Nowadays, computing clouds are everywhere \u2014 which is one reason people worry about their security. We hear more and more often about hackers coming over the internet and looting the data of thousands of people.Most of those attacks hit traditional servers, though. None of the most catastrophic hacks have been on the big public clouds.The same way that your money is probably safer mixed up with other people\u2019s money in a bank vault than it is sitting alone in your dresser drawer, your data may actually be safer in the cloud: It\u2019s got more protection from bad guys.In the case of the big public clouds, the protection is the work of some of the world\u2019s best computer scientists, hired out of places like the National Security Agency and Stanford University to think hard about security, data encryption and the latest online fraud.And they\u2019re pretty good at keeping things safe online.At least, they have been so far.__________Have a question for Ask The Times?

News articles and books are rewritten by the Ministry of Truth and facts and dates grow blurry \u2014 the past is described as a benighted time that has given way to the Party\u2019s efforts to make Oceania great again (never mind the evidence to the contrary, like grim living conditions and shortages of decent food and clothing).In his 1944 letter, Orwell presciently argued that \u201cthere is no such thing as a history of our own times which could be universally accepted, and the exact sciences are endangered as soon as military necessity ceases to keep people up to the mark.\u201d And in \u201c1984,\u201d the word \u201cscience\u201d does not even exist: \u201cthe empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles\u201d of the Party.Of course, all of these developments are being constantly updated, with regular flurries of news and denials and counterdenials \u2014 a confusing state of affairs that itself would not have surprised Orwell, since he knew the value of such confusion to those in power.Another book, published two years after \u201c1984,\u201d also made Amazon\u2019s list of top 100 best sellers this week: Hannah Arendt\u2019s \u201cThe Origins of Totalitarianism\u201d (1951). A kind of nonfiction bookend to \u201c1984,\u201d the hefty philosophical volume examines the factors that fueled the perfect storm of events leading to the rise of Hitler and Stalin and World War II \u2014 notably, the power that centralized storytelling can exert over anxious populations suffering from the dislocations of history, by offering scapegoats, easy fixes and simple cohesive narratives. If such narratives are riddled with lies, so much the better for those in power, who then succeed in redefining the daily reality inhabited by their subjects.\u201cMass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst,\u201d Arendt wrote, \u201cno matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow.\u201d This mixture of gullibility and cynicism, Arendt suggested, thrived in times rife with change and uncertainty, and was exploited by politicians intent on creating a fictional world in which \u201cfailures need not be recorded, admitted, and remembered.\u201d In this world, 2 + 2 does = 5, as Orwell noted, and the acceptance of bad arithmetic simply becomes a testament to the power of rulers to define reality and the terms of debate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "He Fixes the Cracked Spines of Books, Without an Understudy", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byIssaquah JournalISSAQUAH, Wash. \u2014 Sometimes a book just gets loved to death. A Bible, or a copy of \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web,\u201d for that matter, can be opened only so many times, even by the gentlest reader, before its spine weakens and surrenders.And here is a dirty little secret: Public libraries, despite their reputations for hushed wonder about the written word, can be rough places. Automated sorting machines, whirring conveyor belts and hard bins can break a book and shorten its life.Donald Vass, who has spent the last 26 years mending and tending to books for the King County Public Library system here in the Seattle area, has seen both mechanical and human-inflicted damage and more. At 57 and with not many years left before retirement, he says he believes he will be the last full-time traditional bookbinder ever to take up shears, brushes and needles here. The skills take too long to learn, he said, and no one is being groomed to take his place in \u201cthe mendery,\u201d Room 111 at the library\u2019s central service center, where not so many years ago 10 people worked.His is an ancient craft, and across many public library systems, a fading one. It stands in particularly stark contrast here, in a region where Amazon reinvented the book business and is now leading a high-tech boom. Seattle\u2019s glass-and-steel Central Library, designed by the architect Rem Koolhaas and Joshua Prince-Ramus and completed in 2004, is ultramodern and angular. Software engineers, often with corporate ID cards still clipped to their shirts or belts, fill the cafes and bars.Mr. Vass said the skills of book mending took him 15 years to master \u2014 how to diagnose a book\u2019s ills, what to patch and what to leave alone, how to hide evidence of a repair. He uses hypodermic needles to shoot bits of wheat paste into the corners of dog-eared covers to stiffen them, and an old-fashioned screw press to hold pages in place while adhesives dry.He talks of his repaired books \u2014 60 to 80 a month \u2014 as if they were children heading out into a dangerous, unpredictable world.\u201cI\u2019m reluctant, many times, to send them out because I know what they\u2019re going to be up against,\u201d said Mr. Vass, a soft-spoken man who is used to working alone.Menderies, often called book hospitals, were once common in library systems across the nation. But the digital revolution, cost-control pressures and shifting reader tastes pushed many libraries away from paper and the maintenance of fragile old classics. The internet has made it easy to find used books to replace worn ones, and to borrow through interlibrary lending systems.\u201cWe don\u2019t mend anymore; it\u2019s a lost art,\u201d said Alan Hall, the director of the public library of Steubenville and Jefferson County, Ohio, for the last 33 years. \u201cIt was a question of what you could do without, but it\u2019s also technology taking the place of it.\u201dEven the humble word \u201cto mend,\u201d which derives from a French term for atonement, or \u201cto put right,\u201d is dropping out of circulation, librarians said. Conservation is now the operative term for the specialized, highly skilled work taught in graduate degree programs at places like New York University and the University of Delaware. Graduates of such schools are hired by government archives, university research libraries and some big public systems with deep reserves like the New York Public Library, and by art shops that will bring your grandmother\u2019s tattered copy of \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d back to luster at a price of $500 or more an hour.\u201cConservation has gone through an accreditation/professionalization process,\u201d said Stephanie Lamson, the director of preservation services at the University of Washington Libraries. Technology plays a bigger role now too, supplanting some of the traditions of book repair that were based on long apprenticeship and practice. \u201cIt is quite interdisciplinary,\u201d Ms. Lamson said in an email, \u201cand draws from a wide range of techniques and technologies from microscopy to digital imaging.\u201dBooks themselves have been changing for an even longer period, Mr. Vass said, beginning in the mid-1800s, when growing literacy and a mass market \u2014 the era of dime novels \u2014 drove a switch from traditional stitching to much cheaper glues.But those older glues were acidic time bombs that ate books alive, Mr. Vass said. \u201cThe people who did that first adhesive binding \u2014 they really have a lot to answer for.\u201dMr. Vass, who came to book repair through early training as a fine artist and painter, said his mendery had almost no modern technological tools and needs none. \u201cA computer does not do anything here \u2014 it only interrupts,\u201d he said. His prized piece of machinery is a large cast-iron board shears that had a previous life slicing boxes in a candy company. Made in the early 20th century, it can cut a book\u2019s replacement cover pieces, called boards, with absolute precision. He bought it at an estate sale, covered with dirt and rust, for $50 and restored it.His one exception to technological intrusion is a CD player remote control that he keeps on his workbench. But what plays on the two small speakers above the door is also distinctively out of step with the modern world.Mr. Vass listens to medieval and Renaissance music, and what he hears, in the ethereal choral and cathedral pieces written by composers like Christopher Tye, who lived in England in the 1500s, or Jehan de Lescurel, a French poet and composer of the 1400s, creates what Mr. Vass called \u201ca perfect harmony\u201d with his work. The work of Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote music in the 1700s, is an exception to the mendery\u2019s typical Top 40, which tilts toward tunes from the 13th to 16th centuries. \u201cBach seems like a modern composer to me,\u201d Mr. Vass said with a smile.Love of books pervades the work of the mendery \u2014 and the desire to protect them from the harsh threats of the outside world. Damage from automated library sorting and processing machines, for example, has led Mr. Vass to create cardboard box covers to fit newly repaired volumes, like a kind of armored overcoat.Library patrons, worried or grieving over a damaged or worn-out book \u2014 often a childhood treasure \u2014 sometimes find Mr. Vass and ask for his help. If time allows, he said, he does the work and charges nothing, justifying such side projects, he said, in that they often hone his skills.Words leap occasionally from the pages he works on, in an author\u2019s voice, usually long dead, speaking to him. He keeps one such quote prominently on his desk:\u201cWhatever struggle you have met, find its meaning and it will cease to be a struggle.\u201d He remembers nothing else about the book, neither title nor author. But he knows that he sent it back out, mended and ready to fight on for another day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mubi: A Streaming Service With a Ticking Clock", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byStreamingSpeaking as a user, I consider it an interesting, compelling and sometimes maddening strategy. Recently, while browsing the site\u2019s \u201cNow Showing\u201d page, I spotted a Russian science-fiction film from 2011, \u201cTarget,\u201d directed by Alexander Zeldovich. I saw a screening of it a couple of years ago and have wanted to revisit it ever since. The left-hand corner of the screen read \u201c6 Days Left.\u201d (It\u2019s off the site now, as you read this.) There\u2019s something about that ticking clock that produces anxiety.On the other hand, the diversity and the quality of the selections are exhilarating. Mubi is one of several first-rate sites that cater to cinephiles, and its mix of current and vintage films, the global scope of the selections, and the truly eclectic array of genres is great. (There are films from Australia, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, Israel, Italy and Britain as I write, and none from Senegal, Mali and Morocco, but there have been, and I\u2019m sure there will be others.) You could watch one movie a day and never feel aesthetically pigeonholed.Mubi started about 10 years ago under the name the Auteurs. It ran a small number of films and had a feisty editorial section called (then and now) the Notebook, which I know a bit about because I was one of its early regular contributors. Its social network component was vibrant, but its identity as a film provider in those early days struck me as a little murky. The site was founded by Efe Cakarel, a voluble entrepreneur who, in a recent phone conversation, described the process that led to Mubi\u2019s way of doing things. \u201cIn the beginning, we wanted to be like Netflix, but the unit economies of an \u2018all-you-can-eat\u2019 site is very capital intensive,\u201d Mr. Cakarel said. \u201cThe question becomes, how do you create a compelling experience? If you can\u2019t get 10,000 titles, how about a limited selection?\u201d\u201cAlthough we started as an online site, we have a consistent belief in cinema as a theatrical experience \u2014 films should be seen on a big screen \u2014 so this was a culmination of an ambition,\u201d Mr. Cakarel explained.A few years ago at the Cannes Film Festival, I was having a conversation with a revered veteran French film critic about a movie that had just screened, one that he jocularly wrote off as \u201ca film festival film \u2014 financed with festival money, aimed at festival audiences; no couple living on the Upper West Side is going to say, \u2018Let\u2019s see this film\u2019 on any weekend night.\u201d While I don\u2019t personally include a film such as \u201cBaden Baden\u201d in the category he so disdained, it is true that a lot of movies that do well with festival audiences don\u2019t get far enough out into the marketplace to even start to find a broader audience.Which is where Mubi hopes to offer something: Mr. Cakarel says he\u2019s going into the festival season this year with substantially more money than last year. As for \u201cBaden Baden,\u201d he says it will be available after its Mubi run, on different platforms.\u201cWhen some great film premieres at Cannes, and the rights are bought piecemeal, what typically happens is that after a theatrical run, the movie enters a transactional window \u2014 iTunes, DVD, Blu-ray and so on \u2014 and then a pay TV window, where it will stay exclusively for about 18 months,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring that time, Netflix, with all the money in the world, won\u2019t be able to stream that film. The only way to break this up is to get all the rights to the film, even to go into production.\u201d Netflix and Amazon have made strong impressions in film production, and Mr. Cakarel expressed an ambition to do the same.In February, Mubi will start a \u201cDiscoveries\u201d program, which, as its title implies, focuses on new films that have impressed its programmers at film festivals; it kicks off with \u201cLe Parc,\u201d directed by Damien Manivel, a surreal animated date movie. One film it has in the series for April is a short by the acclaimed French director Bertrand Bonello. Its next theatrical release, slated for spring, is \u201cThe Happiest Day in the Life of Olli M\u00e4ki,\u201d a boxing movie directed by Juho Kuosmanen, about a real-life Finnish fighter and his 1962 world featherweight championship match against the American Davey Moore. (Yes, that\u2019s the same Davey Moore who in 1963, a year after the events of the film, inspired songs by both Phil Ochs and Bob Dylan.)I mentioned to Mr. Cakarel that his approach to brand identity reminded me of certain record labels of the 1970s, specifically Island, which had an eclectic roster of artists and put out products of such consistent quality across the board that even if you bought one of its records without having heard a note of it, you were still likely to have gotten something interesting. He laughed. \u201cI was at a dinner last week where I met [the Island Records founder] Chris Blackwell, and he told me that Mubi reminded him of what he had tried to do with the label.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Proposed Football League Envisions a No-College Path to the Pros", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byThe sports landscape is littered with failed professional football leagues, such is the dominance of the N.F.L.Yet the sports agent Don Yee, who represents New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, thinks he may have found a model that will work: a league for 18- to 21-year-old players who skip college to play professionally right away.Most fledgling leagues, like the defunct U.F.L. or the X.F.L., had rosters filled with castoffs who had gone undrafted out of college or who had bounced around pro teams. The quality of play was uneven, while games often overlapped with the N.F.L. and N.C.A.A. calendars, making it hard to gain attention.Yee and his investment group see their new Pacific Pro Football league, which is expected to start in summer 2018, as more of a development league filled with players who want to immediately start playing a pro-style game while getting a paycheck, rather than risking injury on a college team and receiving no compensation.\u201cMost other leagues usually took players who were deemed not good enough for the N.F.L.,\u201d Yee said. \u201cWe\u2019re now trying to go to the head of the line at the buffet instead of getting the picked-over ones.\u201dThe N.F.L. also has toyed with starting a developmental league. In October, Commissioner Roger Goodell said the team owners had discussed the idea of working with 300 to 400 players to make them \u201cready to play as quickly as possible,\u201d though nothing concrete emerged from the discussions.Other leagues already employ teenagers who skip college. Major League Baseball clubs draft young players and send them to their academies or minor league affiliates. Many N.H.L. teams have players as young as 18 on their rosters. Players can join N.B.A. teams if they are 19 and a year removed from high school. (In 2001, the N.B.A. started its own development league, where the players can be 18.)N.F.L. teams can draft only players who are three years removed from their high school class\u2019s graduation, a rule the league said is intended to protect younger, less physically developed players.\u201cThe physical, mental and emotional demands of our sport would make it almost impossible for someone to have success in the N.F.L. at an earlier age,\u201d said Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman.Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, or Tides, said that the N.F.L. had an incentive not to undercut college football, which he said was a \u201cgreat feeder system.\u201dEven with an alternate league, college football, where players get scholarships but are not paid, would remain a strong draw for high school players because of the potential exposure, he said. He added that requiring athletes to spend more time in college makes it more likely that they will be prepared for life in the N.F.L. and after they retire from the game.\u201cI don\u2019t know how broad the interest in academic development is by the pro leagues, but someone who has a broader range of interests has a more balanced life and has the potential to be a better athlete,\u201d he said.Yee acknowledged that his venture was risky, something his advisers have echoed. Fans already have a lot of options for watching college and professional football, and just paying for the necessary training facilities and transportation could be enough to bankrupt a new league.\u201cI\u2019ve danced with at least three of these groups before, but money was always what killed them,\u201d said Jim Steeg, who is an unpaid adviser to Yee and ran the Super Bowl for the N.F.L. for decades.Steeg estimated that between $5 million and $7 million would be needed to cover the costs of each team for one season, along with a comparable sum to run the league office.Still, Steeg was encouraged that Yee was starting small and aiming for a unique pool of players, and that he had already received funding from an \u201cangel\u201d investor. Yee said he hoped to attract enough money in the next phase of fund-raising to cover the cost of a first season.The league would have four teams based in Southern California, both to reduce expenses and because the region has so many young players. The league would have a six-game schedule plus playoffs, and finish before the college season begins. Players would be paid an average of $50,000 in salary and benefits, including workers\u2019 compensation, a 401(k) plan and free community college tuition.Yee wants to partner with companies in the area to create internships for the players to prepare them for when their football days are over.In addition to Steeg, Yee said he was being advised by, among others, the former N.F.L. coach Mike Shanahan; Mike Pereira, who was in charge of officiating for the N.F.L.; and the ESPN analyst Adam Schefter. Ed McCaffrey, a former Denver Broncos wide receiver, is a co-investor.Having enough money to get a league off the ground is one challenge. Finding a way to publicize it is another. With television already cluttered with dozens of games each week, the chances of a new league finding space on a widely distributed cable network are remote.Yee said that internet giants like Amazon and Netflix were looking for sports content to distribute. It is far from clear, however, whether one of those companies will pay Yee\u2019s league to show games.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon to Add 100,000 Jobs as Bricks-and-Mortar Retail Crumbles", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byAmazon\u2019s new warehouse in Baltimore is a rare economic bright spot there, employing 3,000 people full-time in a city ravaged by poverty and a lack of opportunities for less educated workers.And with Amazon\u2019s announcement Thursday that it plans to hire 100,000 new employees in the next 18 months, the Baltimore facility and at least 70 other Amazon fulfillment centers across the country stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries.Fifteen miles away in the suburbs, all that is left of Owings Mills Mall is rubble, demolition having started in the fall, after the last anchor stores, Macy\u2019s and J. C. Penney, closed within months of each other.The contrast between the two scenes is an example of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter termed \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d the inevitable process in which new industries rise and replace old ones.But creation tends to get more press than destruction, and the announcement from Amazon is no exception.The company\u2019s hiring plans are certainly good news. But to understand the forces roiling the American economy, it\u2019s key to remember that online retailing has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America.That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing over the long term. Greater productivity is essential for economic growth, and, according to the company, the 100,000 figure includes highly paid engineers and software developers in addition to hourly warehouse workers. But for people caught on the wrong side of that transition in the short term, it\u2019s the equivalent of an economic hurricane.\u201cThere are huge benefits to consumers from Amazon,\u201d said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard who studies labor and technological change. \u201cBut the workers they are hiring aren\u2019t the same ones being laid off.\u201dEven since New Year\u2019s Day, the traditional retail sector has absorbed more blows. Macy\u2019s said last week that it would eliminate 10,000 positions, and the Limited announced this week that it would close all 250 of its stores, eliminating 4,000 jobs.The Amazon announcement comes as the company is introducing automation that could one day cost jobs. It uses robots in many of its warehouses, though it says they work in conjunction with people instead of replacing them.One place to start, Mr. Katz said, would be for the government to provide more funding for retraining and also develop a wage insurance program to cover differences in salaries as workers migrate to new, lower-paid jobs from disappearing, higher-paid ones.\u201cThe economy as a whole gains from creative destruction, but we don\u2019t put many resources into training displaced workers,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a real problem, and in practice, we need to do much more.\u201dThe half-full glass in all of this is greater productivity \u2014 an economic force that has been otherwise lacking during the recovery from the Great Recession, said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at J. P. Morgan.Productivity in the retail sector, online and offline, jumped 3 percent in 2015 compared with a measly 0.8 percentage point for business over all, he said. The typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores.Along with making online retailers much more efficient, that difference also helps explain why Amazon is a stock market darling while Macy\u2019s and J. C. Penney are laggards.\u201cYou can\u2019t complain about low productivity and then complain about job reallocation in the same breath,\u201d Mr. Feroli said.Still, a lot of jobs are being reallocated in a fairly short time, in an economy that has only begun to pick up speed recently for many Americans.Mr. Feroli calculates that if it were not for online retailers, of which Amazon is by far the biggest, there would be 1.2 million more retailing jobs in the United States. There are 16 million retail workers in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a figure that includes online sellers like Amazon and traditional stores.In the last four years, traditional retailers have cut more than 200,000 jobs, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago outplacement firm.The seasonal bump in store hiring, a familiar economic story each fall, is also ebbing, according to Challenger. During the holiday shopping season last year, stores added 100,000 fewer temporary workers than in 2013.\u201cThe number of jobs we are losing in retail outpaces the number being created in the sectors that are taking their place,\u201d said Andrew Challenger, vice president of the firm. For example, transportation firms and warehouses are hiring, but not as quickly as bricks-and-mortar stores are laying off workers, he said.Many of the jobs included in the figure Amazon announced on Thursday had already been disclosed by the company, which routinely reveals how many people it plans to hire in different localities when it opens new fulfillment centers.The company has become far more vocal about telling its employment story over the past half-decade, which is partly a reflection of the rapid expansion of its network of warehouses devoted to packaging and shipping products to customers. The expansion began in earnest around 2011, when Amazon began hammering out agreements with state governments to collect sales tax from Amazon customers in those states.At the same time, Amazon decided to make fast shipping a priority, something possible only if it opened more warehouses closer to where customers live.The 100,000 hires it plans for the next 18 months represent a 56 percent increase in the 180,000 full-time United States employees it had at the end of 2016. Amazon has more than 300,000 full- and part-time employees globally.That attention could be politically beneficial for Amazon as Donald J. Trump assumes the presidency. Last year during the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump singled out Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, as having a \u201chuge antitrust problem.\u201d Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Bezos was using his ownership of The Washington Post to discourage political scrutiny of Amazon.But Mr. Bezos was among a group of technology-sector executives who met with Mr. Trump last month, and after Amazon\u2019s announcement of its hiring plans on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary said \u201cthe president-elect was pleased to have played a role in that decision.\u201dDrew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.Amazon has said that its employment figures alone do not capture its full effect on jobs. On Thursday, the company said its marketplace business, through which independent merchants sell goods on the company\u2019s site, sustained 300,000 additional jobs in the United States.In the meantime, a new open-air shopping center is planned for the vast rubble-strewn site in Owings Mills, Md., where shoppers once flocked to Macy\u2019s and J. C. Penney. The demolition should wrap up by spring, although no date has been set for the opening of the new mall, nor have tenants been announced.Advertisement"}

Flanagan, a Republican and Senate leader. \u201cI believe in cutting taxes,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo has other plans to generate revenue, including changing New York\u2019s online sales tax law, which currently requires large online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay to collect sales tax on behalf of the state on shipments to New York buyers if the seller is also in New York.The middle-class idea may, in fact, be the key to a compromise. In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Flanagan said that the two areas in which he and the governor were in agreement were holding the line on property taxes and cutting middle-class rates.And cutting middle-class rates also syncs with Mr. Heastie\u2019s goals for the year, which he reiterated on Wednesday, but with a new wrinkle: proposing an even higher tax rate for multimillionaires to help fund education, and other programs favored by his Democratic colleagues.\u201cWe still feel we want to go beyond that,\u201d Mr. Heastie said, adding, \u201cJust the extension of the millionaires\u2019 tax won\u2019t satisfy the conference\u2019s needs.\u201dVivian Yee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Most Primate Species Threatened With Extinction, Scientists Find", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byMatterOur fellow primates are in trouble.In a study of unprecedented scope, a team of 31 primatologists has analyzed every known species of primate to judge how they are faring. The news for man\u2019s closest animal relatives is not good.\u201cI think we\u2019re going to get quite a number of extinctions within next 50 years if things go on the way they are,\u201d said Anthony B. Rylands, a senior research scientist at Conservation International and a co-author of the new study, which was published in Science Advances.\u201cIt\u2019s a landmark paper,\u201d said Anne D. Yoder, the director of the Duke Lemur Center, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s alarming without being alarmist.\u201dTaking stock of every primate species on Earth was a huge challenge, in part because scientists keep finding new ones. Since 2000, 85 new primate species have been identified, bringing the total to 505.Scientists are finding so many new primate species in part because the destruction of forests is making it easier to reach populations that were once remote.\u201cThere is a certain rush of people in a panic, realizing that if they don\u2019t find and describe them, they will be lost without us ever knowing them,\u201d said Dr. Rylands.Another reason for the burst of discovery is that scientists have started investigating the DNA of primates, finding that some populations had unique mutations..\u201cThere are distinct species that have been around for millions of years, even though they look to our eyes very similar,\u201d said Dr. Yoder. Unfortunately, she noted, new species revealed by DNA often turn out to exist in perilously low numbers.The new research was not all bad news for primates.\u201cSome species are doing O.K.,\u201d said Katherine C. MacKinnon, an anthropologist at Saint Louis University and a co-author of the study. \u201cThe ones that are doing O.K. are the ones that aren\u2019t super-specialists, the ones that are most flexible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s worse than we thought 10 years ago,\u201d Dr. MacKinnon said.She and her colleagues identified a number of human activities pushing primates to the edge, such as hunting. In West Africa, for example, there is a strong demand in local markets for primate meat.\u201cThe forests are still standing, but they\u2019ve shot everything out of it,\u201d said Dr. Rylands.The incentives to kill primates are not only local, though. A lot of primate meat is making its way to China, along with body parts falsely believed to have healing powers.\u201cThey\u2019ll import enormous amounts from around Southeast Asia,\u201d said Dr. Rylands. \u201cThey\u2019re a driving force through the whole region.\u201dPrimates are also threatened by the wholesale destruction of forests to make way for agriculture. In the Amazon, the jungle is being converted to cattle ranches and soybean fields, while in Madagascar, rice paddies are taking the place of lemur forests.Western countries are also helping push primates toward extinction. Palm oil can be found in everything from doughnuts to lipstick to biodiesel fuel. New palm oil plantations are completely replacing forests in Southeast Asia \u2014 one of the most primate-diverse parts of the world.Even cellphones can add to the risks. In central Africa, miners go into rain forests to dig for an ore called coltan that ends up in phone circuits. Those miners hunt for their meals. \u201cThey live on primates,\u201d said Dr. Rylands.Humans have already driven some primate species extinct, but it\u2019s hard to say exactly how many. Madagascar was once home to giant lemurs that could weigh as much as 350 pounds.While Western scientists never laid eyes on these remarkable creatures, the fossil record shows that 17 lemur species became extinct after humans arrived there 2,000 years ago.Some of the most endangered primate species are down to just a few dozen survivors. Their prospects are grim, because many of them live in parts of the world where human populations are projected to grow the fastest.In Madagascar, for example, humans may have to move deeper into lemur habitats for new farmland. \u201cIt\u2019s a pressure cooker, and there\u2019s no way to relieve the pressure,\u201d said Dr. Yoder.The authors of the new study offer a number of reasons it is worth trying to halt the crisis.Recent research has shown that primates are extremely important to the ecosystems in which they live. As they feed on leaves and fruit, for example, they move pollen between trees. They pass seeds in their droppings, allowing plants to spread across a healthy range.\u201cPeople used to think of primates as icing on the cake, as not being vital for ecosystems,\u201d said Dr. MacKinnon. \u201cBut now we know they are.\u201dPrimates have also been invaluable for understanding ourselves.The first primates evolved roughly 80 million years ago, and then split into the living lineages over millions of years. By comparing our biology to those of other primates, we have learned about the evolution of our brains, our vision and our vulnerability to diseases.If those species become extinct, we will lose the opportunity to learn more.While the prospects are dire, Dr. Rylands said there were concrete steps that can be taken to help primates. \u201cYou have to stop hunting them and give them a place to live,\u201d he said.That is easier said than done, he acknowledged, since the local communities where primates live are often struggling to feed their families. In some cases, it may be possible to take the pressure off primates by building fish farms as an alternate source of protein.In other cases, communities may be able to make more money over the long term from tourist operations in intact forests than from slash-and-burn agriculture.Dr. Rylands pointed to the golden lion tamarin as an example of how a primate species can be saved. It once lived in huge numbers in the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil. After the forests were nearly wiped out to make way for sugar plantations and other forms of agriculture, the species nearly vanished.In 1983, the U.S. National Zoo led an international effort to bring them back. Monkeys were bred in captivity, forests were conserved and hunting was banned.Today, the species has a small but stable population of some 3,500 individuals in the wild.\u201cThere are cases where you can bring them back from the brink,\u201d said Dr. Rylands. \u201cBut the immensity of the destruction of tropical forests makes it very difficult.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sears Clings to Catalog Thinking in an Online World", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe Sears Holdings Corporation, which is projected to lose more than $2 billion this year, is in the retailing dead pool. As its prospects for a turnaround appear to grow dimmer, it may seem to be another morality tale for bricks-and-mortar retailers in the age of Amazon.Yet it is a lesson that even Sears recognizes. Like other retailers, the company is scrambling to adapt to today\u2019s internet market. The question is whether it can do so before its cash runs out and the deal-making of its hedge fund chief executive, Edward S. Lampert is not enough to create more.Everyone knows Sears, which has been around for over 130 years. It started as a catalog business, the Amazon of a century ago, where you could buy just about anything. And I mean anything. I lived for several years in a Sears catalog home, shipped to my town by Sears at the turn of the 20th century.But in recent years, Sears has struggled. The company has lost over $9 billion in the last five years. Since 2011, it has shut more than 150 of its big Sears stores and over 350 Kmart stores, and it has just announced the closing of another 150 stores. Its revenue has fallen to a projected $25 billion in 2016, from $42.6 billion in 2011, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.The outlook is grim for Sears. This month, the company said that comparable sales had declined by 12 to 13 percent over the holiday shopping season. Its stock price has fallen to $8.75, from a high of over $190.Amazon, in the meantime, has soared. Its revenue is on track to reach $136 billion in revenue this year, according to S.&P. Global Market Intelligence, up over 30 percent from the previous year. Amazon has a market value of $395 billion as it dominates internet retail. And Amazon is on a roll, not just with sales but also with new products like the Echo that are must-haves, at least if you want your children to be screaming for Alexa to play Disney tunes all day.Other bricks-and-mortar retailers are struggling as well because of the Amazon juggernaut. Macy\u2019s has announced store closures and a revenue decline. J. C. Penney has reported disappointing sales.Still, Sears is a special case. Since 2008, it has been directly run and at times aided by Mr. Lampert.Despite a decade of decline, Mr. Lampert \u2014 who is after all a person who can read numbers even if he seldom leaves his compound in Florida \u2014 still seems to believe in a future for Sears, whose headquarters is in the Chicago suburbs. What is he up to?Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund acquired Kmart out of bankruptcy and combined it with Sears. At first, it looked like a miracle as the stock and sales rose. But the financial crisis was grim for Sears.Over the years, Mr. Lampert has managed the company directly \u2014 some say micromanaged \u2014 by dividing managers into segments and pitting them against one another. In addition, he has tried to refocus Sears onto the internet. This has involved the Shop Your Way strategy, in which Sears is to become an \u201casset light\u201d company with \u201cmembers\u201d who can shop online and at more streamlined stores.Despite the conventional wisdom, though, it is not Amazon that is primarily to blame for Sears\u2019s plight. Sears is being squeezed by changing economies and technology. Shoppers go to Walmart for discount items or to Target for discount items with a touch of style. The high end stays at stores like Nordstrom. The middle is smaller and increasingly shops online.(Sears, when asked to comment, referred to recent news releases.)Lots of financing transactions have included a rights offering and letters of credit and loans from Mr. Lampert\u2019s own hedge fund. The financial engineering has been extreme, while the turnaround has been slow to realize.In all of this, Sears itself has declined in value while Mr. Lampert\u2019s net worth has fallen to $2 billion from about $3 billion.So why doesn\u2019t he just try to liquidate the company instead?After all, Sears has $5 billion in inventory alone, lots of real estate still to monetize and beloved brands like Kenmore and DieHard that it has yet to sell. This is a classic 1980s play; the breakup value is much more than that of the existing company.One explanation is that it would be expensive to liquidate Sears. Shutting down 1,600 stores would be chaotic, and selling $5 billion worth of inventory at liquidation value would yield much less. Seritage, which mostly holds Sears property, would be significantly affected.But another explanation is that whatever you think of the execution, Sears is onto something. Bricks-and-mortar retail is not going away\u2014 it still dominates online sales and most likely always will. But retail is fragmenting and shifting into branded stores.Sears was once the Amazon of its day through its catalogs, and it successfully migrated to stores. Companies like Allstate, Dean Witter and Discover were spun out of Sears. Back then the company was everything to all consumers. Now, at a time when Amazon is everything to all customers, $24 billion in sales is still nothing to sneeze at, and surely some Sears stores are still profitable.This is ultimately Mr. Lampert\u2019s strategy \u2014 leverage a huge ground footprint to extend into the internet. A ground footprint is valuable not just because people still mostly shop by ground but also as a delivery vehicle. Amazon itself is opening up some physical stores.Here, Mr. Lampert is betting that Sears can transform itself by leveraging its ground footprint and streamlining it. It has invested in a newer, more streamlined store format selling appliances. The first of these opened in Fort Collins, Colo.But that belies the question of whom Sears is marketing to: discount shoppers or a more upmarket crowd? In today\u2019s day and age it is impossible to be everything for everyone in a physical store when the internet is simply much better at it.All of this must be done when Amazon or Walmart could buy the retailer for pocket change at this point. If Sears intended to dominate the internet, it should have started 15 years ago when it had the brand recognition to do so.In the end, the problem with Sears may be that while Mr. Lampert may be sure of Sears\u2019s value, the public just isn\u2019t sure of where it stands in the hierarchy of retailers when a ground store selling everything just isn\u2019t what it used to be. No amount of Wall Street alchemy and deal-making can fix this problem.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Sweden, Happiness in a Shorter Workday Can\u2019t Overcome the Cost", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byThere\u2019s just one catch. The practice is too expensive and unwieldy to become widespread in Sweden anytime soon.The two-year trial, which took place in the southern city of Gothenburg, centered on a municipal retirement home where workers were switched to a six-hour day, from eight hours, with no pay cut. Seventeen new nursing positions were created to make up for the loss of time, at a cost of around 700,000 euros, or $738,000, a year.Although it was small, the experiment stoked a widespread discussion about the future of work, namely whether investing in a better work-life balance for employees, and treating workers well rather than squeezing them, benefits the bottom line for companies and economies.\u201cThe trial showed that there are many benefits of a shorter working day,\u201d said Daniel Bernmar, the leader of the Left party on Gothenburg\u2019s City Council, which had pushed for the experiment. \u201cThey include healthier staff, a better work environment and lower unemployment.\u201dBut the high price tag, and political skepticism about the practicality of a shorter workday, was likely to discourage widespread support for taking the concept nationwide.\u201cThe government is avoiding talking about the issue,\u201d Mr. Bernmar said. \u201cThey\u2019re not interested in looking at the bigger picture.\u201dWhile a growing number of countries and companies are studying the concept of employee happiness, the idea of improving it through shorter work hours has by no means gained broad traction. In Gothenburg, the City Council\u2019s conservative opposition parties derided the experiment as a utopian folly and sought to kill it, citing high costs for taxpayers and arguments that the government should not intrude in the workplace. The current government is also not backing a shorter workweek.Even the handful of progressive political groups aligned with Mr. Bernmar\u2019s Left party have not made a six-hour workday in Sweden a priority in their platforms. Nor have large Swedish companies, including multinationals active around the world, embraced the idea. Other Swedish towns that previously conducted limited experiments with a shorter public-sector workweek eventually abandoned the concept, citing high costs and flawed implementation.A similar model in France has been controversial for more than 15 years, ever since a Socialist government made a 35-hour workweek mandatory.Still, some large companies are beginning to explore the argument that happy workers may make better, more productive employees.In the experiment at the Gothenburg retirement home, employees reported working with greater efficiency and energy when their hours were cut to six from eight a day. They called in sick 15 percent less than before and perceived their health to have improved at least 20 percent, according to a preliminary review issued last year.At a nearby municipal retirement home, where a control trial left working conditions unchanged, employees reported increased blood pressure and said they perceived no improvement in their health, peace of mind or alertness, the review showed. A final report is scheduled to be released in March.The program increased Gothenburg\u2019s costs by 22 percent, mostly to pay for new employees. But around 10 percent was offset by reduced costs to the state from people being taken off the unemployment rolls and paying taxes into the system, rather than receiving state subsidies, Mr. Bernmar said.Modest experiments are moving ahead in a handful of small towns in Sweden, mostly in the public health care sector, to see if the results from Gothenburg can be duplicated. This year, four additional Swedish municipalities are expected to start research programs.A small but growing number of private Swedish companies, mainly technology start-ups, are also dabbling with the concept, following the lead of some established companies, including a Toyota service center in Gothenburg that has successfully operated on a six-hour day for more than a decade.The question, Mr. Bernmar added, was \u201cshould we work to live, not live to work?\u201dAdvertisement"}

These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen.\u201dSeven job candidates, all of them originally from Iran but citizens of other countries, have received employment offers from Amazon. The company is considering jobs for the candidates in other countries.In an email to Amazon employees, the chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said the company had expressed its opposition to the order to senior administration officials and congressional leaders. He said the company was exploring \u201cother legal options as well.\u201d\u201cFor tech leaders, it\u2019s a work force issue,\u201d said Michael Schutzler, the chief executive of the Washington Technology Industry Association, a trade group representing the state\u2019s technology companies. \u201cWe have a huge shortage of talent. We create jobs 10 times faster than the state can produce talent. Reducing our ability to recruit talent to the state essentially concedes the field to our international competitors.\u201dAt Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., hundreds of employees crowded into a quad near the main cafeteria to protest the order. Employees carried signs like \u201cTrump, Don\u2019t Be Evil\u201d and \u201cSilicon Valley: Built by Immigrants,\u201d while others chanted \u201cNo Ban, No Wall\u201d into a megaphone.It was a scene more fitting for a college campus than a gathering of employees at one of America\u2019s most valuable companies. Google offices in other cities like Seattle, San Francisco and New York held similar rallies. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, told employees at the rally that immigration was \u201ccore to the founding of this company.\u201dWhen the Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who attended the protests at the San Francisco airport on Saturday, was introduced, the crowd broke into chants of \u201cSergey, Sergey, Sergey.\u201d Mr. Brin noted that he came to the United States as a 6-year-old refugee from the Soviet Union when nuclear tensions between the two countries were at their peak.The reaction from major American companies to President Trump\u2019s order has ranged from silence to outrage.\u201cEven then, the U.S. had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees,\u201d he said.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today or have any kind of life I have today if this wasn\u2019t a great country that stood up and spoke for liberty,\u201d Mr. Brin added.Soufi Esmaeilzadeh, a Google product manager who is an Iranian national with Canadian citizenship who resides in the United States with a green card, said that Google\u2019s immigration team initially recommended that she not return home from a business trip in Switzerland after the order was signed on Friday.\u201cMy life is in the U.S. I felt angry, scared, and honestly rejected,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel free or at peace.\u201dBut after the stay won by the American Civil Liberties Union, Google told her that she might have a small window to return but needed to leave immediately. Flying through Dublin, she said four immigration officers pored over her paperwork. She eventually arrived in San Francisco on Sunday.An earlier version of this article misstated the day on which Amazon and Expedia stepped up their opposition to President Trump\u2019s immigration order. It was Monday, not Tuesday.An article on Tuesday about a legal fight of many technology firms against President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration referred imprecisely to the Iranian revolution, which led Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia\u2019s chief executive, to flee the country with his parents. Although Mr. Khosrowshahi left Iran in 1978, when there was unrest against the shah, the revolution was not over at that point.

The enclave is exclusive, full of showpiece brick homes, many decorated with flying flags of distant republics.Her stroll on Wednesday was serene save for the buzzing of saws, the thumping of hammers and the nearly constant chop-chop-chop of helicopters overhead. All were telltale signals that some well-known residents are moving in: President Obama and his family; President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner; and the Amazon founder and billionaire Jeff Bezos, to name a few.Another will soon join the crowd. Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil and Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state, is in the process of buying a home nearby on 24th Street Northwest, said Jack Evans, a District of Columbia City Council member whose ward includes the neighborhood. A person with knowledge of the sale, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Evans was correct.\u201cIn New York, it\u2019s what building Madonna is in,\u201d said Ms. Ahamed, a writer and United States advisory board member of Doctors Without Borders who splits her time among New York, Los Angeles and Washington. \u201cHere, it\u2019s which politician is living next to you.\u201dThe neighborhood, a stately jumble of embassies, ambassadors\u2019 residences, and homes owned by financiers, lobbyists and other members of the upper class, has always been exclusive. But a stormy political climate has produced an unusual medley of newcomers who have generated interest in the neighborhood that extends well beyond Washington.On Belmont Road, the Obamas will take up residence in a Tudor-style home around the corner from Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, who will live in a large white home on Tracy Place. A few streets away, on S Street, Mr. Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is renovating a former textile museum, which sits between the former home of Woodrow Wilson, the nation\u2019s 28th president, and the embassy of Myanmar. Mr. Tillerson is said to be moving in somewhere between Mr. Bezos and Ms. Trump.To many residents here, the big-ticket real estate shuffle is normal as they insist that, really, this is a neighborhood like any other. It\u2019s no big deal, they say, to invite a high-profile neighbor over for a meal made from a backyard pizza oven, or to be on an email chain with the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d anchor Chris Wallace, another resident, gossiping over neighborhood changes or complaining about the lack of parking in the area.Holly Sukenik, who has lived in Kalorama since 1981 and lives a few doors down from Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner\u2019s home, rattled off a list of well-known Washington names to emphasize that residents here have seen it all before.\u201cRumsfeld lived there,\u201d Ms. Sukenik said, pointing in one direction, toward the former home of Donald H. Rumsfeld, who lived in Kalorama when he was defense secretary in the George W. Bush administration.\u201cCaspar Weinberger lived there,\u201d she said, motioning in the direction of a home once occupied by President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first defense secretary.\u201cAnd that Austrian spy,\u201d she paused. \u201cWhat was his name?\u201d\u201cMedia was parked in my driveway,\u201d Ms. Sukenik said. \u201cI was like: \u2018Excuse me, guys. I\u2019ve got to leave.\u2019\u201dOthers know the drill. For the past six years, the lobbyist Tony Podesta \u2014 the owner of that backyard pizza oven and the brother of John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign chairman \u2014 has lived two doors down from the Obama family\u2019s new home. He said longtime residents were used to the influx of new people, but an arrival does occasionally raise an eyebrow.\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since we\u2019ve had a president,\u201d Mr. Podesta conceded. Of Mr. Bezos, he added, \u201cTurning the museum into a private home was a little bit of a surprise to the neighborhood.\u201d\u201cWe have our share of wealthy people,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s a different dimension.\u201dEven for a neighborhood full of people who say they try not to focus on the comings and goings of others, gossip has a way of spreading quickly. Residents have been on the alert for activity in front of Ms. Trump\u2019s new residence, and on Wednesday, two moving trucks and two security vans were parked near the house.Residents are also subtly monitoring the construction going on outside the Obama residence, which on Wednesday remained approachable from the street. Once the Obamas move in, people are expecting a bigger security presence, including roadblocks near the residence and more Secret Service officers, said Mr. Evans, the City Council member.\u201cI think the Secret Service probably likes it, because they\u2019re used to that area,\u201d he added.Ms. Sukenik and Ms. Ahamed say they have heard worrying talk that Belmont Road will be cut off to traffic. Residents are also concerned that protesters will march through the neighborhood on Inauguration Day on Friday to drop off messages for Ms. Trump, urging her to stand up for women\u2019s rights.But, Ms. Ahamed said, this could be untrue. Nearby, a poster for the Women\u2019s March on Washington had been taped to a street lamp across the street from Ms. Trump\u2019s new home.\u201cI hope they\u2019ll be happy,\u201d Ms. Ahamed said of the couple. \u201cIt\u2019s a very nice, very quiet neighborhood.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Grass-Fed Beef, Sold One Cow at a Time", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byLOPEZ ISLAND, Wash. \u2014 On a blustery afternoon in December, Scott Meyers mingled in a pasture with a herd of black cattle, sweet-talking them as if they were family dogs with a weakness for flattery. He scratched their backs, hugged them and rattled off their names: Chocolate, Fudge, Honey.From these pampered creatures, Mr. Meyers produces grass-fed Wagyu beef, celebrated for a buttery flavor that comes from the Japanese breed\u2019s intense fat marbling.\u201cThey\u2019re really providing a great service,\u201d said Mr. Meyers, 60, who runs Sweet Grass Farm with his wife, Brigit Waring. \u201cThey\u2019re that really helpful middleman.\u201dInternet middlemen help ordinary people share cars and apartments. Why not cattle?The concept is starting to catch on with beef connoisseurs and small ranchers like Mr. Meyers, who would rather spend time ranching than doing all the work required to sell beef directly to customers: blogging about their cattle, promoting themselves on social media, juggling order logistics.Crowd Cow and similar start-ups promise to do that work, without obliterating the identities of small ranchers like Mr. Meyers. Rather than putting its own brand on the meat it buys, Crowd Cow advertises the beef\u2019s producers and allows them to tell the stories of their ranches on its website.\u201cThey\u2019re transparent \u2014 they sell our product as our product,\u201d said Mr. Meyers, who also sells beef directly to Seattle-area customers through his company\u2019s website. \u201cIt gives me some security. If I put my beef in a store, that limits my identity.\u201dJoe Heitzeberg, the chief executive of Crowd Cow, which has sold nearly 200 cows online, founded the company with Ethan Lowry.

We want you to understand the differences.\u201dLong before the dawn of the computer, friends, families and neighbors banded together to buy cows from local cattle ranchers, divvying up the butchered parts into quarters and other fractions that stuffed their freezers and fed them for months.While even large commercial cattle operations now sell grass-fed beef and many supermarkets stock it, some consumers prefer the beef they get from small producers online.\u201cI felt like there was more flavor coming to the table,\u201d Timothy Enns, a biotechnology executive in Pleasanton, Calif., said of the beef Crowd Cow sells. \u201cIt\u2019s a very high-quality product.\u201dLoren Taylor, of Ocean Shores, Wash., has ordered several times from Crowd Cow, and enjoyed the beef from Sweet Grass Farm. \u201cMy favorite is the Wagyu,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cThat meat is awesome. You can definitely taste it.\u201d\u201cI really do believe it\u2019s the way their farmers take care of their cows,\u201d she added.Mike Salguero, the founder and chief executive of ButcherBox, said the company had about 10,000 subscribers nationwide, and each month shipped 100,000 to 200,000 pounds of meat, including pork and chicken, from various ranches. It identifies the sources of all of its meat in the box.Crowd Cow takes a different approach, spotlighting a single cattle ranch at a time and selling the beef from only one of its cows until the entire animal is gone. Much of its beef comes in variety packs: A recent sale from Step by Step Farm in Curtis, Wash., featured a $69 package that included four eight-ounce flat iron steaks, two 10-ounce chuck steaks and two pounds of ground beef.More intrepid eaters can buy hearts, livers and tongues. The company sold turkeys for Thanksgiving, and plans to expand to other kinds of meat.Crowd Cow buys the animals after they are already dry-aged, butchered and vacuum-sealed in plastic, so it can deliver orders within a week. For now, the company gets its beef from Washington ranches and serves customers only in the West, with plans to expand eventually to the East Coast.\u201cI can honestly say it makes it more simple for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have one big customer. Sometimes I think, \u2018Wait, that\u2019s scary.\u2019 Everyone says don\u2019t put your eggs in one basket.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t have as much desk work to do,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about who is going to take this carcass or that carcass. It has given me more time to focus on cattle and the ranch.\u201dStill, some independent cattle ranchers said it was risky to distribute largely through an internet start-up, which could be acquired down the line by a company less interested in how the meat is raised.\u201cThat\u2019s what happens with venture capital: They sell the business to somebody and everything changes,\u201d Mr. Elzinga said. \u201cCorporate boardroom decision-making isn\u2019t always aligned with the small producer.\u201dBut Mr. Heitzeberg said he and his co-founder had set out to build a company that could grow without compromising its values. \u201cWe are not looking for an exit,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The company said it is learning \u201chow best to match content with audiences tastes around the world.\u201d It added 5.1 million international members in the quarter, and now has 44.4 million members outside the United States, more than than 47 percent of its total membership.Netflix cited its original series \u201cMarvel\u2019s Luke Cage\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d as worldwide hits. It said it planned to invest more than $6 billion in content this year, up from $5 billion in 2016.Profits are rising steadily.

The company projected that profits would reach $165 million in the current quarter, up from $28 million in the period a year ago.\u201cWe don\u2019t really believe in hockey-stick businesses, like suddenly we will turn significantly profitable at 200 million members,\u201d Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, said during a conference call. \u201cWe think it is much smarter to grow into that bit by bit.\u201dCompetition in streaming television is becoming more fierce and remains a big challenge for Netflix. The company, a pioneer in the market, listed a number of competitors that are encroaching on its turf, including Amazon, which recently announced a global expansion, and YouTube, which leads online video viewing time worldwide. Meanwhile, satellite television companies and traditional television outlets are pouring more resources into streaming offerings.\u201cIn short, it\u2019s becoming an internet TV world, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Netflix as we strive to earn screen time,\u201d Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.The company predicted that subscriptions would continue to grow in the current quarter, although slower than in the period last year. It forecast that it would add 5.2 million members, 1.5 million of them in the United States and 3.7 million abroad. It attributed the slowdown to tough comparisons from the same period last year, particularly with the introduction of the service in 130 countries last January.The quarter was the 10th anniversary of Netflix\u2019s streaming service, which began with the vision that internet television would ultimately replace traditional television. But even as Netflix reported its biggest net addition of streaming members in its history, Mr. Hastings was not satisfied standing still. Asked about his ultimate vision for the company during the conference call, he said, \u201cYou never want to characterize something as an ultimate vision, because when you get there, there is always more you want to do.\u201d\u201cThink of us as just continuing to iterate on the basic cycle of more content and better product, that combines at a great service at a great price,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, with that we can attract many more people to join Netflix, and then that fuels the whole cycle.

The new board will be led by Kenneth Mehlman, who managed President George W.

Mr. Mehlman will volunteer part of his time to the new board, which is recruiting other members who will also serve in a part-time capacity.\u201cYou can make change, but in order for it to be sustainable, you need to build a movement to support it,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview. \u201cNo amount of private research or philanthropy is going to shift that. At the end of the day, the government has far more resources than any individual organization does.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Chan, who live only a few miles from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s office in Palo Alto, Calif., are regularly involved in its direction and major decisions. The couple have identified several main causes, including curing all disease, to which they have pledged $3 billion, and changing the way children are educated through personalized learning, under which teaching is more tailored to each child.In his new role, Mr. Plouffe will run the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s policy and advocacy team. Mr. Plouffe described the job in terms similar to a campaign effort.\u201cCuring disease, improving education through personalized learning and building technology and tools to help organizations reach their full potential are areas with widespread support and massive potential for mobilization, great storytelling and smart policy engagement,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post.Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, described Mr. Plouffe\u2019s departure as amicable.

{"Headline": "How Alexa Fits Into Amazon\u2019s Prime Directive", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyWhen \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation\u201d first aired in the 1980s, it envisioned a number of technological advances for humankind\u2019s future. Set in the 24th century, the show featured 3-D printers, visors that could provide artificial sight and a virtual reality simulator called the holodeck. But perhaps its most prescient creation was the supercomputer onboard the ship. The software \u2014 usually referred to only as \u201cComputer\u201d \u2014 could locate people, open doors and retrieve answers to complicated questions. Crew members spoke their requests, and an always-present helper responded within seconds.Amazon brought a version of that computer to life recently \u2014 albeit a few centuries earlier than \u201cStar Trek\u201d predicted. Last July, David Limp, a company executive who works on the product, said in an interview with Fortune that the idea of an all-knowing machine, with access to all the world\u2019s information, had captured his imagination since the first time he saw it on television. It took, he said, a team of 1,000 engineers to write its code, and when the device was finished, Amazon decided to call it Alexa, shorthand for Alexandria, as in the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt. It is designed to work primarily with a suite of wireless speakers, also made by Amazon, called Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.The company bills Alexa as a smart personal assistant, one that can play your favorite song or read you a book or recite a recipe as you cook. You can also make purchases through Amazon simply by asking. The possibilities are seemingly endless, because Alexa can learn new \u201cskills\u201d (as Amazon likes to call them) from third-party developers who integrate Alexa into their own products. And developers have leapt at the opportunity to do so: At the beginning of 2016, there were 135 skills designed to work with Alexa, but this year that number increased to more than 7,000. Alexa can now order you an Uber or a pizza, check your bank balance, control your TV, turn your lights on and off and even measure your car\u2019s carbon-dioxide emissions. \u201c\u2009\u2018Alexa, buy me coffee\u2019 is just a fraction of what it\u2019s going to be over time,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an internet analyst who covers Amazon for the equities firm Macquarie Securities. \u201cWhat can they improve with the voice activation? Some of that has yet to be seen.\u201dAlexa has already evolved from an experimental device to an irresistible household fixture \u2014 perhaps surprisingly, given Amazon\u2019s spotty track record with hardware. Kindle e-readers are popular, but the company\u2019s attempt at a smartphone flopped hard. Schachter told me that part of Alexa\u2019s success was luck, in that there were few other shiny consumer offerings on the market this holiday season and the price point was affordable. But something about the future-feel of this device, its ease and convenience, has captivated a mass audience, even the most privacy-conscious among us. Alexa is always listening, ready to be of service. (This has already backfired: When a newscaster relayed a story about a little girl using her Alexa to order a dollhouse, it triggered dozens of Alexas in the homes of people watching the broadcast to also try to order one.)Five years ago, few would have guessed that Amazon would already be ahead of the top tech companies vying to be leaders in home automation. But Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of the company, has been shaping this vision since the earliest days of Amazon. I recently revisited \u201cThe Everything Store,\u201d a 2013 book by Brad Stone about how Bezos transformed the start-up from an online bookstore into the e-commerce behemoth it is today. \u201cBezos\u2019 long-term goal is to sell everything, everywhere,\u201d Stone writes. \u201cHe will attempt to move faster, work his employees harder, make bolder bets and pursue both big inventions and small ones, all to achieve his grand vision for Amazon \u2014 that it be not just an everything store, but ultimately an everything company.\u201dThe fact that I live in New York, a city that thrives on accessibility, might explain why I was slow to grasp the appeal of Alexa. Here we have bodegas on every corner, most open 24 hours, in case you need to pick up a roll of toilet paper or a bottle of hot sauce in the middle of the night. But most Americans don\u2019t live with the luxury of that immediacy. I didn\u2019t really understand this until the holidays, when I went home to visit my mom in Virginia and we ran out of seltzer. Carbonated water is not an essential item. But in that moment, it would have been easier to quickly tell Alexa to place an order for us and forget about it until it arrived two or three days later, rather than try to remember to pick up a case of Poland Spring the next time someone made the 20-minute drive to the store. That\u2019s the entire enticing promise of Amazon and Alexa: a much more efficient and manageable life, one in which you can outsource mundane tasks while you do something more important, like spend time with your family.It\u2019s not hard to imagine that Alexa might be displaced as rivals introduce their own efforts. Facebook is working on an intelligent assistant, called Jarvis (named for the smart computer that helps Tony Stark, or Iron Man, navigate his surroundings), as is Microsoft. There are rumors that Apple is working on a major update for Siri. Google is currently Amazon\u2019s closest competitor. The company has spent decades organizing the world\u2019s information and learning about our habits and preferences in the process, so that it will one day know what we want even before we do. Search, then, will evolve away from the actual act of searching to the act of surfacing. The company is working on a version of artificial intelligence called Google Assistant to perfect that very ability.But while Google is working to anticipate your needs, Amazon is readying itself to be the only place you need to go to fulfill them. Thinking about Amazon\u2019s restraints \u2014 the company has never tried to introduce a social network or an email service, for example \u2014 you can understand something about the future Amazon seems to envision: A time when no screen is needed at all, just your voice.Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of CB Insights, a trend-forecasting start-up in New York, told me that Amazon has something that its competitors only dream of \u2014 consumer attention and trust. \u201cIn the last few years, Amazon has become the search engine for consumer products, instead of Google,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to buy something, and you already have an Amazon account, you\u2019re probably going to just buy it there. With Google, you still have to go to Amazon or Walmart.\u201d Amazon is investing in supply trailers, drones and fulfillment centers to develop its own postal service and delivery system. And it\u2019s still pushing its Dash buttons, those small pieces of hardware with one purpose: to order a single item from Amazon, like laundry detergent or dish soap. They seem unnecessary, until you consider them with all of Amazon\u2019s other efforts: It\u2019s not just an everything store, or even an everything company, but an everywhere (and anytime!) store.The various products that Amazon is planning to roll out \u2014 including Pantry and Fresh, its grocery service \u2014 can be easily baked into default Alexa services. Restaurants, the company\u2019s version of Seamless, already is. All this in turn brings in more money for Amazon. As Limp put it back in July: \u201cThe nice thing about the Amazon device business is that when we sell a device, generally people buy more bluejeans. And little black dresses. And shoes.\u201dThere\u2019s a theory that behavioral economists use to explain our consumption habits called \u201chyperbolic discounting,\u201d which is the tendency to choose short-term rewards over long-term gains. The \u201cmarshmallow test\u201d of the 1960s tested the ability of preschoolers to resist temptation \u2014 the titular marshmallow, within reach \u2014 with the promise that they would be rewarded with two if they waited. In the experiment\u2019s most popular interpretation, those who had self-control grew up to be much more successful than those who did not. It is one of the most formative studies in self-control and how people make decisions. Alexa is the ultimate marshmallow test, and most of us are failing. We are being conditioned, as a population, to never wait, to never delay our gratification, to accept thoughtless, constant consumption as the new norm. But how we think about consumption and willpower carry enormous implications for the environment and the culture of society as a whole. Think about that the next time you ask Alexa to order you another roll of toilet paper.An article on Jan. 29 about Alexa, Amazon\u2019s home assistant, misstated the total number of marshmallows offered to subjects of the \u201cmarshmallow test,\u201d which measured the ability of preschoolers to delay gratification. If the subjects could resist the temptation of a single marshmallow, they were rewarded with one more \u2014 not two more.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Trump won\u2019t be sworn in until Friday but big business has already thrown him a veritable inaugural ball.While the jobs and investments are real enough, all of these corporate behemoths will soon have business before the new administration, with make-or-break moves expected on mergers, trade policy, tax reform, defense contracts and regulation.Signaling to the president-elect and his team that they are on board now also provides chief executives with more leverage down the line.\u201cIt might be an attempt to buy good will, but I don\u2019t blame them for trying to do that,\u201d said Tom C. Korologos, a longtime Republican strategist and an adviser at the law firm DLA Piper in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a new administration, and companies are nervous and don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201dUltimately, the new administration\u2019s decisions will be formulated far from the limelight in conference rooms at federal agencies in Washington or behind closed doors on Capitol Hill. The money riding on the outcome runs into the trillions.And on high-profile issues, the companies will need to make a strong case.Detroit automakers, for example, are concerned that Washington will impose tariffs on cars made in Mexico, but they are eager for wiggle room on new fuel-efficiency standards at home. Walmart is worried about rising trade tensions with China, where many of the products it sells are made.On a call with the news media on Tuesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, cited a new pledge by Bayer to invest $8 billion in the United States and create 3,000 jobs.\u201cThe reason for this commitment and expansion is because of the president-elect\u2019s focus on creating better business climate here in the United States,\u201d he said.Mr. Korologos played down the idea that big business would get specific favors in exchange for hiring or investing. But he acknowledged that many of the announcements were choreographed for maximum political impact.\u201cThere\u2019s too many hoops to jump through and too many institutions for it to be a simple quid pro quo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what Trump is doing is very unusual, and these decisions weren\u2019t made 48 hours ago or after a tweet. They were in the works for a long time.\u201dMr. Spicer did point out that Bayer\u2019s decision to hire and invest more in the United States had not been disclosed previously \u2014 unlike some highly promoted announcements that were essentially recycled versions of previous news releases. In other cases, companies are talking up hiring plans now, after earlier decisions to quietly shed workers.Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, said Tuesday it would create about 10,000 jobs when it opens about 60 new stores, plans that had already been announced last year. The additions to the work force are largely in line with Walmart\u2019s typical hiring practices for new stores, according to a company spokesman, Lorenzo Lopez.Months before it announced the new stores last year, Walmart said it could lose as many as 16,000 workers by closing 154 of its American locations and 115 stores overseas. Mr. Lopez said on Tuesday that \u201ca lot\u201d of the workers who had been affected by the store closures were able to move to surrounding Walmart stores.In the case of the auto industry, Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of imports of Mexican-made vehicles has prompted companies to defend their American manufacturing presence aggressively and announce new investments, some of which had long been in the planning stages.Last week, the chief executive of Fiat Chrysler, Sergio Marchionne, admitted that plans for 2,000 new jobs in the United States had been under consideration long before Mr. Trump won the presidency in November.\u201cThe decision has been in the works for a long time, dating back to 2015,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said during an appearance at the Detroit auto show. \u201cIt is just a continuation of the retooling of the U.S. manufacturing base.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s immediate \u2014 and positive \u2014 reaction to the announcement underscored how closely the president-elect is following the automotive job picture, and how his keen interest in American manufacturing is influencing automakers.On Tuesday, General Motors, the largest American automaker, announced $1 billion in new investment in its American factories that would create or retain 1,500 jobs. The automaker also said it was moving production of axles from Mexico to the United States and creating 450 American jobs, and would continue to add thousands of new technology jobs over the next few years.In a statement, G.M. said the plans had been \u201cin the works for some time.\u201d Yet the timing of the announcement was no coincidence, given Mr. Trump\u2019s interest.\u201cThere\u2019s no question there is an emphasis on job creation in the U.S. right now,\u201d said Patrick E. Morrissey, a G.M. spokesman. \u201cThis was good timing for us to share what we are doing.\u201dIndeed, on Tuesday, Mr. Trump publicly thanked G.M. and Walmart via Twitter within hours of their announcements.\u201cIn 2009 and 2010 under President Obama, it was sustainability, and in 2017 with Trump it\u2019s domestic manufacturing,\u201d Mr. Mehlman said.For automakers, that is an important issue as G.M. and many other companies make cars in Mexico for sale in the United States.The automaker has so far declined to stop importing cars from Mexico. But the entire auto industry is bracing for potential changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement that could disrupt their intricate production structure in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Industry analysts see the widely publicized announcements of new jobs as attempts by car companies to both blunt the president-elect\u2019s criticism and curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\u201cRetaining and growing jobs in the U.S. is a political hot button right now,\u201d said Michael Harley, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThe timing of the announcement shows General Motors is more than willing to play the new administration\u2019s publicity game.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about companies\u2019 announcing hiring plans in the United States after the election of Donald J. Trump misstated the share of Lockheed Martin\u2019s revenue that comes from the federal government. It is more than 70 percent, not 20 percent.Rachel Abrams contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Could these beasts understand the primitive conversations around the fire? Why was barking their only form of communication? The questions modern humans have now about dogs may be along the same lines, just updated for our times. Do we secretly yearn for beings that eat things out of the trash and drool when excited to be preoccupied with geopolitics, insurance rates or 4G data plans?

An insistence that they share our values, our sense of humor, our embrace of capitalism. Some ancient cultures deified dogs. Some contemporary cultures eat them. We make them talk.Advertisement"}

Or at least the robots that will take our jobs.The role of automation in displacing workers has been a popular topic since the presidential election. Indeed, it could be easily argued that more blue-collar jobs in the United States have been lost to machines than to foreign workers. A modern steel mill, called a minimill, for example, is mostly automated and needs a fraction of the workers needed at an older mill.There is no question that companies that handle large volumes of products, like Amazon, are eager to automate as much work as possible in their distribution centers. But envisioning the role of robots beyond repetitive manual labor (and perhaps even call centers and some legal research) gets trickier.One day, they may be. But that day is most likely a long way out. A self-driving truck would be prohibitively expensive. That is, if you could buy one. And right now, you can\u2019t.Advertisement"}

Elizabeth Alanis, a friend of the bride and a minister of the American Marriage Ministries, officiated.The bride, who is 33 and is taking her husband\u2019s name, is an operations manager for investment and corporate banking in the New York office of the Bank of Montreal. She graduated from Princeton and received a Master of Fine Arts degree in film production from New York University.She is the daughter of Janet R. Veale of Monticello, N.Y., and Christopher Frank of Beverly Hills, Calif.He is a son of Judith S. Bruggemann and Charles J. Bruggemann of Rochester Hills, Mich.The couple met in July 2015 while working at Jigsaw Productions, a television and film production company in New York. The groom was a member of the postproduction team for Amazon Prime\u2019s \u201cThe New Yorker Presents\u201d series, and the bride was a member of the postproduction team for the A&E series \u201cThe Killing Season.\u201dBetween both production teams, there was a single coffee pot to be found in a small kitchen, where the story of Ms. Frank and Mr. Bruggemann began.\u201cThere was something profound and instantaneous about first meeting Anastasia, and I do not think it had anything to do with how desperately in need of coffee I was at the time,\u201d Mr. Bruggemann said. \u201cBeyond her bright eyes and beaming smile, I experienced something intensely kinetic and tactile when we first spoke.\u201dMs. Frank said it was an \u201cutterly stunning encounter.\u201d\u201cI found him so luscious and present,\u2019\u2019 she added, \u201cI immediately decided there must be something wrong with him.\u201dAs the weeks unfolded, Mr. Bruggemann\u2019s treks to the small kitchen for coffee became more frequent, as did his conversations with Ms. Frank. Two months later, they went on a first date to Luke\u2019s Lobster, a restaurant in the financial district, and \u201ca conversation began that felt like it would never end,\u201d Mr. Bruggemann said.Two days later, they went on a second date, and the next day, Mr. Bruggemann left for Norway to attend the premiere of \u201cSunshine Superman.\u201d He made sure, however, to call Ms. Frank from Oslo on her birthday, a few days before flying back to New York.Just before Thanksgiving, their productions wrapped on the same day. After saying their long weekend goodbyes in front of a Duane Reade store, Ms. Frank involuntarily blurted out, \u201cI love you,\u201d and then immediately apologized for \u201cconfessing something so true, so soon,\u201d she said.Mr. Bruggemann returned the \u201cI love you\u201d immediately upon his return from the Thanksgiving break, and their relationship began taking flight.In September 2016, he proposed to her at a restaurant in the West Village. He didn\u2019t notice the couple next to them had been fighting all evening.But as they were leaving, they noticed the arguing couple were now smiling.\u201cThey asked if they could take a picture of us,\u201d Mr. Bruggemann said.After stepping outside onto a quiet side street, Ms. Frank turned to Mr. Bruggemann and said, \u201cNow that we\u2019re alone, would you please ask me again?\u201dThis time, only a full moon was witness.Advertisement"}

And, of course, shop on Amazon while driving.Other tech companies are also getting into using \u201cconversational computing,\u201d or voice commands, in cars. Apple has CarPlay software for dictating messages or getting map directions while behind the wheel. Google has Android Auto for something similar.In all, there seemed to be more than a dozen companies with Alexa capabilities at CES. Notably, Huawei, a Chinese electronics company, said its flagship Mate 9 phone would have Alexa preinstalled. That\u2019s particularly impressive, because the Mate 9 uses Google\u2019s Android operating system and thus has access to Google Voice, a voice assistant.Why the big push now?\u201cIf you own the voice-user interface, you own lots of data, and you know what people are talking about. That gives you a much better chance of selling them something,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, the president of Moor Insights & Strategy, a tech analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s also a Trojan horse for getting people to use A.W.S.\u201d (Amazon Web Services is by far the most profitable part of Amazon.)User data, direct digital knowledge of what people are doing with your products and in the world, is perhaps the most valuable currency in a world dominated by online life. It is the best way to know how your products are going over, and what to build next.Amazon collects lots of shopping data from its retail website, and now has the most information on how people use cloud computing systems like A.W.S., but it has an uneven record in many other areas. Its phone was a dud, and it has a relatively modest business in tablets mostly used for reading. It has no operating system of its own to speak of, and that is often how companies like Apple and Google obtain some of their best data.If the company can capture voice computing, it can gain lots of insights without having to build lots of low-margin hardware.

{"Headline": "Innovations Threaten the Neighborhood Bike Shop", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported bySean Sweeney opened the door to the refurbished 1839 barn behind his home in Wayne, Pa., outside of Philadelphia. Inside, one bicycle after another hung from hooks screwed into a beefy ceiling beam: Mr. Sweeney\u2019s triathlon bike, road bike and two mountain bikes dangled alongside four bikes belonging to his wife and one of his three daughters. Mr. Sweeney races often, and the whole family competes in triathlons.The 59-year-old Mr. Sweeney, a strategic adviser for the Tokio Marine insurance companies, always hated hauling the bikes to a local shop to be tuned up and repaired. \u201cI have to carry that big thing right there,\u201d he said, gesturing toward a bicycle rack for his car. \u201cI have to load it; it smacks my legs. My wife and kids, they all hate doing it, and we all put it off.\u201dOn this day, however, Mr. Sweeney only had to point to the bike he wanted repaired \u2014 a Trek hardtail mountain bike with a few mysterious squeaks after a recent race \u2014 and the work was underway. Seth Samson, a bicycle mechanic for a company called Velofix, rolled the bike into a large red van parked in Mr. Sweeney\u2019s driveway, clipped it to a stand and started taking it apart.\u201cThe fact that these guys come here to me is a home run,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said.Velofix has over 80 franchises in Canada and the United States. The one Mr. Samson works for is owned by Justin Brundage, 46, an avid cyclist who also has a job at a financial services firm. Mr. Brundage leased two territories in the Philadelphia area.Working with Velofix, Mr. Brundage purchased the oversize Mercedes diesel van, which was wrapped in the red, white and black Velofix logo and outfitted with a bike stand, tools and tool cases, trays of parts as well as accessories like glasses, gloves and water bottles. Velofix also contracts with about a dozen bike manufacturers to assemble and deliver bikes purchased online through the manufacturers\u2019 websites.This is just one of several changes coming to an industry that has resisted many of the innovations that have altered others over the last 15 years. Some smaller bike companies have sold their bikes online for some time, but now the industry\u2019s largest manufacturers are offering bikes directly to consumers via their web pages.These shops can have a hard time making room for small, innovative companies that may interest more cyclists. \u201cIt squashes innovation,\u201d Mr. Grant said. \u201cThey can\u2019t get their brands in the door. No one rides it or learns about it.\u201d\u201cWe can showcase really innovative stuff,\u201d Mr. Nielsen said. \u201cOur customers have come to expect that.\u201dBuying a bicycle online is not as simple as buying a T-shirt. High-end bikes, which can cost well over $5,000, come in as many as 10 sizes. Buyers choose from frames made of carbon fiber, certain types of steel or other metals. There are single-speed, fixed-gear, road, time-trial, cyclocross, hybrid, commuter and many types of mountain bikes. Bike shops have long helped cyclists find the right fit.Of the 15 Trek orders Mr. McCorkell has received this way, about five turned out to be the wrong size or bike for the customer, he said. That presents a problem because the bike is not part of the shop\u2019s inventory, and the store earns much less on these sales. Mr. McCorkell said that so far he has been able to return the bike and get the customer another Trek bike. Mr. Bjorling said Trek was improving the consumer education portion of its website to help its customers make better choices.In an industry looking for ways to reach out to consumers who are accustomed to buying online, this model is only growing. Beeline Bikes assembles and delivers bikes bought on Raleigh\u2019s and Diamondback\u2019s websites as well as those bought through Backcountry and Competitive Cyclist. (Accell and Backcountry are investors in Beeline.) Velofix, which has similar arrangements with about a dozen small brands, including Eddy Merckx, will also help fit customers to a bike before they order one. Beeline and Velofix also provide services for bikes bought on Amazon.Manufacturers like that customers have a point of contact with a certified mechanic for repairs and adjustments. The convenience of receiving that service at home is an added bonus. But in an effort to avoid undercutting local shops, most companies do not discount bikes when they sell them directly; in fact, buyers may find better prices in their local shop.Even in traffic-clogged New York City, Mr. McCorkell of Bicycle Habitat has looked into getting his own repair van because, he said, he knows he cannot be complacent.\u201cThe change in the outside world is profound,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been as affected by the internet as bookstores and record stores, but it is coming.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medicaid\u2019s Data Gets an Internet-Era Makeover", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byJini Kim\u2019s relationship with Medicaid is business and personal.Andrew M. Slavitt, acting director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, described the cloud database as \u201cnear historic.\u201d Largely because Medicaid information resides in so many state-level computing silos, Mr. Slavitt explained, \u201cwe\u2019ve never had a systemwide view across the program.\u201dHealth data on its own \u2014 billing, diagnostic and treatment information, typically recorded in arcane, shorthand codes \u2014 is not very useful. But if it can be aggregated and analyzed economically and quickly, that data is seen as a vital ingredient in transforming health care.The health care marketplace in the traditional fee-for-service model values volume. More doctor visits, hospital stays, operations and pills mean more revenue and profit for health care providers. But the push in recent years has been toward what is known as value-based health care. In the value model, medical groups are paid for outcomes: patients treated more efficiently and people who are healthier.But that transition only becomes possible with accurate, reliable data as the raw material for measuring outcomes and discovering what works and what does not. That is the reason for the excitement about and investment in health information technology, and the goal of the Medicaid work with Nuna. The data set will be stripped of identifying information before it is released to researchers.Ms. Kim, 35, a former Google product manager, has firsthand experience with Medicaid. Her brother, Kimong, who is a year younger, is severely autistic. When he was 8, Kimong started having monthly grand mal seizures, which are characterized by loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. The ambulance, hospital, doctor and therapy bills piled up. As a 9-year-old, Ms. Kim helped her Korean immigrant parents complete the Medicaid application forms.\u201cOur family would have gone bankrupt without Medicaid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt saved us.\u201dThe Medicaid system covers millions of working families, older people, children and people with disabilities. In fact, 40 percent of Medicaid spending goes to the disabled. Half of long-term care in America, mainly for older people, is through Medicaid. And nearly half of the children born in the United States are in the Medicaid system.The trouble with traditional health data warehouses, specialists say, is that they resemble digital vaults. It is difficult and time-consuming to get information in or out, and only people with specialized skills can use them.But the new cloud-based technology, using internet-era software, is flexible and interactive. It opens the door to real-time monitoring of emerging disease clusters, billing patterns and program effects. For example, did the percentage of low birth-weight babies decline after a Medicaid program was put in place? If so, how much?\u201cThis kind of data can help move health care policy from a partisan ideological debate to one informed by knowing who the people affected are and what will likely happen to Medicaid recipients,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research organization.\u201cHealth care is hard, and humility is important,\u201d Ms. Kim said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just put technology on something and assume it\u2019s going to work. You really have to understand the ecosystem in health care.\u201dThat government experience, Ms. Kim said, \u201cpaved the way\u201d for Nuna\u2019s work with Medicaid data. It demonstrated, she said, that internet technology and software methods could be applied to government health data from the mainframe era.Her brother is still on Medicaid, and caring for him is a family affair. Ms. Kim lives with her parents and Kimong in Hercules, Calif., in the Bay Area, about 10 miles north of Berkeley. When excited, Kimong waves his arms. When frustrated, he bangs his head against a wall. He can be loud and disruptive when he is anxious, and the family has been escorted off a few plane flights. \u201cHe\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Ms. Kim said.To relieve her parents, Ms. Kim takes Kimong with her to work some days. He can only say a few words, and one of them became the start-up\u2019s name \u2014 \u201cNuna,\u201d or \u201cbig sister\u201d in Korean.Nuna, founded in 2010, had only one full-time employee, Ms. Kim, until 2014, when it got an early round of venture financing. And no one was paid until then. David Chen, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief data officer, holds a Ph.D. in bioinformatics from Stanford University, but he also was a data scientist at Netflix for three years while Nuna was getting off the ground.Nuna is applying the technology and lessons learned from its Medicaid work to pursue business from private health plans, especially at large companies, to help them improve the efficiency and quality of care for workers.Ms. Kim expressed pride in her start-up\u2019s work, but also a sense of personal satisfaction. \u201cThis is my love letter to Medicaid for saving my family,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cyberwar for Sale", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "FeatureAfter a maker of surveillance software was hacked, its leaked documents shed light on a shadowy global industry that has turned email theft into a terrifying \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 political weapon. Supported byNow Lagunes was worried. Around 1 o\u2019clock, she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her. She reached him at a restaurant, where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies. \u201cI did not send you an email,\u201d he insisted. A consultant with the campaign \u2014 who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates \u2014 overheard the conversation. He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages: emails with vague subject lines, asking the recipient to review a document or click a link. The campaign, he realized, had been hacked.In the vote for party leader, Lagunes and her allies in Puebla \u2014 a two-hour drive southeast from Mexico City \u2014 were supporting the challenger, a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots. But the incumbent was backed by Puebla\u2019s powerful governor, Rafael Moreno Valle. One of Mexico\u2019s rising political stars, Moreno Valle is close to Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and has forged an alliance between PAN and Nieto\u2019s centrist Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI, long the dominant force in Mexican politics. Since winning the governorship in 2010, Moreno Valle\u2019s opponents say, his ambitions have grown, and he has resorted to increasingly harsh measures to keep Puebla state \u2014 including members of his own party \u2014 under control. \u201cIn the beginning, the governor was low-profile and respectful,\u201d Rafael Micalco, a former leader of PAN in Puebla state, told me. \u201cWhen he became governor, he transformed. Now he controls the party through threats.\u201dThis race to retain control of the party leadership in 2014 was a crucial test for the governor, who was rumored to be considering a run for Mexico\u2019s presidency in 2018. (This past September, Moreno Valle publicly announced his intent to run.) Clashes between the two camps were especially intense in Puebla, where backers of the challenger, Ernesto Cordero, claimed that the governor was using public money to support the incumbent, Gustavo Madero, though the governor\u2019s office has denied these charges. Shortly before the election, Madero\u2019s campaign manager said that Cordero\u2019s side was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the process. \u201cTheir strategy is clear from the outset,\u201d he said in an interview with a Mexican magazine. \u201c\u2009\u2018If I win, good. If not, I was cheated.\u2019\u2009\u201dAfter Lagunes\u2019s call on Election Day, her colleagues rushed from the restaurant back to their local headquarters, a hotel conference room that they had nicknamed \u201cthe bunker.\u201d All morning, they had been trying to reach their field network, a group of 40 Cordero canvassers who were working to get out the vote in Puebla state. But the field network seemed to have gone dark. Few of the canvassers were even answering their phones. Hackers, the team concluded, must have found the list of the canvassers\u2019 names and phone numbers \u2014 widely circulated by email within the campaign \u2014 and begun to intimidate them.\u201cThe day before,\u201d the consultant told me, the field network was \u201cmotivated and eager to do this work. After the hack, it was very hard to reach them. The few who did answer said that they had received phone calls saying that their lives were at stake. They were worried that if they went out, they or their families would get hurt.\u201dAccording to another worker on Cordero\u2019s campaign, who also requested anonymity, citing fear of reprisal, the message to the canvassers was simple and direct: \u201cWe know who you are. If you don\u2019t want any trouble, shut down your cellphone and stop your activity.\u201d The worker added: \u201cIt\u2019s an authoritarian regime.\u201dAnd so, like Lagunes, Podesta fell into a trap. The button appeared to lead to an official Google page, but it was in fact a meticulously personalized fake, with a domain address linked to a remote cluster of atolls in the South Pacific. The details were designed to trick Podesta into entering his password. This technique is known as \u201cspear phishing.\u201d It is an especially potent weapon against companies and political organizations because it needs to succeed only one time, against one target. After that, attackers can use the trusted identity of the first compromised account to more easily lure colleagues into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links. Not only will a working email password yield years of intraoffice chatter, invoices, credit-card bills and confidential memos; it can often be leveraged into control of other personal accounts \u2014 Twitter, Facebook, Amazon \u2014 and even access to company servers and internet domains.The White House, C.I.A. and F.B.I. have all claimed that, based on classified evidence, they can trace the hacks of Podesta\u2019s email account (and other hacks of people close to the Clinton campaign) back to the Russian government. But with the rise of private firms like Hacking Team, penetrating the email accounts of political opponents does not require the kind of money and expertise available to major powers. A subscription-based website called Insider Surveillance lists more than a dozen companies selling so-called ethical malware, including Milan-based Hacking Team and the German firms FinFisher and Trovicor. Compared with conventional arms, surveillance software is subject to few trade controls; a recent attempt by the United States to regulate it under a 41-country pact called the Wassenaar Arrangement failed. \u201cThe technology is morally neutral,\u201d says Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency. \u201cThe same program that you use to monitor your babysitter might be used by Bashar Assad or Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to keep track of whomever they don\u2019t like.\u201dHacking Team has fewer than 50 employees, but it has customers all over the world. According to internal documents, its espionage tool, which is called the Remote Control System, or R.C.S., can be licensed for as little as $200,000 a year \u2014 well within the budget of a provincial strongman. After it has been surreptitiously installed on a target\u2019s computer or phone, the Remote Control System can invisibly eavesdrop on everything: text messages, emails, phone and Skype calls, location data and so on. Whereas the N.S.A.\u2019s best-known programs grab data in transit from switching rooms and undersea cables, the R.C.S. acquires it at the source, right off a target\u2019s device, before it can be encrypted. It carries out an invisible, digitized equivalent of a Watergate-style break-in.The United States government is almost certainly the world\u2019s most formidable repository of hacking talent, but its most powerful cyberweapons are generally reserved for intelligence agencies and the military. This might explain why, according to company documents, at least two federal law-enforcement agencies have been Hacking Team clients: the F.B.I., beginning in 2011, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, beginning in 2012. The F.B.I. contract paid Hacking Team more than $700,000; the D.E.A. appears to have used the software to go after targets in Colombia.Documents show that the company has also sold its software to some of the world\u2019s most repressive governments. Some, like those of Honduras, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are Western allies. Other countries, like Uzbekistan and Turkey, have a more troubled relationship. A few are openly hostile to the West. Between 2012 and 2014, Hacking Team was paid nearly one million euros by the government of Sudan, a United States-designated state sponsor of terrorism. Even more notable, in light of recent events, is the three-year relationship that Hacking Team carried on with the F.S.B., one of Russia\u2019s main intelligence agencies. As with Puebla, Hacking Team used a middleman, a research agency called Kvant, to handle its sales to Russia. Between 2012 and 2014, the agency paid Hacking Team 451,000 euros to license the Remote Control System.Hacking Team claims that it draws the line at customers who commit \u201cgross human-rights abuses\u201d and that it sells exclusively to governments operating within the laws of their own countries. In at least one case, David Vincenzetti, Hacking Team\u2019s founder and chief executive, told a salesman to hold off on a potential Mexican client. \u201cWe sell to official, governmental LEAs\u201d \u2014 law-enforcement agencies \u2014 \u201cand security agencies ONLY,\u201d Vincenzetti wrote in an email. But at other times, a more casual attitude prevailed inside the company. \u201cIf one sells sandwiches to Sudan, he is not subject, as far as my knowledge goes, to the law,\u201d one Hacking Team lawyer wrote in an internal email. \u201cHacking Team should be treated like a sandwich vendor.\u201dWhen asked about its arrangements in various countries, the company responded that it \u201cdoes not comment on confidential business dealings.\u201d Its American spokesman, Eric Rabe, did tell me that neither Russia nor Sudan is a current Hacking Team customer. (The relationships, Rabe wrote, ended in 2014, Russia because \u201cthe Putin government evolved from one considered friendly to the West to a more hostile regime\u201d and Sudan \u201cbecause of concerns about the country\u2019s ability to use the system in accordance with the H.T. contract.\u201d) Separately, the company confirmed that the state of Puebla was, in fact, a former client.With the source code for the Remote Control System now public, the company and its clients had to stop using it temporarily. By the end of the year, though, Hacking Team had updated its product and was trying to rebuild its reputation. I was curious whether a company that profited from online breaches could recover from its own. Eric Rabe, the American spokesman, sounded eager to meet me for coffee in Philadelphia. A grandfather and former television-news anchor, he exudes square-jawed credibility. \u201cIf you disagree with someone on the internet,\u201d he said, of the Hacked Team files, with a wave of his hand, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to have a public-policy debate. Just go destroy them.\u201dA couple of months later, I went to Milan to visit Hacking Team\u2019s headquarters, a stately gray apartment building with boxes of limp flowers adorning a few of its sooty sills. Waiting to demonstrate the company\u2019s software were Rabe; Philippe Vinci, a company vice president; and Alessandro Scarafile, a young engineer. Scarafile had gathered a Dell desktop computer and three smartphones: iPhone, BlackBerry and Android. The screen from his own laptop, which represented the console of a client intelligence agency, was projected on the wall. Several icons represented the various streams of data that could potentially be acquired by gaining control of the target\u2019s computer: images from built-in cameras, sound from built-in mikes, screenshots, detailed records of applications opened and bitcoins transferred, a continuous log of location with latitude and longitude, and logs of address books, calendars, phone calls, Skype calls and passwords, as well as websites visited. A key logger recorded every key that was pressed. It was a lot to keep track of. Two other views, called \u201cline of events\u201d and \u201cline of actions,\u201d assembled the information into chronological order.Scarafile, who was playing both the customer and the target, or \u201cbad guy,\u201d turned on the Dell. Judging by the background on the desktop, a gothic scene framed by castlelike silhouettes, our target seemed to be planning a terrorist attack from Transylvania.Whatever the method of infection, the malicious code, known as an \u201cagent,\u201d then communicates with its masters anonymously, its dispatches routed through a series of dedicated servers scattered around the world. Even if the target gets suspicious and figures out that something is wrong, this chain of servers makes it nearly impossible for him to figure out exactly who is using Hacking Team\u2019s product to spy on him.For the demo, Scarafile opted for the third method, which he referred to as \u201ca bit of social engineering.\u201d Using the customer\u2019s computer, he sent the target an email with a Word file attached. Then he returned to the target\u2019s computer and double-clicked on it, just as Lagunes had clicked on the link in her inbox. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d he said, \u201cthis system is currently infected, or monitored, by the Remote Control System.\u201d It would remain so even if the suspect turned off his machine or logged out.On the timeline, the target appeared as a stubbly lout in an undershirt, named \u201cJimmy Page ... head of the terrorist cell.\u201d Using Jimmy Page\u2019s Dell, Scarafile logged into Page\u2019s Gmail, Facebook and Twitter. He opened up Skype, perused Page\u2019s criminal colleagues (Don Corleone, Harry Potter, Keyser Soze) and left one of them a voice mail message from Page\u2019s phone. Accessing a USB drive attached to the infected computer, Scarafile opened an encrypted file that turned out to contain an order to \u201ckill David Vincenzetti.\u201d R.C.S. captured it all, including periodic snapshots of Scarafile, as Page, at work.\u201cI don\u2019t like the words \u2018inject\u2019 and \u2018infect,\u2019\u2009\u201d Vinci, the vice president, said. \u201cR.C.S. is deploying the agent into the device of the target because you want to monitor some of his activities. Exactly the way that law enforcement is listening to some of your phone calls, right?\u201d\u201cI think the Iran deal is just terrible,\u201d Vincenzetti said, and then added, sarcastically, \u201cOh, it\u2019s such a very peaceful expansion. Very peaceful.\u201d\u201cThat is not an official company position,\u201d Rabe interjected.Vincenzetti, now 48, is a familiar type \u2014 a ferociously competitive, driven entrepreneur whose existence is organized around his work. He has a wife, who was born in Morocco, and no children. His small, heavy-lidded eyes can make him seem sleepily blas\u00e9. On the morning we met at Hacking Team\u2019s offices, he wore jeans, a navy-blue cardigan and a striped shirt, unbuttoned to midchest. He seemed more comfortable on his feet than sitting down. As we talked in a conference room, he periodically leapt to his feet and stalked around the table, considering in turn the espresso machine, the view from the window, a case of bottled water.\u201cIf I wanted to break into this room, how would I do it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere is a door, and there are two windows.\u201d He pressed his hands against the glass panes. \u201cThe perimeter is the first thing you must secure,\u201d he continued. Securing data was what he did earlier in his career. Now he had moved on. \u201cIf you cannot break into a bank, you cannot protect a bank. So when you are in security, really there is no difference between thinking offensively and defensively.\u201dIn the mid-1980s, Vincenzetti\u2019s parents, a salesman and a schoolteacher, bought him a Commodore 64, one of the earliest personal computers. He soon created a Pac-Man clone, a Tron lightcycle-style game and a text-based adventure game. As a computer-science student at the University of Milan in the \u201990s, he became fascinated by cryptography; he corresponded with programmers around the world about new cryptographic theories and wrote code for email encryption. In his senior year, he was appointed to administer the university\u2019s internal network, a post that was usually reserved for a graduate student. Vincenzetti remembers these early days as a time when \u201ceverything was free and no one was trying to harm you. We were wide open and accessible. All the best were called hackers, and I was a hacker.\u201dVincenzetti left university early and founded three companies, all of them focused on defensive cybersecurity. After he founded Hacking Team in 2003, he tried to sell his services to Italian police agencies but found them skeptical that Mafiosi and other high-level criminals would ever bother to encrypt their communications. In Italy, the police were also used to getting whatever they needed through wiretaps, arranged with varying degrees of formality through their contacts at telecommunications firms. But after the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which were coordinated via cellphones and the internet, police officers and intelligence agents not just in Italy but all across Europe became interested in contracting with offensive-hacking vendors, part of an emerging arms race over consumer-grade encryption. The growth of Skype made it easy for users to encrypt their communications, and the authorities were eager to pay for countermeasures like the Remote Control System. Singapore, Hacking Team\u2019s first non-European client, signed on in 2008. The company\u2019s Middle Eastern business took off in 2011, a boom that coincided with the beginning of the Arab Spring.All Hacking Team customers sign contracts agreeing to comply with local laws. The company says that it vets potential customers and studies reports from journalists and human-rights groups, looking for \u201cobjective evidence or credible concerns\u201d that its products are being abused. But when it comes to Hacking Team\u2019s own interactions with customers, leaked documents suggest that employees have sometimes turned a blind eye. In the case of the Puebla government and other Latin American customers, Hacking Team employees appeared to ignore warnings suggesting that the Remote Control System was being used to gather intelligence on the political opposition. On multiple occasions, customers emailed Hacking Team attachments with election-related content, including polling data, party registration forms and invitations addressed to and signed by elected officials. Rather than ask what these files had to do with fighting crime and drug trafficking, Hacking Team support-staff members simply emailed them back, as requested, with an embedded \u201cexploit,\u201d turning the document into a surveillance tool to be used against whomever it was sent on to. Asked about these cases, Rabe replied that customers \u201care not supposed to be using it for political purposes, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that an Italian computer programmer,\u201d i.e., a support technician, \u201cwould have seen these files and known what was going on. ... I think that\u2019s a stretch, that an Italian software guy could know that an individual is a dissident.\u201dShortly thereafter, R3D published three invoices from the Hacked Team cache showing that one state government \u2014 that of Jalisco, on the Pacific Coast \u2014 had paid the company nearly half a million euros for the Remote Control System. Soon other documents were found in the leak to implicate several more states, including Puebla, though most of the states denied ever using the software. (Jalisco later admitted to purchasing the system, which it claimed was for its prosecutor\u2019s office.) The story failed to get much traction in the Mexican press, except in Puebla, after R3D connected with Lado B, a small online-news collective there. The site\u2019s name translates to \u201cB Side,\u201d as in the back of a hit single \u2014 symbolizing its dedication to telling stories that would otherwise go untold.Lado B\u2019s editor, Ernesto Aroche, was not surprised that Puebla\u2019s government had been using the Remote Control System. In Moreno Valle\u2019s six years as governor there, he has spent lavishly on new surveillance systems, including multiple \u201csecurity arches,\u201d highway-spanning structures that scrutinize traffic with video cameras and X-rays, and whose cost had raised some questions in the local press. Beginning in 2013, Aroche began noticing solicitations on the Puebla-state website for hidden cameras and other spying equipment. When he filed a public-records request about them, the government\u2019s form response indicated that these orders had never been filled, but Aroche was skeptical, given the mounting evidence that Moreno Valle\u2019s administration had begun using its security apparatus for political purposes. There were periodic break-ins of homes belonging to dissident politicians and journalists, with the burglars sometimes taking little besides their victims\u2019 laptops. Politicians would answer calls from unknown numbers, only to hear their own taped conversations played back to them. Another journalist, Fernando Maldonado, received an unmarked envelope full of what were purportedly transcripts of 400 private phone calls made by Puebla politicians.As Aroche and R3D sifted through the Hacked Team file dump, they discovered that the files on Puebla had more detail than those dealing with Hacking Team\u2019s other Mexican accounts. The Puebla client often wrote emails asking for help with infecting a particular document with a malicious virus. Some of these came from an account \u2014 soporteuiamx@gmail.com \u2014 that also appears in many of Hacking Team\u2019s internal support tickets. One of those tickets documents a client\u2019s request for help in infecting an attachment: an invitation to attend an event for a Mexican political organization, signed by Violeta Lagunes and addressed to another party colleague opposed to the governor.Aroche interviewed politicians and journalists who were on the receiving end of the infected emails contained in the Hacked Team trove. According to a 2015 article that Lado B published in conjunction with a politics website, the Puebla group sent Hacking Team at least 47 requests to infect specific files that it would then forward on to their targets. Almost all of those files had to do with political issues. Going through the Hacked Team materials, Aroche found the name of a Puebla government employee who seemed to be working within the spying operation. \u201cBefore, we had been talking about ghosts,\u201d Aroche told me. \u201cNow, we could prove it. We started putting names on the actors.\u201dMore than a year later, there have been no political repercussions for the governor or his allies in Puebla. I met Aroche this fall at the Lado B offices, a small room facing a courtyard in a crumbling stone building from Puebla\u2019s colonial days. The only suggestion of Lado B\u2019s presence was a small sticker on the window. Inside, Aroche was thumbing through an envelope of documents that he had wrung out of the state government. Two redacted contracts signed by Puebla officials showed an arrangement between the state government and a company called Sym Servicios Integrales, which Aroche\u2019s reporting had identified as an intermediary for Hacking Team. The details of what had been purchased were redacted. \u201cThese contracts demonstrate that the Puebla government had a commercial relationship with this company,\u201d Aroche said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if they\u2019re a little bit stained \u2014 I dropped some coffee on them.\u201d (Sym Servicios Integrales says it \u201cnever sold H.T. technology to the state of Puebla.\u201d)In a brief written statement from Sagrario Conde Valerio, a spokeswoman, the government of Puebla denied allegations of spying and claimed that \u201cno relationship exists nor has ever existed between the government of Puebla and the company \u2018Hacking Team.\u2019\u2009\u201d The government declined to respond further to a list of questions.But a former official from Moreno Valle\u2019s administration claimed to me that more than $1 million was being diverted from the state budget each year to fund the political-espionage unit. Documents from the Hacked Team archive indicate that Hacking Team received an order from the government of Puebla for 415,000 euros in the spring of 2013, and that Hacking Team booked hotel rooms for three of its associates who traveled to Puebla in May of that year.Some of the R.C.S. training, I was told, took place in a green building on a residential street. When I visited the purported site this fall, lettering above the door said that the building was once a school. Now it had bars across the door and mirrored windows. Neighbors told me it had been abandoned for several months. \u201cPeople would come and go,\u201d one woman said. \u201cThey were very secretive. They would drop off equipment, take away equipment. Then one day, about a year ago, they came and took everything away and left.\u201d Another neighbor said that he often saw a state-police car parked in front of the house and a man with a limp entering and leaving \u2014 a former Mexican intelligence agent, according to someone who was present during the Hacking Team training.Mexico is Hacking Team\u2019s biggest export market, accounting for nearly six million euros in sales, according to leaked documents. Ostensibly, the Remote Control System is intended for fighting criminals and drug traffickers there. (\u201cThere have been reports that the software was used in the apprehension of Chapo Guzman,\u201d Rabe told me, referring to the Mexican drug lord. \u201cI can\u2019t confirm it.\u201d) The files indicate that at least seven other Mexican state governments were Hacking Team clients, but because they did not use email to the same extent as Puebla, their activities are harder to track. Multiple former Hacking Team employees told me that abuses of the software were not limited to Puebla. One former employee described having the system set up inside a mayor\u2019s office.Katitza Rodr\u00edguez, international-rights director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Mexican law allows for interception of communication, like the wiretapping of phone lines, but it does not grant precise legal authority to use new, powerful invasive tools like those created by Hacking Team. And she argues that it is much more dangerous in Mexico than in other Western countries, where checks and balances are stronger. \u201cThis is much more intrusive than the interception of a phone call,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are not only listening; they are taking over your laptop. Mexico needs to have a full debate in Congress about what legal safeguards are needed for this kind of surveillance or if the government should be using it at all.\u201dAmerican expansion by companies like Hacking Team may not face much resistance from the federal government, which is becoming more accepting of electronic surveillance as part of normal police work. Last year, the Justice Department successfully changed the rules of criminal procedure, making it easier for federal agents to hack into multiple computers with a single warrant. Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who tried to block the change, complained that it gives \u201cunlimited power for unlimited hacking.\u201d In a 2014 address, now referred to in cybersecurity circles as his \u201cGoing Dark\u201d speech, the F.B.I.\u2019s director, James Comey, argued that the encryption built into Apple products posed a threat to public safety \u2014 enabling not only terrorism but also drug trafficking, child abuse and hit-and-runs. Instead of \u201ca safe that can\u2019t be cracked,\u201d Comey wanted technology companies to lend him the combination. \u201cThe law hasn\u2019t kept pace with technology, and this disconnect has created a significant public-safety problem,\u201d Comey said. \u201cWe call it \u2018going dark.\u2019\u2009\u201dAs the United States government has argued for weaker protections around personal communications, American businesses have been spreading more powerful surveillance tools around the world. Many foreign law-enforcement agencies already buy electronic-surveillance products from SS8 \u2014 a company backed by the storied venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers \u2014 as well as from the Harris Corporation, a $13 billion company based in Florida and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. At least 25 American police departments have used Harris\u2019s Stingray device, which mimics cellphone towers and can intercept cellphone calls within 200 meters. All known sales of Stingrays to local law enforcement have been authorized by the F.B.I., which has since fought in court to keep those sales secret. In Baltimore alone, Stingrays have been used more than 4,000 times, in routine drug investigations. Much less is known about another Harris product, the advanced Hailstorm, which is also sold to local police departments. Hailstorm is reportedly capable of implanting malware that can take control of a targeted phone, much like Hacking Team\u2019s R.C.S.The Hacked Team documents that offer the most revealing view of the company\u2019s ethos happen to be the most public ones. For years, as often as two or three times a day, Vincenzetti sent mass emails to hundreds of his business contacts. The recipients included numerous members of the United States military and intelligence community, as well as government employees from the city of Cincinnati and the Internal Revenue Service. In these messages, Vincenzetti often addresses this audience collectively as \u201cgents.\u201d The news he cites is a reminder of how the geopolitical winds have been blowing in favor of Hacking Team and other self-described allies of law and order. In Vincenzetti\u2019s world, the system is always, as George Tenet famously said about pre-Sept. 11 intelligence, \u201cblinking red\u201d: the imploding Middle East; a restive, nuclear-armed Russia; battalions of ISIS-trained jihadis roaming around Europe with their encrypted thumb drives and dark-web expertise. Against this backdrop of ever-increasing danger, concerns about human rights are na\u00efve at best.Vincenzetti\u2019s emails vividly exploit this sense of danger and alarm. He writes about shadowy gangs of Iranian hackers using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag to inject malware into French laptops. He celebrates the conviction of Ross Ulbricht, a.k.a. the Dread Pirate Roberts, creator of the Silk Road website. After the arrests of two Uzbek men in Brooklyn for telling informants that they wanted to join up with ISIS, Vincenzetti writes of \u201ca very serious terrorist plot on American soil foiled.\u201dHe went on to tap out this sales pitch:The time has come for a technologically MORE SOPHISTICATED, and much more effective, internet supervision ... something capable to penetrate the core of the terrorists\u2019 HIDDEN forums. And such a (quite unique) technology EXISTS.The following day, he gave a few more hints:I am talking about a NEW technology capable of neutralizing their encryption-based protective layers in order to track them, identify them, locate them, chase them and finally bust them. Something operating on a massive scale. Something different. I am talking about a novel, superior, next-generation mass-surveillance technology.The tone of Vincenzetti\u2019s sales patter was strangely upbeat, especially considering his dire forecasts. It was almost as if he were in the business of selling microwave ovens or sandwiches, not tools through which the private lives of criminals (and whoever else) could be fully laid bare.Vincenzetti\u2019s unstated equation \u2014 privacy is secrecy, and secrecy is terrorism \u2014 is less controversial than it might appear. A supportive echo can be heard in many public statements from American officials, which Vincenzetti often cut and pasted into his mass emails. The former attorney general Eric Holder called for \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial tools that allow us to be pre-emptive.\u201d When Comey warned that \u201cencryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place,\u201d Vincenzetti forwarded it along approvingly, with the tagline: \u201cWe DO have an answer to many if not all of his concerns.\u201d And when, in May 2015, Comey warned of a \u201cthreat\u201d that had \u201cmorphed\u201d into \u201ca chaotic spider web,\u201d Vincenzetti sent word to his \u201cgents\u201d as well.One month later, an anonymous hack revealed Hacking Team\u2019s own invisible spider web, and one year later, during the run-up to Election Day, came the internal emails of the Democratic Party. By then it was clear that tools for digital burglary had spread well beyond the hands of regular police officers. Comey had argued for weaker safes; Vincenzetti was selling longer crowbars. They could be used to chase Jimmy Page, arrest Chapo Guzman, fight crime, smear a political opponent or just keep tabs on someone, anyone. To be hidden is to be a terrorist \u2014 this was the heart of his pitch. Any digital redoubt that could resist being pried open was a public risk and a private opportunity.An article on Jan. 8 about surveillance software erroneously included one company among those that sell so-called ethical malware. The Israeli company Nice no longer sells such software; it sold its intelligence division in May 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Riot Police Try to Quell Continuing Violence in Brazilian Prison", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 In an attempt to regain government control after days of rioting, specially equipped police forces entered a Brazilian prison on Thursday where rival drug gangs were fighting pitched battles with metal bars and wooden clubs in scenes reminiscent of medieval warfare.The horrific scenes, broadcast live on television by cameras situated on the sand dunes that tower over the prison walls, represented the escalation of a prison crisis that has seen over 120 prisoners killed this year alone.In response to the increasing violence, President Michel Temer authorized the use of the armed forces this week to aid the police in searching for drugs, cellphones and weapons in Brazil\u2019s crowded prison system, where drug gangs and extreme violence rule. Maj. Eduardo Franco, a police spokesman, said he was not able to confirm reports of two more prisoner deaths on Thursday.The prison crisis exploded on Jan. 1 when 56 inmates were slaughtered during a riot at a prison near Manaus in the state of Amazonas. Five days later 33 people were killed at a prison in Roraima in the far north of Brazil. Police and security officials have blamed a war for control of Brazil\u2019s drug trade between rival gangs.The First Capital Command, which is from S\u00e3o Paulo and known by its Portuguese acronym P.C.C., is pitted against regional gangs, like the Amazon-based Family of the North, which the authorities said was behind the massacre in Manaus, and the Crime Syndicate, a gang from Rio Grande do Norte which was attacked by the P.C.C. on Jan. 14.\u201cThis is almost a war situation,\u201d the state justice secretary, Wallber Virgolino, said at a news conference on Thursday.A popular tourist destination, Natal has been effectively put under curfew by the violence and buses have stopped running, said Nilson de Castro, 49, who runs a local news blog. \u201cThe population is terrified,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Navigate New Airline Carry-On Rules", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayAre there loopholes to get around those restrictive carry-on baggage and boarding rules? Will more major airlines begin restricting access to their overhead bin space? And while we\u2019re talking about space, which carry-on size will actually make it past the gate agent and onto the plane?Let\u2019s begin with United\u2019s new fares.If you buy one of United\u2019s \u201cbasic economy\u201d fares, you can bring along a personal item like a laptop bag or backpack that is 9 inches by 10 inches by 17 inches or less, but not carry-on luggage (hence why you\u2019re not given access to the overhead bins). But there are ways around those rules. In fact, there are three ways to bring on carry-on luggage and use the overhead bins even if you purchase a \u201cbasic economy\u201d fare:Any of the above will also prevent you from having to board last as well.Whether other major United States carriers join United and introduce new rules for their overhead bin space remains to be seen, but it will not be surprising if they eventually do, given that the airlines tend to copy one another if a new practice is successful. Indeed, the latest segmentation of economy fares into no-frills seats and premium seats began with Delta Air Lines and has since been adopted by American Airlines and United. If travelers take to United\u2019s basic economy fares, expect the practice to become more widespread.There is no universal carry-on bag size. Each airline has its own rules. And baggage allowances may vary across routes and cabin classes.Shopping for a new bag? There are two things to keep in mind. First, an airline can change its carry-on policy so if you\u2019re buying a bigger bag you might not want to spend a mint. (For example, beginning April 4, the maximum dimensions of the personal item travelers on Spirit Airlines are allowed to bring on board will be 18 x 14 x 8 inches \u2014 a change from the current maximum size of 16 x 14 x 12 inches.)Nine out of the 11 bags were larger than the manufacturer claimed. So invest in a tape measure. And when you measure a bag, be sure to include the wheels and handle in your measurements. Be ruthless. After all, the airlines will be.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cubans Newly Blocked at U.S. Border Place Hopes in Trump", "Date": "2017-01-22", "News": "Supported byNUEVO LAREDO, Mexico \u2014 She spent weeks hiking through the Amazon, crossing a crocodile-filled river. She scaled border walls, escaped from immigration detention in Panama and slept in a church. Broke, hungry and exhausted, she found refuge with indigenous people in the jungle who took her in and fed her for a week.Finally, six months after fleeing Cuba on a tortuous journey to the United States, Marleni Barbier, a dental assistant from Havana, made it to the border with Texas \u2014 about 12 hours too late.The abrupt change is a profound one for Cubans, who fled their country by the tens of thousands in the last year to take advantage of a decades-old policy that permitted them to enter the United States.\u201cI have faith that Trump will change it,\u201d said Ms. Barbier, 44, who arrived at the Texas border right after President Barack Obama announced the end of special rights for Cubans. \u201cTo take away a law at the last minute like that, it\u2019s so unjust.\u201dSome of the Cubans stuck in limbo here at the Texas border arrived on Jan. 12, the same day the Obama administration eliminated the so-called wet foot, dry foot rule. The rule, which dated to 1995, allowed Cubans who reached the United States to enter the country.About 150 Cubans are parked only 50 steps from the pedestrian bridge that connects Nuevo Laredo, in Mexico, to Laredo, Texas. Bewildered and deflated, they are being fed by Mexican strangers, and they pray.\u201cEverybody was racing to get here before the inauguration on the 20th,\u201d said Yamila Gonz\u00e1lez Cabeza, 44, a teacher from Cuba, saying many migrants thought the Trump administration would be the one to shut the border. \u201cThe reverse was true. We did not expect this surprise on the 12th.\u201dThe Cuban government has long abhorred the special immigration privileges, saying the policy bleeds the island of its citizens and lures waves of migrants into dangerous journeys by land and sea.That decision could now put Mr. Trump in an awkward position: He campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, vowing not to let migrants slip through American borders. But he has also threatened to overturn Mr. Obama\u2019s executive orders and get tough on the Cuban government.Mr. Trump has in the past said the wet foot, dry foot policy, which sent back Cubans caught at sea but allowed those who reached land to enter, was unfair. Still, the Cubans here hope he will show humanitarian compassion for people who undertook arduous voyages to escape Communism and extreme poverty.Ms. Barbier said she had spent all of the $8,000 she made from the sale of her house in Cuba to make it this far. \u201cThat money is gone, gone, gone,\u201d she said.About 41,000 Cubans made similar trips across the Americas last year. But because she got to the border a little too late, Ms. Barbier and other Cubans like her may be sent back unless they can prove they endured individual persecution, not just poverty or lack of opportunity, on the island.\u201cI certainly have sympathy for them, but the policy has been changed, and the moment they changed it, the policy was eliminated,\u201d said Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat who represents Laredo. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say anyone in the pipeline can come in. By luck, some got in and some did not.\u201dEliannes Matos Salazar, 32, said she had been at the border station here all day on Jan. 12, and had already been photographed and fingerprinted, when she was forced to leave after the announcement. Yet her husband got through and is now in Las Vegas, she said.Alberto Ram\u00edrez Balmaseda said he had turned back because border agents told him that he would face long periods of incarceration for a chance at presenting proof of persecution to a judge.\u201cWhat evidence do we have? That there\u2019s been a Castro regime in power for about 60 years?\u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez said. \u201cIf you are a political prisoner in Cuba, they don\u2019t put \u2018political prisoner\u2019 on your criminal record. They say you stole a pig.\u201dSeveral of the Cubans interviewed said that even if they had not had political problems before they left, they would if they were sent back.Yenier Echevarr\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, 31, who worked as a baker in the tourism industry, said state security agents had seen a photo he posted from Brazil on Facebook, so they showed up at his house in Cuba and demanded that his wife sign his employment resignation papers. He had been gone just a week and had not officially emigrated.\u201cFirst of all, if I\u2019m deported I will probably have to serve two months in jail,\u201d Mr. Echevarr\u00eda said. \u201cAnd I will never again have a job, a car or a house \u2014 ever.\u201dThe Cuban government promised in the 1995 migration accords with Washington not to retaliate against Cubans who were turned back, said Holly Ackerman, a Duke University librarian who studies Cuban migration. To qualify for residency in the United States, Cubans will now have to show they would be personally persecuted back home.\u201cBeing pinched and limited and controlled by the Cuban government isn\u2019t enough to satisfy the U.S. authorities any more,\u201d she said. \u201cCubans who are thinking about exiting will undergo a profound reframing of their identity as a result of these changes.\u201dSilvia Pedraza, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan, argued that while the prior policy had been flawed, it was na\u00efve to treat Cubans as economic immigrants.\u201cOne has to distinguish people who leave totalitarian countries,\u201d she said. \u201cFor sure, the weight of the economic circumstances is very strong in their lives, because the daily stuff of life in Cuba is so difficult that when Cubans talk, that\u2019s what they begin talking about. But it does not seem right not to recognize the political nature of this.\u201dJos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn Carmona Flores, who runs a state agency in Mexico that offers humanitarian assistance to migrants, said that about 200 Cubans were currently in Nuevo Laredo, and that an additional 1,100 were waiting in other cities until they decided what to do.According to the International Office of Migration, about 250 Cubans were being processed at the southern Mexico border when the announcement was made. Scores who arrived since then are being sent back to Cuba.More than 11,000 Cubans arrived in Mexico in just the last three months of 2016, meaning that thousands more along the migrant route across the Americas could still flood Mexico in the weeks to come. On Friday morning, the Mexican government deported 91 of them who had entered along the southern border.\u201cI am very worried for them,\u201d Mr. Carmona said. \u201cThey have no plan. They have no backup plan if their original plan fails. They are truly vulnerable to illness, an epidemic, extortion. In many ways they are much more vulnerable than the Central American migrants we are accustomed to dealing with.\u201dMr. Carmona\u2019s agency was created after 78 migrants were massacred in his state by a drug cartel in 2010. Central Americans are regularly kidnapped and extorted, a fate Cubans have largely escaped in the past because they did not linger long.\u201cI think they are going to have to reach some kind of amnesty or truce and be returned to their country; Mexico will have to do it, because they are here,\u201d Mr. Carmona said. \u201cWho is going to be the executioner? Who is going to return these people to a place where they are likely to be \u2018sanctioned\u2019 \u2014 to put a friendly word to it?\u201dKirk Semple contributed reporting from Tijuana, Mexico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Know About CES 2017", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byTo average people, the name of the International CES, formerly known as the International Consumer Electronics Show \u2014 one of the largest tech conventions, taking place in Las Vegas this week \u2014 will seem dated, if not highly misleading.Tech companies often use the annual trade show as a marketing mechanism to bombard people with news about products that will have little, if any, impact on consumers. And the word \u201celectronics\u201d is awkward in an era when tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook are focusing innovations on areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Yet there are a few product categories worth following this week: high-definition television sets, smart-home accessories and drones. Here is a briefing on things you might want to know as the show unspools this week.But this week, CES will make it clear that buying a 4K television set finally makes sense. TV makers will announce a host of improvements to 4K features, including color technologies like high dynamic range, a software feature that enhances the contrast and color profile of a picture, and wide color gamut, a technology that shows a wider range of colors. Some TV manufacturers, like LG, will introduce TVs that are only a few millimeters thick and easily mountable on a wall. Toward the holiday season, prices on many high-quality TVs with these features will probably drop significantly, as they have in previous years, to roughly $800 to $1,300. In addition, there are now many devices capable of playing 4K content, including 4K Blu-ray players, Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 Pro console and Roku\u2019s higher-end streaming devices.For consumers, voice assistants have broken down the complexity of interacting with smart-home devices, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst for Creative Strategies, which was among the first market research firms in Silicon Valley. (It\u2019s easy for anyone to say \u201cAlexa, turn on the lights.\u201d) And for companies that sell home accessories like locks and thermostats, it has never been easier to make a convenient smart-home product because the companies can now team up with the tech giants. \u201cNow there\u2019s an ecosystem to plug into and build support around, and I think that\u2019s going to help a lot,\u201d Mr. Bajarin said.What that means is that in the next year or two, shopping for a smart-home accessory will be as simple as looking up a type of product and finding one that matches up with your Apple, Google or Amazon device. That\u2019s a lot simpler than with older accessories, which required you to install extra hubs and download additional apps to work with your smartphone.\u201cWhen you go to Amazon.com or the Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s to buy a connected dead bolt from us, what you can expect from us is we want to make sure that lock is going to work with whatever platform you choose,\u201d said Rob Martens, a futurist at the lock company Schlage. Remember that annoying drone buzzing around and taking pictures of people at the beach? That problem is only going to get worse: Drones are getting cheaper, and lesser-known Chinese companies are increasingly getting into the drone business to drive prices down even further. Cheaper drones are expected to have a strong presence at C.E.S., and some popular drones representing well-known brands have already dipped in price. DJI\u2019s Phantom 4, for example, is now $999, down from about $1,400 last year. Mr. Bajarin of Creative Strategies said consumers should also expect to see drones made in China by lesser-known brands that cost as little as $600. Also in store, he said, are drones with smarter tracking abilities and extra photography angles, among other features.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Con Man Poses as Long-Lost Grandson in \u2018Sneaky Pete\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported bySo is \u201cSneaky Pete\u201d \u2014 the story of a con man who passes himself off as the long-lost grandson of a family that runs a Bridgeport, Conn., bail-bond shop \u2014 going to be \u201cJustified North\u201d? The four episodes Amazon made available don\u2019t answer that question definitively, though what they do show us is a little alarming: The pilot is still the best thing about the show by far.Written by David Shore (\u201cHouse\u201d), whom Mr. Yost replaced as showrunner, the first episode deftly sets up a tricky situation and introduces us to the characters with a low-key, disarming sense of humor. The Pete of the title is actually Marius (Giovanni Ribisi), who has just spent three years in prison, listening to his cellmate Pete\u2019s stories of his idyllic childhood. Marius needs to hide from a murderous gambler (Bryan Cranston, who created the show with Mr. Shore), so he decides to pull off his most challenging con yet: showing up at Pete\u2019s old home and convincing the family that he\u2019s the grandson and cousin they haven\u2019t seen in 20 years.The story runs along the channels you\u2019d expect, and there are dangerous shoals of sentimentality: Marius-Pete, whose own childhood was harrowing, finds himself falling for his new family and will have to decide whether to stick to his plan of fleecing them and disappearing. It all works in the pilot because the characters are convincingly human, and the cast, including Mr. Ribisi, Margo Martindale, Peter Gerety and Marin Ireland, is excellent. Ms. Martindale, as the grandmother, plays yet another matriarch who\u2019s charming on the outside, scary on the inside, but it never grows old.Of course, one of her most notable performances in such a role came in \u201cJustified.\u201d That overlap is coincidental, but after the pilot episode, other \u201cJustified\u201d actors start to appear, including Jacob Pitts, Brad William Henke and Karolina Wydra. Casting, in general, continues to be a strength, with Jay O. Sanders, Michael O\u2019Keefe, Kevin Chapman and Alison Wright (Martha in \u201cThe Americans\u201d) popping up.But the mood of the series changes after the pilot; a show that was distinctive for being relaxed and amiable starts to feel a little more forced and artificial. A certain amount of theatricality worked for Mr. Yost in \u201cJustified,\u201d which was partly a comedy of Southern manners. But it isn\u2019t working yet in \u201cSneaky Pete.\u201d Some of the new characters, like a parole officer who\u2019s aggressive in his efforts to empower ex-cons, aren\u2019t convincing, and an eight-minute monologue for Mr. Cranston\u2019s character that\u2019s meant to be a tour de force lands awkwardly.Perhaps by the end of the season, Mr. Yost and his crew (Episodes 2 through 4 were all written by former \u201cJustified\u201d writers) will have successfully remolded \u201cSneaky Pete,\u201d and the cast makes it worth watching in any case. In the meantime, we can toast the promise of the pilot with some Pappy Van Winkle.Advertisement"}

The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, would give Alibaba a controlling stake of about 74 percent.The takeover of Intime is part of a strategy that makes Alibaba a rarity among major global e-commerce companies \u2014 it has spent billions buying up pieces of the very retail sector it disrupted.Alibaba has also bucked the trend among its peers with logistics. Unlike Amazon and JD.com, its Chinese rival, Alibaba has shied away from owning its own inventory or trying to build out logistics.That Alibaba begins the year with a major acquisition shows that the company has no intention of slowing its merger binge. Even as some have wondered how the company can digest and manage the myriad strategic investments and acquisitions it has made in recent years, it seems set to continue buying where it sees opportunities.\u201cWe don\u2019t divide the world into real or virtual economies, only the old and new,\u201d Daniel Zhang, the Alibaba chief executive, said in the news release. \u201cThose who cling on to the old ways of retailing will be disrupted, and brick-and-mortar businesses will be able to create value for consumers if they are integrated with the power of mobile reach, real-time consumer insights, and technology capability to improve operating efficiency.\u201dShares in Intime rose 35 percent on Tuesday, the first full day they were allowed to trade after the suspension.Advertisement"}
