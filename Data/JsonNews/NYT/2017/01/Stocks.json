{"Headline": "Presidents Have Less Power Over the Economy Than You Might Think", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byInvisible HandPresidential reputations rise or fall with gross domestic product. The state of the economy can determine if presidents are re-elected, and it shapes historical memory of their success or failure.But the reality is that presidents have far less control over the economy than you might imagine. Presidential economic records are highly dependent on the dumb luck of where the nation is in the economic cycle. And the White House has no control over the demographic and technological forces that influence the economy.Even in areas where the president really does have power to shape the economy \u2014 appointing Federal Reserve governors, steering fiscal and regulatory policy, responding to crises and external shocks \u2014 the relationship between presidential action and economic outcome is often uncertain and hard to prove.It\u2019s this quirk in how we think that unfairly enhances the reputation of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton while unfairly diminishing the presidencies of Jimmy Carter and both George Bushes.And if you think of the financial markets as the hyperactive cousin of the economy itself, this mental framework can cost you money.We all have a tendency to think that a president whose policies we disagree with will be bad for the economy and the stock market. But looking at markets in such starkly political terms can lead to bad decisions. Ask a conservative who refused to invest in stocks while they notched a 182 percent gain during the Obama presidency \u2014 or a liberal who shorted stocks after Donald J. Trump won in November.So what tools does a president actually have to shape economic outcomes? Fewer than you might think. Let\u2019s walk through the factors that determine economic results \u2014 from those that are more purely luck to those that do reflect a president\u2019s skill at overseeing the economy.When George H.W. Bush took office in January 1989, the unemployment rate was 5.4 percent and the roaring 1980s expansion was near its peak. When Bill Clinton succeeded him in January 1993, the unemployment rate was 7.3 percent and falling, as the United States was finally shaking off the damage of a recession.That bit of timing alone \u2014 taking office at the trough of the business cycle versus the peak \u2014 can help explain much of how we perceive a president. Mr. Bush, of course, was a one-term president, while Mr. Clinton was handily re-elected.President Obama\u2019s luck on this front was somewhere between those extremes; he took office in the middle of a steep downturn. But some simple math shows just how much the timing of the 2008-9 recession relative to Inauguration Day mattered. Mr. Obama is set to leave office with cumulative job growth of 8.4 percent over his eight years in office.But if he had taken office 13 months earlier in December 2007, he would have presided over a putrid 3.4 percent growth. If he had taken office in February 2010, when employment hit rock bottom, he would be on track to see blockbuster 14 percent job growth in eight years (assuming 2017 job creation turns out to be equivalent to 2016).Put simply, when you take office at the bottom of a recession and with unemployment high, you can \u201cachieve\u201d a lot of growth just from the natural healing of the economy. When you take office at the top, there is nowhere to go but down. This may presage bad news for Mr. Trump, given that the jobless rate was a relatively low 4.7 percent in December.Consider one of the big economic forces of the post-World War II economy: women entering the labor force on a mass scale. In 1948, only 33 percent of American women between 25 and 54 worked or sought work. By the time George W. Bush took office in January 2001, that had risen to about 77 percent.That means that throughout the second half of the 20th century, the economy had a huge tailwind, as millions of women joined the work force and stated contributing to G.D.P. Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton didn\u2019t create that trend; broader social forces did. But the fact that it happened made their economic records look better.Expand the idea to other elements of demographics: the baby boom generation entering the labor force from the 1960s through the 1980s and now retiring; the large millennial generation coming into the work force. You see that a big part of the economic growth that might take place during a given presidency is determined by forces not under any politician\u2019s control.It\u2019s worth noting that these forces are part of the story behind slow growth during the Obama administration and will \u2014 unless something surprising changes \u2014 continue in the Trump administration. The labor force has grown an average of 0.4 percent a year during the last eight years, and the Congressional Budget Office projects an average of 0.5 percent a year during the coming four.By contrast, the labor force grew by an average of 1.2 percent a year during the 1990s, the last period of blockbuster growth.Now we\u2019re getting to areas where the president really does have some control over the economic cycle. Too bad it\u2019s so indirect.The Federal Reserve raises and lowers interest rates in an effort to prevent recessions and maintain low inflation. The president appoints its seven-member board of governors, including the chair.The president can select appointees who align in terms of philosophy and instincts, and may select Fed governors who are more competent \u2014 or less. But the Fed system is designed to maintain independence from the administration once the appointments are made.Beyond that, terms are staggered such that a president won\u2019t necessarily get to appoint a majority of Fed leaders, especially right off the bat (Fed governors\u2019 terms are 14 years, though lately few have served that long; the Fed chair has a four-year term).So when a president appoints Fed officials who are effective stewards of monetary policy, achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices and financial stability, it helps a president\u2019s odds of having an impressive economic record. It just isn\u2019t a very direct exertion of power.This is often what we think of when we talk about a president\u2019s economic policy. The occupants of the Oval Office can steer policy around taxing and spending priorities. But they can\u2019t do it alone.It\u2019s certainly true that tax and spending policy carries a president\u2019s imprint. President Obama\u2019s election victories enabled him to enact a major fiscal stimulus in 2009 and increase taxes on the wealthy starting in 2013. President Reagan\u2019s election brought a sharp cut in tax rates. Different election results would have made for different fiscal policy.But Congress has, if anything, greater power than the president over how the government taxes and spends. It\u2019s almost a punch line that when a president issues a proposed budget each winter, congressional opponents call it \u201cdead on arrival.\u201dAnd while Mr. Obama had fiscal policy wins, he also met stiff resistance. The spending cuts known as \u201csequestration\u201d happened because Republicans took control of Congress in 2010.So to the degree that taxes and spending shape the course of the economy \u2014 and there\u2019s no doubt they do \u2014 presidents can set direction, but not steer the ship themselves. It is a lesson Mr. Trump will soon learn.There\u2019s a broad range of other areas in which presidential action affects the economic future. Name a field, and the president exerts power over it: health care, energy, technology innovation, financial regulation, labor policies, trade, transportation infrastructure, agricultural policy. The list is endless. Even foreign policy matters; stable geopolitics is generally good for business.The problem is that all of these big policy areas affect the nation\u2019s economic prospects over the long run. The downsides of regulating banks poorly might show up as a crisis a decade down the road. The benefits of better infrastructure will tend to show up over many years. The payoffs of well-designed education policies come to fruition as young people enter the labor market with better skills years later.Likewise, from a more conservative vantage point, the cost of environmental restrictions limiting energy production may not show up in the price of fuel for years. Burdensome, outdated regulations tend to show up as a modest drag on business year after year, not as an acute, clear crisis.For example, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Affordable Care Act would reduce the labor supply by 2.3 million because more people would choose not to work. (The thinking being that they were working mainly so they could have employee-sponsored health insurance.) It said this would happen not immediately, but by 2021, a full 11 years after the law was passed and four years after the president who signed it would be out of office.And that\u2019s a case where independent economists manage to create an estimate of economic consequences. Often these economic impacts are so slow-building, diffuse and subject to partisan interpretation that it\u2019s hard to estimate them with any precision. We all want to assume that it is our preferred policies that make the economy rev more strongly, even if it\u2019s hard to prove definitively.None of this means that presidents can\u2019t do a lot to make the United States economy more dynamic and productive. It\u2019s just that doing so could take a great while. It\u2019s hard to prove that this or that policy was the source of the good times.In the short run, all those other factors have a more direct, measurable effect in shaping whether a moment in political history produces an economy we remember fondly.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Pick for Health Secretary Under Scrutiny for Investments", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byRepresentative Tom Price of Georgia, President Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of Health and Human Services, has been assailed by Democrats in recent weeks over his investment in health care companies at the same time that he pushed legislation that could have benefited those businesses.As Mr. Price awaits a confirmation vote, which could come next week, here is what we know about his investments, and whether his activities could have broken any laws or ethics rules.Which of Mr. Price\u2019s stock holdings have come under scrutiny?His investment in a tiny Australian company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, was singled out for scrutiny, especially his participation in an offering of discounted stock that was limited to \u201csophisticated U.S. investors.\u201d Mr. Price has said he learned of the company from Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, and Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional liaison during the presidential transition. Mr. Collins serves on the company\u2019s board of directors and is its top shareholder.While Mr. Price has said nearly all of his trades were made by a broker and that he did not tell her what to invest, he said he personally chose to invest in Innate. Representatives for Mr. Price have said that he set up a separate account to invest in the company, since his existing accounts did not permit the trading of penny stocks, which the company was at the time he invested.Why are senators calling for an investigation?Democrats have called for an investigation into whether Mr. Price violated what is known as the Stock Act, which bans members of Congress from insider trading.Senators have also raised questions about the special stock offering, known as a private placement. Many of the participants were in Mr. Collins\u2019s social and professional circles.What are the chances that Mr. Price violated insider trading laws?Experts in insider trading and legal ethics said that they had not seen evidence that any laws were broken but more information was needed before they could make a final judgment.The S.E.C. typically focuses on the timing of trades and the communication between the parties.Others said the act of merely introducing legislation \u2014 which is far from a guarantee that it will pass \u2014 is unlikely to move a company\u2019s stock significantly.What is the deal with that \u201cprivate placement\u201d?Participation in a private placement may raise questions about exclusive access, but it is unlikely for such an offering to lead to insider trading. That is because in private placements, it is the company that is selling the stock. A person with insider knowledge, therefore, would not be able to defraud the company, which presumably has access to the same nonpublic information.But Mr. Langevoort said private placements can raise questions if the placement is offered at a steep discount to a public official, and if the offering was intended to influence that person. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have issues, it\u2019s just that the issues are different,\u201d he said, while noting there is no evidence that is what was happening in the case of Innate.What about Representative Collins and his ties to Innate Immunotherapeutics?Mr. Collins\u2019s involvement with a small, speculative company is indeed odd, some of the experts said.But Mr. Collins has remained one of its biggest boosters. He has been an investor in the company since 2005.Several of Mr. Collins\u2019s friends and associates are also investors, including two of his adult children, his chief of staff, and several donors.In an interview this week with Wolf Blitzer of CNN, Mr. Collins said he frequently mentioned the company because he was proud of it.Some ethics experts have said this boosterism, coming from an elected official, is problematic, because people who seek to influence him could buy stock in the company as a way of currying favor.\u201cThe focus on this company is beyond curious,\u201d Mr. Gillers said, while noting there was still no way to tell whether wrongdoing occurred. \u201cRight now it\u2019s weird, but we don\u2019t know why it\u2019s weird.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Health Secretary Pick\u2019s Longtime Foes: Big Government and Insurance Companies", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byROSWELL, Ga. \u2014 It was 1 in the morning, and the orthopedic surgeon on call was preparing to operate on a woman whose foot had been shattered in a car wreck, after hours of tending to other patients. The woman\u2019s husband, Jeff Anderson, asked him, \u201cAre you too tired to do this?\u201d\u201cHe looked me straight in the eye \u2014 very quiet guy \u2014 and said, \u2018I was born to do this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Anderson recalled.The surgeon that night more than 20 years ago was Representative Tom Price of Georgia, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, the cabinet official who will lead the new administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.Since then, the assuredness that defined Mr. Price as a surgeon has carried into his political career. He has always listened politely to other viewpoints but never swerved from his policy mission to protect his former profession from what he views as heavy-handed government intrusion.Many who knew Mr. Price as a doctor here in Atlanta\u2019s affluent northern suburbs praise his commitment to his patients. But his legislative record shows that over eight years in the Georgia Senate and 12 years in Congress, he has advocated at least as much for physician groups and health care companies \u2014 seeking to limit damages in malpractice cases, for instance, and voting against legislation that would have required the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries.Mr. Price has routinely argued that patients are the driving force behind his efforts. Still, his positions have often coincided with the financial interests of groups whose donations have helped advance his political career.Doctors themselves are sharply divided over his nomination, and some are particularly galled by Mr. Price\u2019s enmity for the Affordable Care Act and opposition to abortion rights. Some of his positions even clash with those of Mr. Trump, who wants to pressure pharmaceutical companies on drug prices, for example, and has pledged to largely leave Medicare alone.Last year, Mr. Price bought stock in a company that makes orthopedic implants shortly before introducing legislation that could have protected the company, Zimmer Biomet, from financial losses due to a new federal regulation. The regulation sought to rein in spending on joint replacements for Medicare patients; Mr. Price\u2019s legislation would have delayed its implementation. After he introduced it, Zimmer\u2019s political action committee contributed to his re-election campaign; the string of events was first reported Monday by CNN.Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said Mr. Price \u201chad no knowledge or input into the purchase\u201d of the Zimmer stock, which he said was made by a broker. Asked why Mr. Price had not directed his broker to avoid buying health-related stocks while he wrote and voted on health legislation, Mr. Blando said, \u201cWe know that other members of Congress, including Democrats, have holdings in health care stocks and vote on health-related legislation.\u201dIn a letter to an ethics lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services last week Mr. Price said he would divest himself of holdings in 43 health-related and other stocks to avoid conflicts of interest. Noting that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an \u201cexhaustive review\u201d of Mr. Price\u2019s financial holdings, Mr. Blando said last week that Mr. Price \u201ctakes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously.\u201dAlthough not among the billionaires whom Mr. Trump has tapped for his cabinet, Mr. Price has profited from medicine, both as a doctor and as an active investor in health care-related companies including Aetna, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Zimmer Biomet, which makes artificial joints and other medical devices. He has an estimated net worth of $13.6 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with assets that include real estate. He has also been an effective fund-raiser: Even in his first run for office in 1996, his war chest of $173,000, much of which came from doctors and medical companies, led his poorly financed Democratic opponent to call him \u201cDr. Dollar.\u201dMr. Price, who declined to be interviewed, was engaged in a number of pitched partisan battles even before coming to Washington in 2005. In the Georgia Legislature, he voted against a new state flag that minimized the Confederate battle cross and supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. In Congress, he has taken stances seen as antithetical to public health, opposing regulating tobacco as a drug and favoring legislation that would make it easier to sell bullets that can pierce armor.He has also written a fairly detailed plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act. It would repeal the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and provide tax credits to help with the cost of coverage based on age instead of income, with older people getting higher credits.Mr. Price grew up in Dearborn, Mich., the son and grandson of doctors who heavily influenced his career choice. He has publicly recalled making house calls with his grandfather, who practiced medicine into his 90s. After medical school at the University of Michigan, he moved to Georgia, completing his residency at Emory and setting up practice in Roswell, a relatively affluent, conservative suburb of Atlanta.In the 1990s, his practice, Compass Orthopedics, was among seven in the Atlanta area that merged into a large group that became known as Resurgens Orthopaedics. It became the largest orthopedic practice in Georgia, and now has 100 doctors and 1,000 employees spread over 21 locations.Dr. Steven B. Wertheim, another founding partner of Resurgens, said one goal of the consolidation was to gain bargaining power with insurance companies and to provide M.R.I.s, physical therapy and even certain outpatient operations in-house rather than referring patients to other providers or operating at hospitals. More leverage with insurers often allows doctors to extract higher rates.\u201cHis overall gist was, \u2018Look, if all we did was practice good medicine, we\u2019d be broke by tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Dr. Wertheim said of Mr. Price. \u201cHe understood the need to run a business.\u201dAs a physician, Mr. Price was constantly frustrated by having to seek insurance companies\u2019 approval for his patients to get an expensive diagnostic test or physical therapy \u2014 a common complaint among specialists. Similarly, he resented when federal health regulators intervened in something he and his partners thought they were already doing well, like using electronic medical records.\u201cThose are the things that drove him crazy,\u201d Dr. Wertheim said.His resentment of government intervention in medicine drove Mr. Price to become involved in the Medical Association of Georgia early in his career, and his work there led him to run for office in 1995, when the House seat in his district opened up. But by 2002, as his legislative duties increased, he traded his suburban practice for a job at Grady Memorial Hospital, a vast, chaotic, aging complex, just a few blocks from the State Capitol.For the next two years, Mr. Price was the medical director of Grady\u2019s orthopedic clinic, seeing a vastly different population than the well-off, privately insured patients he was used to. Most of Grady\u2019s patients are poor and black, and many lack any form of insurance. Long waits for care are the norm, and trauma, including gunshot wounds, is a big part of the caseload.\u201cHe called me and asked if there was a position,\u201d said Dr. James R. Roberson, the chairman of the orthopedics department at Emory University School of Medicine, whose residents train at Grady. \u201cHe needed some flexibility \u2014 that was most of his impetus to want to return to Grady, because he was really very interested in pursuing a political career.\u201dDr. Roberson said that Mr. Price played a \u201cunique role\u201d at the clinic, training residents and overseeing patient care but also seeking to address inefficiencies \u2014 long wait times, for example \u2014 and representing the clinic at hospital administrative meetings. Although he saw patients, he did not perform surgery or need to be on call at night \u2014 an unusual arrangement, Dr. Roberson said.In the Legislature, Mr. Price spent his first six years in the powerless minority, although he quickly rose to the position of minority whip.His fortunes changed in 2003, after Sonny Perdue became the first Republican governor since Reconstruction and persuaded enough Democrats to switch parties to put the Senate into Republican hands.As the majority leader, Mr. Price\u2019s intimate knowledge of procedural rules and maneuvers, gleaned from assiduous research, helped advance his party\u2019s agenda.In the state Legislature, he was the leader who delivered bad news, the no-nonsense tactician to some of his Southern-born colleagues\u2019 more backslapping style. His sense of humor, when he used it, was dry. Colleagues often wondered if he slept.\u201cHe\u2019s a machine,\u201d said Russell K. Paul, a Republican who served in the State Senate with Mr. Price.During his two years in the majority, Mr. Price\u2019s top priority was curbing the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance, which he said was forcing hospitals and nursing homes to close and forcing doctors to limit which procedures they performed.\u201cHe was very bright, articulate, and smart enough to be able to see the different sides,\u201d said Tom Bordeaux, a former Democratic state lawmaker and trial lawyer who negotiated with Mr. Price over a package of bills Mr. Price introduced to limit doctors\u2019 liability in malpractice cases. \u201cBut he was just totally unwilling. He was very gracious and he was completely inflexible.\u201dUltimately, Mr. Price failed to persuade even his Republican colleagues to accept a provision that would have capped pain-and-suffering damages for malpractice victims at $250,000.Mr. Paul, now the mayor of Sandy Springs, Ga., said Mr. Price had become more partisan during his last few years in the Legislature, when the Republicans saw an opportunity to tip the balance of power in their favor for the first time since Reconstruction.\u201cThere was not a lot of bipartisan collegiality when it came to trying to control the government in Georgia,\u201d Mr. Paul said, \u201cand that environment was the crucible that began to turn Tom into a hardened political warrior.\u201dMr. Price has also supported proposals to overhaul Medicare \u2014 potentially putting him at odds with his new boss, Mr. Trump, who has pledged not to \u201ctouch\u201d the program. Speaking to a student group at the University of Michigan in 2015, Mr. Price expressed concern that Mr. Trump would not listen to others, including Congress, if elected.Katie Thomas contributed reporting from Chicago, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In \u2018Brexit\u2019 Speech, Theresa May Outlines Clean Break for U.K.", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 \u201cGet on with it.\u201dWith the address, Mrs. May began the jockeying that will lead to a break after more than four decades of tight integration, and define Britain\u2019s relations with its neighbors for decades to come.She confirmed that Britain is determined to regain control of migration from the European Union and rejected the supremacy of the European Court of Justice. That stance is anathema to the European Union, which has made the free movement of people \u2014 as well as goods, capital and services \u2014 a bedrock principle and which relies on the court to arbitrate.\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Mrs. May said, acknowledging the differences. \u201cWhat I am proposing cannot mean remaining in the single market.\u201dShe said that she hoped to complete a final deal with the European Union by March 2019 and that it would be voted on by both houses of Parliament. She was not clear about what would happen if Parliament rejected the deal, though some speculated that a rejection would result in the sort of chaotic, \u201ccliff edge\u201d breakup that she and Britain\u2019s bankers and business leaders hoped to avoid.Mrs. May struck a diplomatic note, including an appeal for a new partnership with Continental Europe, but not at all costs.\u201cWe seek a new and equal partnership \u2014 between an independent, self-governing, global Britain and our friends and allies in the E.U.,\u201d Mrs. May said. \u201cNot partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half in, half out.\u201dAnd she appealed to Britons, especially to those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to unite behind the government and stop refighting the referendum that backed leaving the bloc, which she had opposed.The reaction among her opponents in the \u201cremain\u201d camp was predictably harsh and seemed to herald a long and bruising process.\u201cTheresa May has confirmed Britain is heading for a hard Brexit,\u201d said Tim Farron, the leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats. \u201cShe claimed people voted to leave the single market. They didn\u2019t. She has made the choice to do massive damage to the British economy.\u201dThe speech, which provided some degree of substance, gained a warmer reception in the markets, with the pound seeming to stabilize after several jittery days. It rose as much as 1 percent against the dollar during her speech, while stocks on the London exchange fell.Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobbying group, welcomed the greater clarity provided by Mrs. May but worried that \u201cruling out membership of the single market has reduced options for maintaining a barrier-free trading relationship between the U.K. and the E.U.\u201dKallum Pickering, senior Britain economist at Berenberg Bank in London, was more blunt, writing in an analysis that \u201cas we do not expect the E.U. to compromise its principles, the U.K. is set to face significant economic consequences from Brexit.\u201dFew analysts expect the negotiations to go as smoothly or as quickly as Mrs. May seemed to say in her speech. In recognition of the troubles that may lie ahead, Mark Boleat, the policy chairman for the City of London Corporation, the heart of Britain\u2019s financial services industry, urged Mrs. May to swiftly secure a transition deal that would provide the certainty that businesses crave.Charles Brasted, a partner at Hogan Lovells, an international law firm, cautioned that the deal Mrs. May wanted was likely to be seen by the European Union as \u201cprecisely the cherry picking that they have warned against.\u201d He added: \u201cThe objectives are now clear. The path towards them is uncharted.\u201dBut he warned that \u201cevery one of the aspirations expressed by the U.K. government today will demand exceptional political skill to negotiate and will be complex to implement legally and commercially.\u201dMrs. May\u2019s speech, delivered in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House in London, was the most closely watched statement on European policy since January 2013, when the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, promised to hold a referendum on European Union membership.The prospect that Britain would remain part of the single market has been fading since Mrs. May said in October that she would demand complete control of migration from the European Union and release from the European Court of Justice.The extent to which Mrs. May would be willing to compromise to maintain some access to the single market and to the customs union for goods was less clear. Membership in the customs union limits the ability of member countries to strike individual free-trade deals with non-European nations. So she said she wanted a deal that would allow Britain to trade freely with the world, but still have as much tariff-free trade as possible with European Union countries.While European nations are expected to be stingy with market access, Mr. Pickering says he believes they will eventually bend.In the final deal, he wrote, he still expects Britain and the European Union to agree to a deal in which \u201cthe U.K. maintains a good level of access to the E.U.\u2019s goods markets and limited access to the less-developed services markets.\u201d\u201cCrucially, we expect the U.K. to lose its E.U. financial services passport,\u201d Mr. Pickering wrote, referring to a system that allowed banks based in Britain to offer financial services throughout the bloc. \u201cThis follows from the U.K. raising some modest barriers to migration from the E.U.\u201dMany European Union countries have backed taking a hard line against Britain to send a message to other member states that might consider leaving. Anticipating that, Mrs. May said that Britain wanted a successful European Union and a friendly partnership, but that \u201cno deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about a speech by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain in which she charted the country\u2019s course toward a clean break with the European Union misstated the timing of her call to \u201cget on with it.\u201d It came late in the speech, not early.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin, and James Kanter from Brussels.Advertisement"}

It would have a presence online as well as in stores, with brands including Foster Grant, Oliver Peoples, Persol, LensCrafters, Pearle Vision and Sunglass Hut.The deal follows more than four years of talks. The new company would have more than 140,000 employees and sales in more than 150 countries. Based on 2015 results, it is forecast to have revenue of more than 15 billion euros, or about $16 billion, in 2016.\u201cThe new group would be a clear leader in the optical industry, with a strong brand portfolio, global distribution capabilities and complementary expertise in ophthalmic lenses, prescription frames and sunglasses,\u201d Fred Speirs, a UBS analyst, said in a research report on Monday.The two companies were worth a combined \u20ac46.3 billion, based on their market capitalization at the end of trading on Friday, making the deal one of Europe\u2019s largest cross-border transactions. They said they expected to save \u20ac400 million to \u20ac600 million \u201cin the medium term.\u201dMore than half of revenue at the combined company would come from the United States, while Europe would account for about 22 percent and 18 percent would come from Africa, Asia and the Middle East.The transaction is expected to close in the second half of the year, but requires regulatory and shareholder approval.It comes at a time of significant growth and change in the global eyewear market, which had a value of about $121 billion last year, according to data from Euromonitor.Aging populations, greater access to health care, awareness of sun-related damage and a rising middle class in emerging markets have led to a surge in sales in eyewear, particularly for branded frames.Under the terms of the deal, Delfin, the family holding company of the Luxottica founder and executive chairman, Leonardo Del Vecchio, would exchange its 62 percent stake in Luxottica for shares in Essilor, becoming the combined company\u2019s largest shareholder.Mr. Del Vecchio would serve as executive chairman and chief executive, while Mr. Sagni\u00e8res would serve as executive vice chairman and deputy chief executive.The company\u2019s 16-member board would consist of eight directors nominated by Essilor and eight nominated by Delfin.The merger resolves lingering concerns over a leadership succession plan at Luxottica. Mr. Del Vecchio, who is 81, founded the company in 1961 and has been chairman ever since. But the role of chief executive has been a revolving door.In 2014, Mr. Del Vecchio pledged to double the group\u2019s revenue over the next decade, and to look into mergers or acquisitions to secure Luxottica\u2019s future.Luca Solca, a luxury-sector analyst for Exane BNP Paribas, said the deal \u201cwould be excellent news for both stocks.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt creates significant synergies, both in revenues and costs; it defuses the risk of heightened competition between the two and it removes uncertainty on succession at Luxottica.\u201dCitigroup and Rothschild and the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton advised Essilor, while Mediobanca and the law firms Bonelli Erede Pappalardo and Bredin Prat advised Delfin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Samsung Heir Faces Arrest on Charges of Bribing South Korea\u2019s President", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The sprawling investigation into President Park Geun-hye of South Korea took a dramatic turn on Monday with word that prosecutors were seeking the arrest of the de facto head of Samsung, one of the world\u2019s largest conglomerates, on charges that he bribed the president and her secretive confidante.Mr. Lee is accused of instructing Samsung subsidiaries to make payments totaling 43 billion won ($36 million) to the family of Ms. Park\u2019s confidante, Choi Soon-sil, and to two foundations that Ms. Choi controlled, in exchange for help from Ms. Park in facilitating a father-to-son transfer of ownership control of Samsung.The special prosecutor, Park Young-soo, said that the money represented bribes from Samsung, and that Mr. Lee embezzled some of the money from his companies. Mr. Park said he had asked a Seoul court to issue an arrest warrant for Mr. Lee; it usually takes a few days for a court to decide whether to grant such a warrant.\u201cWe have enough evidence to establish President Park and Choi Soon-sil as co-conspirators sharing profits\u201d in the bribery scheme, Lee Kyu-chul, a spokesman of the special prosecutor, said during a news briefing on Monday.If Mr. Lee is arrested, it will be a milestone in South Korea\u2019s efforts to fight corruption involving the country\u2019s powerful family-controlled conglomerates, known as chaebol. It could also disrupt Mr. Lee\u2019s efforts to inherit management control of Samsung, whose tentacles in consumer electronics, shipbuilding and a range of other industries reach throughout South Korea\u2019s economy.Although Samsung has often been investigated on corruption allegations, neither Mr. Lee nor his father has spent time in jail. The elder Mr. Lee was convicted of bribery in 1996, and of tax evasion and breach of trust in 2009, but in each case, he was not arrested, and his prison terms were suspended. Each time, his criminal record was later erased in presidential pardons, and he soon returned to Samsung\u2019s leadership.The South Korean government and the judiciary have been similarly lenient toward other business tycoons convicted of white-collar crimes, deepening public mistrust of the justice system and raising doubts among foreign investors who want tighter corporate governance in South Korea.Corruption scandals in the chaebol often stem from maneuvers to transfer wealth control from one generation of the dominant family to the next, and the trouble at Samsung is no exception.The special prosecutor said that Mr. Moon acted on behalf of Ms. Park.The national pension fund\u2019s support was crucial for the merger, which analysts said helped Mr. Lee inherit control of Samsung from his father. Elliott Management, an American activist hedge fund, and other investors in Samsung had campaigned to block the merger, saying that it wronged minority shareholders by grossly undervaluing the shares of one of the two Samsung companies, Samsung C&T.Samsung issued a statement on Monday denying that it paid bribes or made \u201cimproper requests related to the merger of Samsung affiliates or the leadership transition.\u201dAllegations that Ms. Park helped Ms. Choi extort millions in bribes from Samsung and other companies are at the heart of the corruption scandal that led to the impeachment vote. Ms. Park\u2019s powers have been suspended while the Constitutional Court decides whether to end her presidency.Mr. Lee testified at a National Assembly hearing last month that he was not involved in the decision by Samsung to make the payments. He also said that they were not voluntary donations, suggesting that the company was a victim of extortion, not a participant in bribery.But the special prosecutor\u2019s team accused Mr. Lee on Monday of perjuring himself during the parliamentary hearing. The prosecutors said they had evidence that Mr. Lee personally ordered the payments after receiving a request from Ms. Park.Some conservative South Koreans, as well as some pro-business newspaper editorials, have warned that an arrest of Mr. Lee could hurt the national economy by disrupting Samsung\u2019s management. Lee Kyu-chul, the special prosecutor\u2019s spokesman, responded, \u201cWe determined that establishing justice is far more important.\u201dDespite the case\u2019s high profile, its impact on Samsung\u2019s day-to-day operations will probably be subdued at first, according to analysts. Samsung Electronics, which makes microchips, screens and smartphones, is run by professional managers who are used to operating on their own without Mr. Lee\u2019s direct involvement.Still, Mark Newman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, a research and brokerage firm, said that Mr. Lee\u2019s legal issues could ultimately slow down larger strategic decisions at Samsung.\u201cBig things, like restructuring or a new big multibillion-dollar investment, things like that might be tricky for him to get to,\u201d he said.He likened the company\u2019s clout to that of large, organized special interests in Washington.\u201cIn the U.S., there are a lot of powerful lobbies, like the gun lobby, but in Korea the equivalent is the Samsung lobby or the Hyundai lobby,\u201d Mr. Newman said. \u201cThey\u2019re very powerful, but they\u2019re being found out.\u201dPaul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Your Family Better at Personal Finance", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byOff the ShelfWhen I become emperor, three things will happen immediately:\u2022 Blue-eyed soul music will be banned from the radio.\u2022 DVRs will automatically add an extra hour so they never cut off a sporting event before it\u2019s over.\u2022 Everyone will be required to pass a basic personal finance course.I am serious about the last one.That number has steadily declined since Finra \u2014 the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which helps set policies for brokers and Wall Street \u2014 first offered the quiz in 2009. (For the most recent quiz, Finra surveyed a representative sample of more than 27,000 Americans nationwide from June through October 2015. The margin of error was estimated at 0.5 percent.)And we are not talking advanced calculus here. A representative question? \u201cSuppose you have $100 in a saving account earning 2 percent interest a year. After five years, how much would you have? More than $102? Exactly $102? Less than $102?\u201d To get it right, you don\u2019t have to know how much money you would have, just that it would be more than $102.Also, on a personal level, I know personal finance education works. Of my four children, only our daughter took a personal finance course. She did it in college to satisfy her math requirement, and she is far better with money than her equally smart brothers.Given how strongly I feel about this, I am delighted by the new finance book \u201cMake Your Kid a Money Genius (Even if You\u2019re Not)\u201d by Beth Kobliner (Simon & Schuster, $19.95). It\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction. Ms. Kobliner, a former staff writer for Money who wrote \u201cGet a Financial Life,\u201d aimed at millennials, has produced another engaging book.It helps that she shares personal stories, like this: \u201cWhen my son was in preschool and we had a playdate with twins who lived nearby, I was impressed that they knew the difference between a penny, a nickel, a dime and a quarter. And I felt sort of embarrassed \u2014 me, the money writer \u2014 that I hadn\u2019t taught my little guy.\u201dHer tone is supportive throughout. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a perfect investor to be a good investor,\u201d she writes. And: \u201cUnderstand your own financial baggage and leave it behind.\u201dThe book\u2019s organizing principle is just fine. Ms. Kobliner selects a topic (what to tell your children about debt, for example) and suggests age-appropriate advice.When they are in preschool, she says, help them understand that credit cards are not a magic wand. \u201cBuying stuff costs money whether you use cash\u201d or charge it, she writes.By the time they are in middle or high school, it\u2019s time to go much deeper: Explain the high interest rates that credit cards charge and why it is imperative to pay off your balance each month.But I have two reservations.First, the book seems padded. I am not sure it needed separate chapters on insurance, the need to work hard and \u201cgiving back.\u201d Together, the three take up more than 20 percent of the book.Second, some of the advice seems off base or vague.For example, in talking about the importance of delayed gratification, Ms. Kobliner writes, \u201cTeaching your kid to focus on the long-term payoff doesn\u2019t take nearly as much effort as it sounds.\u201d To which I can only respond, \u201cHave you ever taken a 5-year-old down a supermarket\u2019s cereal aisle?\u201dAdvice like, \u201cInvest a little \u2014 but not too much \u2014 in bonds\u201d is not specific enough. How much is too much?Ms. Kobliner gives lots of good prescriptions: Diversify; don\u2019t trust stock tips; use index funds. But while rules of thumb are helpful, my children always learned better when the examples were vivid and they knew the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the answer.Like when discussing why you want to invest in mutual funds with low fees, she writes: \u201cSay you put $1,000 into a fund with an expense ratio of 1.5 percent, and at the same time you put another into a fund charging just 0.2 percent. If they both earn 7 percent a year, after 30 years, the first fund would have accumulated $4,984, and the second would have $7,197.\u201dThat\u2019s fine. But the numbers are rather small and the conclusion is not memorable. So instead, I wish she had written something like this: \u201cAs you may expect, fees and expenses vary from fund to fund. A fund with high costs must perform better than a low-cost fund to generate the same returns for you. Even small differences in fees can translate into large differences in returns over time. For example, if you invested $10,000 in a fund that produced a 10 percent annual return before expenses and had annual operating expenses of 1.5 percent, then after 20 years you would have roughly $49,725. But if the fund had expenses of only 0.5 percent, then you would end up with $60,858.\u201dYet Ms. Kobliner\u2019s new book is worth reading. It\u2019s a good base for building financial literacy. Simply helping children learn personal finance basics will benefit them in the long term. Living within their means and saving for retirement as early as possible will give them a running start.And if the book makes you stop periodically to reconsider your own spending and saving habits, or helps you find a good answer when your child asks about money, that\u2019s good, too. Ms. Kobliner\u2019s book won\u2019t make anyone a financial genius. But it may lay a solid foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elaine Chao Gets Cozy Reception at Confirmation Hearing", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Elaine L. Chao, a veteran cabinet secretary who has served under two Republican presidents, offered remarkably few specifics but many promises of cooperation on Wednesday as she cruised through her confirmation hearing to become transportation secretary.Democrats on the Senate committee charged with reviewing Ms. Chao\u2019s nomination by President-elect Donald J. Trump made it clear that they have no objections to her, suggesting that she will be easily confirmed in a full Senate vote.Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, the top Democrat on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, praised Ms. Chao for acting with \u201cgrace and excellence\u201d in her previous government service.\u201cI certainly look forward to you, in this new administration, doing the same,\u201d he said.Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the committee\u2019s chairman, called her \u201can ideal candidate.\u201dMs. Chao spent most of the three-hour hearing promising to examine and learn more about drones, fuel efficiency standards, air traffic control services and many other subjects that may soon be part of her portfolio.With most of the spotlight falling on Mr. Trump\u2019s desire for a major infrastructure overhaul \u2014 in his own words, a priority for his first 100 days in office that could cost $1 trillion \u2014 Ms. Chao vowed to keep senators informed of emerging plans. She called the overhaul \u201ca heavy lift\u201d that would require cooperation both between the parties and between Congress and the administration.\u201cAs the infrastructure proposal is being put together, we will certainly be in great discussion with the Congress, because, once again, we can\u2019t do it on our own,\u201d she said.The selection of Ms. Chao to lead the Transportation Department and its $75 billion budget stands out in the lineup of largely billionaire business executives Mr. Trump has nominated to populate his cabinet. She served as labor secretary for the duration of George W. Bush\u2019s administration and as a deputy transportation secretary under the elder George Bush.Ms. Chao vowed on Wednesday to work with lawmakers on a host of transportation issues \u2014 including maritime infrastructure and positive train control, a safety system intended to prevent collisions.Emphasizing the need to revitalize the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure, Ms. Chao called for creativity to fund improvements. Asked whether Mr. Trump would support including federal spending in his infrastructure package, she said, \u201cI believe the answer is yes.\u201dSupport for federal infrastructure funding could put the Trump administration on a collision course with congressional Republicans, who have been reluctant or even openly hostile to increasing domestic spending in recent years.Ms. Chao offered few other funding solutions, though she did propose turning to more public-private partnerships, referencing the potential capital available from \u201cequity firms, pension funds and endowments.\u201dThat seemed to raise concern from Mr. Nelson, who cautioned against the privatization of government services, alluding to a possible point of friction between Democrats and the incoming Trump administration.Since leaving public service, Ms. Chao has joined the boards of Wells Fargo, News Corporation and Vulcan Materials, among others \u2014 positions she said she would resign from if confirmed.However, according to documents she filed with the Office of Government Ethics, Ms. Chao will continue for a time to receive payments under financial agreements with Vulcan, which makes construction supplies, and Wells Fargo as she severs her ties with them; the payments from Wells Fargo stocks will continue through March 2021. She has agreed to recuse herself from matters involving those companies.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Though Wells Fargo came under fire late last year for its business practices, senators did not ask her to elaborate on her continued ties with the embattled company.There was a notably cozy, familiar tone to much of the hearing, as senators questioned a nominee with close ties to one of their own: Ms. Chao is the wife of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky.Praising Ms. Chao as \u201cincredibly capable\u201d in his introduction, Mr. McConnell cheekily endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s pick. \u201cShe\u2019s got really great judgment, on a whole variety of things,\u201d he said.To capture his feelings, Mr. McConnell turned to the words of a previous Republican senator whose spouse was a transportation and labor secretary, paraphrasing what Bob Dole once said about his wife, Elizabeth.\u201cI feel a little bit like Nathan Hale,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201c\u2018I regret that I have but one wife to give for my country.\u2019\u201dMs. Chao said, \u201cI will be working to lock in the majority leader\u2019s support tonight over dinner.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Aleynikov\u2019s lawyer, Kevin H. Marino, said an appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, the highest state court, was likely.Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, issued a statement applauding the appellate court decision. Mr. Vance said if the trial judge\u2019s ruling had been allowed to stand, it would have sent a message that theft of intellectual property is not a crime.\u201cNo company wants to do business in a market where someone can steal its work product without consequences,\u201d Mr. Vance said.Mr. Vance then filed state criminal charges against the former Goldman employee.When Mr. Aleynikov was originally arrested in 2009, high-frequency trading \u2014 the rapid-fire trading of stocks, bonds and commodities driven by algorithmic computer programs \u2014 was just gaining prominence on Wall Street. Today, such trading is commonly used by Wall Street firms and hedge funds and drives much of the daily trading in the stock market.An earlier version of the headline for this article misstated part of the name of the company where the trader worked.

{"Headline": "Gene-Modified Ants Shed Light on How Societies Are Organized", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byBasicsWhether personally or professionally, Daniel Kronauer of Rockefeller University is the sort of biologist who leaves no stone unturned. Passionate about ants and other insects since kindergarten, Dr. Kronauer says he still loves flipping over rocks \u201cjust to see what\u2019s crawling around underneath.\u201dIn an amply windowed fourth-floor laboratory on the east side of Manhattan, he and his colleagues are assaying the biology, brain, genetics and behavior of a single species of ant in ambitious, uncompromising detail. The researchers have painstakingly hand-decorated thousands of clonal raider ants, Cerapachys biroi, with bright dots of pink, blue, red and lime-green paint, a color-coded system that allows computers to track the ants\u2019 movements 24 hours a day \u2014 and makes them look like walking jelly beans.The scientists have manipulated the DNA of these ants, creating what Dr. Kronauer says are the world\u2019s first transgenic ants. Among the surprising results is a line of Greta Garbo types that defy the standard ant preference for hypersociality and instead just want to be left alone.The researchers also have identified the molecular and neural cues that spur ants to act like nurses and feed the young, or to act like queens and breed more young, or to serve as brutal police officers, capturing upstart nestmates, spread-eagling them on the ground and reducing them to so many chitinous splinters.Dr. Kronauer, who was born and raised in Germany and just turned 40, is tall, sandy-haired, blue-eyed and married to a dentist. He is amiable and direct, and his lab\u2019s ambitions are both lofty and pragmatic.\u201cOur ultimate goal is to have a fundamental understanding of how a complex biological system works,\u201d Dr. Kronauer said. \u201cI use ants as a model to do this.\u201d As he sees it, ants in a colony are like cells in a multicellular organism, or like neurons in the brain: their fates joined, their labor synchronized, the whole an emergent force to be reckoned with.\u201cBut you can manipulate an ant colony in ways you can\u2019t easily do with a brain,\u201d Dr. Kronauer said. \u201cIt\u2019s very modular, and you can take it apart and put it back together again.\u201dThe researchers hope to turn the clonal raider ant into a so-called model organism, right up there with such laboratory stalwarts as E. coli and Drosophila. But while bacteria and fruit flies have proved invaluable for addressing fundamental questions of how genes operate or body plans arise during development, Dr. Kronauer\u2019s model ants offer scientists the chance to explore, under controlled conditions, the origin and evolution of animal societies.\u201cHis system is unbelievably promising for anyone who wants to study social behavior,\u201d said Corina Tarnita, an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University who has worked with termites and microbial communities.\u201cYou can ask, what are the basic ingredients, the elementary operations that nature has used repeatedly to produce societies \u2014 whether you\u2019re talking about ants, slime molds, baboons or even the very first human societies.\u201dGene Robinson, a honeybee expert and director of genomic biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said, \u201cSocial insect colonies are the quintessential complex system, and Daniel has developed a very powerful set of tools addressing big questions of how they operate, and how, in the absence of central control, local interactions can give rise to global patterns.\u201dOne key to the raider ant\u2019s potential as a laboratory workhorse is its adaptability. Many ants are finicky. Not so Cerapachys.\u201cIt\u2019s a weedy species,\u201d Dr. Kronauer said. \u201cThat\u2019s true of a lot of model organisms \u2014 they have a global distribution, they\u2019re good at invading disturbed habitats, and they\u2019re good at being raised in a lab.\u201dTo trace the knotted skeins of antly social life, the researchers take a battery of approaches. They knock out ant genes or edit the lettering of ant genes and see how the ants respond. They ply ants with radioactively labeled neurochemicals and check where in the ants\u2019 brains the signaling molecules gain purchase.They measure ant movements by fractions of a millimeter as the insects perambulate along finely calibrated grids traced in ceramic. They overfeed the ants and starve the ants; they mix and match ants of varying age, life experience and transgenicity.The project represents basic research at its most seductively cerebral, yet it may well reveal insights into human disease, like why cancer cells ignore all stop signals from their surroundings, or why the brain turns in on itself during depression.\u201cBy studying the neuromodulators that make ants so sensitive to their social environment,\u201d Dr. Kronauer said, \u201cwe could learn something fundamental about autism and depression along the way.\u201dThe five-year enterprise has not been glitch free. Early on, the ants were stricken by a mite infestation. \u201cIt came out of nowhere and killed off 80 percent of the colonies,\u201d Dr. Kronauer said. \u201cI went home and told my wife, we\u2019re done.\u201dNow the protocols are established, the ants are thriving and members of Dr. Kronauer\u2019s lab handle their subjects with deft efficiency. In one experiment, Vikram Chandra, a graduate student, plucked individual ants from a dish with a small pair of pliers and passed the tool over to Amelia Ritger, a research assistant.She peered through a microscope to inject a dose of hormone into each ant\u2019s abdomen and then returned the pliers to Mr. Chandra for a refill. \u201cWe\u2019ll go through a few hundred of these over the next couple of hours,\u201d Ms. Ritger said.\u201cIn structuring our work routine,\u201d Mr. Chandra said dryly, \u201cwe decided to take a tip from the ants.\u201dDr. Kronauer said his students and postdoctoral fellows designed everything from scratch: computer algorithms, tracking devices, the incised mazes. \u201cThey\u2019re engineers, code writers, neuroscientists,\u201d Dr. Kronauer said. \u201cMe, I\u2019m just the guy who knows about ants.\u201dIn fact, Dr. Kronauer spent years studying ants in the field, working with slave-making ants in Arizona and army ants in Costa Rica. But as much as he loved fieldwork, he began to feel that chasing army ants through the forest was like chasing chimpanzees.\u201cThey move, you follow. You can\u2019t really do experiments,\u201d he said. He wanted to delve deeper, take ants back to the lab, do sequencing, transgenics, knockouts, molecular work, the whole fruit fly buffet. But what sort of ants would comply?As a rule, biologists who study ants in the lab must constantly replenish their stocks from the wild, which would preclude the precise genetic research Dr. Kronauer had in mind. Then he happened on three papers about the obscure C. biroi, and he knew he\u2019d found his ant.Beyond its amenable weediness, the clonal raider ant seems almost custom-tailored for experimentation. The world\u2019s 12,000 known species of ants display a variety of reproductive and survival strategies. The most familiar examples are the fully eusocial ants, in which many sterile female workers do all the chores, a single large queen lays all the eggs, and a sprinkling of male ants, or drones, supply the sperm.Among clonal raider ants, there are no permanently designated workers and queens. Instead, all the ants in a colony switch back and forth from one role to the other. About half the time, they behave like workers, gathering food for their young \u2014 generally, by raiding the nests of other ants and stealing their larvae.The rest of the time, they go into queen mode and all colony members lay eggs together. Moreover, there are no male raider ants: The eggs develop parthenogenetically, without sperm, creating phalanxes of genetically identical female clones.The ants\u2019 unusual mix of genetic uniformity and wildly protean conduct offers a powerful tool for cracking the old nature-versus-nurture conundrum, and the Kronauer researchers have been mapping out the interplay between genes and environmental cues in shaping essential behaviors like reproduction and sociality.Sequencing the genome of the ant, the scientists found that one class of odorant receptor genes had been \u201cmassively expanded,\u201d Dr. Kronauer said, suggesting that C. birois may be even more dependent than the average ant on chemical communication. The researchers then used gene knockout techniques to eliminate that category of odorant receptors from some ants, and the results were startling.The knockout ants had no trouble detecting food. In fact, Dr. Kronauer said, \u201cthey would eat much more than other ants do.\u201d Their appetite for socializing was another matter.Whereas normal raider ants will happily pile on top of one another whenever possible, the knockout ants avoided the crowd, instead wandering around on their own for days at a time, as though they were nothing more than the average asocial beetle.The results suggest that the diversification and specialization of olfactory receptors were keys to the evolution of ant sociality.The researchers are also exploring the biochemistry of caretaking, asking which signals prod ants to leave the nest and find food for their young.Preliminary results suggest that volatile pheromones exuded by newborn larvae stimulate the brains of adult ants to begin generating the hormone inotocin, the ant\u2019s equivalent of oxytocin, which is famed for its role in promoting nurturing behavior among mammals.For raider ants, an inotocin surge galvanizes the urge to venture forth and start plundering, and ants with the greatest number of inotocin-making neurons, Dr. Kronauer said, \u201care the first ones out the door.\u201dSome ants, by contrast, ignore the community cues altogether, and they pay dearly for their scoffery.On occasion, though, an ant\u2019s ovaries remain animated when they should be suspended, and other ants can detect the illicit activity through telltale hydrocarbon signatures on the offender\u2019s cuticle. Policing ants soon move in on the hyperovarian individual, drag it out of the nest, hold it down and pull it apart, an execution that can take hours or days.\u201cThese ants are like little tanks,\u201d Dr. Kronauer said.Why is it important to kill off an ant that might breed off-season when that ant is your genetic twin? Dr. Kronauer compared the police ants to the body\u2019s immune system, and the rebel ant to cancer.\u201cAn ant colony faces similar problems as a multicellular organism,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have components that don\u2019t respond to regulatory cues and start to replicate out of control.\u201dWhen the ant police come knocking, there\u2019s no rock big enough to hide you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alphabet\u2019s Profits Stay Predictably Good in a Volatile Industry", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It is almost boring how predictably good Alphabet\u2019s earnings are these days \u2014 a trait not always shared by the company\u2019s tech conglomerate peers.But fourth-quarter results announced on Thursday from Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, proved once again that the company is the model of moneymaking consistency.The heart of Alphabet\u2019s consistent earnings remains the company\u2019s search engine. While a consumer can delay an iPhone purchase or shop somewhere other than Amazon, Google\u2019s search engine is an indispensable tool for anyone using the internet. The shift to mobile devices, once considered a threat to Google\u2019s search business, has only strengthened it.Google\u2019s market share on desktop search is around 78 percent, but it is above 90 percent on mobile devices, according to research from NetMarketShare.com. What is more, on smaller mobile displays, Google\u2019s ads occupy a large portion of the screen \u2014 making it more likely a user will click on them.Clicks on Google ads increased 36 percent in the quarter, but what advertisers paid for each click decreased 15 percent.Google is also sitting on many of the internet\u2019s most valuable properties \u2014 the places where people go to stay in touch on email, find driving directions or seek out entertainment.While clicks on Google\u2019s ads across the internet are rising, they are growing faster on its own websites like YouTube. Alphabet does not break out results for YouTube, but the site continues to amass a huge audience. Google said more than a billion people watched YouTube every month, viewing hundreds of millions of hours of its videos every day.Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said company assets like search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play, constituted \u201cprime time in the mobile era.\u201dEven Alphabet\u2019s unexpected hiccups are a little dull. The company\u2019s earnings per share were $7.56, or 11 cents below analysts\u2019 estimates. It said the reason for the shortfall was that it paid more in taxes. The company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 percent, compared with 5 percent in the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet said it paid more in United States taxes but did not explain why.Alphabet shares were down 2 percent in after-hours trading. The stock reached a record high on Wednesday.While the dominance of the Google search engine seems unassailable today, Alphabet is investing heavily in new technologies that may threaten its stronghold. Devices like the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated smart speaker, portend a future where artificially intelligent digital assistants fetch information without needing to access a search engine directly.Google did not provide figures for how those products sold, but the \u201cother revenue\u201d category, which included hardware sales along with revenue from Google Play, rose 62 percent to $3.4 billion.Part of the company\u2019s financial stability came from Google\u2019s creation of Alphabet in 2015. The reorganization into a holding company split the company\u2019s core search business from a growing list of fledgling operations, like the newly minted Waymo \u2014 what used to be Google\u2019s self-driving car project until it was spun off as an independent Alphabet company in 2016.Under the watch of Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, the company has scaled back costs and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 the ambition of its speculative investments into new technologies. During the quarter, Alphabet said quarterly revenue from \u201cother bets\u201d rose 75 percent to $262 million, while operating losses narrowed to $1.09 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "These Booths Are Made For Talking: Soothers Hit the Streets", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byCirca NowA week after the presidential election, while walking through the farmers\u2019 market in Union Square, I came across a young woman giving out free hugs to strangers. I gladly accepted one. Balm.A day later, a friend told me that a Lutheran pastor on the Upper East Side has been dispensing free counsel on the sidewalk on Tuesday mornings while sitting in a wooden booth that he had made to the exact specifications of Lucy\u2019s in the comic strip \u201cPeanuts,\u201d complete with a sign reading, \u201cSpiritual Help, 5 cents. The pastor is in.\u201d (Nickels are provided.)Street preachers. Huggers without portfolio. If stores and restaurants can pop up, why can\u2019t the helping professions?\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that there\u2019s a resurgence of this stuff,\u201d said Anna Carter Florence, an ordained Presbyterian minister and the Peter Marshall Professor of Preaching at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga., who said she saw a group of women giving free hugs outdoors in Toronto in November. \u201cHistorically, street preaching has to do with the proclamation of injustice and freedom for the oppressed. It\u2019s a kind of street theater. It\u2019s sacred jesters.\u201dIndeed, some of today\u2019s pop-up spiritualists are overtly political. Amichai Lau-Lavie, a Conservative rabbi who is the founder of both Lab/Shul NYC and Storahtelling Inc., helped organize an interfaith vigil in Washington Square Park on the night of the election. \u201cWe sang, we shared words of comfort, I made everyone do a primal scream,\u201d he said. \u201cA couple hundred people, 30 seconds of screaming. So powerful.\u201dTen days later, Mr. Lau-Lavie stood with other protesters in front of a mosque on 55th Street, holding signs bearing words of solidarity with Muslims. \u201cA lot of passers-by did a double take,\u201d Mr. Lau-Lavie said. \u201cBut interrupting business as usual and defying the normal, it\u2019s very profound.\u201dJustin Normand, a manager of a Dallas sign shop, had a similar idea in November: He stood in front of the Islamic Center of Irving in Irving, Tex., holding a sign reading, \u201cYou belong.\u201d Though Mr. Normand does not typically wear a cowboy hat, he did during his vigil, hoping to symbolize a part of Texas that he felt Muslims needed to hear from.In a subsequent Facebook post, Mr. Normand explained his efforts: \u201cThis was about binding up the wounded. About showing compassion and empathy for the hurting and fearful among us. Or, in some Christian traditions, this was about washing my brother\u2019s feet. This was about my religion, not theirs.\u201dBut other pop-up spiritualists say their aim is not political. The Rev. Gregory Fryer, the pastor of Immanuel Lutheran Church in Manhattan, said his \u201cPeanuts\u201d-style booth had nothing to do with the election.\u201cI simply believe that there are hungry hearts in this city,\u201d he said. Asked if publicity was a motivator, he confessed: \u201cWell, that is true. The first times I set up the booth, in October, I hoped people would begin to recognize me and the church. This church is a little intimidating-looking; people may think it\u2019s an armory. But, as time has gone by, things have reversed. Now I think of myself as Jason Bourne: I\u2019m memorizing the face of everyone who goes by. I want to recognize that these are my neighbors.\u201dThe jurisdiction of today\u2019s pop-up spiritualists is not confined to the tactile and the spiritual. Ciro Ortiz, 11, has been offering \u201cemotional advice\u201d for $2 a session at the Bedford Avenue subway stop on the L line in Brooklyn since October. Two springs ago, Jedediah Purses started offering free psychological counseling on the streets of San Francisco. \u201cI\u2019d done a lot of informal trainings in this kind of work and wanted to see what my skill set was,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m endlessly fascinated with what it\u2019s like to offer yourself up and to let the world come at you.\u201dMr. Purses has had clients confess \u201call sorts of crazy crimes\u201d to him. He has befriended homeless people. He\u2019s fended off numerous offers from passers-by selling drugs. He\u2019s had extended conversations with police officers about the moral and ethical struggles of their job.\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with anger from people of color who were annoyed to see white people shedding tears over the election \u2014 \u2018You didn\u2019t know that it\u2019s like this all the time for us?\u2019\u201d he said.The demands of the street are not insignificant. Pastor Fryer stocks his booth with Kleenex; Mr. Normand has his husband fielding media requests.\u201cThis sounds like a New Yorker cartoon come to life,\u201d said Andrew Walsh, the associate director of the Leonard E. Greenberg Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life at Trinity College in Hartford. \u201cThe forces of orderly commerce do seem, however, to have excluded these folk from the shopping malls.\u201dOn a blustery December day, I talked to Bugun Choi, who had already spent four hours holding a placard in Union Square to bring attention to his self-help nonprofit organization, the Society of Natural Science. I suggested to Mr. Choi that it was a cold day to be standing on a street corner. \u201cI am armed perfectly,\u201d he said. \u201cI bought these earmuffs for this.\u201dThen, when our conversation stretched 12 or 15 minutes longer than I hoped, I confessed: \u201cI need to go inside. I\u2019m starting to feel frostbit on my delicate parts.\u201d Mr. Choi smiled wanly.Many people ascribe to street preachers and freelance huggers a touch of craziness. \u201cMost of us give them a wide berth,\u201d said Ms. Florence, the priest and professor. \u201cI see them in Times Square and think, wow, but for a health plan and a set of meds, there go I.\u201dAccordingly, some pop-up spiritualists will take pains to be noninvasive and approachable. \u201cI let people come to me,\u201d said Mr. Purses, the counselor in San Francisco. \u201cI occupy myself by reading a book or taking notes, which gives people the chance to shamelessly check me out without the possibility of me looking back at them.\u201dMr. Lau-Lavie, the rabbi, said he labored to \u201cbe cautious, be alert, be polite\u201d when conducting services alfresco.\u201cI\u2019ll be perfectly honest, there\u2019s an element of fear,\u201d he said. \u201cAt our vigil on election night, there were some people at the edge of our circle who started yelling, \u2018Trump! Trump! Trump!\u2019 It was never violent, but it was hard.\u201dIf there is an element of gonzo to this new crop of pop-up spiritualist, such assiduousness is in perfect keeping with the history of street preaching. Ms. Florence cited research done by her colleague Charles Campbell, a professor of homiletics at Duke Divinity School, to point out that there is a long tradition of street preachers who preach naked.\u201cSt. Basil spent 70 years wandering the streets, completely naked in the Russian winter, preaching,\u201d she said. \u201cThe nakedness was intentional, and meant to unmask social hierarchy. Ivan the Terrible was so troubled by Basil, and so terrified of him, that he never had him arrested or killed. Basil used to throw meat at him!\u201dIf the measures that pop-up spiritualists take sometimes seem over the top \u2014 the primal screaming, the cartoon-derived booth, the cowboy hat \u2014 they are part of the package. Ms. Florence said, \u201cHoly fools speak in big language, trying to say something like what Flannery O\u2019Connor said: When you\u2019re preaching to those whose imaginations have grown numb, you have to preach big.\u201dHenry Alford is the author of \u201cWould It Kill You to Stop Doing That?

{"Headline": "Choice for Health Secretary Is Vague on Replacing Affordable Care Act", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byBut at a hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Mr. Price provided only vague reassurance to members of both parties who pressed him for specific policies.Republicans concluded he was well qualified; Democrats were not satisfied.\u201cJust days ago, President-elect Trump promised, quote, \u2018insurance for everybody,\u2019\u201d said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the committee. \u201cBut Congressman Price, your own proposals would cause millions of people to lose coverage, force many people to pay more for their care, and leave people with pre-existing conditions vulnerable to insurance companies\u2019 rejecting them or charging them more.\u201dIn four hours of testimony, Mr. Price, an orthopedic surgeon from the affluent northern suburbs of Atlanta, set lofty goals for a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, but did not say how he would achieve them.Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said one investment looked like a \u201csweetheart\u201d deal. But Mr. Price said, \u201cI had no access to nonpublic information.\u201dA list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Mr. Trump said last week that drug companies were \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and that Medicare should negotiate with drugmakers to secure lower prices, a position long championed by Democrats and fiercely opposed by Republicans.Asked if he would press Congress to authorize such negotiations, Mr. Price did not give a definitive answer. \u201cI think we need to find solutions to the challenges of folks\u2019 gaining access to needed medication,\u201d he said.He added that, if confirmed, he would try to give states more freedom and flexibility under Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides coverage for more than 70 million low-income people. In response to questions, he said states should be allowed to require certain able-bodied adults without children to work, seek work or participate in job training as a condition of receiving Medicaid. Some Republican governors want to impose such requirements, but the Obama administration has turned down their proposals.Mr. Price praised Indiana\u2019s program to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act with conservative policies that state officials say promote \u201cpersonal responsibility.\u201d\u201cStates know best\u201d how to care for their Medicaid beneficiaries, he said, adding, \u201cWhat Indiana has done is really a best practice, I think, for many other states to follow.\u201dMr. Trump has not said much about the future of Medicaid in the 31 states that have expanded eligibility, with large amounts of federal money.Democratic senators were often frustrated in their efforts to get Mr. Price to say whether he supported the coverage requirements and insurance mandates in the Affordable Care Act.In a typical response, he said that patients should have \u201caccess to the kind of coverage that they want,\u201d rather than having it dictated to them by the government.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said that Mr. Price appeared to support the coverage and protections provided by the Affordable Care Act, but that \u201cwe don\u2019t get any specifics as to how that\u2019s going to occur\u201d if the law is repealed.Without mandating coverage of specific benefits, Mr. Price said, the Trump administration could \u201cmake certain that individuals had the care and the kind of coverage that they needed for whatever diagnosis would befall them.\u201dHe said the administration could put in place \u201ca different construct\u201d that \u201cwould allow for every single person to gain access to the coverage that they want and have nobody fall through the cracks.\u201dHe did not say how the Trump team would guarantee such protection.Mr. Trump has expressed support for a provision of the 2010 health law under which insurers must allow children to stay on their parents\u2019 policies until the age of 26. This is \u201cbaked into the insurance programs that are out there right now,\u201d Mr. Price said.\u201cI think that the insurance industry has included individuals up to age 26 on their parents\u2019 policies virtually across the board,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t see any reason that that would change.\u201dDemocrats were skeptical. Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire said there was no guarantee that such protections would continue in the absence of federal requirements. Insurance companies did not routinely cover drug abuse treatment in the past and might not do so in the future without a requirement, she said.\u201cI think there\u2019s been a lot of talk about individuals losing health coverage,\u201d Mr. Price said. \u201cThat is not our goal, nor is it our desire, nor is it our plan.\u201d\u201cOne of the important things that we need to convey to the American people is that nobody\u2019s interested in pulling the rug out from under anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that it\u2019s absolutely imperative that individuals that have health coverage be able to keep health coverage and move, hopefully, to greater choices and opportunities for them to gain the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their families.\u201dMr. Price said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d consider administrative action to stabilize the market for insurers, which are supposed to submit proposals for 2018 coverage in April. Insurers say it will be nearly impossible to calculate premiums if they have no idea what will replace the health care law.Mr. Price championed \u201cmedical innovation\u201d as an essential ingredient of high-quality care but criticized the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, which was created by the health law to test new ways of paying doctors, hospitals and other providers.He said that the agency had great promise, but that too often, its experiments were compulsory for doctors and nearly nationwide in scope. He said he \u201cadamantly opposed the mandatory nature\u201d of some payment models, like one for joint replacement surgery and one for expensive drugs administered in doctors\u2019 offices.Mr. Price said he would not object if Medicare tested payment methods with small pilot projects that could expand if successful.The health committee will not vote on Mr. Price\u2019s nomination. Another hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday by the Senate Finance Committee, which will vote on whether to recommend confirmation. The committees share authority over issues for which the Health and Human Services Department is responsible.Advertisement"}

Go Out and Buy Some Shares", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byATLANTA \u2014 For the next two weeks, football fans are going to learn a lot more about the Atlanta Falcons, who crushed the Green Bay Packers, 44-21, to earn the right to face the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Feb. 5.Quarterback Matt Ryan will receive most of the attention, and for good reason. He leads the N.F.L.\u2019s best offense and has emerged as a top candidate for the Most Valuable Player Award. On Sunday, he added to his credentials, throwing for 392 yards and four touchdowns and running for an additional score.Ryan had a lot of help, of course. The running back tandem of Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman offers versatility and complements Julio Jones, one of the league\u2019s top receivers. Jones caught nine passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns, including a 73-yard score that effectively sealed the win for the Falcons.Jones and Ryan have an undoubted value on the field and among fantasy football fans, but a teammate, wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, has value in an additional place \u2014 on the stock market.The former Houston Texans running back Arian Foster was the first player to have his own stock. After an initial public offering of his stock, he received $10 million in return for promising to pay Fantex 20 percent of his future earnings. Foster\u2019s star soon faded, though. After gaining more than 1,200 yards in 2014, he struggled with injuries and retired in October.Chicago Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery, Washington Redskins tight end Vernon Davis and Buffalo Bills quarterback E. J. Manuel are among the other players with Fantex stocks.Sanu, though, is the only one still playing this season. Depending on his performance in the Super Bowl, his stock, which trades on the secondary market under the ticker SANUL, could rise if, say, he landed a big sponsorship deal. Buying shares in his stock might also be a way for fans to place an unconventional bet on the potential success of the Falcons, without going to a bookmaker.In the Falcons\u2019 locker room after Sunday\u2019s game, Sanu laughed and shrugged when asked about the potential impact on his stock price.\u201cIt feels awesome,\u201d he said, standing two lockers over from Jones\u2019s locker.Sanu, 27, spent his first four seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals, who drafted him in the third round of the 2012 draft.Based on his \u201cbrand value,\u201d fans bought 164,300 shares at $10 a share in an I.P.O. in 2014, and Sanu received $1.56 million. In July 2015, Fantex paid Sanu shareholders a dividend of 20 cents a share.The value of the stock shot up in March \u2014 from $9.50 to $11 \u2014 when Sanu signed a five-year, $32.5 million contract with the Falcons.To the Falcons, part of Sanu\u2019s value is providing Ryan an alternative to Jones, who is often heavily covered. Thanks in part to all the attention Jones receives, Sanu caught 59 passes for 653 yards and four touchdowns this season.\u201cYou\u2019ve got Julio, you\u2019ve got Sanu, and you\u2019ve got Matt spreading the ball everywhere,\u201d Falcons defensive end Dwight Freeney said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to play all of them.\u201dEarly in the game on Sunday, Ryan zeroed in on Sanu, who caught five passes for 52 yards. The biggest catch came on the opening drive when Ryan, under pressure, flipped a 2-yard pass to Sanu, who caught the ball with his right hand and fell to the ground in the end zone for the first score of the day.\u201cIt was Matt being Matt,\u201d Sanu said.Coach Dan Quinn said he appreciates having so many offensive weapons.\u201cThat\u2019s a special guy and he came up big,\u201d he said. \u201cJulio does his thing, but Sanu does his thing, too, and we need it. We need all of that.\u201dEven if the Super Bowl does not provide a bump in Sanu\u2019s stock price, the Super Bowl will provide him with an additional payday. The winners each receive $107,000, and the losers $53,000 apiece.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At BlackRock, Dip in 2016 Profit Reflects Shift to Lower-Cost Funds", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byEarnings per share for the year fell 2 percent, to $19.29.For the asset management giant, the last quarter of 2016 was a continuation of a long-term trend: While investors poured money into the firm\u2019s family of exchange-traded funds, they withdrew assets from BlackRock\u2019s actively managed stock funds, which, in tune with the broader industry, have been lagging their benchmarks.BlackRock\u2019s assets under management finished the year at $5.1 trillion, compared with $4.6 trillion in 2015.Its stock and bond E.T.F.s, which trade under the iShares brand name, took in $140 billion of investor money in 2016. The funds track a variety of indexes and charge fees that are substantially lower than those of traditional mutual funds, something that has added to their appeal in recent years.BlackRock now oversees $1.2 trillion in E.T.F.s, compared with $1 trillion in 2015, and leads the market by a large margin in this regard.In an interview, Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock\u2019s chief executive, said inflows of investor money to the firm rose sharply in the weeks after the election, which, he said, was the result of retail and institutional investors shifting money from cash into stocks.And while he said the stock market received a lift from promises Donald J. Trump made in terms of cutting taxes and getting the government to spend more, he offered words of caution about the Trump effect on the global economy.\u201cIf you are a diversified global investor, bonds have fallen since the election and, in dollar terms, lots of international investments are down,\u201d said Mr. Fink, referring to the bond sell-off and the strong performance of the dollar. \u201cPeople are so euphoric about U.S. stocks, but people with broader portfolios have not done that well.\u201dMr. Fink has been named to a panel of corporate chief executives who will be advising Mr. Trump on financial and economic policies, with the first meeting expected to be held in Washington sometime next month.Investor money is going into E.T.F.s that follow the main equity benchmarks. While the $14 billion that investors pulled from BlackRock\u2019s other retail and institutional equity funds last year is small compared with the $5.1 trillion that the firm now manages, the outflows \u2014 and the mediocre performance of these funds \u2014 highlights a major challenge for Mr. Fink, the firm\u2019s founder.The firm\u2019s fast-growing E.T.F. business, as well as its Aladdin platform, which provides risk oversight services to a growing number of investment firms, are substantially outpacing BlackRock\u2019s more traditional stock-picking business.Mr. Fink recently hired an executive to oversee BlackRock\u2019s equity investments, Mark D. Wiseman, who will focus on these performance challenges.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Fight Trump Faces Over Drug Prices", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump has made it clear that he thinks drug prices are too high and that the pharmaceutical industry, as he put it at a news conference this month, is \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201dHe joins a host of lawmakers and others who have excoriated drug makers in recent years for high-priced drugs that are out of the reach of many Americans. On Monday, Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, reaffirmed that the issue would be a priority.One of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals \u2014 to force drug makers to bid for the right to sell their products to Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 has repeatedly failed to attract enough support in Congress, especially among his fellow Republicans.Removing that prohibition is a favorite cause of liberal politicians like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but it has been opposed by the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans, including Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the nominee for secretary of health and human services.Whether freeing the government to negotiate on drug prices would lower costs, however, is anything but clear. And its chances of passing a Republican-led Congress are even less so.Medicare did not cover prescription drugs until 2006, after Congress expanded the program to add a drug benefit, known as Part D. But the measure included something called the noninterference clause, which was backed by the pharmaceutical industry and prevented the federal government from negotiating directly with drug makers.This prohibition does not mean that pharmaceutical companies can set any price they want. Privately run prescription drug programs, which control the benefits for large groups of Medicare beneficiaries, negotiate on the government\u2019s behalf. These programs are run by the same companies \u2014 including Express Scripts, CVS and UnitedHealth \u2014 that manage the drug plans for large employers and insurers.\u201cYou get your largest negotiating power from your ability to walk away,\u201d said Dr. Aaron S. Kesselheim, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who has written frequently on drug prices.Even if Medicare were to remove those protections and agree to cover fewer drugs \u2014 a politically unpopular move that has failed in the past \u2014 drug companies might find ways to make up the financial losses, said Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, a consulting firm that works for drug companies, hospitals, insurers and others.Today\u2019s most expensive drugs typically treat rare conditions, like cystic fibrosis and certain types of cancer, for which there are few options. In those cases, drug companies hold the bargaining power, no matter who is on the other side of the table.\u201cI worry that if you force one price across the market, you may well end up with a higher price in noncompetitive categories than you would otherwise,\u201d Mr. Mendelson said.And even if the negotiating ban were lifted, the United States would still not have the same clout as, say, Britain, whose universal health care coverage makes the government the country\u2019s only buyer of drugs.Some worry that if the United States government were to significantly lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, pharmaceutical companies would respond by raising prices for the millions of people insured through large employers or private insurers. Others contend that if the prices negotiated by Medicare were public, the transparency could level the playing field and lower prices across the board.It seems unlikely, given that Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\u201cIt\u2019s been a nonstarter with Republicans, and it\u2019s the traditionally Democratic talking point,\u201d said Alana Dovner, a research analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors, which advises investors on developments in Washington. \u201cSomething as dramatic as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices \u2014 that would be such a radical change, and so opposite the traditional Republican health care policies, that it just seems unfathomable at this point.\u201d\u201cYou are by definition saying yes to some drugs and no to others,\u201d Mr. Mendelson said. He called that position politically dangerous, saying it would be denounced as \u201cgovernment practice of medicine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Rare Corner of Finance Where Women Dominate", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byOnce a year, a small group of executives who control trillions of dollars in American companies meet for lunch in Manhattan. Among the things they discuss: pushing for greater say in how companies are run.It is an elite gathering, but you will not see a single man in a suit in the room. The event, called the Women in Governance lunch, underscores a rare corner in finance where women dominate.Women hold the top positions in corporate governance at many of the biggest mutual funds and pension funds \u2014 deciding which way to vote on the directors of a company board. They make decisions on behalf of teachers, government workers, doctors and most people in the United States who have a 401(k). The corporate governance heads at seven of the 10 largest institutional investors in stocks are now women, according to data compiled by The New York Times. Those investors oversee $14 trillion in assets.Corporate governance is playing a growing role within the broader ecosystem of corporate America. Each spring, publicly traded companies hold shareholder meetings and outline business strategy for the coming year. Shareholders like BlackRock, T. Rowe Price and State Street vote on corporate strategy and issues including company board appointments and compensation.Their votes can go a long way, given the huge stakes these institutions control in United States companies. BlackRock holds a stake greater than 5 percent in 75 of the 100 largest companies, according to data compiled by Jerry Davis, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. State Street has more than than 5 percent of 23 of the largest companies, while Capital Group owns more than 5 percent of 20 of the biggest companies.That power, however, is rarely wielded to confront companies. Most of the time, these huge institutional investors choose to vote with management.And their approach contrasts sharply with that of brash activist billionaires like William A. Ackman and Daniel S. Loeb, who have made a name for themselves as corporate agitators. These investors bring about change by theatrically pounding on the front doors of companies and using the public court of opinion to bully companies into changing their strategies.Still, the heads of corporate governance at institutional giants say they are working quietly behind the scenes to advocate for greater shareholder rights.Now, Ms. Anderson\u2019s team is weighing whether to create a similar policy for gender diversity on corporate boards.\u201cWe have an interest in seeing more women on boards because there is data that a more diverse board makes better decisions,\u201d said Ms. Anderson, who was at Invesco before T. Rowe Price and has been working in the field of corporate governance for two decades.Efforts by mutual funds to change the behavior of a company by using the power of a proxy vote is a fairly recent phenomenon. For decades, powerful institutional investors automatically rubber-stamped the decisions of corporate management and boards. At the same, many top executives paid little attention to the concerns of their shareholders.\u201cMany years ago, for every 10 letters we wrote, we generally heard back from half,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cNow it\u2019s 100 percent.\u201d Today, companies in which T. Rowe Price holds a large stake will even reach out to the firm unprompted.The 2008 financial crisis was a turning point for shareholders, said Anne Sheehan, the director of corporate governance at California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the public pension fund.Ms. Sheehan joined the pension fund, Calstrs, in October 2008, in the depths of the financial crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. \u201cTalk about hitting the ground running and seeing what the impact of that crisis was doing to our portfolio,\u201d she said.The experience was an eye-opener. \u201cI saw it as an opportunity to make our voices known in the debate,\u201d Ms. Sheehan said. \u201cWhat were these directors doing on our behalf? How could shareholders speak up?\u201dThe crisis, she added, \u201creally brought home the prevalence of the \u2018Old Boys Network\u2019 inside the board rooms of these financial firms which resulted in too much group think.\u201dThe corporate governance team at Calstrs regularly questions companies on a range of issues including gender diversity and the pay gap between the top executives at a company and the most junior employees. Having women in positions of governance has helped bring these issues to the forefront of the discussion at companies, Ms. Sheehan said.\u201cIt reminded me of the old adage: If you want to get something done, put a woman in charge,\u201d she added.At BlackRock, Michelle Edkins and her team of 30 analyze whether certain corporate directors are being paid too much and whether they have overstayed their terms. If there is a problem, they begin by opening a dialogue with the company.Ms. Edkins, who trained as an economist in New Zealand and took her first position in corporate governance in 1997 by answering an ad in The Financial Times, said women tended to be less confrontational than men, making it easier to address a problem and try to fix it in this way.\u201cWe don\u2019t meet with C.E.O.s and tell them how to remedy the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a stylistic difference and my observation is that this constructive challenge comes more naturally to women.\u201dBut to some critics, this approach is not yielding change fast enough.BlackRock\u2019s track record on voting against corporate management reveals that it is taking a slower approach to pushing for change. For example, on the issue of executive pay, during the most recent reporting period ending on June 30, BlackRock voted 96.3 percent of the time to support compensation policies across the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, according to Proxy Insight.It also voted against every shareholder proposal relating to diversity, environment, governance and social concerns over the last year, according to Proxy Insight.The record is not much better at other top institutional investors.Nick Dawson, a co-founder of Proxy Insight, said that while investors treat issues related to environmental, social and governance policies, known in industry parlance as E.S.G., very seriously, \u201cthere is a clear preference for behind-the-scenes engagement on these issues.\u201d \u201cAsset managers prefer to ensure that management teams are capable of dealing with E.S.G. issues in-house, rather than by applying external pressure,\u201d he said.Still, BlackRock said that it voted against pay practices or compensation committee members at 10 of the 50 companies where executives were paid the most during the most recent reporting period.And other investors like the activist hedge fund Elliott Management said that it had become much easier to engage with companies.\u201cWhen an activist shows up to a situation, having these engaged, thoughtful leaders involved in the discussion helps the company and the activist get to a collaborative solution,\u201d said Jesse Cohn, the head of United States equity activism at Elliott. This, he added, happens \u201cwell in advance of a proxy contest.\u201dThere is concern that on the subject of gender, women are less likely to push for greater diversity. Some women in high-power corporate governance positions said that they preferred not to bring up gender as an issue in discussions with management on concern they will be perceived to have an agenda.But some experts say there is tremendous potential for the network of women in corporate governance to make a bigger difference.\u201cIf there is an old girls\u2019 network so to speak with so much authority in corporate governance, this is an opportunity to create an agenda for greater diversity through a formalized means,\u201d said Mr. Davis, at the University of Michigan.While women like Ms. Edkins are fighting behind the scenes to bring more women onto the boards of America\u2019s biggest companies, they are struggling with an entirely different diversity challenge of their own: the lack of men in the field of corporate governance.\u201cIt\u2019s counterintuitive in finance,\u201d Ms. Edkins said. \u201cBut when we are hiring, we need to really push that diversity to make sure we have men on the slate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Markets Are Coping (for Now) With Blows to Unity in Europe", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byLosing one referendum crucial to the future of Europe may be regarded as misfortune, but, as Oscar Wilde might say, losing two looks like carelessness. Europe\u2019s leaders are looking careless after forcing votes in Britain and Italy that went the wrong way, from their perspective, within less than six months.But you would barely realize that any of that happened, judging by the performance of European markets.Popular exchange-traded funds, like Vanguard FTSE Europe and iShares Europe, lost 3.9 percent and 3.2 percent on the year, although dividend payments meant that shareholders just about broke even.European government bond yields have soared since the so-called Brexit vote, but they were still down for all of 2016, which means that bond prices, which move in the opposite direction, rose.The markets are taking political developments in stride, but that may not last. For while the people have spoken, they are not about to pipe down soon; national elections are scheduled this year in the two most important European Union states: Germany and France.There are populist parties on the ballot in each that could achieve enough support to ruffle the markets. Many Europeans are frustrated with decades of economic stagnation exacerbated by a failure by leaders to confront barriers to prosperity like high taxes and rigid labor markets. With so much at stake, investment advisers warn, it would be foolish to downplay the dangers.Europe is suffering from \u201cthe rise of populist backlash against the establishment,\u201d said Paul O\u2019Connor, head of multiasset for Henderson Global Investors, a British company that manages $12.5 billion in assets in American mutual funds. \u201cIt feels as if it\u2019s in its infancy, and it\u2019s going to overshadow the next few years quite significantly.\u201dPopulist governments often spend lots of money on infrastructure projects and other programs intended to curry favor with the public, market strategists say. That enhances growth in the short run, and it may provide a notable boost for Europe by accelerating a nascent trend away from the austerity that many governments imposed during the debt crisis a few years ago.But the spending programs are often financed with borrowed money, something that Europe owes plenty of already, and the damage from the added debt usually outweighs and outlasts the benefits from the growth. Stock buyers lately seem to be focusing on the positive growth factors, while bond sellers are looking further ahead.\u201cTypically, when a populist government gets elected, one of the first things it does is fiscal expansion\u201d to promote job growth and voter confidence, said Markus Stadlmann, chief investment officer of Lloyds Private Bank. \u201cWhat happens in the next phase of fiscal expansion is that it\u2019s financed by government borrowing.\u201d President-elect Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain have proposed programs of one sort or another that would serve this purpose, Mr. Stadlmann said.When the bill comes due, it is often in the form of higher interest rates or higher inflation. At that stage, he warned, \u201cgovernment is less in control, the deficit deteriorates, government spending is unsustainable, wages fall in real terms and there are capital outflows. That\u2019s one of the reasons the bond rout has been really intense.\u201dAnother populist impulse that should worry investors is protectionism through tariffs or other curbs on foreign goods. The aim is to protect jobs, but most economists say that constraining trade limits competition and leads to higher consumer prices.One concern about Brexit is that Britain will lose access to the free-trade zone within Europe. Not only might British merchandise be hit with tariffs, but British companies might also have to pay more for European goods used in manufacturing.Mr. Stadlmann called the potential for trade disruptions \u201ca big risk.\u201dA potentially (if, at the moment, unlikely) catastrophic economic event that investment advisers say is not accounted for in asset prices is the departure from the European Union, or at least the euro, of the one indispensable member: Germany.If Germans wanted to leave the union \u2014 say, because of disenchantment with the influx of migrants or the assistance provided to weaker member states \u2014 it could do so. Germany has a more robust economy than its neighbors, and it runs a large current-account surplus with the world outside Europe (more money comes in than goes out), so it could replace the euro with a stronger currency, reducing the country\u2019s debt burden, whereas a weaker country that left the eurozone might risk default.If Germany left, \u201cthe E.U. would be severely wounded, at best,\u201d said William Porter, global credit strategist for Credit Suisse, adding, \u201cPolitics in the periphery is not what\u2019s going to drive\u201d developments in Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s the core.\u201dMr. Stadlmann expressed similar thoughts, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not Spain and Italy that are different in the E.U., it\u2019s Germany.\u201d He added that he is \u201cnot very negative on the E.U. holding together at the moment.\u201dWhat investment advisers are very negative on when they consider the impact of rising populism is European bonds.\u201cThe re-pricing in government bonds is incomplete,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Connor at Henderson, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s plausible the bull market in fixed-income has come to an end.\u201dMr. Stadlmann likewise noted that the reversal of bond yields is \u201ccontinuing and gaining speed.\u201d As for other assets, he encourages being \u201cvery, very selective.\u201d In particular, he favors stocks of German retailers and real estate companies.John Maxwell, manager of the Ivy International Core Equity Fund, is more optimistic on European stocks, especially on multinational companies that are cheaper than rivals based elsewhere and that are comparatively immune to politics.\u201cIf something goes wrong, it doesn\u2019t mean Procter & Gamble is going to do better than Unilever selling detergent in Italy,\u201d he said.Unilever is one portfolio holding that illustrates his point. Others are the energy company Total, British American Tobacco, the health care concern Smith & Nephew and Reckitt Benckiser, which makes household goods.Mr. O\u2019Connor of Henderson prefers market segments that do well when inflation rises, including financial services and economically cyclical sectors like natural resources and consumer discretionary.

{"Headline": "Jared Kushner Will Sell Many of His Assets, but Ethics Lawyers Worry", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byBut because he plans to sell to his brother or to a family trust controlled by his mother, some ethics lawyers interviewed questioned how meaningful the divestiture would be.Jamie S. Gorelick, a lawyer who is advising Mr. Kushner on how to deal with the ethical issues he will have to navigate while advising Mr. Trump on topics that could affect his bottom line, said Mr. Kushner would sell his interest in about 35 investments, including his family\u2019s flagship office tower on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. He also plans to restructure his role in his remaining holdings so he will not be involved in managing them, Ms. Gorelick said.In addition, she said, he will sell his common stocks; resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, his family business; and sell The New York Observer. He will also recuse himself from decisions that could affect his remaining holdings, as well as those of his wife, Ivanka Trump. \u201cHe will be treated as any other person entering public service,\u201d said Ms. Gorelick, a partner at WilmerHale and a deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton.Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, said that, ideally, the transactions would be independent of the person selling the asset.But as outlined by Ms. Gorelick, Mr. Sanderson said, the plan falls short of that standard. Not only does Mr. Kushner intend to sell the assets to his brother, Joshua, a venture capitalist, and to a trust controlled by his mother, Seryl, but his mother and siblings are the beneficiaries of the trust.\u201cIt sounds like a shell game to me,\u201d Mr. Sanderson said.Even with these measures, Mr. Kushner will still have links to his family\u2019s empire, which owns property across the country and relies on often-opaque foreign money.The negotiations began about six months ago, around the time Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. While the family trust will take over Mr. Kushner\u2019s stake in the building, the value of his interest and other details of the transaction are not known. And as a White House adviser on issues including trade, he is likely to counsel the president on America\u2019s relationship with China.People close to Mr. Kushner and his wife have repeatedly highlighted the income they will be sacrificing; Ms. Gorelick said Ms. Trump would remove herself from management roles at the Trump Organization and at her apparel and licensing companies. She will draw income in fixed payments from the Trump Organization, so her salary will not fluctuate based on deals that could relate directly to new federal laws or decisions by her father\u2019s administration.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that there isn\u2019t an argument on the other side,\u201d Ms. Gorelick said. \u201cI just think we have the better argument.\u201dRichard W. Painter, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota and a chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump and his team deserved credit for bringing Mr. Kushner on as an employee, rather than as an informal adviser not subject to criminal conflict-of-interest rules.Mr. Painter noted that the trust was irrevocable, meaning it cannot be modified without the permission of the beneficiaries. He also said it was a positive sign that Mr. Kushner\u2019s wife and young children were not beneficiaries. However, other relatives are.\u201cThere will be appearance issues, and you need to make sure this is not a wink-wink, nod-nod issue,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans\u2019 Paths to Unraveling the Dodd-Frank Act", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump took aim at financial regulations and other federal rules on Monday, signing an executive order to trim back the federal regulatory thicket and promising to do \u201ca big number\u201d on Obama-era Wall Street restrictions.At the same time, congressional Republicans opened their own front against the Dodd-Frank Act, the law that overhauled financial regulation after the 2008 financial crisis. And with Mr. Trump in the White House, Republicans who previously challenged Dodd-Frank now see success in their sights after years of futility.\u201cDodd-Frank is a disaster,\u201d the president declared during a 10-minute session with reporters as he signed an unrelated executive order that could reduce other types of government regulations.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing a big number on Dodd-Frank,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cThe American dream is back.\u201dIn reality, the president cannot unravel Dodd-Frank with a stroke of a pen, and congressional Republicans will find it easier to chip away at the law than to repeal it altogether.Defanging Dodd-Frank, a sweeping law that created a consumer protection agency and reined in mortgage practices and derivatives trading, would also seem to contradict Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-Wall Street language from the campaign trail. His closing campaign ad, which lamented a \u201cglobal power structure\u201d and a \u201ccorrupt machine,\u201d flashed an image of Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs.But the president has spoken out against Dodd-Frank, claiming that eliminating it would benefit working people, even as he stocks his administration with former Goldman executives and billionaires.His allies in Congress began their legislative assault on Dodd-Frank on Monday, introducing a measure to repeal a Securities and Exchange Commission regulation that requires oil companies to publicly disclose payments they make to governments when developing resources around the world. The regulation was tangential to Dodd-Frank\u2019s mission of reforming Wall Street but was included as a bipartisan effort intended to shine a light on potential bribes.This effort is just the beginning. House Republicans are also moving bolder legislation that would repeal crucial provisions of Dodd-Frank, including the so-called Volcker rule, which prevents banks from making risky bets with their own money. And they are exploring ways to use the budget process to potentially defund some of the law\u2019s most contentious provisions.Still, each strategy has its limits. The House legislation to repeal Dodd-Frank could stall in the Senate, where it needs 60 votes. And even though the Congressional Review Act requires only a majority of lawmakers to repeal a rule, only 10 or so Dodd-Frank rules are vulnerable to this process.\u201cIt is the height of hypocrisy for Republicans to now be wasting time attacking rules signed by the former president, which went through a rigorous vetting process,\u201d said Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York, the top Democrat on the rules committee.Even the president\u2019s latest executive order could have a minor impact.The order says each new rule must be offset by regulatory cuts that save at least twice as much money. It also instructs the Office of Management and Budget to set annual limits on the total cost of rules issued by each department. For the current year, the limit is set at zero.\u201cThis will be the largest cut ever, by far, in terms of regulation,\u201d Mr. Trump said hyperbolically.But the order does not apply to independent agencies like the Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, limiting its effect on financial regulation. Independent agencies could choose to comply but are unlikely to do so while under the leadership of people appointed by President Obama.In addition, the order includes a broad exemption for \u201cemergencies and other circumstances.\u201dDespite the obstacles, there are a number of different tactics that Republicans can use to try to dismantle Dodd-Frank.Dodd-Frank opponents owe Newt Gingrich a debt of gratitude.The Congressional Review Act, passed some 20 years ago as part of his Contract With America, provides lawmakers at least 60 days to introduce legislation disapproving major new regulations. The lawmakers can ultimately repeal the regulations with support from just a majority of lawmakers and the president. The Congressional Research Service has determined that rules sent to Congress on or after June 13 of last year are vulnerable to repeal.Until now, the Congressional Review Act was not much of a weapon. It has led to a repeal measure being signed into law only once, in 2001, when Republicans and President George W. Bush wiped out workplace safety regulations adopted near the end of President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration.But Republicans have identified dozens of potential rules to override, some of which arose from Dodd-Frank, according to congressional documents reviewed by The New York Times.Republicans can target a derivatives rule adopted last year by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule for prepaid debit cards and a rule approved by banking regulators that imposed capital requirements for banks that trade derivatives. The threat also applies to any unfinished rules that the consumer bureau completes, including its looming crackdown on payday lending.The S.E.C. oil-payment rule is the first of five Obama administration rules scheduled to be challenged this week. The House rules committee advanced the legislation to repeal that rule on Monday over the objections of the panel\u2019s Democrats, who argued that Republicans were misusing the Congressional Review Act to undermine Dodd-Frank.The oil-disclosure policy has already had a tortured history. The S.E.C. completed the rule in 2012, with the support of antipoverty groups like Oxfam and the One Campaign, but the American Petroleum Institute, the trade group representing Exxon Mobil and other oil companies, sued the agency and won.In 2013, a federal judge in the District of Columbia vacated the rule. It took the S.E.C. another three years to redo the rule, which it finally did in June of last year, opening it to Republican attack under the Congressional Review Act.\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is responding to a narrow interest within the industry that is trying to be secretive,\u201d said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who sponsored the amendment in Dodd-Frank along with former Senator Richard Lugar, a Republican.If the Congressional Review Act is a scalpel, then the Financial Choice Act is a sledgehammer.The legislation, introduced last summer by Representative Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, represents the most comprehensive response to Dodd-Frank yet.The bill would repeal the Volcker rule as well as the so-called Durbin amendment, which set a limit on fees retailers are charged for debit card transactions. It would replace Dodd-Frank with a more flexible regulatory structure.After a false start under President Obama, Mr. Hensarling\u2019s plan to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank could gain new life from Mr. Trump.\u201cRepublicans on the Financial Services Committee are eager to work with the president and his administration to unclog the arteries of our financial system so the lifeblood of capital can flow more freely and create jobs,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said in a statement.He hopes to pass the bill this year \u2014 with his committee expected to take it up in the coming weeks \u2014 but that is no sure thing.For one thing, the deep-pocketed banking lobby is not unanimous in its support of Mr. Hensarling, a Texan with a populist streak whose plan is arguably more geared toward small banks than big ones. Many of the biggest banks, creatures of habit that have already adjusted to much of Dodd-Frank, would prefer specific accommodations, rather than wholesale repeal of the law.Mr. Hensarling\u2019s plan would also need to merge with legislation offered by Senate Republicans. And even then, they would need some Democrats to reach 60 votes.House Democrats have vowed to fight Mr. Hensarling.\u201cThis bill is so bad that it simply cannot be fixed,\u201d Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on Mr. Hensarling\u2019s committee, said of his bill last year.If his straightforward legislation stalls, Mr. Hensarling may find comfort in the minutiae of the budget reconciliation process.In the next six weeks or so, his committee is required to submit its \u201cbudget views\u201d for 2018 to the House Budget Committee. In this document, Mr. Hensarling is expected to recommend a number of measures that could rein in some core aspects of Dodd-Frank.For example, he will most likely recommend replacing regulators\u2019 authority to wind down troubled banks with a new chapter of the bankruptcy code. He also could tinker with the funding for two bodies that Republicans love to hate: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a collective of regulators who monitor threats to the financial system.By subjecting these bodies to the congressional appropriations process, rather than a dedicated funding mechanism, Congress may be able to cut their funding.It is unclear whether this plan will gain traction with congressional leaders.While Congress is busy fighting Dodd-Frank, the Trump administration\u2019s financial regulators may prove that less is more.Wall Street is hoping that with new leaders at the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, regulators may allow some leeway for violations of the Volcker rule and other regulations.And while most of Dodd-Frank has been completed, there are rules left to set, including restrictions on executive compensation. Under the Trump administration, those rules may remain unfinished business.Stacy Cowley, Emmarie Huetteman and Glenn Thrush contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

If trades can occur outside the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. market hours, then why not extend the trading hours altogether, or allow for 24/7 trading?\u201d_____Suppose you grow vegetables and want to sell your produce at a local farmers\u2019 market. Would you just show up any old day and time and hope for the best? Nah, you\u2019d look at the designated hours that the farmers\u2019 market is open, and only go then, when you know that customers will be around. The reason any marketplace sets hours is so that buyers and sellers know when to show up. And the same is true for financial markets.In the old days, showing up at the same time was more obviously necessary \u2014 the traders at the New York Stock Exchange needed to be physically in the same place to buy and sell shares. But even now that most trades happen electronically, it benefits everyone if the exchange sets certain hours as the business day, so that buyers and sellers know exactly when everyone else will be ready to buy and sell. (For the New York Stock Exchange, those hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.)In response to new technologies and increased demands (particularly global demands), the stock market began offering extended hours that now allow you to trade shares as early as 4 a.m. and as late as 6:30 p.m. \u2014 but there are fewer buyers and sellers at those times. Most traders are busy having dinner with their spouses or asleep or whatever. So even small orders can distort the price; trying to sell just a few thousand shares of a stock might make its price plummet in after-hours trading, whereas, during the trading day, a similar order might find a buyer without affecting the price much at all.In other words, there\u2019s nothing to stop you now from trading late at night or early in the morning \u2014 except that you may find it\u2019s as lonely as an off-hours farmers\u2019 market.Have a question for Ask The Times?

{"Headline": "Taking the Long View Paid Off in the Short Term, Too", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byPatience paid dividends for three of the top-performing mutual funds of the fourth quarter.The managers of the trio \u2014 the Matthew 25 fund, the Hotchkis & Wiley Small Cap Value fund and the Oakmark Global fund \u2014 cling to investments longer than competitors. Their turnover ratios \u2014 the percentage of holdings they replace each year \u2014 are lower than average. The typical actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar sloughs nearly 65 percent of its portfolio annually. Not one of these three hits that rate.Like Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor who leads Berkshire, Mr. Mullholland started out as a hard-core value hound; he sought stocks that were selling for far less than his estimate of their worth. But, he said, he concluded early on that the best companies also had the potential to grow in the long term and that an investor often had to pay more for them.\u201cYou make money by buying the exceptional \u2014 an exceptional business, exceptional management or an exceptional price,\u201d he said. These days, Mr. Mulholland calls himself a \u201cprice-conscious\u201d purchaser of both value and growth stocks.Consider Goldman Sachs Group, which was recently the fund\u2019s top holding. Its shares, like those of many companies, had lagged in some years since the financial crisis. But Mr. Mulholland said he saw an exceptional business \u2014 \u201cthe premier financial brand in the world.\u201d When he bought in, the stock was trading at what he deemed a discount. It returned nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter.Mr. Mulholland likes to stick with winners and will let them swell into a sizable stake. Goldman recently accounted for 9 percent of his fund\u2019s assets, and several years ago Apple was nearly 18 percent. It\u2019s now also about 9 percent.He runs the fund out of a small office in suburban Philadelphia, and he and his wife are its biggest shareholders, he said. \u201cI invest for myself and whoever wants to ride along with me.\u201dMatthew 25, with an expense ratio of 1.06 percent, returned 19.3 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 3.8 percent for the S.&P. 500.Mr. Miles said he and Mr. Green had learned, in 20 years of running the fund together, that many investors will take \u201cwhatever current earnings are, good or bad, and extrapolate them to an unreasonable level.\u201d Thus good news can lead to irrational exuberance, and bad news to unjustified avoidance. \u201cIf the market says this company is underperforming and will underperform forever, that\u2019s often an opportunity,\u201d he said.That kind of thinking had prevailed, Mr. Miles said, with financial companies, which, as a group, accounted for about a third of the fund\u2019s assets on Nov. 30. \u201cBanks haven\u2019t been given much hope since the financial crisis, and their earnings haven\u2019t been spectacular. So they\u2019ve been inexpensive, relative to the market,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been improving their capital position \u2014 they\u2019re fundamentally less risky. And with the new administration coming in, there\u2019s potential that some of the regulatory regime will relax. That would allow them to generate greater returns on capital, which would improve earnings.\u201dExpectations that President-elect Donald J. Trump will bring different policy priorities to Washington may have also given a lift to private prison companies, Mr. Miles said. The GEO Group, a prison operator based in Florida, was another recent winner for the fund and is a top holding.\u201cThe private prison industry is the low-cost source of supply,\u201d Mr. Miles said. \u201cIf there\u2019s more immigration enforcement, you\u2019d think there\u2019s going to be additional demand.\u201dThe managers of the Hotchkis & Wiley fund neither favor nor shun any particular sector or industry. They will consider any small-cap company that has a strong balance sheet and \u201cimportance to its customers\u2019 success or the broader economy,\u201d Mr. Miles said. The fund returned 17.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Its A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.29 percent.Mr. Coniaris said that three tenets unify the investment approach of all the funds in the Oakmark lineup. They invest in shares trading at discounts to the fund managers\u2019 estimates of their intrinsic value. The stocks\u2019 issuers must show \u201ca clear path to growing per-share value over time,\u201d he said. And their management teams must \u201cthink and act like owners.\u201dHe added that, when valuing stocks, Oakmark doesn\u2019t just seek statistical cheapness, such as a low price-earnings multiple. Its fund managers and analysts dig deeper. That can lead them to picks like Alphabet, which may seem unusual for a value hunter.When valuing the stock, the Oakmark team members made several adjustments, Mr. Coniaris said. They subtracted the company\u2019s big hoard of cash. They also factored out its money-losing \u201cmoonshot investments,\u201d like its effort to develop a driverless car. And they estimated that the market had misunderstood the value of YouTube, the company\u2019s video-streaming service.\u201cIf YouTube were to monetize its viewership like a cable company, it could be worth roughly $300 a share,\u201d Mr. Coniaris said. Alphabet has lately traded above $800.\u201cThe way we see it is, if you back out all that stuff, you\u2019re getting the core search business at a big discount.\u201dMr. Coniaris\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.17 percent, returned 7.6 percent for the quarter. The fund\u2019s sibling, Oakmark Global Select, also thrived in the quarter, returning 7.4 percent. The duo\u2019s holdings overlap, but Global Select is more concentrated, with only 20 holdings, while Global has 35.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Frontier Airlines Is Said to Hire Banks to Plan Stock Debut", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byWarren E. Buffett recently revealed a willingness to invest in airlines after years of shunning them, and ever since, those stocks have soared. Now, one more company is aiming to be added to the list of publicly traded airlines.Frontier Airlines \u2014 known for offering scant legroom and low prices for rides on planes that have wild animals painted on the tails \u2014 is preparing an initial public offering, people with knowledge of the deal said. The Denver-based company has tapped Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Evercore to manage the debut, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private information.Frontier is aiming to raise about $500 million in the deal, the people said. That would imply a valuation for the company of about $2 billion. Frontier had an official \u201cbake off,\u201d where banks were interviewed for a role in the offering, late last year, one of the people said.Like the history of many airlines, Frontier\u2019s is winding. The airline was founded in the 1990s after Continental Airlines shuttered its Denver hub. It has reorganized and gone through bankruptcy and has had several owners. The latest owner is the investment firm Indigo Partners, which is run by Bill Franke, who is credited with being the chairman who turned around Spirit Airlines, another no-frills airline. He has been shifting Frontier toward the Spirit model.Such no-frills models have proven a profitable way to go, especially for airlines competing with larger American carriers that have undergone rampant consolidation over the past decade. Frontier has also been capitalizing on low fuel prices, which has enabled it to expand its fleet.But if Frontier does go public, it may not stay an independent company for long.Mr. Franke could be described as an airline legend. In addition to being the chairman of Frontier, he is the managing partner of Indigo, a private-equity firm focused on transportation. He also served as the chairman and chief executive of America West Airlines.Spirit Airlines has enjoyed a remarkable year of trading in the stock market. Its shares have jumped 45 percent, and the company commands a market valuation of $4 billion.While Spirit was not among the airlines that Mr. Buffett chose to invest in, shares of those companies have also climbed.Since it became public in mid-November that Mr. Buffett had taken stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Continental Holdings and Southwest Airlines, shares of each of them gained at least 6.9 percent.If the company is still profitable, that may be enticing to investors who have seen little in the way of new issues over the last few years. In 2016, there were fewer initial offerings listed on American exchanges than in any year since 2009.If there is anything Mr. Buffett has disliked more than airlines over the years, it is I.P.O.s. So his participation is unlikely if and when the shares begin trading.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump May Not Like Alternative Energy, but Investors Should", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersGIVEN what President-elect Donald J. Trump has said about his energy strategy \u2014 he favors coal and wants to end federal subsidies to the clean energy industry \u2014 does it still make sense to invest in wind, solar and other alternative sources of power?The answer is an emphatic yes, according to investment advisers, who say clean energy companies will continue to thrive during a Trump administration, regardless of what the president says or does. The sector has become as much about getting returns on investments and catching the next technological boom as it is about reducing greenhouse gases and helping the environment.And clean energy is creating jobs in every state, not just the ones that have oil or gas in the ground. Even the most politically conservative states, like Kansas and Iowa, are leaders in wind power and are likely to continue investing in it.\u201cNo longer is there a trade-off between what you believe in and what you can make money off of,\u201d said Nancy Pfund, a founder and managing partner of DBL Partners, which made early investments in SolarCity and Tesla.She predicts that investors \u201care going to redouble their efforts to migrate their portfolios to a 21st-century energy economy.\u201d Even without subsidies, she said, alternative energy sources will be well positioned to compete with coal and other carbon spewers.\u201cIt really has to do with the cost of wind, solar and electric cars compared to where we were 12 years ago,\u201d Ms. Pfund said.But the challenge for all investors during the Trump administration and beyond will be to make sure that passions for change and innovation, or anger at environmental policies that favor fossil fuels, do not cloud sound investment analysis.\u201cRecently, people have taken the green mandate and said, \u2018You need to invest in the future,\u2019\u201d said Chat Reynders, the chief executive and chairman of Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, a $1.3 billion asset-management firm. \u201cPeople have chased some investments that weren\u2019t timely or were not quality investments in order to participate.\u201dFor example, back in the 1970s, some investors were eager to back manufacturers of solar panels. But what was then a cutting-edge technology with high barriers to entry is now a commodity, with prices dropping as more manufacturers enter the market. This is good for the consumer, but not great for investors in the panel makers.\u201cYou can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle when it comes to the economics driving solar, wind and battery storage,\u201d said Thomas Van Dyck, managing director in the SRI Wealth Management Group at RBC Wealth Management.\u201cThe economics are such that in California, wind and solar are the cheapest form of power you can put in place,\u201d Mr. Van Dyck said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a long-term investor, you need to look at these long-term trends.\u201dDespite the economic forces lining up behind clean energy, investors and analysts caution that people interested in investing in this area should be prepared for a rough ride in the short term.\u201cIf you\u2019re a long-term investor and looking out five to 10 years, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Mr. Van Dyck said. \u201cIt\u2019s like looking at Intel or Microsoft in the 1990s \u2014 they had some cyclical issues, but look at them today.\u201dR. Paul Herman, the chief executive of HIP Investor, an investment rater and portfolio manager, said investors looking for broad guidance should keep three things in mind. They should look for companies that are trying to save money and reduce risk through clean energy. This is the Walmart example.They should monitor their investments in fossil-fuel producers closely, lest their stocks plummet again as renewable energy gets cheaper and the value of their reserves diminishes. And those with a longer-term investment horizon and a higher tolerance for risk should look for companies focused on energy innovations.The last is the holy grail. Ms. Pfund\u2019s firm, DBL Partners, had great success investing in Tesla and SolarCity, but she said she was not looking to mimic those investments today.\u201cThe last thing I\u2019m going to do is keep investing in the same old, same old,\u201d she said. \u201cThe venture-backed electric car company was a smart investment 10 years ago, but today it\u2019s things like storage \u2014 the batteries in a Tesla or stationary storage \u2014 that are going to play a huge role in the electric grid of the future.\u201dWith storage, the energy created by the sun and wind can be used on demand \u2014 or on cloudy, calm days.Mr. Reynders said he was steering clear of solar panels but liked companies that install the panels. He also said he thought the Trump administration would be good for alternative-energy investment, though not as its cheerleader. If the administration follows through on Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to cut clean-energy subsidies, it could force a shakeout in the industry and prompt investors to pay closer attention to company fundamentals.For investors with a greater appetite for risk, there are certainly longer-term energy investments. One is graphene, a superthin, incredibly strong material that can be used as a conductor. Its promise is for batteries of the future, and probably much more.William Page, portfolio manager for global environmental opportunities strategy at Essex Investment Management, said he saw the potential in investing in graphene but was avoiding it for now.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to invest in a technology that might work in the lab today but it\u2019s not something that is a viable investment today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want something that is profitable today.\u201dLike Mr. Reynders, Mr. Page thinks that companies that install solar panels are a good investment. He also likes LED lighting installation \u2014 not the exactly the sexiest clean energy investment, but one that is environmentally sound and profitable today.At the opposite end of the risk spectrum, Matthew Weatherley-White, co-founder and managing director at the Caprock Group, said people could make alternative energy investments in themselves, as it were.\u201cSay you have $10,000,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to invest in a solar panel company or in a solar array for your house?\u201dOf course, it depends on whether you are a city or country dweller. \u201cIn Idaho, where I live, there\u2019s 6 percent internal rate of return for a solar array, so you get paid back in 18 years,\u201d Mr. Weatherley-White said. \u201cThat might not blow the socks off as an investment, but it\u2019s pretty predictable.\u201dIn places like California, where state policies favor solar power, that rate of return could be three to four times what it is in Idaho, he said. Still, it comes down to a question every investor should ask: \u201cWhere am I going to invest for a positive financial return and an environmental impact?\u201dAnd in the United States, it is the states rather than the federal government that may wield the greatest influence over the clean-energy sector. \u201cWhile the Trump victory for some was disturbing or took the wind out of their sails,\u201d Ms. Pfund said, \u201cthe federal government can only do so much.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Destroy the Business Model of Breitbart and Fake News", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byOne day in late November, an earth and environmental science professor named Nathan Phillips visited Breitbart News for the first time. Mr. Phillips had heard about the hateful headlines on the site \u2014 like \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy\u201d \u2014 and wondered what kind of companies would support such messages with their ad dollars. When he clicked on the site, he was shocked to discover ads for universities, including one for the graduate school where he\u2019d received his own degree \u2014 Duke University\u2019s Nicholas School of the Environment. \u201cThat was a punch in the stomach,\u201d he said.Why would an environmental science program want to be promoted on a site that denies the existence of climate change? Mr. Phillips figured \u2014 correctly \u2014 that Duke officials did not know where their ads were appearing, so he sent a tweet to Duke about its association with the \u201csexist racist\u201d site. Eventually, after a flurry of communication with the environment department, he received a satisfying resolution \u2014 an assurance that its ads would no longer show up on Breitbart.Mr. Phillips had just engaged in a new form of consumer activism, one that is rewriting the rules of online advertising. In the past month and a half, thousands of activists have started to push companies to take a stand on what you might call \u201chate news\u201d \u2014 a toxic mix of lies, white-supremacist content and bullying that can inspire attacks on Muslims, gay people, women, African-Americans and others.In mid-November, a Twitter group called Sleeping Giants became the hub of the new movement. The Giants and their followers have communicated with more than 1,000 companies and nonprofit groups whose ads appeared on Breitbart, and about 400 of those organizations have promised to remove the site from future ad buys.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on Breitbart News right now because they\u2019re the biggest fish,\u201d a founder of Sleeping Giants told me. (He requested anonymity because some members of the group work in the digital-media industry.) Eventually, Sleeping Giants would like to broaden its campaign to take on a menagerie of bad actors, but that would require a much bigger army of Giants, and \u201cit has only been a month since we started doing this,\u201d he told me when I talked to him in December. Then he added, \u201cThis has been the longest month of my life.\u201dHe said that he noticed something had gone wrong with internet ads in November when, just out of curiosity, he visited Breitbart News. Like Mr. Phillips, he was gobsmacked by what he found there. His version of Breitbart was plastered with the logos of Silicon Valley brands that courted tech-savvy, pro-diversity millennials. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that these progressive companies were paying Breitbart News,\u201d he said.So he created a Twitter account called Sleeping Giants that would allow him and his fellow activists to anonymously interact with advertisers. Then they sent screenshots to companies like Chase, SoFi and Audi to prove that their ads appeared next to offensive content. Within hours, they received their first response, and they realized that they had stumbled across a potentially powerful tactic.\u201cWe are trying to stop racist websites by stopping their ad dollars,\u201d reads the Sleeping Giants profile. \u201cMany companies don\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s time to tell them.\u201d They say it\u2019s not about taking away Breitbart\u2019s right to free speech, but about giving consumers and advertisers control over where their money goes. The group\u2019s Twitter page offers a simple set of instructions to anyone who wants to follow suit. Step 1: \u201cGo to Breitbart and take a screenshot of an ad next to some of their content.\u201d Step 2: \u201cTweet the screenshot to the company with a polite, nonoffensive note.\u201dThe activists\u2019 back-and-forth with companies reveals a fog of confusion surrounding online advertising. Many organizations have no idea that their ads may end up next to content they find abhorrent.You might blame this \u2014 in part \u2014 on robots. According to the research firm eMarketer, American companies are now spending more than $22 billion a year on \u201cprogrammatic ads,\u201d the kind of advertising that is bought with little human oversight. Joshua Zeitz, vice president of corporate communications at the ad-tech company AppNexus, explained to me how this automated ad buying works. When you click on a link, \u201cin less than a second, a call goes out, and algorithms and automated software bid in an auction to put their advertisement up on your page,\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe the Nabisco algorithm wants to put an ad up there; so does Macy\u2019s and so does Honda.\u201d The algorithm that places the highest bid wins the chance to appear on your screen.Programmatic ads can also follow individuals around the internet, based on their browsing history, as happened with Mr. Philips. A single targeted ad could cost just a fraction of a penny, but the pennies add up to a billion-dollar industry.Even when ad placements are automated, companies still have the power to control whether neo-Nazis or fake news hucksters profit. In fact, it\u2019s actually rather simple for companies to impose ethical policies, according to Mr. Zeitz. Indeed, his own company (which handles programmatic advertising for other organizations) recently decided to get out ahead of the issue by removing Breitbart News from its advertising marketplace. \u201cWe\u2019re not banning them because they\u2019re alt-right or conservative. We banned them from our marketplace because they violate our hate speech policy, which prohibits ad serving on sites that incite violence and discrimination against minority groups.\u201d (Breitbart has said that it condemns racism and bigotry \u201cin any form.\u201d)He pointed out that brand-name companies had already figured out how to keep their ads from flowing onto porn sites, because \u201cyou really don\u2019t want your ad for a breakfast cereal next to a hard-core pornographic video,\u201d and so \u201cthere are tools in place that allow companies to control where their ads go.\u201d A company can block a specific site like Breitbart News from its ad buy. Or it might pick a \u201cwhite list\u201d of sites that align with its values.But to do that, companies would have to forgo the sites designed to deliver exactly what they want \u2014 a big audience for little cost. In November, NPR reporters interviewed Jestin Coler about his fake-news empire. Mr. Coler and his team stage-crafted their sites to look like local newspapers and then planted fantastical headlines and fictional stories that attracted more than a million views. Though the news was fake, the ads were real. Mr. Coler wouldn\u2019t tell the reporters exactly how much he made off advertising, but he intimated that his revenues ranged between $10,000 and $30,000 a month.Such \u201centrepreneurs\u201d have an outsize influence on our political sphere. BuzzFeed News reported that, during the last three months of the election, hoax stories outperformed real ones on social media. Thanks to people enthusiastically sharing pro-Trump headlines cooked up by clickbait farms, in the bizarro-world of online advertising, the fake can be more profitable than the real.Ezra Englebardt, an advertising strategist, joined the Sleeping Giants campaign because he believes it creates much-needed transparency in the online advertising world. When lots of people share photos of the ads that they\u2019re seeing on their own screens, it becomes possible to get some sense of where the ad dollars go, he said.Still, the post-truth reality makes it difficult to measure the scope of the problem. Breitbart\u2019s editor in chief told Bloomberg that despite these bans, his company \u201ccontinues to experience exceptional growth.\u201d However, public Twitter communications and news accounts prove that advertisers are indeed fleeing the site.More important, the screenshot activists are forcing companies to pick a side. After pressure from consumers, Kellogg\u2019s became one of the first big brands to announce that it would remove its ads from Breitbart News. In retaliation, Breitbart called for a boycott, and the cereal brand seems to have suffered from the uproar on social media. At the same time, it received lots of good press for taking its stand; in early December, many consumers announced that they would reward the company by making all-Kellogg\u2019s donations to soup kitchens.I expected that other companies would want to trumpet their own Breitbart departures. It seemed an easy win for corporate P.R. to distance itself from Klan-rally-like riffs like this one \u2014 \u201cevery tree, every rooftop, every picket fence, every telegraph pole in the South should be festooned with the Confederate battle flag.\u201d (Telegraph poles!?)But when I reached out to several organizations that seemed to have joined the ban, they didn\u2019t want to talk about it. A bank and a nonprofit group did not respond to my queries. Two companies \u2014 3M and Zappos \u2014 declined to talk about the matter. A Patagonia spokeswoman said that her company did not advertise on white-supremacist sites \u2014 but she would not comment on the screenshots that activists had sent to Patagonia in early December showing the company\u2019s logo on Breitbart\u2019s Facebook page. Warby Parker was the most forthcoming; a representative pointed me to a statement that thanked a Twitter activist for inspiring its own ban on Breitbart.In the behavior of some of these companies, you can detect the way our norms have already shifted. In the old normal, it would have cost little to stand up against neo-Nazi slogans. But in the new normal, doing so might involve angering key players in the White House, including the president-elect, Donald J. Trump, who has hired the former editor of Breitbart as his senior adviser. Mr. Trump recently proved the damage he could do to a company by criticizing Lockheed Martin on Twitter; soon after, its stocks prices tumbled.Still, a new consumer movement is rising, and activists believe that where votes failed, wallets may prevail. This struggle is about much more than ads on Breitbart News \u2014 it\u2019s about using corporations as shields to protect vulnerable people from bullying and hate crimes.Nicholas Reville, a board member of the Participatory Culture Foundation who has worked with the Sleeping Giants, pointed out that businesses benefited from embracing diversity: \u201cYou have to be inclusionary if you\u2019re going to try to sell to a very large audience.\u201d And he pointed out that consumer activism might be especially effective because so many people feel they have no other way to express their opposition to Trump-ian values.The founder of Sleeping Giants agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to say it, but maybe companies will have to be the standard-bearers for morals right now,\u201d he said. He added that most corporations embrace policies (on paper at least) that prohibit racist bullying and sexual intimidation. Even if President Trump flouts these rules, corporations may continue to uphold them. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen employee handbooks where they have codes of behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s all we have to fall back on now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rising Market Now Confronts Heightened Risks", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byThe stock market has continued to reach new highs, troubled only fleetingly by rising interest rates, sluggish corporate earnings and new and uncomfortable political realities.Monetary policy is tightening, government spending is expected to expand substantially, and, as the American presidential election and the vote in Britain to leave the European Union show, trade relations and other ties among nations may be fraying. How those trends progress should go a long way to determining the performance of stocks and bonds as the year moves along.These aren\u2019t the only issues for investors to contend with, either. Economic indicators have perked up \u2014 unemployment in December, reported on Jan. 6, was 4.7 percent, and consumer confidence is near multiyear highs \u2014 but the earnings outlook remains subdued, stock valuations remain high and bond yields are low but rising. Under these circumstances, many investment advisers recommend taking only minimal, reasonably priced risks.\u201cI\u2019m hard pressed to locate any investment where you can make a strong argument that it\u2019s undervalued,\u201d said Joe Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard and head of the firm\u2019s Investment Strategy Group. \u201cJust as the economic environment seems to be improving, the investment environment is more challenging. Investors have more risk in their portfolios than at any time since 1999.\u201dBen Inker, co-head of asset allocation at the GMO investment firm, likewise finds \u201cplenty of things to worry about.\u201dThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index early this month traded at about 26 times the earnings that the constituent companies reported in the previous year, higher than at almost any time in history. One reason that investors are willing to pay so much is that they see even less value in other assets.\u201cThe rest of the world looks scarier than the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Inker said. \u201cWho would want to touch Europe? Who would want to touch emerging\u201d markets? As scary as they may appear, he recommends investing in emerging stock markets as the best of a series of difficult choices. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we have high hopes for the emerging world this year,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they\u2019re priced for a really bad outcome. The U.S. is priced for a really good outcome.\u201dAmerican stocks had a really good outcome in 2016. The S.&P. 500 rose 9.5 percent, to 2,238.83, including a 3.3 percent gain in the fourth quarter.The average domestic stock fund in Morningstar\u2019s database rose 3.3 percent in the quarter and 10.9 percent on the year. Leading the way in the quarter, with double-digit gains, were portfolios that focused on financial services, smaller companies, energy and industrials.Whether managers make the most of it, David Kelly, chief global strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management, finds solid prospects in American stocks this year, more than many of his peers do.He favors sectors most sensitive to rising growth, such as financial services, technology and consumer discretionary stocks.\u201cThe general trend of government policy will be pretty pro-business and much more friendly to the U.S. corporate sector than it has been,\u201d he said. But he said that \u201cthe Republicans may get sidetracked by antitrade rhetoric.\u201dPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has proposed raising tariffs on imported goods, and some Republicans in Congress have proposed changing corporate tax rules to reward exporters and punish importers. Economists generally agree that higher tariffs reduce competitiveness and drive up prices of imported goods, including parts supplied to American manufacturers.Mr. Kelly is also wary of Mr. Trump\u2019s pledges to increase government spending on infrastructure projects.\u201cThere isn\u2019t actually any money in the budget to fulfill his agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cCongress may decide not to worry about it and push up the debt, and we\u2019ll end up with more debt and inflation.\u201dAnd we may have higher interest rates, too. The Federal Reserve raised rates in December, only the second time in a decade. Mr. Kelly expects three, possibly four, increases this year.The more forbidding rate environment may account for much of the run-up in bond yields last year. Yields on 10-year Treasury issues rose to 2.44 percent at the end of December from 1.36 percent in early July, with most of the increase occurring just after Election Day, according to Bloomberg.Bond funds lost 1 percent in the fourth quarter, depressed by the 11.8 percent plunge in portfolios that specialize in long-term government issues. For the full year, according to Morningstar, the average bond fund was up 5.9 percent, helped by double-digit gains in riskier categories like high-yield and emerging market debt.Laird Landmann, co-director of fixed income at the TCW fund-management company, said he saw little to recommend to investors because \u201casset prices are getting out of whack with the economy.\u201dInflation is likely to keep rising, he predicted, perhaps exceeding 2.5 percent this year.His advice is to play it safe and stick with Treasury bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities not issued or guaranteed by the federal government, and bonds issued by American banks.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to buy things after eight years of a credit cycle,\u201d Mr. Landmann said. \u201cWait for it to turn; that\u2019s the discipline of being a value investor.\u201dWhen considering any benefits of spending measures introduced by Mr. Trump and Congress, it\u2019s important to remember that they wouldn\u2019t be spread far and wide. Hope that the global recovery might at last get some legs helped emerging stock markets last year, but they gave back about seven months\u2019 worth of gains in the week after the election, as investors weighed the prospect of Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist campaign language being translated into action.The average emerging market stock fund lost 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter but still gained 9 percent for the year. International stock funds over all fell 2.8 percent in the quarter and rose 4.9 percent on the year.Some of the worst-performing stock markets were in countries on which Mr. Trump has focused. Mexico lost 8 percent in 2016, and the Shanghai Composite index in China was down more than 12 percent, although funds concentrating on China and its surroundings rose 0.7 percent.The president-elect\u2019s outlook \u201cis clearly antiglobalization,\u201d said Rick Schmidt, co-manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets Fund.\u201cTrade is going to have a bigger impact on some markets than others,\u201d he said. \u201cIn emerging markets, clearly there are places where risk hasn\u2019t retreated. Mexico is No. 1, China is No. 2.\u201d\u201cWhether he can implement\u201d his agenda \u201cis one thing, but you have to assume he means it,\u201d Mr. Schmidt added. \u201cIt would be dangerous not to take him at his word.\u201dJust as Mr. Inker prefers emerging markets because the risk they entail comes at the right price, Mr. Schmidt sees some of the best opportunities this year in beaten-down markets like Mexico.Elsewhere, he finds India overpriced, and he is avoiding utilities and Chinese banks, although he likes banks in other countries.Mr. Kelly also sees emerging markets as cheap and therefore good long-term plays, and he likes European stocks over the long haul, too.While emerging markets are appealing to many based on their valuations, Mr. Landmann warned that they may be particularly vulnerable to potential missteps in a Trump presidency.\u201cMarkets are not going to crash necessarily, but you could see crashes in more fragile areas like China,\u201d he said.Mr. Davis, at Vanguard, advised investors to make sure they are globally diversified and not overly dependent on American markets. He also encouraged them to expect less. \u201cOne risk for equity markets for 2017 is they are pricing in 4 percent economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s unlikely; they seem to be discounting risks to free trade.\u201dThe economy has been growing at barely half that rate. \u201cI\u2019m not bearish on the economy,\u201d Mr. Davis said, \u201cbut I think expectations on returns need to be lowered.\u201dMr. Inker also suggested that investors keep their enthusiasm in check.\u201cI would have thought that the prospect of surprising statements coming out of the White House in the form of tweets would generate uncertainty, and markets don\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far the U.S. market has not seemed to mind. We\u2019ll have to see. This is uncharted territory.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Turkey, U.S. Hand Is Seen in Nearly Every Crisis", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byTurkey has been confronted with a cascade of crises that seem to have only accelerated as the Syrian civil war has spilled across the border. But the events have not pushed Turkey closer to its NATO allies. Conversely, they have drifted further apart as the nation lashes out at Washington and moves closer to Moscow, working with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to secure a cease-fire in Syria.One story in the Turkish press, based on a routine travel warning issued by the American Embassy in Turkey, was that the United States had advance knowledge of the nightclub attack, which the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for. Another suggested that stun grenades used by the gunman had come from stocks held by the American military. Still another claimed the assault was a plot by the United States to sow divisions in Turkey between the secular and the religious.Rather than bringing the United States and Turkey together in the common fight against terrorism, the nightclub attack, even with the gunman still on the run, appears to have only accelerated Turkey\u2019s shift away from the West, at a time when its democracy is eroding amid a growing crackdown on civil society.All of this is a reflection, many critics say, of what they call the paranoia and authoritarianism of Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose leadership has so deeply divided the country that, instead of unifying to confront terrorism, Turkish society is fracturing further with each attack.The West, symbolized by the United States, is the perennial bogeyman.While seeming to pile on the Obama administration in its waning days \u2014 by accusing it of supporting Turkey\u2019s enemies, including the Islamic State; Kurdish militants; and supporters of an exiled Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, whom Mr. Erdogan blamed for directing the coup \u2014 Turkish officials are also telegraphing something else: that they are willing to open the door and improve relations with the United States once President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office.\u201cOur expectation from the new administration is to end this shame,\u201d Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said this week while accusing the United States of providing weapons to Kurdish militants in Syria who are fighting the Islamic State, but are also an enemy of Turkey. \u201cWe are not holding the new administration responsible for this,\u201d Mr. Yildirim said. \u201cBecause this is the work of the Obama administration.\u201dMeanwhile, the nightclub assailant is on the loose.The Turkish authorities said on Wednesday that they had identified the killer, but refused to release any other details, although photographs of the man, from surveillance cameras, have been released. Also, a video surfaced that appeared to show the assailant recording himself in Istanbul\u2019s Taksim Square.A senior United States official, who has been briefed on the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details, said the Turks had recovered the video from a raid on a house in Istanbul. The official said the Turks now believed the killer was from Uzbekistan, not Kyrgyzstan, as many reports this week had first suggested.The official expressed alarm at the growing anti-Americanism in Turkey, which seems to accumulate after each crisis here, and said it put the lives of Americans in the country in jeopardy.The chaotic investigation has added to the anxiety on Istanbul\u2019s streets, with vehicle checkpoints, night raids on houses and low-flying helicopters.\u201cThere is significant fear in ordinary people,\u201d said Aydin Engin, a columnist at the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet, who was detained last year as part of the government\u2019s crackdown on the news media. \u201cFear prevails when it comes to going to an entertainment place, being in a crowd, going to a shopping mall, getting on the metro.\u201dWith each passing day, public life descends deeper into what many Turks concede is a mix of darkness and seeming absurdity, with growing fears of violence and expressions of xenophobia set next to repressions on civic life.\u201cIn a way, it\u2019s basically a breakdown of order,\u201d said Soli Ozel, a Turkish columnist and academic, seeking to explain the tumult in society. \u201cEveryone feels entitled to do whatever they want to do and how they want to do it.\u201dA timeline of recent terrorist attacks in Turkey.Tugrul Eryilmaz, another longtime Turkish journalist, recalled the country\u2019s military coup in 1980 and the crackdown on civil society that followed, and said, \u201cI have never been in such a situation like today.\u201d\u201cTurkey is so deeply polarized around the powerful persona of Erdogan that, instead of asking why terror attacks are happening and how they can be stopped, the pro- and anti-Erdogan blocks in the country are blaming each other,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, a specialist on Turkey at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThis is why I am deeply worried about Turkey and the country\u2019s ability to stymie further terror attacks.\u201dParliament voted overnight to extend by three months the state of emergency that went into effect last summer after the failed coup. The emergency grants Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government extraordinary powers to detain perceived opponents and hold them in pretrial detention. Tens of thousands of people have either been arrested or been purged from their jobs, on suspicion of having links to Mr. Gulen, who now lives in Pennsylvania.Mr. Erdogan on Wednesday made his first public remarks since the attack on Sunday morning, a striking period of silence for a man who is normally ubiquitous in the public sphere, often giving speeches daily.Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist, rejected criticism that his government, in pushing an Islamist agenda, had deepened divisions between the secular and the pious. Many on social media, in the aftermath of the nightclub attack, noted that the Turkish government\u2019s religious authorities had denounced New Year\u2019s celebrations as un-Islamic.\u201cAs the president of all 79 million citizens,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said, \u201cit is my duty to protect everyone\u2019s rights, law and spaces of freedom.\u201dMr. Erdogan, who spoke this week with President Obama in a condolence call, also told his audience what he believed Turkey, in facing so many terrorist attacks, was really up against: a plot by the West.Invoking the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and the subsequent Turkish war against Western armies and their proxies, he said, \u201cToday Turkey is in a new struggle for independence.\u201dEric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington, and Michael Wolgelenter from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fate of UBS Is in the Hands of Fickle Markets", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsInvesting in UBS is a bet on an uncertain world.The Swiss bank reckons resurgent investors may bolster its tepid 6.1 percent return on equity for 2016. But after a fourth quarter marked by net outflows of $5.4 billion and a further withering of wealth management margins, the hopes of the bank\u2019s chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, for a pickup in activity need quick consummation.Investment banking and wealth management in the Americas were bright spots in the three months to December. UBS has less firepower in fixed-income trading, which has been booming. But revenue jumps in equities trading and in the origination and advisory business were bigger than at its rivals. Meanwhile, higher short-term interest rates and higher fees helped revenue at UBS Wealth Management Americas.The snag is that the outlook could disappoint even though client surveys point to rebounding confidence. In investment banking, UBS is less exposed to the United States than its rivals and more geared toward Asia, which is underperforming. Wealth management transaction fees could bring in more money in America if the recent rally in United States stocks spurs clients to rebalance their portfolios. But they may not rise much elsewhere.There are other risks. One is the potential for litigation as countries force UBS and other private banks to ditch investors\u2019 assets that do not comply with tax rules. It bodes ill that the European Court of Human Rights this month rejected the Swiss bank\u2019s appeal against aspects of a French government case.Another is the possibility of adverse currency swings. UBS estimates that a 10 percent drop in the dollar\u2019s value against the Swiss franc would depress its pretax profit by 600 million Swiss francs relative to average forecasts. Any such move would offset the impact of Mr. Ermotti\u2019s cost-cutting program, which is expected to deliver 500 million Swiss francs in savings this year.UBS looks doubly exposed to fickle markets, since President Trump\u2019s policies will dictate whether American investors\u2019 animal spirits persist.With UBS shares trading around a third above their estimated 2017 tangible book value \u2014 and in line with purer plays like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs \u2014 the Swiss bank looks fully priced.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Vows to Ease Rules for Drug Makers, but Again Zeros In on Prices", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump promised some of the nation\u2019s top drug company executives in a meeting at the White House on Tuesday that he would slash regulations at the Food and Drug Administration and make it easier for them to manufacture products in the United States.He also described as \u201cfantastic\u201d the person he planned to nominate for commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, someone he said would streamline the agency and get drug approval decisions faster.\u201cYou can\u2019t get approval for the plant, and you can\u2019t get approval for the drug; other than that, you\u2019re doing fantastic,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the meeting, to laughter from top executives of companies like Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly and Novartis.But even as he struck a cordial tone with them, he said that lowering drug costs would remain a focus and that he would discuss the issue further during the nonpublic portion of the meeting, away from the news media. \u201cThe U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the pricing has been astronomical,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have to get prices down for a lot of reasons.\u201dAt the meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump again referred to Medicare\u2019s role, saying he would oppose anything that prevented competition, including \u201cprice fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what\u2019s happening.\u201dA White House spokesman later clarified that his remarks meant that the president \u201csupports increasing bidding and competition for all drugs in Medicare.\u201dBut the president also tried to persuade the executives that he would provide them with assistance, saying: \u201cWe can save tens of billions of dollars, and you people are going to do great. You\u2019re going to do great.\u201dIn comments after the meeting, the drug industry leaders said it had been productive and said they welcomed the president\u2019s pledges on cutting regulations and speeding approvals.But drug safety advocates criticized his comments, saying that eliminating agency regulations would mean rolling back consumer protections on products as diverse as drugs, cosmetics, food and dietary supplements.Dr. Carome said many of the regulations had been set up by Congress so they could not easily be removed. \u201cMost of these regulations, to do away with them would require new statutes and new laws to be passed,\u201d he said.Others said the agency had already loosened the approval process for new drugs in recent years, with questionable benefit.During the meeting, Mr. Trump also told the executives that he was close to naming a candidate to lead the F.D.A.\u201cYou\u2019re going to get your products \u2014 either approved or not approved \u2014 but it\u2019s going to be a quick process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to take 15 years,\u201d apparently a reference not to the length of time it takes the agency to approve drugs but to how long it takes a to develop a drug.He also appeared to express frustration at what he said were unnecessary delays by the agency, especially for drugs that treat patients who are close to death. The agency justifies the delay by saying it needs to evaluate whether the drug is safe, and whether it works, Mr. Trump said: \u201cWe can\u2019t approve the drug because we don\u2019t want to hurt the patient,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the patient is not going to live more than four weeks.\u201dThe Trump administration has not said who the finalists for the position are, but two widely circulated candidates are Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former F.D.A. official with longstanding ties to the pharmaceutical industry, and Jim O\u2019Neill, an associate of the billionaire Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who has said he favored allowing drugs to be approved even if their efficacy had not been proved.Even Joseph Jimenez, the chief executive of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, emphasized the company\u2019s American ties, pointing out the billions of dollars it spends on research and development and saying, \u201cOur global headquarters is near Boston.\u201d Eric Althoff, a spokesman for Novartis, which is based in Basel, Switzerland, said Mr. Jimenez was referring to the company\u2019s research and development headquarters.Mr. Jimenez and others supported Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to cut taxes and regulations. \u201cOne of the things that can help us is a lower tax rate,\u201d Mr. Jimenez said.\u201cYep, we\u2019ll get it,\u201d Mr. Trump replied.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Dow\u2019s Record Rise Sends a Former Wall Street Stock Broker Back in Time", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byI returned to January 4, 1982, the day I began my short but illuminating career as a Wall Street stockbroker.On that day, the Dow Jones, an average of 30 blue-chip stocks that are industry leaders, closed at 882.52. Not 8,000. Eight hundred.Yes, before I became a financial reporter, I was what they used to call a customer\u2019s man. That\u2019s Wall Street parlance \u2014 from the early 20th century anyway \u2014 for people who bought and sold securities for investors.A glance at the nearby photograph of my graduating class of fellow stockbrokers in late 1981 shows that \u201ccustomer\u2019s man\u201d was still a fairly accurate term even when I entered the industry. Fact is, most brokers were male.Taken on Dec. 18, 1981 at the World Trade Center headquarters of Dean Witter Reynolds, the photograph shows 59 people who had just passed their regulatory exams and training programs and were ready to become brokers. (I am seated on the floor in the front row, fifth from left.)Ten were women, or roughly 17 percent of the class. Only one was African-American.My classmates came from all over the country, but I worked in Midtown Manhattan at a big branch of Dean Witter, a 1920s-era brokerage firm whose name disappeared after being swallowed up by Morgan Stanley in 1997.I spent only two years as a customer\u2019s man, but in that short span I learned an immense amount about how the financial world works and doesn\u2019t. I witnessed both the wonders and the woes of capitalism. I saw firsthand how the stock market can create wealth and take it away.When I took my seat at Dean Witter I didn\u2019t know that United States stocks were about to take off on their longest bull run in history. It didn\u2019t happen right away, of course \u2014 by August 1982, the DJIA had fallen about 100 points from its January level. But after that, it was off to the races, churning its way to over 2,700 by 1987. My timing was pretty good.On October 19, 1987, came the scary 500-point drop. But that turned out to be a hiccup, and soon the Dow was back in positive territory. It hit the 10,000 milestone in 1999.By then, I was no longer on Wall Street. Instead, I was on the outside looking in and writing about what I saw for The New York Times. Thanks to my years as a broker, though, I understood what was going on behind the scenes and could explain it to readers. It didn\u2019t matter that my experience had come decades earlier because very little on Wall Street ever changes.Soon after Dow 10,000, the average began to stumble. In 2000, the internet bubble burst, hammering investors\u2019 portfolios; then came 9/11 and the devastating accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Adelphia. That was a chastening period.So was 2008 and 2009, when the mortgage meltdown drove the economy into the ditch and markets to steep declines. Once again, the markets rebounded.Now, with the Dow topping 20,000, it seems a worthwhile moment to compare what\u2018s happening in the economy and on Wall Street today versus when I first inhabited that planet. There are some similarities but many differences.Today, we have a president who is also pro-business. But this time interest rates are in the cellar and rising, the economy is robust and investors are tripping over themselves to buy stocks. The upside from here, therefore, seems more limited.What about the Wall Street culture? Are things different today for women than they were in the 1980s? Yes and no.As my class photo indicates, customers\u2019 women were in the minority at investment firms back then. Across the nation, Bureau of Labor Statistics show, women made up approximately 24 percent of sales representatives in the securities and financial services industry in 1983. Blacks made up 3 percent.By 1995, women accounted for one-third of securities and financial services sales representatives, BLS statistics show. African-Americans made up just 6 percent.Those figures would seem to indicate that women have made strides at infiltrating Wall Street. But whether they are truly welcomed on trading desks and in brokerage firm offices is another question entirely. I wonder, for example, if more women on Wall Street means none of them has to endure, as I did, performances by female strippers brought into the office to honor a colleague on his birthday.Ah, the good old days.The bottom line about my experience on Wall Street: I got a lot more out of it than it got out of me.Wall Street learned that I was O.K. at bringing in customers. But I wasn\u2019t much good at generating commissions. My name was usually at the bottom of my branch\u2019s monthly revenue runs.Be wary of initial public offerings of stock, often propelled by investor exuberance whipped up by sales representatives wearing rose-colored glasses.And what if a top company executive comes across as a dope or dishonest? Trust your judgment and sell the stock.These are lessons that remain useful as we look forward to Dow 30,000.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "2016\u2019s Winning Investors Talk About 2017, and Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseLast year was one of unusually big surprises for markets \u2014 none more so than the election of Donald Trump. Not only were many money managers and experts dead wrong about his chances, but they were doubly wrong in betting on a big market sell-off in the event he won.Mr. Trump\u2019s victory kicked off a continuing stock rally that left the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index up nearly 10 percent by the end of the year, a gain few anticipated a year ago.Again this year, I turned to some prominent investors and market experts who successfully maneuvered through what turned into a treacherous year, asking them for insights into how they did it and what they expect in 2017.\u201cI was ridiculed,\u201d Anthony Scaramucci told me this week, referring to his early and vocal support for Donald Trump. Unlike many on Wall Street, the outspoken Mr. Scaramucci \u2014 the founder of SkyBridge Capital, host of a revived \u201cWall Street Week\u201d television show on the Fox Business Channel and author of several books on business and investing \u2014 went all in for Mr. Trump after initially backing Jeb Bush.Nor did the so-called Trump rally come as a surprise to him. \u201cTo put it simply, if you get a 35 percent corporate rate reduced to 15 percent or even 20 percent, you\u2019re looking at a 30 percent earnings increase for most companies,\u201d he told me as he took a short break from the Trump transition team.SkyBridge focuses mostly on hedge funds and other so-called alternative investments, but also offers a high-yielding stock mutual fund, the SkyBridge Dividend Value Fund. The fund gained over 15 percent last year, handily outpacing the S.&P. 500.As a long-only fund \u2014 one that invests in securities for their potential gains and doesn\u2019t short stocks, or bet on potential declines \u2014 \u201cwe benefited enormously from the Trump win,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that contrarians often get things wrong. But when they get it right, there\u2019s a tidal wave. Trump is an example. The conventional wisdom was that he couldn\u2019t win. Assets were priced relative to the conventional wisdom. So when he did win, there was huge upside.\u201dMr. Scaramucci attributes his contrarian view of Mr. Trump in part to the fact he lives on Long Island, a stone\u2019s throw from his working-class parents, and not among the Manhattan elite, even though he\u2019s an alumnus of Harvard Law School and Goldman Sachs. \u201cEveryone in the local bar, from the bluest- to the whitest-collar workers, was voting for Trump,\u201d he said.But Mr. Scaramucci isn\u2019t blindly contrarian. He did initially bet wrong on Mr. Bush. \u201cI pivoted,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone makes mistakes. The question is, How do you adapt? All entrepreneurs have to do that.\u201dNow Mr. Scaramucci is in the Trump inner sanctum as a member of the transition team, in a position not only to predict the future, but also to help shape it.Not surprisingly, he\u2019s bullish on the economy and stock market for 2017. He expects the kind of high-dividend, value-oriented stocks his fund invests in (some of its biggest holdings last year were Best Buy, Caterpillar and Boeing) to do well unless \u201cwe get to hyper-growth, in which case there will be a rotation to growth stocks.\u201dHe said fears of a Trump-induced trade war were overblown. \u201cNo one wants a trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we\u2019re calling for are fairer free-trade arrangements around the world.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re not coming at this from a position of ideological purity. There are a lot of practical business people in the room. We\u2019re not asking if something is right or left, but whether it\u2019s right or wrong.\u201dJerome L. Dodson is the founder and president of Parnassus Investments, and lead portfolio manager for the Parnassus Endeavor Fund. He champions the notion of doing well by doing good. \u201cCertain social and environmental values are really important to us,\u201d he told me this week.His fund doesn\u2019t invest in fossil fuels. He seeks out companies that treat their employees well and where turnover is low.In a highly competitive world where cutthroat capitalists scoff at such values, he\u2019s also emerged on top: His Parnassus Endeavor Fund is ranked by Morningstar as the No. 1 fund in its category (large-cap growth) over one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods \u2014 a remarkable feat.Mr. Dodson follows a highly disciplined approach that considers only companies trading at less than two-thirds of their intrinsic value \u2014 a subjective assessment of the actual value of a company, without regard to its market price \u2014 which makes him as much a value investor as a growth investor.He doesn\u2019t worry much about typical macro events or predictions, like the outcomes of presidential elections, the direction of interest rates, or oil prices. He doesn\u2019t claim to be much of a forecaster, and said he was surprised that two of his fund\u2019s positions \u2014 John Deere, the farm equipment icon, and Cummins, the engine maker \u2014 ended up doing so well last year. \u201cAll you can do is look for good companies that are undervalued,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to know when they\u2019re going to go up.\u201dA typical investment for his fund was the chip maker Micron Technology, whose shares had been battered by declining revenue and a global chip glut. Mr. Dodson calculated that Micron shares were trading at just one-third of their intrinsic value when he bought them for an average of $10.80 a share. Equally important, Micron \u201cis a great place to work, with good employee benefits and relatively low turnover,\u201d he said. Last year it was the Endeavor Fund\u2019s largest holding.This week it was trading above $22, more than double the fund\u2019s average cost. \u201cWe are holding onto the stock but wouldn\u2019t buy a lot more today,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.Indeed, with the market so high, it\u2019s getting hard for Mr. Dodson to find stocks that meet his intrinsic value criteria. Ideally, he\u2019d like to have about 40 stocks in the fund. Currently he has just 25.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say I\u2019m cautious about the coming year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s because valuations are so high.\u201dStill, \u201cif Trump can deliver some of what he\u2019s talking about, which is tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and the economy starts growing at 3 percent, then earnings will increase, causing the price-to-earnings ratio to come down,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would make me more positive about 2017.\u201dWill resurgent oil prices continue to drive markets?In all likelihood, yes, said Damien Courvalin, head of energy research for the Goldman Sachs\u2019s global investment research commodities team. Mr. Courvalin makes a rare return appearance this year, after pretty much nailing it in his forecast for 2016. Last year he predicted further weakness in oil prices, followed by a recovery by the year\u2019s end \u2014 which is just what happened.This year Mr. Courvalin and his team are predicting $59 a barrel for Brent crude over the next three to six months, with prices stabilizing in the longer term at $55 to $60.That\u2019s because a price much above $60 is likely to cause a supply surge, especially from United States shale producers.But Mr. Courvalin said investors should focus less on price than on inventory. When high current inventories drive down spot prices, high-cost producers are at a disadvantage, but can still sell forward futures contracts at a premium. More normalized inventories lower or eliminate that incentive and reduce price volatility, which is a benefit to low-cost producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia.Because of that shift in the forward futures curve, there is upside potential for oil and commodities investors even if price gains in the spot market are modest. \u201cYou want to see demand levels that are strong, and we\u2019re getting there,\u201d he said.This has little to do with Mr. Trump or his policies. While the president-elect is seen as likely to encourage higher United States energy production, a higher supply will be offset by stronger demand and a stronger dollar. In any event, it\u2019s likely to take years for any Trump policies to affect market supply and demand.\u201cWe expect oil demand to be good next year,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point in the business cycle where you can expect to see much better returns from commodities than from equities, based on historical patterns.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Bond Market Is Shifting, So Steady Yourself", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byFundamentallyThe forces that rejuvenated the stock market late last year have changed the profile of the fixed-income market.Heading into the fourth quarter, for example, funds that invest in long-term government debt had been up more than 13 percent for the year as investors favored relatively safe bets on a sluggish economy. But as market interest rates shot up on hopes of accelerating growth and fiscal stimulus from the incoming administration of Donald J. Trump \u2014 hopes that contributed to the big rally in stocks \u2014 long-term government bond funds fell by double digits in the final three months of the year and finished 2016 up just 1 percent. The Vanguard Long-Term Government Bond E.T.F., for instance, fell nearly 12 percent in the final three months of 2016 and finished the year up only 1.2 percent for the year.At the same time, investor appetite for lower-quality bonds has been on the rise, with high-yield bonds up nearly 2 percent in the fourth quarter. The SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond E.T.F. has gained nearly 2 percent since Dec. 1 and returned 14.4 percent in 2016.\u201cIn one fell swoop, the market was recalibrated,\u201d said Carl P. Kaufman, managing director for fixed-income strategy at Osterweis Capital Management. \u201cThe question is: Does it continue?\u201dMr. Kaufman said that investors aren\u2019t likely to find that out until at least the first few months of the Trump presidency. But he said he thought \u201cthe markets are going to take a breather and see what happens until then.\u201dIn the meantime, market strategists warn investors not to dramatically overhaul their core fixed-income strategy.To be sure, many investors believe that the smartest strategy in 2017 is not to fight the Federal Reserve or fiscal stimulus.With the Fed indicating that there could be three modest rate increases in 2017, after the central bank\u2019s quarter-point rise in December, investors are generally being advised to \u201cshorten up\u201d their bond portfolios by putting new money to work in short-term debt that will lose less value than long-dated bonds when market rates rise.Even if the Fed is overestimating the number of rate increases to come \u2014 as policy makers did in 2016, when they entered the year forecasting four rate increases but only delivered one \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re not being paid a lot to extend out\u201d in terms of maturities, said Jeff Klingelhofer, a portfolio manager and managing director at Thornburg Investment Management.At the same time, the Trump administration\u2019s calls to lower household and corporate tax rates and to increase spending on infrastructure projects are expected to energize growth \u2014 or at the least breathe some new life into an aging economic recovery that\u2019s been unfolding for nearly eight years. And these stimulative policies are generally viewed as a sign that it\u2019s safe to bet on institutions with less-than-pristine credit.But within this framework, fixed-income strategists advise investors to err on the side of caution.\u201cThe markets have mostly overreacted at this point,\u201d Mr. Klingelhofer said. \u201cMost investors would agree that we\u2019re in the later stages of this recovery \u2014 maybe we\u2019re in the seventh inning, maybe the eighth, but we\u2019re not in the second inning when it comes to growth.\u201dTherefore, he said, even if investors want to add to their high-yield exposure, the prudent move may be to focus on the higher-quality end of the junk bond spectrum \u2014 for instance with a bond rated BB or B.Andrew C. McCormick, head of T. Rowe Price\u2019s United States taxable bond team, said that with the Fed poised to continue lifting short-term rates, there may be a more attractive way to gain exposure to the noninvestment grade market: bank loan securities with interest rates that float with market rates.Bank loan funds post gains when rates are on the rise, but this is particularly true now that the Fed\u2019s December increase has pushed the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, up to 1 percent. While rates on bank loan securities generally float with the market, in many cases that only happens if Libor is at or above 1 percent.With Libor at that threshold, this form of noninvestment grade debt should have more appeal.Moreover, the typical bank loan fund has about one-tenth the exposure to the energy sector as high-yield bond funds do. While energy prices have recently stabilized, plummeting prices in 2015 led to a jump in the default rate for high-yield debt early last year.Bank loans also sport ultrashort maturities. The average bank loan fund has a duration of less than 0.4 year, implying that if market rates were to rise by 1 percentage point, these funds would fall less than 0.4 percent in value. By contrast, the average duration of a junk bond fund is 3.6 years.\u201cYou\u2019re taking virtually no duration risk in bank loans,\u201d says Kathy A. Jones, chief fixed-income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Meanwhile, she adds, bank loan debt hasn\u2019t had the run-up that high-yield bonds have enjoyed.Kate Warne, an investment strategist with the brokerage Edward Jones, said investors shouldn\u2019t assume too much when it comes to the bond market.For example, while it may seem certain that rates are poised to rise, \u201cthe Fed has overestimated the number of rate hikes they expect pretty consistently,\u201d she said. Moreover, with bond yields generally higher in the United States than overseas, foreign money will continue to pour into domestic bonds, which should keep a lid on how high rates can rise.This is an argument for sticking with a traditional strategy like a bond ladder, she said, in which investors divide their fixed-income stake into bonds maturing in routine intervals to mitigate interest rate risks.Rather than abandoning the laddered approach by selling longer-dated bonds, investors may choose to add to their cash stake to take advantage of rising rates sooner. \u201cBut don\u2019t ignore intermediate- and long-term bonds,\u201d she said.Ms. Jones of Charles Schwab said that investors may think they know what\u2019s to come in the economy or from the Trump administration in 2017, \u201cbut in reality, we are operating under a cloud of uncertainty. Everyone may be expecting taxes to be cut or counting on infrastructure spending, but we simply don\u2019t know what the specific policy prescriptions will be,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

But a word of warning to the president-elect: This one could be different.When Paula Jones sued Bill Clinton, powerful conservative backers bankrolled and pressed her case until the sitting president of the United States was deposed under oath \u2014 and fatefully denied having sexual relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky. The result: the first and only impeachment of an elected president.Ms. Zervos could well have the same kind of political muscle behind her \u2014 from the left.A CNN-ORC poll on Tuesday also put Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating at 40 percent, \u201cthe lowest of any recent president and 44 points below that of President Barack Obama, the 44th president.\u201dNo doubt, many people from both sides of the Trumpian divide will sympathize with his antipathy for pre-election polling \u2014 although Hillary Clinton\u2019s two-percentage point win in the popular vote was about in line with national polling. The postelection polls are well outside the margin of sampling error in their comparisons to other presidents.Mr. Trump consoled himself with all the buses and airplanes heading to Washington this week for the inauguration weekend.Unmentioned: More than 200,000 of those people are going to protest the 45th president. Bikers for Trump has vowed to defend him.While on Twitter, the president-elect decided to again go after Mr. Lewis, Democrat of Georgia \u2014 even though last week\u2019s Twitter confrontation is still reverberating among African-Americans and beyond.It is, in fact, true that Mr. Lewis, a civil rights icon who had his skull cracked in Selma, Ala., questioned the legitimacy of President Bush, the last president elected despite losing the popular vote.It is also true that Mr. Lewis is just not someone easily attacked by either political party.The top Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have sent Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama a letter with two pointed questions: If confirmed as attorney general, will you commit to not shutting down any F.B.I. or Justice Department investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election? And will you recuse yourself from involvement in those investigations?Since his appearance before the committee, Democrats have made clear they do not trust that an Attorney General Sessions would be an independent law enforcement officer when it comes to the man he loyally backed for president, who then picked him to be the highest law enforcement official in the land.The painting, which had won its spot in a student art contest, was an abstract depiction of a conflict between the police and residents of St. Louis.The painting had been taken down a few times by Republican lawmakers and left at the office of Representative William Lacy Clay, Democrat of Missouri, who sponsored the piece, before finally appealing to the architect\u2019s office, which oversees the contest, in which student artwork is chosen to hang in a well-traveled hall between the Cannon House Office Building and the Capitol. The architect wrote a letter on Tuesday suggesting that the painting broke contest rules by being too political.\u201cBy his unprecedented and unconstitutional action, following criticism of the artwork by Speaker Ryan and several G.O.P. Members, the Architect of the Capitol acted to suppress the free speech rights of my constituent,\u201d Mr. Clay said, adding that he plans to seek reversal of the architect\u2019s determination.The architect\u2019s office, as is their wont, did not return emails requesting comment.In the new Golf Digest, the Trumps have a magazine cover that rises above the kibitzing.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, called for an investigation. \u201cThis new report makes clear that this isn\u2019t just a couple of questionable trades, but rather a clear and troubling pattern of Congressman Price trading stock and using his office to benefit the companies in which he is investing,\u201d he said.There may be no time for that. But Mr. Price\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings this week before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee, already set to be contentious, what with Medicare and the Affordable Care Act being hot topics, now promise to be scorching.For much of Tuesday, Democratic members of Congress have been proclaiming on social media that no, they will not be attending Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.And this flurry from the head of the Congressional Black Caucus:It is not unusual for members of Congress to skip the festivities, held outdoors on the steps of the Capitol in January. (This year, the weather forecast is for unseasonably warm temperatures, but rain.) What is unusual is the number proclaiming their truancy. If unity is what he wants, Mr. Trump has his work cut out for him.It may be one of the most contentious of the confirmation hearings.President-elect Trump \u2014 not exactly known for his piety \u2014 will be sworn in as the 45th president with not one Bible but two \u2014 the one that Abraham Lincoln used at his first inauguration and his own personal Good Book.Thomas Barrack Jr., who is leading the inaugural committee, said in a statement:In his first inaugural address, President Lincoln appealed to the \u2018better angels of our nature.\u2019 As he takes the same oath of office 156 years later, President-elect Trump is humbled to place his hand on Bibles that hold special meaning both to his family and to our country.Mr. Trump\u2019s Bible was apparently presented to him by his mother upon his graduation from the Sunday Church Primary School at First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, on Children\u2019s Day, June 12, 1955.The late-day confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, a billionaire and Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary, is expected to feature fierce questioning from Democrats over her still-incomplete ethics form.Ms. DeVos, the heiress to an automotive fortune who married into the even more vast fortune of the family that owns Amway, is one of few nominees to go before a Senate panel before completing an ethics questionnaire for the independent Office of Government Ethics addressing her financial holdings. According to prepared remarks, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, will say:I am going to want to learn more about your extensive financial entanglements and potential conflicts of interest. As a billionaire with hundreds, if not thousands, of investments made through complex financial instruments \u2014 many of which are made in ways that are not transparent and hard to track \u2014 you need to make it very clear how you will be avoiding conflicts of interest should you be confirmed. That goes for your investments, as well as the massive web of investments made by your immediate family.Mr. Trump had already upended Republican plans to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act, then replace it several years down the road, by demanding that a new health care law be ready within weeks.Now he is vexing them on taxes. Mr. Trump campaigned hard on a proposal to impose a 35 percent tariff on goods built by American companies abroad, then imported into the United States. Since Republicans are generally opposed to huge tax increases on corporations, congressional leaders had come up with an alternative: \u201cborder adjustment,\u201d under which companies would no longer be able to deduct the cost of goods they import from their taxes or exclude the revenue from exports when calculating taxable income. That would encourage companies to buy parts and materials from American suppliers.\u201cAnytime I hear border adjustment, I don\u2019t love it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBecause usually it means we\u2019re going to get adjusted into a bad deal. That\u2019s what happens.\u201dHe\u2019s not making it easy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sears Agrees to Sell Craftsman to Stanley Black & Decker to Raise Cash", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byBut the response from Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s chief executive, James M. Loree, acknowledged a concern that many on the conference call were likely to have harbored: that Sears could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection someday.\u201cWe expect to get this approved before there is any indication whatsoever that there would be any restructuring of that nature from Sears,\u201d Mr. Loree said, adding that he believed such a move was not imminent.The sale of Craftsman, valued at more than $775 million, was meant to prevent that day of reckoning by raising much-needed cash for Sears.For Sears, selling one of its classic brands \u2014 one it created nearly a century ago \u2014 is the latest move to bolster its balance sheet during a prolonged sales slump.Sears also suffered during the season, with comparable-store sales at its Sears and Kmart units down at least 12 percent.Sears has been in trouble far longer. Under Mr. Lampert, who is also a hedge fund manager, Sears has consistently lagged behind its peers, as analysts said, pointing to underinvestment in stores and slumping sales. Last September, analysts at Moody\u2019s estimated that the company\u2019s negative cash flow for its 2016 fiscal year would be $1.5 billion.As of Oct. 29, Sears had $258 million in cash and equivalents on hand, compared with $3.1 billion in long-term debt, the company said. Its market value Thursday morning, by comparison, was $1.2 billion, even with a jump in its stock price after the Craftsman news. Sears shares surged as much as 8 percent on Thursday, before ending up 0.3 percent on a day when some retail stocks tumbled.Sears has long been dogged by predictions that it would eventually be forced into bankruptcy.But on Thursday, the company listed its latest initiatives for shoring up its cash position, including closing 150 more stores and raising up to $1 billion through a $500 million loan backed by its real estate and a previously announced loan from Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund.\u201cWe are taking strong, decisive actions today to stabilize the company and improve our financial flexibility in what remains a challenging retail environment,\u201d Mr. Lampert, the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, said in a statement.Stanley Black & Decker will be able to sell Craftsman tools in even more outlets. Today, only 10 percent of the product lineup is sold outside Sears stores.\u201cCraftsman is a legendary American brand,\u201d Mr. Loree said in a statement. \u201cThis agreement represents a significant opportunity to grow the market.\u201dReaching the deal took months, as Mr. Loree acknowledged on the analyst call. Last spring, Sears announced that it had hired the banks Citigroup and LionTree as advisers to explore the sale of some of its best-known brands, including Craftsman, DieHard and Kenmore, to raise money.Stanley Black & Decker was one of several dozens of companies approached during the summer about bidding on the tool business. But after the company and its bankers at Deutsche Bank spent time devising a potential takeover bid, Stanley Black & Decker turned its eyes toward buying Newell Brands\u2019 tool business, a deal announced in October.By late fall, however, Sears returned to ask if Stanley Black & Decker would reconsider a bid for Craftsman.Under the deal, Stanley Black & Decker will pay $525 million when the transaction closes, which is expected to occur by year-end, and an additional $250 million at the end of the third year after closing. Sears will also collect a percentage of new Craftsman sales for 15 years after the deal closes. The transaction is now valued at $900 million.\u201cWe literally spent months putting this transaction together and to cover each other\u2019s needs and manage the risk profile for both parties,\u201d Mr. Loree told analysts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Skip the G.M.O.s: Park Slope Food Co-op Fights Over Its Pension Fund", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported bySo it came as a shock last November when the co-op\u2019s 17,100 members learned that its pension fund was stuffed with speculative microcap stocks \u2014 like Intrexon, a company hoping to fight the Zika virus by unleashing genetically modified mosquitoes in the Florida Keys.The pensions are not for co-op members; members must, in fact, work at no pay in exchange for access to the co-op\u2019s much-publicized low prices. The pension plan is for the co-op\u2019s roughly 90 paid employees, including about 20 retirees. It appears to have gone into hedge fund mode years ago, when one co-op member, also a hedge fund investor, made stock-picking his unpaid job.The other members were unaware of this until last summer, when an auditor let fly a bolt from the blue: The fund had racked up two straight years of losses, and the co-op had to pour in more than $1 million to keep it flush.Laid-back co-op members reacted to this news like shareholders stung by an unexplained dividend cut. Some feared a wag-the-dog effect, in which the pension fund would keep losing money and sucking more and more cash away from the co-op as more people retired. Labor costs would rise, and that would be the end of the benefit that drew them all to the co-op in the first place: food prices 20 to 40 percent below those in supermarkets.\u201cDoes the co-op wish to continue on this rather hair-raising course?\u201d asked Mark Kuzmack, a member who aired his views in the co-op\u2019s newspaper, The Linewaiters Gazette, so named because members read it while waiting in line at the registers.The members will vote on a reform proposal on Tuesday evening, at what is expected to be a stormy meeting. The proposal calls for oversight of the co-op\u2019s two pension trustees, who have until now operated on their own. Some of the 90 paid employees suspect \u201coversight\u201d is just a code word for the real agenda: getting rid of their pensions.The co-op\u2019s founding member and general coordinator, Joseph L. Holtz, who is also a trustee, said in an interview that a new layer of oversight was unnecessary. The stocks were recovering nicely from their swoon, he said, and in any case they were all being liquidated and replaced with safer investments.\u201cThe members have clearly spoken, either through their letters or their statements at general meetings, that they\u2019re not interested in investing in that much volatility,\u201d he said.In addition, he said, the pension trustees will stop wearing two hats, serving both as fiduciaries and stock pickers. The trustee responsible for the biotech stocks will step down, once he finishes liquidating the portfolio, a process that will take months.\u201cYou don\u2019t just sell $7 million of stocks overnight,\u201d Mr. Holtz said.The other trustee is George W. Haywood, a professional investor who worked in the past as a hedge fund manager and Lehman Brothers bond trader. He is also a Brooklyn native and a member of the co-op, though now he lives in Washington. Mr. Haywood did not respond to messages requesting comment.\u201cGeorge Haywood is a high-profile Beltway insider,\u201d said Avi Fisher, another of the many co-op members who aired their views in The Linewaiters Gazette. \u201cI am curious why and how we have a relationship with him. It certainly isn\u2019t because there\u2019s a dearth of financial acumen in New York City.\u201dMr. Haywood is the biggest holder of a stock in the pension fund, that of Neptune Technologies and Bioressources. Neptune makes edible oil from krill, a small, shrimplike crustacean, and promotes it as a nutrition supplement superior to fish oil.Some co-op members see a conflict of interest in Mr. Haywood\u2019s roles as a pension trustee, a pension stock picker and the biggest holder of one of those stocks.In December, with controversy swirling around the pension fund, Mr. Haywood told The Linewaiters Gazette that no conflict of interest existed.\u201cOwning stock,\u201d he said at the time, \u201cdoesn\u2019t make you an insider. We\u2019re not trading on any insider information.\u201dHe said he had traded the shares on a public exchange and did not charge any fee for his services.Mr. Holtz recalled that when the pension plan was established, in 1993, there had also been worries about the risks it might pose to the co-op. He said an actuary had set up a schedule of funding and benefit accruals that would make it safe and sustainable, as long as the co-op put in 1 percent of its sales every year. Projected annual growth, of both the co-op\u2019s sales and the pension fund\u2019s investments, would take care of the rest.The academic papers have won respect from specialists, but not much understanding by the public at large.In Park Slope, however, gentrification turns out to have brought not only craft beers, man buns and deluxe baby buggies, but also a cohort of sophisticated finance professionals who still join the co-op for its cheap food.One of them, Jonathan Hessney, went to a recent general meeting armed with his own analysis of the pension investments. He showed that the investments had zigzagged up and down since the crash of 2008 \u2014 but that in the end, the fund would have been better off just holding cash.Mr. Hessney also showed that the co-op had not put in the actuary\u2019s recommended 1 percent of sales every year, presumably because the trustees thought aggressive investments would make the whole plan cheaper. Many people still do.Members at the meeting did not seem to know whom to believe, Mr. Hessney or Mr. Holtz, who is widely revered at Park Slope for devising its free-work-for-cheap-food business model.Mr. Holtz said he predicted that his confidence in the old investment strategy would be borne out on Tuesday, when he plans to reveal the fund\u2019s average annual return from 1993 to the present, a period that includes the biggest bull market in American history.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be over 9 percent,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Did We Take Low Interest Rates for Granted?", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byEditorialBondholders would take a hit because bond prices fall when interest rates rise, but that should not take investors by surprise. Corporations, which have gorged on debt in recent years, are also likely to find rate increases manageable, because many have issued long-term bonds or amassed large cash cushions, thus shielding themselves from rate shocks.But the end of rock-bottom rates represents a huge missed opportunity for generations of Americans. Congress could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 used those near-zero rates to borrow money to rebuild the country\u2019s decrepit infrastructure, which would have sped up the recovery by creating jobs and set the stage for growth long into the future.That chance was squandered. After Republicans won control of the House in 2010, they managed to shift the debate from economic-recovery spending to deficit reduction. They did this despite evidence that the still-weak economy required more, not less, federal aid, and even threatened to default on the national debt unless federal spending was slashed. In 2013 and 2014, the budget was cut so deeply that the government sector subtracted from economic growth. In 2015, the government added nothing to growth. In 2016, it added a smidgen.The result has been a lopsided recovery. Prices for stocks, bonds and real estate, which benefit from monetary stimulus, have surged. Wages, which would have benefited from federal spending to bolster the economy, have lagged, widening the gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else.The policies Donald Trump talked about in the campaign, if enacted, would take a different route to the same disturbing place. For example, deregulation would stimulate the economy \u2014 in part, by removing restraints on reckless lending, borrowing and production. Tax cuts for the rich are likely to send asset prices even higher while worsening the budget deficit.A growing economy accompanied by a growing deficit is a recipe for still higher interest rates. Since Mr. Trump was elected, the yield on a benchmark 10-year Treasury bond has already risen to 2.4 percent from 1.8 percent, a sign that investors expect inflation.With interest rates rising, a big infrastructure plan becomes increasingly less feasible, which reinforces the pro-tax cut, anti-spending attitude of congressional Republicans. This week, top Republicans dismissed the possibility of near-term action on infrastructure, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to make it part of his first-100-days agenda.The Federal Reserve\u2019s policy of rock-bottom rates helped to avert what would have been even greater devastation from the Great Recession. Even now, the Fed should continue to keep rates as low as possible for as long as possible to help bring down underemployment: The number of working people who cannot find full-time hours remains elevated even as unemployment has declined.Still, the Fed cannot by itself repair a badly damaged economy. So the country is in an unhappy position. Interest rates are poised to rise, but there is no credible plan from Mr. Trump for broad and stable prosperity.Advertisement"}

Just months ago, it ruled that a decision tainted by a conflict of interest for a single Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice required reconsideration, even though the ruling had been unanimous.Justice Kennedy acknowledged that a rehearing without the affected justice was an imperfect solution. \u201cJudges who were exposed to a disqualified judge may still be influenced by their colleague\u2019s views when they rehear the case.\u201dBut a partial cure, Justice Kennedy wrote, was better than none.\u201cAllowing an appellate panel to reconsider a case without the participation of the interested member,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwill permit judges to probe lines of analysis or engage in discussions they may have felt constrained to avoid in their first deliberations.\u201dThat is nothing like Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s financial conflict in the patent case. But the principles outlined in Justice Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion were general ones.Chief Justice Roberts dissented in the Pennsylvania case, saying Chief Justice Castille\u2019s failure to disqualify himself may have been unwise but did not violate the Constitution\u2019s due process protections. As a consequence, Chief Justice Roberts did not address how courts should address proceedings tainted by conflicts.One way to do so in the patent case, Life Technologies v. Promega Corporation, No. 14-1538, would be to dismiss it while allowing Life Technologies to refile its petition and seek review from a court in which Chief Justice Roberts is recused from the outset. For all we know, after all, the chief justice supplied the fourth vote needed to hear the case in the first place.\u201cFrom the public perspective, a do-over with Roberts sidelined is the right outcome,\u201d Professor Gillers said. \u201cThe public has an interest in a ruling uninfluenced by Roberts\u2019s participation.\u201d\u201cBut the public doesn\u2019t have a right to be heard,\u201d he added. \u201cThe lawyers have to seek that remedy or they will have waived it. Of course, nothing stops the remaining justices from ordering a do-over in the public interest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Nominees\u2019 Filings Threaten to Overwhelm Federal Ethics Office", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rex W. Tillerson owns more than $50 million of Exxon Mobil stock, has earned an annual salary of $10 million and holds a range of positions \u2014 from director at the Boy Scouts of America to the managing director of a Texas horse and cattle ranch.The nine-page ethics letter detailing Mr. Tillerson\u2019s commitments is the first of hundreds that will be made public in the coming weeks by members of President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and other top political appointees, presenting a historic test of the federal government\u2019s ability to identify conflicts of interest \u2014 and figure out ways to avoid them.Rex W. Tillerson is the first Trump administration cabinet member to complete, and have published, his financial disclosure and ethics agreement. Here are the documents.Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy son-in-law, is in the process of submitting his own forms as he prepares to take a formal White House position, people involved in the process said.\u201cThe Office of Government Ethics is stressed, no doubt about that,\u201d said Robert Rizzi, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson, who represents half a dozen Trump administration nominees going through the process, although he would not name them, citing confidentiality agreements. \u201cThey are having some difficulty keeping up.\u201dAll of the cabinet appointees and hundreds of others must submit a financial disclosure report detailing all the assets they own, their approximate value and income from any source they have made in the last year. Some of the nominees are so wealthy \u2014 and their assets so varied \u2014 there are not enough boxes on the standard form for them, lawyers involved in the process said.The disclosures are then used by the agencies they are to take over, along with the Office of Government Ethics, to identify potential conflicts of interest and to negotiate ethics letters to be signed by the nominees, committing to avoid conflicts of interest.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.At the same time, this class of wealthy incoming officials could save hundreds of millions of dollars in income tax payments, thanks to a special tax benefit created so that affluent Americans do not avoid federal government jobs.The Trump administration, lawyers involved in the effort said, is behind where it should be in this process of disentangling conflicts of interest. This is partly a reflection of the extraordinary complexity of negotiating such conflict of interest agreements for incoming government officials worth hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars.\u201cUsually, you just own a bunch of stocks and bonds, but he\u2019s getting people that own buildings and real estate and stuff you can\u2019t sell,\u201d said Alan Johnson, a New York-based compensation consultant. \u201cHe has Wilbur Ross, who is probably involved in a gazillion different things. I think it is going to be very complicated to try to disentangle all of these things.\u201dMr. Ross is a billionaire investor and former banker who made a fortune in steel, coal, telecommunications and other industries.Under federal law, executive branch employees, including cabinet members, are prohibited from using their positions in the government to enrich themselves, meaning they are not allowed to participate in any particular matter that might directly financially benefit assets they own.The best way to avoid such a conflict, said Lawrence M. Noble, former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, is to sell any assets \u2014 like Exxon Mobil stock or any individual company stock \u2014 and put proceeds into Treasury bonds or mutual funds.\u201cWe don\u2019t want the decisions that these individuals make to be influenced \u2014 in reality, or even appearance \u2014 by their own financial interests,\u201d Mr. Noble said. \u201cThey are working for the American people, and not to enrich themselves or their families.\u201dA list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.For appointees like Mr. Tillerson, the transition to government can have lucrative benefits: They can take advantage of measures in the tax code meant to be an incentive for wealthy people to consider public service jobs. The measure was put in place during the administration of the first President George Bush.Until now, Henry M. Paulson Jr., Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, has been the most prominent example of a public official who has taken advantage of the divestiture certificate. In 2006, Mr. Paulson left Goldman Sachs and sold an estimated $500 million in Goldman stock, deferring taxes on the sale.In his memo, Mr. Tillerson suggested that he was likely to seek such a certificate, and laid out a series of plans to divorce himself from financial engagements, board appointments and Exxon Mobil. This means he will most likely avoid capital gains taxes based on his sale of $50 million in Exxon Mobil stock he owns, as well as shares in more than 150 companies including Airbus and the Walt Disney Company, all of which he has promised to sell off within 90 days of his confirmation, his ethics documents suggest.But a more complicated task involved resolving the fate of two million shares of Exxon Mobil stock, worth about $180 million, that Mr. Tillerson was set to receive over the next decade.Under the terms of the agreement, if Mr. Tillerson, 64, goes back into the oil industry during the next decade, he will forfeit any money left in the account.Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the administration of President George W. Bush, said this provision preventing Mr. Tillerson from returning to the oil industry was unusual and positive, as it removes the incentive for him to take steps while in government that might benefit an industry he planned to return to work for upon his departure.\u201cIt gives up something I had never been able to get from other government officials \u2014 a promise not to go back to an industry from which you came,\u201d Mr. Painter said.Still, some environmental activists say such steps cannot address what they argue will be Mr. Tillerson\u2019s inherent bias in the State Department.\u201cIt is impossible for this man to remove his career, and frankly his personality, from the oil and gas industry,\u201d said Lena Moffitt, director of a Sierra Club campaign trying to reduce the nation\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels. \u201cHe has been knee deep in this industry for more than four decades.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trillion-Dollar Question: Why Don\u2019t More Women Run Mutual Funds?", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byIf you stop to consider who runs the thousands of mutual funds in America, you might conjure up an image of offices full of men. Then your brain might auto-correct to include some fund managers who are women.Equally astounding: Whether here or overseas, the numbers have scarcely budged since 2008.So, in a field where every fraction of a percentage point counts, why would this disparity persist?\u201cWe think of ourselves as a meritocracy in finance, but this begs some hard questions,\u201d said Katherine Collins, chief executive of Honeybee Capital, an independent research firm in Boston.You may be tempted to blame the usual suspects (like industry bias and old-boys\u2019 networks), but there\u2019s no single culprit here. For women, the pipeline into investment management needs repairs and upgrades from start to finish.Based on extensive interviews with people in the industry, it appears that women in college and graduate school would benefit from: greater awareness of asset management jobs and what they entail; better recruitment, clearer entry points; and a culture that supports and rewards the talents women bring to the table.There may even be ways that women can put on their hard hats and help with the pipeline\u2019s construction.Let\u2019s start with awareness. If you\u2019re a young woman in college or getting your M.B.A., how do you set your sights on investment management as a career?Many women simply don\u2019t know these roles are open to them. Men may lack that awareness as well, but there is a specific domino effect here that has an impact on women: The dearth of women in asset management means there are very few role models for young women, which means there are few connections to bring women into these roles, which perpetuates a lack of visibility.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to say, \u2018I want to get my M.B.A. and then go into asset management,\u2019 when you don\u2019t know that option exists,\u201d said Mandana Hormozi, co-manager of the Franklin Mutual Beacon Fund at Franklin Mutual Series, an investment group under Franklin Templeton Investments.Like many women, Ms. Hormozi got her M.B.A. assuming she\u2019d go into investment banking, a field that tends to loom large on the business school radar. Although she eventually made the shift into asset management, she says it is easy for women to miss these opportunities. \u201cThe lack of awareness is huge,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really have to shine a light on it.\u201dMany people are trying. Lakshmi Bhojraj, executive director of the Parker Center for Investment Research at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell, started a Women in Investing conference for M.B.A. students and a similar conference last year for undergraduates. \u201cWe just weren\u2019t seeing enough applicants for our investment management track,\u201d she said.When women realize how male-dominated investment management is, she said, \u201cit can be a bit daunting for them.\u201d The Cornell conferences are meant to give women the opportunity to talk to other women about these jobs, without feeling self-conscious.Why are some women daunted by the idea of pursuing a career in asset management? One possible reason: Few people know what asset managers do. Women in particular may be surprised to learn that the job is just as much about seeing the world, as it is sitting at a desk crunching numbers, said Noriko H. Chen, an equity portfolio manager with the Capital Group in San Francisco. She co-manages its American Funds New Perspective Fund and the American Funds Developing World Growth and Income Fund.Ms. Chen entered college with a nonfinancial career in mind; she was a pre-med major. But her father had always encouraged her to invest, she says, and she had a natural interest in picking stocks. With the money she earned from a part-time job, Ms. Chen invested small amounts in companies whose products she knew well, like computers and ice cream. She gravitated toward jobs with financial companies during the summer. After she graduated, Ms. Chen decided to forgo medicine and move into finance.Many portfolio managers start as research analysts, where they\u2019re assigned to a cover a specific industry. At Capital Group, Ms. Chen began as an infrastructure analyst in Asia, evaluating companies that produced building materials. \u201cI saw a lot of cement plants,\u201d she said, laughing, but said she found the details of the work fascinating. She walked through factories, talked to workers, and met with management teams, distributors and customers to decide whether to recommend buying shares of a company.\u201cYou really have to get out there and kick the tires,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a relationship job.\u201d Analysts can cover an industry for years, she said, building connections that help them dig up insights about a company.Back at her desk, Ms. Chen would build a financial model of each company, helping her decide whether to recommend that portfolio managers invest in it. Once she became a portfolio manager herself, she relied on similar skills, but took on more responsibility. \u201cYou become more of a generalist,\u201d Ms. Chen said, often overseeing many industries and evaluating the recommendations of different research analysts in deciding whether to buy stock for a fund.Some of the work may sound glamorous: traveling the world and pulling the trigger on big investments. But it\u2019s that last part \u2014 actually sinking money into stocks \u2014 where the intimidation factor kicks in for many women. \u201cWhen you buy, you have to put your money where your mouth is,\u201d Ms. Chen said, \u201cand you have to be willing to be wrong.\u201dIn one sense, running an active stock portfolio is a bit like baseball: Winning is important, yes, but winners don\u2019t hit every ball, and portfolio managers don\u2019t always pick winning stocks. \u201cMistakes can be about 40 percent of your job,\u201d Ms. Chen said, \u201cand that can be harder for women, who often want to do things perfectly.\u201d Good portfolio managers typically try to take the long view, she said. They need to assess risk, make choices, endure their mistakes \u2014 and from these, learn to make better choices, Ms. Chen said. \u201cIt\u2019s about resilience.\u201dUnfortunately, many women seem reluctant to enter a field that constantly tests their ability to weather setbacks \u2014 or perhaps they need practice. Stock-picking contests are common at the M.B.A. level. They\u2019re designed to help students practice quantitative assessment in a low-stakes environment. Yet many women just won\u2019t do them, Ms. Chen said.Elissa Sangster, executive director of the Fort\u00e9 Foundation, a nonprofit that helps women start careers in business and finance, speculated that some women may harbor \u201cconcerns about their quantitative readiness,\u201d and thus avoid not only stock-picking competitions, but the financial track altogether.About 36 percent of M.B.A. students are women, up from 32 percent in 2011, according to Fort\u00e9. \u201cBut when you drill down, you see a discrepancy between those pursuing marketing versus finance,\u201d Ms. Sangster said. \u201cOnly about 15 to 20 percent of women M.B.A.s go into finance.\u201dOne of Fort\u00e9\u2019s missions is to encourage women to flex their quantitative muscles. \u201cWe want women managing more capital, and we know that results are being left on the table because they aren\u2019t pursuing these careers,\u201d she said.In addition to building more entry points into the job pipeline, some companies are striving to improve recruitment \u2014 a wonky process in asset management. Because companies in this field typically do not hire as many candidates annually as investment banks do, asset management firms often lack a strong presence on M.B.A. campuses, or start their recruiting after students have already accepted other jobs. So even if you\u2019re interested in asset management, it can be tricky to figure out how to land a job.Again, men may face the same hurdles here, but they are more likely to have an established network of contacts to help them find jobs, says Adrienne R. Martinez, director of corporate and foundation relations at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Ms. Martinez started out on the asset management track in the Cornell M.B.A. program, but says she didn\u2019t see a clear path to a job. In contrast, her fellow investment-banking students, most of them men, had a well-worn road map. \u201cEvery Friday they were on the bus to New York, to network on Wall Street,\u201d she said. \u201cThe second-years told the first-years what to do. It was like a conveyor belt.\u201dAlthough Ms. Martinez did land an asset management job in New York in 2008, she says it was difficult to find a similar job when she relocated to North Carolina in 2013.To remedy the erratic recruitment process that women in particular face, Capital Group, Franklin Templeton, Vanguard and other companies have created programs to attract undergrads, mentor women transitioning from other fields and reach out to female M.B.A.s several years after they graduate.The CFA Institute, which offers the chartered financial analyst credential held by many portfolio managers, started the Alpha and Gender Diversity conference in 2015; it\u2019s now an annual event. Vanguard even offers an onsite internship program with portfolio management groups \u201cso an employee can try it on for size,\u201d Tim Buckley, chief investment officer at Vanguard, wrote in an email.But there is still that elephant in the middle of all this: the reputation of Wall Street itself as a culture that\u2019s unfriendly to women. \u201cHistorically, money management has had a reputation for being a tough environment for women,\u201d Mr. Buckley said.Is it particularly hard on women? Ms. Hormozi doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cIt depends on your personality,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see any reason for intimidation. If you\u2019re in a room with six guys, you have an advantage. I always get my questions answered. But I\u2019m not a wallflower.\u201dStill, many people say that the boys\u2019 club of Wall Street is alive and well, and \u2014 despite all the research on women\u2019s investing acumen \u2014 the financial world isn\u2019t always set up to value women\u2019s skills. \u201cThere is a tendency to reward aggression,\u201d said Ms. Collins of Honeybee Capital, formerly a top portfolio manager at Fidelity for 11 years.For men and women, these are high-paying jobs. The starting salary for a portfolio manager can be in the mid six figures, but a significant chunk of a fund manager\u2019s compensation is paid as a bonus, and that\u2019s where big differences can emerge. Many fund managers are paid on the basis of one-year performance, which can reinforce short-term strategies that go for the big win.In effect, some of the qualities that may make many women successful asset managers \u2014 keeping a cool head, being calculated about taking on risk, taking a long-term view \u2014 can work against them. \u201cWomen often get left out of the limelight, and the dollars follow,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Some companies, like Capital Group, have set up new bonus parameters so that fund managers are rewarded based on one-, three- and eight-year performance. The aim is to provide a greater incentive for all fund managers to think long-term, and to make compensation more \u201cmeritocratic,\u201d Ms. Chen said. Otherwise, she said, some women grow frustrated when they believe they have to \u201cplay the same games or embrace the same hobbies\u201d as male colleagues in order to be recognized. \u201cI like playing golf,\u201d Ms. Chen said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t have time to play golf.\u201dThere\u2019s an issue of attrition as well. Many women shy away from starting financial careers because of the lack of \u201cflexibility,\u201d often a code word for having children. Once you have your M.B.A., you\u2019re likely in your mid-20s or later. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pivotal time, when women want to start a family,\u201d said Ms. Bhojraj of Cornell. \u201cMany women worry that they can\u2019t balance it all, and they\u2019ll want to step off. Firms need to be more creative in coming up with ways to retain them.\u201dThe program places college sophomores and juniors in a 10-week summer training program in asset management that builds awareness of the field, allowing them to make connections, acquire technical investment knowledge and get a feel for what these careers are like.Ultimately, the bottom line is truly about the bottom line \u2014 for financial companies and investors. All-female and mixed-gender teams combined now oversee nearly $3 trillion of mutual fund assets in America, Morningstar says. Considering that greater gender diversity seems to improve performance, it appears that closing the gender gap isn\u2019t just good for women. It\u2019s a potentially terrific investment for everyone.Follow M.P. Dunleavey on Twitter @mpdunleavey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Commerce Pick Wilbur Ross to Divest at Least 80 Holdings", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byWilbur L. Ross, nominated to be the nation\u2019s next commerce secretary, is a very wealthy man with his hands in myriad businesses ranging from banking to energy and real estate loans to the auto parts industry.The billionaire investor, who made much of his money investing in troubled companies, said in a filing released on Tuesday that he will seek to sidestep potential conflicts of interest by divesting at least 80 assets and investment funds over the next several months. He will also step down from positions with more than two-dozen funds or companies in which he has a financial interest. Mr. Ross, 79, also intends to divest himself of holdings in many of those entities.The day before Mr. Ross is to appear before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation for his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the federal Office of Government Ethics released his 57-page disclosure statement detailing his extensive financial holdings. By Tuesday afternoon, the ethics agency had posted an agreement it has with Mr. Ross spelling out his plans for divestiture of holdings that could pose a conflict with running the Commerce Department.The filings reveal that Mr. Ross holds board positions with 82 companies or foundations \u2014 many of the businesses are associated with WL Ross and Company, his private equity firm, which is a division of Invesco. The filing notes that Mr. Ross has an art collection valued at over $50 million; $150 million in cash in several brokerage accounts; and a wide assortment of stocks and bonds.The filing lists Mr. Ross as having assets ranging from $337 million to $687 million and income between $16 million and $55 million. The figures include some assets and income from his wife.The disclosure filing and ethics agreement note that unvested shares received as part of his compensation at Invesco will vest shortly after he leaves the firm.Mr. Ross sold his firm in 2006 to Invesco, an Atlanta-based investment company, for about $375 million. In recent years, he has pulled back on the daily operations of the business.To remove the potential for conflict, Mr. Ross said in the ethics agreement that he will resign from WL Ross and a number of Invesco affiliates. But Mr. Ross does intend to retain unpaid positions in several companies that own personal residences. He also plans to retain financial interests in seven investment vehicles, including one involved with the shipping industry.The financial disclosure probably understates Mr. Ross\u2019s net worth because it does not place a value on the underlying assets held by many of the investment funds in which he has stakes. Mr. Ross is one of several wealthy business people President-elect Donald J. Trump has nominated to join his cabinet. Mr. Trump\u2019s choices have been criticized for being at odds with the populist tone of his presidential campaign.Mr. Ross\u2019s selection has drawn scrutiny because he has bought struggling companies \u2014 some already in bankruptcy \u2014 and tried to breathe new life into them by using strategies that included layoffs and reworking of union contracts and benefit packages.During the confirmation hearing, Mr. Ross is likely to be asked about job losses at some of the steel companies, coal companies and auto parts companies that he has managed through his firm. He may face questions about his firm\u2019s overseas investments. He is vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, the biggest bank in that European island nation.Mr. Trump is expected to lean on Mr. Ross to help shape trade policy. In the past, Mr. Ross has supported Mr. Trump\u2019s call to rework trade deals with foreign countries.Yet Mr. Ross has located plants in other countries. Mr. Ross is chairman of International Automotive Components Group, an auto parts manufacturer with facilities in Mexico, a country that has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-trade barbs.In the filing, he said that about 90 days after being sworn-in as commerce secretary, he will assign the rights to annual payments he receives from a profit-sharing plan at Rothschild, a company he used to work for, to a public charity. He said he receives \u201capproximately \u201c$1,000 a year in distributions from this plan.\u201dSarah Cohen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dow Hit 20,000. Now What?", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byYes, it is just another number.But in an industry that lives and dies by the power (seen and unseen) of sums in all their varieties, that the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 20,000 on Wednesday was enough to give even the most hardened stock market watchers reason to smile. The Dow finished the day at 20,068.51.\u201cIt blows me away,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management. \u201cI can remember when people wondered if we would ever get through Dow 1,000. It\u2019s amazing \u2014 we are up 20-fold in my career.\u201dAnd that is a big deal, Mr. Paulsen explained, because it means that for all the worry and doubts that have sprung from the market collapses in 1987, 2000 and 2008, if investors just held to a core portfolio of large American stocks they would have done pretty well.Of course, the usual caveats apply.It is also true that the Dow represents just 30 companies \u2014 including stalwarts like Goldman Sachs, Apple and Walmart \u2014 compared with the 500 that make up the Standard & Poor\u2019s index or the 2,000 of the Russell market tracker.After all, from the perspective of a financial adviser seeking maximum diversification for a client, an E.T.F. that tracks just 30 stocks is not as compelling as the alternatives that represent a broader swath of the American economy.The E.T.F.s that follow the S.& P. 500 and the Russell 2000 turn over 92 million and 32 million shares, respectively.Still, even if the power of 20,000 is more psychological than quantifiable, that should not necessarily weaken its punch, especially today when there are so many different forms of media that can advertise the accomplishment.\u201cI think it is meaningful,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, an independent and longstanding market strategist. \u201cNo matter what your politics are or what fears you may have \u2014 this index is one of the more reliable indicators we have in terms of where the economy is heading.\u201dAs did Mr. Paulsen, Mr. Yardeni underscores the durability factor in describing why 20,000 should be recognized.It is this very point, however, that worries some market seers.\u201cIt has taken over 17 years to get here,\u201d said David Kelly, head of global strategy at JP Morgan Asset Management. \u201cWe hit 10,000 on a wave of enthusiasm but we have had to climb a wall of worry all the way up to 20,000.\u201dMr. Kelly makes some cautionary points in terms of urging investors not to get carried away with the number.The recent postelection surge toward 20,000 has been driven by what investors are calling a reflation trade, or a bet that the economy under President Trump will benefit from proposed tax cuts and a move toward more aggressive government spending. Earlier Wednesday, responding to an Associated Press report on Twitter that the index had traded above 20,000 for the first time, Mr. Trump sent a tweet from the president\u2019s official Twitter account that said, \u201cGreat!\u201dPeople should also be aware, Mr. Kelly said, that expected cuts in capital gains taxes has kept many investors from taking profits during the rally. The thought being, that if they were to wait several months, they could dump their stocks and face a lighter tax bill in the process.\u201cThe exit door is jammed,\u201d he said.Mr. Kelly also warns that this rally has been unusually focused on the United States. This will be the fourth consecutive year that domestic stocks have outperformed their counterparts in overseas markets \u2014 developed and emerging.Such a streak is rare indeed, and it highlights the extent to which the dollar\u2019s strong run of late has bolstered the market\u2019s performance.Then there are the \u201cperma-bears\u201d who see Dow 20,000 as just the latest sign that the end is nigh.Mr. Stockman disputes the notion, embraced today by stock market bulls, that Mr. Trump can cut taxes and increase government spending while leaving Medicare and Social Security alone without creating a debt and deficit crisis.And he is putting his money where his mouth is. Since the election, he has made bets that the market will fall sharply from these levels.\u201cThis is the greatest short of all time,\u201d Mr. Stockman said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morgan Stanley Nearly Doubled Profit From Year Earlier Fourth Quarter", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsMorgan Stanley roared in the fourth quarter, but it also exposed the limits of animal spirits. The bank led by James Gorman almost doubled its profit in the period from a year earlier to $1.7 billion. As at rivals, though, return on equity remains subpar.Some banking businesses do not fare well when too much hangs in the balance, as occurred with an OPEC meeting, an Italian constitutional referendum and the American election late last year. Fees from new stock sales, for example, fell 5 percent from the third quarter at Morgan Stanley, 19 percent at JPMorgan Chase and 34 percent at Bank of America.Trading desks ought to have been reaping the benefit from market mood swings. They certainly performed better in last year\u2019s final quarter than during the same span in 2015. Morgan Stanley\u2019s fixed-income, currency and commodities dealers raked in, at $1.5 billion, nearly three times as much revenue.The results even dipped a bit from the usually slower summer months, though the bank did better than JPMorgan. Equity trading revenue improved for Morgan Stanley, the market leader, but fell at its two big investment banking rivals, even though the S.&P. 500 Index rose more than 7 percent between the election and the end of the year.Profitability also remains subdued. With annualized return on equity of 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter, Mr. Gorman is inching toward his 2017 goal of 9 percent to 11 percent. For now, Morgan Stanley keeps failing to cover its cost of capital, generally assumed to be 10 percent for large banks.Business may pick up in time, but that story has been told for years. What could power earnings is largely beyond Wall Street\u2019s control: more and faster interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve and financial rule changes from Washington.Morgan Stanley is well placed to benefit from both. It is growing its lending business and its mostly domestic wealth-management unit accounts for an increasing share of the company\u2019s profit. With a capital ratio of 16.8 percent, the bank holds more excess than rivals and thus has plenty to return to shareholders if regulators allow.The prospect of such benefits, rather than increased revenue, has helped lift Morgan Stanley\u2019s share price by almost 30 percent since Donald J. Trump was elected president. Investors may need to hold their horses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.E.C. Inertia on Paybacks Adds to Investor Harm", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byFair GameWhen securities laws are broken and investors get hurt, the Securities and Exchange Commission often rides to the rescue, using its regulatory muscle to extract penalties that can be returned to victims.But as a cadre of harmed Citigroup investors is learning, it is one thing to persuade a wrongdoer to pay reparations and quite another to disburse the money.This particular matter dates to August 2015, when the S.E.C. struck a settlement with Citigroup over an exotic investment strategy involving municipal bonds that the bank sold to clients from 2002 to 2008.Receiving reparations in cases like these is a multistep process that the S.E.C. details on the site. Typically, restitution funds sit in an account at the United States Treasury. Disbursement is generally overseen by outside entities appointed by the S.E.C.; their fees are paid by the institution providing the funds.Fair funds were established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; they allow the S.E.C. to exact civil penalties in addition to recovering ill-gotten gains, a process known as disgorgement.The S.E.C. website shows that the Citigroup case is one of roughly 80 fair fund and disgorgement plans currently operating. Another 60 or so plans have been terminated; this means they have finished distributing the money to investors. Any amounts left over go to the Treasury or an S.E.C. investor protection fund.But the pace of the Citigroup restitution plan seems especially glacial. And it raises questions about how these plans are administered and whether those overseeing them are rewarded for slowing down the process.At the time of the settlement, the S.E.C. said a plan of distribution to harmed investors would be submitted \u201cwithin 120 days of payment in full\u201d by Citigroup. That payment was made in August 2015, a bank spokeswoman said.And yet, 500 days later, there\u2019s still no plan of distribution.I asked the S.E.C. what was causing the holdup. Judith Burns, a spokeswoman, declined to comment.Lawyers for the aggrieved investors say they are losing patience. \u201cTo me, it comes down to a bureaucratic quagmire of indifference and concealment,\u201d said Steven B. Caruso, a lawyer at Maddox Hargett & Caruso in New York City. \u201cThere is simply no transparency in this process, and no effort being made by the S.E.C. to recognize that these are funds that belong to other people.\u201dBecause many of the investors are subject to confidentiality agreements, they were wary about discussing their concerns.Then more silence.Of course, it isn\u2019t simple returning money to wronged investors. Determining who deserves how much of a settlement\u2019s proceeds, and locating those people, is complicated. Needless to say, recovering some losses, even if it\u2019s pennies on the dollar and many years later, is better than never receiving a thing.Even though the case involved just one recipient, it took 15 months from start to finish.I asked the S.E.C. how long each fair fund process takes, and got a partial answer.But these figures don\u2019t take into account the time between an S.E.C. settlement and a plan\u2019s approval, which can be many years. In the $40 million mutual fund case dating to 2001, for example, it took eight years for the fund to be approved.Mr. Caruso said he had tried repeatedly to get answers about what was happening with the fund. At first, the S.E.C. told him it was waiting to get the list of investors from Citigroup. Then, an agency official suggested he try Garden City Group, which he did.\u201cEvery time I would call, somebody else would call me back to say, \u2018We really don\u2019t have a timetable, and we don\u2019t have a lot of information,\u2019\u201d Mr. Caruso recalled.I asked Stephen Cirami, chief operating officer of Garden City Group, about the status of the fund. He did not return my voice mail message or email.I had hoped to learn how Garden City Group gets paid for its services. For example, is it incentivized to move quickly in distributing the funds, or is it paid more the longer the process takes?It is Citigroup, not the investors, paying these costs. But an inefficient process means investors are hurt twice.\u201cThat $180 million should be back in people\u2019s pockets, not sitting in some account somewhere,\u201d Mr. Caruso said. \u201cThe bottom line is, there\u2019s no accountability.\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Pounce on Best Credit Card Offers (Before Banks Pull Them)", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyWhile many of us weren\u2019t paying attention, some credit card sign-up bonuses became so eye-poppingly large that the analysts at Bernstein Research wondered in November if the industry was afflicted with temporary insanity.But the mere existence of four-figure bonuses on top of the points and perks that come with everyday spending raises a number of questions for consumers.Even if you thought you had had enough of card-hopping to get the best deals, shouldn\u2019t you at least grab those 15 100-dollar bills if you have the means? Or might the offers actually get better? And is it time to bet against the stocks of the maniac bankers who are tossing around offers like this?The card has a $450 annual fee, but it gives back $300 of it each year once you purchase at least that amount in travel. It also gives out a generous amount of points \u2014 three per dollar spent \u2014 on travel and dining. Plus, you can swap points for miles on many airlines if you want to take your chances with seat availability in those reward schemes. Other perks include access to some airport lounges and a rebate for fees you pay for TSA PreCheck, the expedited security screening, or Global Entry, which speeds international returns.So should you take advantage of it while you can? My wife and I both have done it and are glad we did. It has required some mental energy to channel the right amount of spending away from our current card and track the new bills so we don\u2019t end up paying late. But there is nothing that focuses the mind quite like feeling that you are beating the system.Leah Gerstner, an American Express spokeswoman, noted that the company had been in the premium card market for more than three decades, implying that it knew a thing or two about appropriate competitive responses to the latest shiny thing.\u201cWhat\u2019s worked for us is a mix of targeted sign-up bonuses combined with a range of premium benefits and services,\u201d Ms. Gerstner said. She added that the company had issued \u201crecord levels of new cards\u201d while delivering \u201csustainable\u201d economics to the company.In their report in November, the Bernstein Research analysts dangled the tantalizing possibility that American Express might begin some kind of price war, throwing its own sky-high bonuses and privileges at customers.Now that Chase has lowered its sign-up bonus, however, Kevin J. St. Pierre, a Bernstein managing director, thinks the chances of that are low.\u201cThey have inertia on their side, with a long-tenured customer base that is generally satisfied with their product and very satisfied with the service,\u201d he said. \u201cSo how much do they need to tweak to defend that?\u201dChase would not comment about the performance of Sapphire Reserve, owing to the requirement to stay silent before its coming earnings announcement. Still, it almost certainly modeled the possibility that some people would spend their 100,000-point bonus and then stop using the card. The card\u2019s long-term profitability will depend largely on what percentage of cardholders carry a balance \u2014 and how much and for how long.Mr. St. Pierre said he didn\u2019t lose much sleep over a single, too-generous card offering from a bank of this size. \u201cThey are so large that they can afford to experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cA few hundred million in any quarter is a cost of doing business, and they\u2019ll use it, learn from it and improve the product from their perspective and move on.\u201dTwitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}

He was 91.His son Michael said the cause was heart failure.Mr. Lilly began fishing as a young boy in Manhattan, Mont., where he was influenced by his father\u2019s tales of trout fishing in his native California. After his father closed up his barbershop for the day, the two of them would fish.In time, Mr. Lilly\u2019s youthful fascination with trout became a life\u2019s work. He became a guide on the Madison, Gallatin and Yellowstone rivers; the owner of a renowned trout shop in West Yellowstone, Mont.; and an author, preaching the joys of casting artificial flies into rivers and streams.\u201cI was always engaged by the instant of the strike,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography, published in 1988. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many thousands of trout I\u2019ve taken since. I still have the same excitement when I put a fly over a trout and a miracle happens.\u201dAnd, until the early 1960s, he viewed trout as a reward to be eaten, not as a natural resource that could be imperiled.\u201cLife was simple,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou caught a big fish; you killed it. Only an idiot would let it go.\u201dBut he eventually changed his mind. He heard about catch and release from fishermen from Michigan and made it his cause, reasoning that the popularity of fly-fishing in Montana might deplete the stocks of trout. He created a catch-and-release club in his shop, selling fishermen silver buttons that boasted of their releases of trout of various lengths.\u201cThe club caught on and a lot of anglers wore one or more buttons on his/her vest,\u201d Paul Schullery, a friend who co-wrote Mr. Lilly\u2019s books, said in an email. \u201cPresumably, the button kind of replaced the trout as the \u2018trophy.\u2019\u201dMr. Lilly\u2019s reputation in Montana as a fisherman, retailer and outfitter helped persuade reluctant anglers that they could change their behavior.\u201cHe had a megaphone, and people picked up on what he said,\u201d Bruce Farling, executive director of Montana Trout Unlimited, a conservation group, said in an interview. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only voice, but he was probably the most prominent one.\u201dWalen Francis Lilly II was born in Manhattan, Mont. \u2014 \u201con the kitchen table,\u201d he said \u2014 on Aug. 13, 1925, to Walen Lilly, a barber, and the former Violet Collins, a homemaker.Fishing and baseball were young Bud\u2019s passions. As a teenager, he played for a local men\u2019s baseball team against a squad of black players, and, as he told the story, hit a single off the legendary pitcher Satchel Paige. He was talented enough, he said, to attract the attention of the Cincinnati Reds. But service in the Navy during World War II interrupted his baseball dreams.Mr. Lilly\u2019s conversion to catch and release was one element of his conservation work. He also worked to end Montana\u2019s practice of planting hatchery trout in rivers \u2014 which let fishermen increase their catches \u2014 to allow wild trout to thrive.In recent years, Mr. Lilly\u2019s vision was diminished by macular degeneration, and he could no longer fish.\u201cBut he\u2019d sit on the bank with lots of advice,\u201d his son Michael said.In addition to Michael, he is survived by another son, Gregory; a daughter, Annette Lilly Russ; a stepson, Chris Lilly; a stepdaughter, Alisa Flores; his second wife, the former Esther Neufeld; five grandchildren; and two step-grandchildren.Mr. Lilly was known as a raconteur whose conversations often began with a joke. Last year, his stepson told his Facebook followers to visit him for a chat on the porch of his father\u2019s home, a converted boardinghouse, in Three Forks, Mont.\u201cChances are he\u2019s out front, taking in some vitamin D,\u201d Chris Lilly wrote, \u201cand waiting for a chance to talk about fishing or what it was like to be an officer in the Navy at age 19 during WWII.\u201dAn obituary on Monday about the conservationist Bud Lilly omitted several survivors. A stepson, Chris Lilly; a stepdaughter, Alisa Flores; and two step-grandchildren also survive him. In addition, the obituary misidentified the author of a 2016 Facebook post inviting people to visit Mr. Lilly. It was his stepson, Chris \u2014 not his son Gregory.Advertisement"}

Here are key moments from today:\u25a0 Representative Tom Price of Georgia, nominated to be health and human services secretary, defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company during his time in Congress. \u201cThe reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,\u201d he said.\u25a0 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, lamented \u201cthe hyper-politicization of the nomination process.\u201d\u25a0 Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the nominee for budget director, said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities.\u25a0 The toughest questions that Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending and appeared to be shocked when Mr. Mulvaney could not remember those votes.\u25a0 Linda E. McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment and Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Small Business Administration, said her entrepreneurial background suited her for the job.\u25a0 Ms. McMahon assured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations.The findings emerged from a review of Mr. Price\u2019s tax returns and other official documents by committee staff members from both parties.In a questionnaire in December, the committee staff said, Mr. Price understated the value of 400,613 shares of the Australian company that he purchased in August 2016 through \u201ca private placement offering.\u201dThe value of the shares was listed on the questionnaire as $50,000 to $100,000, but that reflected the purchase price, the staff reported. At the request of the committee, Mr. Price recalculated the value of his holdings to reflect their market price. The revised value was $100,000 to $250,000.In addition, the committee staff said, Mr. Price \u201ctook improper deductions on his 2016 tax returns\u201d for the depreciation of land associated with condominiums that he owns in Washington and Nashville.Moreover, the staff said, Mr. Price and his wife, both physicians, claimed \u201cmiscellaneous employment deductions totaling $19,034\u201d for various expenses in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Neither Mr. Price nor his wife work as a physician, the staff report said, and \u201cproper documentation could not be located,\u201d so Mr. Price\u2019s tax returns will be amended to remove the $19,034 in deductions.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, questioned Mr. Price over his trades of health care stocks during his time in Congress.\u201cIt is hard to see this as anything but a conflict of interest and an abuse of position,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.In particular, Mr. Wyden pressed Mr. Price over his investments in Innate Immunotherapeutics, which the senator said could be affected by legislation that comes before Congress.Mr. Price said he had done nothing wrong.\u201cThe reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,\u201d he said.Just how involved is Mr. Price as the Trump administration plots how it will replace the Affordable Care Act?Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, tried to find out.\u201cPresident Trump said he\u2019s working with you on a replacement plan for the A.C.A., which is nearly finished and will be revealed after your confirmation,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that he said that, yes,\u201d Mr. Price responded, drawing laughter in the hearing room.\u201cNot that he\u2019s ever done this before, but did the president lie?\u201d Mr. Brown asked. He added: \u201cI know we don\u2019t use the word lie here, because we\u2019re polite, when presidents say statements that aren\u2019t true. But did he lie to the public about working with you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with the president about health care, yes,\u201d Mr. Price replied.Senator Hatch lamented \u201cthe hyper-politicization of the nomination process.\u201d He said Democrats\u2019 attacks on Mr. Price\u2019s ethics were \u201cspecious and distorted.\u201dHe said lawmakers should not \u201cinvent new standards for finances, ethics and disclosure that are different from those that have generally applied in the past.\u201d\u201cNone of those who say they oppose Dr. Price\u2019s nomination seem to be talking about whether he is qualified,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, also came to Mr. Price\u2019s defense. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been asked to be a character witness in a felony trial in the sentencing phase of a conviction,\u201d he said. He called Mr. Price \u201can honorable man.\u201dMr. Mulvaney said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities if he were confirmed as Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director.\u201cI believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said in prepared remarks to be delivered to the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cI also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy.\u201dWhile Mr. Mulvaney is a big believer in spending cuts, he made it clear that he wanted to protect America\u2019s social safety nets. \u201cA strong, healthy economy allows us to protect our most vulnerable,\u201d he said.Mr. Mulvaney was asked about his failure to pay nanny taxes in his opening question, and said that it had been an innocent mistake.\u201cIn 2000, we had triplets. When we came home, we hired someone to help my wife, to help take care of the children,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cIn my mind, she was a babysitter.\u201dHe added, \u201cI did not consider her a household employee for purposes of withholding.\u201dMr. Mulvaney said he had realized his error when filling out a questionnaire related to his nomination to be Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director. He said that he had quickly notified his accountant, the president and his colleagues so that he could correct the mistake.The toughest questions Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came not from a Democrat but from Senator McCain.He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending, and appeared shocked when he could not remember those votes.\u201cBoy, I\u2019ll tell you, I would remember if I voted to cut our defenses the way you did, congressman,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t take it with the seriousness that it deserves.\u201dMr. McCain was also unimpressed with Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s explanation for wanting to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan. After giving the congressman a history lesson on the roots of the Sept. 11 attacks, he offered a final note of disapproval.\u201cI am deeply concerned about your lack of support for our military,\u201d he said.Mr. Mulvaney was forced to address suggestions he had made in the past that Social Security was akin to a Ponzi scheme, and he played down that characterization.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t read too much into it, as describing it as a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he said, explaining that he had merely been referring to the fact that the program takes money from people and gives it to other people.As for keeping the program solvent, Mr. Mulvaney said he would not recommend cuts that would cause current retirees to lose benefits. However, he said that he could see raising the age for receiving benefits in the future.Ms. McMahon reassured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations, promising to work to put in place \u201cthe right regulations\u201d to spur economic growth if she is confirmed as head of the Small Business Administration.Senator Jim Risch, the Idaho Republican who leads the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said the regulatory structure of government today was \u201cstrangling businesses.\u201dMs. McMahon presented herself not as the billionaire former chief executive of W.W.E. but instead as an entrepreneur who had weathered the most difficult moments of building a business from the ground up.\u201cSmall businesses want to feel they can take a risk on expansion or a new hire without fearing onerous new regulations or unexpected taxes, fees and fines that will make such growth unaffordable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to renew optimism in our economy.\u201dIntroduced and endorsed by the two Democrats who defeated her in her failed Senate bids in Connecticut \u2014 Senators Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy \u2014 Ms. McMahon seems likely to sail to confirmation, with the committee expected to approve her next week. The introduction and endorsement of a Republican nominee by two Democratic senators is unusual at the outset of a confirmation hearing.Mr. Murphy, who defeated Ms. McMahon in 2012, expressed \u201cconfidence that she is going to give good, sound counsel to President Trump.\u201d\u201cI saw firsthand the fight that Linda brings to any endeavor she takes on,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Mr. Price, a Georgia Republican, denied any wrongdoing.He also avoided being pinned down on the future of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid, programs that insure more than 100 million people.While Mr. Price faced vigorous questioning from Democrats, he and other cabinet nominees have benefited from solid support among Republicans, who hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate.But some nominees had bipartisan support.

Ross for commerce secretary and Ben Carson for secretary of housing and urban development.Linda McMahon, selected by Mr. Trump to lead the Small Business Administration, also sailed through her confirmation hearing. She was introduced and endorsed by the senators from her home state, Connecticut: Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy, both Democrats.The endorsements were notable because Ms. McMahon ran for the Senate and was defeated by Mr. Blumenthal in 2010 and Mr. Murphy in 2012.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Even as some nominees advanced, Republicans were becoming frustrated and angry. They said Democrats were delaying and prolonging the reviews, raising procedural objections without changing the likely outcome.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, accused the Democrats of \u201cobstruction and foot-dragging\u201d and said they were \u201cattempting to litigate or re-litigate the election.\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said: \u201cThe president won an election. He deserves to get his people in place.\u201dThe hard feelings felt to some like payback. Democrats noted that Republicans had stalled many of President Barack Obama\u2019s picks and refused to act on his nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court.In the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Democrats held up confirmation votes for two nominees: Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana for interior secretary and former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas for energy secretary. The Democrats said they had unanswered questions about important research programs at the Energy Department.Democrats on the Finance Committee put Mr. Price through three and a half hours of grueling interrogation. But they appeared unlikely to block his confirmation unless other damaging information comes to light.\u201cWe\u2019ve always known where the votes are,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the committee. The panel could vote next week on whether to recommend confirmation, with its Republican majority strongly supporting Mr. Price.Mr. Wyden asked Mr. Price if he would promise that no one would be worse off and no one would lose coverage as a result of the order. Mr. Price declined to provide an explicit assurance. He promised instead to work with Congress to \u201cmake certain that we have the highest-quality health care and that every single American has access to affordable coverage.\u201dSenator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said the administration appeared to be planning a \u201cwar on Medicaid.\u201d Mr. Price rejected that description, saying he wanted to give states more control over Medicaid, which covers more than 70 million low-income people.Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, asked Mr. Price for a commitment that any replacement for the Affordable Care Act would allow states to continue the expansion of Medicaid eligibility already approved by Nevada and 30 other states.Mr. Price deferred to Congress, saying, \u201cThis is a policy question that needs to be worked out through both the House and the Senate.\u201d He said he wanted to ensure that people \u201cwho are currently covered through Medicaid expansion either retain that coverage or in some way have coverage through a different vehicle.\u201dIn any event, he said, \u201cevery single individual ought to be able to have access to coverage.\u201dHe added that many people had Medicaid coverage but could not find doctors to treat them.\u201cOne out of three physicians who ought to be able to see Medicaid patients in this nation do not take any Medicaid patients\u201d because of low reimbursement rates, burdensome regulations or the \u201chassle factor,\u201d Mr. Price said.That answer did not satisfy Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, which is home to more than four million Medicare beneficiaries. \u201cIf I gave them that answer,\u201d Mr. Nelson said, \u201cI would get run out of the room with a group of senior citizens.\u201dA background investigation of Mr. Price found that he had understated the value of his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company and claimed income tax deductions that he could not substantiate. The findings emerged from a review of his tax returns and other official documents by Finance Committee staff members from both parties.In a questionnaire in December, the staff said, Mr. Price understated the value of 400,613 shares of the Australian company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, that he purchased in August through \u201ca private placement offering.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how this can be anything but a conflict of interest and an abuse of his position,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. But Mr. Price said that he did not have any \u201cnonpublic information\u201d about the company. And the committee chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said the Democrats\u2019 attacks on Mr. Price\u2019s ethics were \u201cspecious and distorted.\u201dThe committee staff added that Mr. Price had taken \u201cimproper deductions on his 2016 tax returns\u201d for the depreciation of land associated with condominiums he owns in Washington and Nashville. He and his wife, both physicians, also claimed \u201cmiscellaneous employment deductions totaling $19,034\u201d for expenses in 2013, 2014 and 2015, the staff said. But \u201cproper documentation could not be located,\u201d so his returns will be amended.Thomas Kaplan and Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

When Christopher Murphy asked whether she would agree that schools are no place for guns, she did not give the obvious right answer to a Democratic senator whose state suffered the horrendous Sandy Hook massacre (\u201cSenator, there is no place for guns in schools\u201d).

{"Headline": "Port Authority Will Pay $400,000 to Settle Federal Securities Charges", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey violated federal securities laws when it borrowed money to repair a bridge and roads in New Jersey that its lawyers thought were beyond its bounds, securities regulators said on Tuesday.The agency, which operates bridges, tunnels and airports in and around New York City, agreed to pay a $400,000 fine in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The commission, which polices sales of stocks and bonds, said the Port Authority had admitted to wrongdoing in the matter, making it the first issuer of municipal bonds to do so.But John J. Degnan, the chairman of the Port Authority, said the agency had not admitted to willful wrongdoing, only to negligence in its failure to disclose all of the risks faced by buyers of its bonds. \u201cI was shocked when I saw the release,\u201d Mr. Degnan said, referring to the commission\u2019s announcement of the settlement.A lawyer representing the Port Authority, James Sottile, sent a letter to the commission demanding a retraction of its news release.Mr. Degnan also questioned the timing of the announcement, which came just as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was delivering his State of the State address in Trenton. For Mr. Christie, it was another case of intrigue involving a bridge that could tarnish his legacy.A spokesman for the governor referred a request for comment to the Port Authority.But Port Authority lawyers were leery of that proposed shift, saying the alternative projects did not fall within the agency\u2019s purview. An internal Port Authority memo at the time said, \u201cThere is no clear path to legislative authority to undertake such projects.\u201dOne big problem was that the projects involved roadways that carry vehicles to and from the Holland Tunnel, which connects New Jersey to Lower Manhattan. The Port Authority operates the tunnel, but according to one of its internal memos, there was no law that allowed it to \u201cconstruct, own, maintain or operate any of the approaches to the Holland Tunnel.\u201dHowever, it was permitted to work on roads leading to the Lincoln Tunnel, which connects New Jersey to Midtown Manhattan and which the agency also operates.So, before the Port Authority\u2019s commissioners voted in March 2011 to authorize the road projects, the agency adopted the view that the roads in question also led to the Lincoln Tunnel. An internal memo proposed a \u201ctraffic study\u201d to bolster that position.That was more than two years before allies of Mr. Christie at the Port Authority told tales of another traffic study. That study was the purported reason for the September 2013 closing of lanes of traffic that led to tollbooths at the George Washington Bridge.Neither the commissioners of the Port Authority nor investors were ever informed of the internal debate over the legality of using Port Authority money for the road projects, the securities commission said. From 2012 to 2014, the Port Authority raised $116 million through bond sales whose proceeds were intended for the road projects, the commission added.\u201cThe Port Authority represented to investors that it was authorized to issue bonds while not disclosing significant known risks that its actions were not legally permitted,\u201d said Andrew M. Calamari, director of the commission\u2019s New York office.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australian Drug Maker Has Low Profile but Powerful Backers in Washington", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Innate Immunotherapeutics is a tiny pharmaceutical company from Australia that has no approved drugs and no backing from flashy venture capital firms, and trades for just over a dollar a share on the Australian Stock Exchange. More than once, the company has run out of money and nearly closed its doors.Other Washington power players with investments in the company include Michael Hook, Mr. Collins\u2019s chief of staff, who is a top shareholder, and Bill Paxon, a Washington lobbyist and former congressman, according to company filings and congressional financial disclosures. Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon bought the stock at a discount as part of a private offering organized by Innate aimed at \u201csophisticated U.S. investors.\u201d They have since quintupled their money, at least on paper.Representatives of Mr. Price and Mr. Collins say they have not broken any rules, but what has puzzled Washington and industry insiders alike is how a no-name Australian biotech, with only one experimental multiple sclerosis drug under development, attracted a coterie of Washington investors, including the man who is likely to become the next health secretary.A spokesman for Mr. Collins said the congressman had followed all ethical guidelines and said Innate was one of many companies he had been involved in. \u201cHe is very proud of the progress the company has made over the years and hopeful it will be able to develop a potentially lifesaving treatment for the millions of individuals suffering from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,\u201d said the spokesman, Michael McAdams.In an interview this week in San Francisco, Innate\u2019s chief executive, Simon Wilkinson, seemed amused at all of the attention now being paid to what he described as his \u201clittle biotech at the wrong end of the world.\u201dTheir goal, they said, is to sell the company to a larger pharmaceutical company.\u201cIt won\u2019t be up to us to seek approval for the drug,\u201d Mr. Wilkinson said in the interview, which took place at his hotel on a rundown block in San Francisco, where he was pitching the company to potential buyers at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference.Like many biotech start-ups, Innate has had ups and downs, Mr. Wilkinson said. \u201cBut sometimes, things happen,\u201d he added. In his case, he said, \u201cI met Chris.\u201dMr. Wilkinson said he was on a fund-raising trip to the United States in 2005 when the two met, and he made his pitch to Mr. Collins, who was then a businessman with a reputation for turning around struggling companies. Mr. Collins decided to invest in the company, eventually joining its board.In 2007, Mr. Collins was elected county executive of Erie County, which includes Buffalo, and in 2012, he won election to Congress. He remained on Innate\u2019s board, and Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Quinn said his new political career has had little impact.\u201cIf anything, I suspect it\u2019s probably a negative,\u201d Mr. Quinn said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s a bit harder to access \u2014 he\u2019s just busy.\u201dMr. Collins remained one of the company\u2019s top cheerleaders, enlisting many of his associates as investors and even lending the company money a handful of times when it was at risk of going out of business.Today, many of Innate\u2019s biggest shareholders have ties to Mr. Collins. They include two of his adult children, Caitlin and Cameron, who are the company\u2019s third- and fourth-biggest shareholders, as well as several Buffalo businessmen who have donated to his political campaigns, according to company filings and campaign finance disclosures. Lindy Ruff, the head coach of the Dallas Stars hockey team and a former player and coach for the Buffalo Sabres, is also an investor.Innate\u2019s sole drug in development, MIS416, is in clinical trials in Australia and New Zealand to evaluate whether it works in people with an advanced form of multiple sclerosis. A midlevel trial is underway, and results are due in the middle of this year.Experts in congressional ethics and trading rules said there did not appear to be evidence that Mr. Collins or Mr. Price used nonpublic information to steer their investment activities, a practice that would violate what is known as the Stock Act, which bans insider trading by members of Congress. But, said Donna M. Nagy, a law professor at Indiana University who has written on the financial investments by members of Congress, \u201cOne needs facts in order to get answers to those questions, and coming up with the facts for that is going to be difficult.\u201dMr. Holman of Public Citizen said Mr. Collins\u2019s recruiting efforts among Washington power players created the opportunity for \u201cinfluence peddling.\u201d For example, Mr. Paxon, who represented Mr. Collins\u2019s congressional district in the 1990s, could appear before Mr. Collins as both a lobbyist and a fellow investor in Innate.\u201cIt\u2019s a very effective means of buying access and hopefully influencing politicians,\u201d Mr. Holman said.Mr. Collins\u2019s spokesman said Mr. Paxon and Mr. Collins had never discussed Innate and noted that, because they are both from the Buffalo area, he might have become aware of Innate through other investors in the region. Mr. Paxon did not respond to emails and a call for comment.Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon were among 16 entities that took part in the private American placement, as did several other of Mr. Collins\u2019s associates and donors, according to the company filing. Mr. Price and Mr. Hook also participated in a second offering in the summer, the filings show. Mr. Price purchased between $50,000 and $100,000 in Innate shares in August, which was among the largest stock buys he had made since 2012, according to congressional financial disclosures. The investment was larger than his trades in more established pharmaceutical stocks like Pfizer and Merck.With his discount from the private placements, Mr. Price would have purchased some stock at 25 Australian cents per share in August and some at 34 cents. The stock closed on Friday at $1.31.Mr. McAdams, Mr. Collins\u2019s spokesman, said the private placement was available to qualified American investors and said Mr. Hook had previously invested in a private placement with the company in 2009, before Mr. Collins was a congressman. Several other investors were longtime friends of Mr. Collins, Mr. McAdams said, and their investment predates his time in Congress.Mr. Quinn dismissed questions about whether anyone engaged in insider trading and said the company\u2019s stock had been rising in anticipation of the results of the clinical trial later this year. The outcome of such trials is typically kept secret from investors and even company executives.\u201cRight now the whole value of this thing swings on a bet on the study results,\u201d he said.In San Francisco this week, Mr. Wilkinson said he had received interest in a possible acquisition from about 20 \u201chigh grade\u201d pharmaceutical companies. The drug, if approved, would be the first to treat a progressive form of multiple sclerosis.But he was also self-deprecating, noting wryly that Innate was such a \u201cbottom feeder\u201d at the JPMorgan conference that the company had not even qualified for an invitation to attend the main event.Abby Goodnough contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Becoming Warren Buffett\u2019 Goes Beyond a $74 Billion Fortune", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported byWarren E. Buffett isn\u2019t exactly an unknown quantity.Nowhere are there in-depth discussions about balance sheets and cash flow, though there are flashy animations illustrating basic investing principles. Instead, the film focuses on how Warren Edward Buffett grew from the Nebraskan son of a congressman to become the Oracle of Omaha, the avuncular mascot of American capitalism who built Berkshire Hathaway into a $406 billion empire, and shows some of his warts along the way.\u201cPeople watching it expecting to learn how to buy cheap stocks will be disappointed,\u201d Mr. Buffett said with a chuckle during a telephone interview. \u201cWhen I think about getting beyond a financial audience, this becomes really prominent.\u201dThe film, directed by Peter Kunhardt, is indisputably positive toward its subject, showcasing hallmarks of the Buffett legend like his regular chats with students, his poring through thick corporate financial statements and his almost daily visits to a McDonald\u2019s drive-through.But the movie doesn\u2019t shy away from portraying Mr. Buffett, now 86, as something of a remarkable human computer, gifted with numbers and less so with interpersonal relationships. He is the kind of man who straightforwardly says that he can\u2019t remember the colors of his bedroom walls, and the kind of husband who when his wife had the flu and asked for a pot to keep by her bedside, instead fetched a colander.In the film, his daughter, Susie, says she learned how to talk in sound bites to a father more immersed with financial issues than his children\u2019s. \u201cYou lose him to some giant thought he had in his head at the time,\u201d she said.Mr. Buffett doesn\u2019t quibble with what is onscreen. \u201cIt\u2019s really an accurate portrayal,\u201d he said. \u201cI make no claim to perfection.\u201dSusie Buffett, in a telephone interview, said she hoped the film captured Mr. Buffett in full. \u201cI think people get so star-struck with the money and the fame, and they don\u2019t know that he\u2019s just a person,\u201d she said.But the effect is different when the movie features dozens of old family photos and interviews with Mr. Buffett, his sisters and his children, and Bill and Melinda Gates. Mr. Buffett\u2019s first wife and the mother of his children, Susan (who died in 2004), is featured so prominently as an influence and force in Mr. Buffett\u2019s life that she\u2019s virtually a co-star.\u201cI\u2019m a non-finance guy, so I wanted to do a film about Warren the man and how Warren the man became Warren the super-successful investor,\u201d Mr. Kunhardt said.A week later, Mr. Buffett \u2014 impressed by Mr. Kunhardt\u2019s previous work \u2014 agreed to the first of four sit-down interviews. By 2015, Susie Buffett presented the filmmaker with a treasure vault for Buffettphiles: closets and cardboard boxes full of family photos, personal documents and home movies never seen publicly.Mr. Buffett remained closely engaged with the project. This month, as the movie neared completion, he caught a numerical error in one of its graphics, a missing handful of zeros in one particular datum.One notable omission in \u201cBecoming Warren Buffett\u201d is any interview with Astrid, Mr. Buffett\u2019s current wife. When Susan left Mr. Buffett in 1977 to move to San Francisco, the two remained married, and she later introduced him to Astrid, who became his longtime companion with her blessing. After Susan (whom Mr. Buffet also called Susie) died in 2004, Mr. Buffett married Astrid.\u201cSusie and I and Astrid had an arrangement that worked maybe one time in a thousand,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.Nonetheless, Mr. Buffett said that he asked Mr. Kunhardt to respect Astrid\u2019s wishes not to be interviewed. For his part, the filmmaker said he retained full editorial control and decided that Susan was simply a much more vital part of Mr. Buffett\u2019s story.She is credited with helping to shape Mr. Buffett\u2019s liberal politics \u2014 along with a reaction to his beloved father\u2019s conservative principles \u2014 through her interest in the civil rights movement.And Mr. Buffett credits his first wife with being the proper parent for his children and for helping push him into philanthropy. (Mr. Buffett has pledged to give away 99 percent of his fortune.)\u201cThe part that I liked best is that they get to see Susie,\u201d he said of his first wife and the movie\u2019s prospective audience. \u201cWhat happened with me would not have happened without her.\u201dThough Mr. Buffett is an octogenarian and has battled prostate cancer (successfully), he insists that participating in the movie wasn\u2019t a way to cement his legacy.\u201cThis was not done because I think I\u2019m getting my last haircut next week,\u201d he said.\u201cAt 86, actuarially, I know what\u2019s in the books, but literally I get to do what I love, and it\u2019s easy for me,\u201d he added. \u201cI do not feel that my life is past its most interesting points.\u201dAn article on Monday about the documentary \u201cBecoming Warren Buffett\u201d described incorrectly the development of the book \u201cThe Snowball,\u201d a biography of Mr. Buffett. Although he cooperated with its author, Alice Schroeder, the book was not \u201cauthorized.\u201d Mr. Buffett had no editorial say in its content.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Certainty of Trump\u2019s Wall: Big Money", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "An earlier attempt tried cameras and radar but ran over budget. The project was a loss for taxpayers. But for contractors, it was a big win.Supported byIt was the border wall that didn\u2019t get built.In 2006, Boeing and a team of other companies won a federal contract to construct a wall to protect the United States border with Mexico, which stretches roughly 2,000 miles, from California to Texas.The project was a loss for taxpayers. But for contractors, it was a big win.Today, as President Trump declares his intention to move forward with plans to build a barrier along the Mexican border, many of the details remain little more than a guessing game. Does Mr. Trump intend to build miles of concrete blocks, or fencing? Could parts of the wall be virtual, using technology like cameras and sensors to monitor the border, or be manned by drones? Will Mexico, as Mr. Trump has promised repeatedly, pay for it?There is no doubt that if the United States moves ahead with plans for an ambitious border wall \u2014 one of the biggest infrastructure projects in decades, perhaps running in the tens of billions of dollars \u2014 it will be a boon for contractors.An examination of failed efforts from the past highlights the potential gains for companies and potential pitfalls for taxpayers. Among the possible winners are construction firms, high-tech surveillance companies and cement manufacturers including, in what would be an ironic turn, one of Mexico\u2019s largest materials companies.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that, when the government spends money on a big project like this, companies are going to make a lot of money,\u201d said Joe Hornyak, a partner with the law firm Holland and Knight, who specializes in government contracting law. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about that.\u201dIn the past week, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Congress would move ahead with plans to build the wall, estimating that it would cost $12 billion to $15 billion.Researchers at M.I.T. said last year that a 1,000-mile, 50-foot-high steel-and-concrete wall would run taxpayers about $40 billion.The White House did not immediately respond to an inquiry. In 2011, when the Department of Homeland Security canceled the fence project, it said the effort was ineffective and too costly.History would suggest that such efforts can have problematic results. Past attempts at a wall have favored companies with decades of government contracting experience. From 2007 to 2012, the federal government paid contractors more than $1.5 billion for border protection, according to a New York Times analysis of spending under the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Secure Border Initiative.The initiative, started in 2005, has been one of the most aggressive attempts to protect the border. An office at Customs and Border Protection was assigned to develop and construct a virtual and physical wall along the border with Mexico, to reduce illegal immigration.The company that won the biggest contract through that office was Boeing, which is best known for building aircraft but also performs a variety of tasks for the government, making it the nation\u2019s second-largest federal contractor. Boeing was paid more than $20 billion in contracts during the last fiscal year.Boeing was not the only winner. The security company Wackenhut Corporation, now known as G4S Secure Solutions, received more than $119 million. I.B.M. won more than $56 million, and ManTech International, the technology company, received upward of $43 million.The project with Boeing, though, ran into snags almost immediately. Boeing and its team had built a complicated system consisting of sensors, radar and cameras mounted on towers to help border agents find people crossing into the country illegally. But the system worked inconsistently in some rough terrain.The project became the subject of multiple, and scathing, Government Accountability Office reports, some of which cited poor fiscal oversight. And after about $1 billion had been spent, the Obama administration canceled the project.In recent days, Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, has been asked whether the company had discussed border security with the president, and whether it could harvest any information from its earlier project for the new wall. He said the company was not actively pursuing anything in that area but was open to working with the government. The company, otherwise, did not comment on its scrapped project.There have been other attempts at a barrier that also ran into financial trouble. As a result of the various projects, hundreds of miles of wall already exist along the border, though in a form \u2014 wire mesh, chain link, sheet piling, concrete vehicle barriers, post and rails and X-shaped beams \u2014 that Mr. Trump may not have envisioned.In 2005, one border project was harshly criticized by lawmakers after it was reported that cameras broke down frequently. In another, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of the Inspector General reported in 2011 that officials had wasted $69 million in taxpayer dollars on an effort to build border walls, including the purchase of $44 million worth of extra steel that it did not need.In 2006, President George W. Bush signed the Secure Fence Act into law, requiring 700 miles of double-layered reinforced fencing to protect the border. The law was altered later to give the Department of Homeland Security more discretion to decide what kind of fencing was needed. Much of that wall consists of vehicle barriers, which do not stop people on foot.None of this history seems to have tempered Mr. Trump\u2019s enthusiasm. But it comes at a time when a construction boom across much of the country has created a significant shortage of legal labor to build the wall, according to construction executives and others in Texas. Separately, a study released in 2012 estimated that half the construction workers in Texas were undocumented workers. Which means that many of the laborers on the wall could be illegal immigrants.\u201cIf this wall gets built in Texas, there is a high likelihood that a significant bit of the work force will be undocumented,\u201d said Jose P. Garza, the executive director of the Workers Defense Project, which supports low-income workers.In another twist, money may flow to Mexicans or Mexican companies. Analysts say it is basically cost prohibitive to ship heavy rock or concrete more than 70 miles, or cement more than several hundred miles. That means manufacturers closest to the border may prove to be the most economical. That could be a big win for Cemex, Mexico\u2019s largest cement manufacturer, which has a United States-based subsidiary that could bid for the project and several plants dotting the border, analysts note. The company could also potentially receive hard-to-trace subcontracts that even government agencies sometimes have a difficult time tracking.Also, the government already gives preferences to contractors that supply American-made construction materials when it awards such contracts, said Mr. Hornyak, but for certain large construction projects, the Trade Agreements Act waives requirements for materials made in countries that have entered into trade agreements with the United States.So, Mr. Hornyak added, the president would most likely need Congress to change the law if he wanted to dictate that agencies, for instance, buy only American-made cement.All of which means that, in an almost subversive inversion of the running debate over who will pay for what, the United States could ultimately wind up paying Mexican citizens and Mexican-owned businesses to construct the wall.An infrastructure build-out could also increase the cost of cement and other materials, say analysts. Currently, the United States is operating at 90 percent of its capacity levels, estimates Garik Shmois, an analyst at Longbow Research in Independence, Ohio. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be effectively sold out by 2018, based on current projects,\u201d Mr. Shmois said. \u201cSo any additional period of growth, such as an infrastructure cycle, will put upward pressure on prices.\u201dThat is good news for cement and materials companies with significant operations in the United States, including Vulcan Materials, Martin Marietta Materials and German-based HeidelbergCement Group, as well as Mexico\u2019s Cemex and Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua.Companies that specialize in surveillance technology or even \u201cvirtual\u201d barriers could also benefit. Elbit Systems of America, whose parent company is based in Israel, won a contract in 2014 with Customs and Border Protection to build a set of towers with radar and cameras covering 170 to 200 miles along the Arizona border. When the radar detects movement, cameras zoom in and send images to command centers.\u201cWhen looking at the border, there is not a one-size-fits-all approach,\u201d said Gordon Kesting, vice president for homeland security solutions for Elbit Systems of America. \u201cBut if you look at the costs associated with some of the approaches, they are quite different. There is a discussion to be had on the most effective and efficient use of taxpayer dollars.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Run-Up Since Election Slows as Investors Consider Risks", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byWith just days to go before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president, once ebullient markets have eased a bit as investors have begun to ponder more seriously the risks of a Trump administration.After a run-up in the weeks after Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory, stock markets in the United States have been little changed in the last month \u2014 with investors on several occasions stepping back, as opposed to elevating the Dow Jones industrial average past a 20,000 milestone.The concerns include a dollar that has gained too much in value, worries about trade wars with China and Mexico and, most broadly, a fear that Mr. Trump will not be able to deliver on his promises to cut taxes, increase government spending and reduce regulation.The market declines in recent weeks have been very modest, and investors, for now, seem to be prepared to give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt on his plans for the economy.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments over the weekend about the dollar being too strong, about the possibility that more countries will follow Britain out of the European Union and his intention to tax German carmakers for not building factories in the United States all heightened these concerns.\u201cPeople are concerned about an appreciating dollar, how much higher rates will go and antagonizing China,\u201d Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of the asset management giant BlackRock, said in an interview last week. \u201cThere has been too much conversation about the glories of the U.S. stock market.\u201dOn Tuesday, the dollar\u2019s main index, which is measured against the world\u2019s top currencies, dropped by more than 1 percent. Even beaten-down currencies like the Turkish lira and the Mexican peso \u2014 among the world\u2019s weakest performers in the last month \u2014 gained ground against the dollar.Economists have warned that an overly strong dollar can hurt the United States economy in several ways. America\u2019s trade deficit would widen as exports stagnate and cheaper goods from Mexico and China flood the market. A long period of a strong dollar also increases the chances of an emerging market crisis, when crucial investment funds flee currencies that are plummeting against the dollar.The price of gold, a traditionally safe investment, was up by nearly 1.5 percent on the day. The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose, driving its yield \u2014 an important benchmark for interest rates \u2014 down to 2.33 percent from the previous close, 2.4 percent, a sign that investors are searching for safety instead of returns by loading up on government bonds.And stocks in the United States continued to search for direction in the absence of tangible developments on Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for the economy.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed at 2,267.89 on Tuesday, down 0.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down by the same percentage, at 19,826.77. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.63 percent to 5,538.73.Mr. Fink\u2019s view, which is shared by many investors with a global outlook, is that while the president-elect has made bold promises about the need to energize what has been a tepid recovery for the nation\u2019s economy, such transformations do not occur quickly.\u201cThese things take months and years to do,\u201d Mr. Fink said.While stock market specialists are in broad agreement that the Trump rally has more room to run, some are beginning to question whether the marked increase in stocks has gone as far as it can without tangible policy results in the form of lower taxes and government spending initiatives.\u201cI wonder if the euphoria has exceeded the fundamentals,\u201d said David Lafferty, chief market strategist for Natixis Global Asset Management. \u201cThe stock market is pricing in a Reagan-type scenario.\u201dLike many, he worries that such a bout of fiscal expansionism so late in the economic cycle will lead to a sharp increase in prices and a sudden move by the Federal Reserve to play catch-up by raising interest rates faster than the market expects.Economists and investment strategists are also warning of possible global shocks that could unnerve the markets in the next year.While some of these upsets may be driven by the growth of populist political movements, across Europe in particular, this higher volatility would kick in as central banks cease intervening so aggressively in markets.Jens Nordvig, a currency specialist at Exante Data, highlighted three such concerns in a recent letter to clients. He cautioned that it had been 15 years since the last full-fledged emerging market crisis and pointed to Turkey\u2019s plunging currency and capital outflows in China as two areas of concern.He also listed a potential breakup of the European Union and any move by Mr. Trump to impose tariffs or other penalties on imports as events that could destabilize markets.\u201cIt is a complex world, with messy answers to questions that seemed simple fairly recently,\u201d Mr. Nordvig wrote in his note. \u201cAnd in this world, significant macro shocks will be more prevalent.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "On a Fijian Island, Hunters Become Conservators of Endangered Turtles", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byYadua Island JournalYADUA ISLAND, Fiji \u2014 Pita Qarau pulled his boat next to a turtle, which was trying desperately to flee the buzz of the boat\u2019s noisy engine. The turtle, a female hawksbill, was surprisingly fast, capable of a top speed of about 15 miles per hour.But Mr. Qarau knew he could win the sprint. He lost the turtle momentarily, then circled back. Finally, as the turtle slowed down, he positioned the boat near the fatigued animal. He threw his engine into neutral and dived into the water.Seconds later, he re-emerged, holding on to a chaotic mess of flapping flippers.Not long ago, a catch like this would have meant turtle for dinner, but Mr. Qarau would let this one go. He checked the turtle\u2019s health, but he was unable to tag it, as he had intended, because he had run out of tags.Fiji has imposed a moratorium on harvesting turtles, and while the ban has been observed inconsistently around the island nation, some people like Mr. Qarau have weaned themselves from eating turtle, which is considered a delicacy, and instead have dedicated themselves to conservation.\u201cThe number of turtles were dropping and the size, you can\u2019t see any big ones, only small,\u201d he said later in the day. \u201cThat is why I change myself.\u201dMr. Qarau, 53, a native of Yadua, a small, remote island in Fiji\u2019s north, is a volunteer participating in a program by the World Wildlife Fund that has helped replenish the turtle population after decades of decline.The skills for hunting turtles, passed down through the generations here, come in handy for tracking and protecting them from illegal harvesting. Monitors like Mr. Qarau are known in Fijian as \u201cDau ni Vonu,\u201d or guardians of turtles.Life in Yadua is simple and close-knit. The island\u2019s only village, Denimanu, has about 200 people, almost entirely related by blood or marriage. Most residents\u2019 income is from catching and selling fish. A hot shower is accomplished with a few cans of water left in the afternoon sun.Traditionally turtles were eaten at major events, like a wedding or a chief\u2019s funeral. As traditions eroded in recent decades, some people began to think of turtles and their eggs as an everyday food to catch and sell.Climate change and habitat loss have also placed pressure on the turtle population. The conservation status of the turtles common to Fiji\u2019s waters \u2014 green, olive ridley, leatherback, hawksbill and loggerhead \u2014 ranges from vulnerable to critically endangered, according to the Red List of Endangered Species published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.The Fiji government imposed a temporary ban on turtle harvesting in 1995 to halt the decline. The current 10-year moratorium is scheduled to expire next year.It was there that Mr. Qarau realized future generations might never see or taste a turtle if harvesting continued. He said he was not thinking of himself when he decided to give up hunting turtles. \u201cI am thinking about the future generations,\u201d he said.The island\u2019s chief, Ratu Jone Cakautavatava, decided that Yadua\u2019s residents should no longer consume turtles, and people began to wean themselves off what many considered a favorite food. \u201cIt was really hard to stop,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cbut I follow the law.\u2019\u2019Mr. Cakautavatava described the old days of hunting turtles in a fiberglass boat and spearing them through the shell. Gesturing to the harpoon in his hand, Mr. Cakautavatava said, \u201cI keep the spear until the government says, \u2018Yes, we can kill turtles.\u2019 \u201dMr. Qarau\u2019s commitment to replenishing the turtle stock involves monitoring them twice a week. He walks the beaches searching for turtle tracks, which could indicate a nest. He and others are trained to dig into nests and record their contents: hatched eggs versus duds.Counting turtles is best done at night when turtles sleep under the coral, he said, or during the day when they feed at high tide on a shallow reef. A minute into a monitoring round on recent morning, the shadowy shapes of six turtles jetted across a reef.\u201cYou won\u2019t see that sight anywhere else in Fiji,\u201d said Laitia Tamata, a coastal fisheries officer for the World Wildlife Fund who manages the monitoring program. When the program began in Yadua in 2010, only six turtles nested on its beaches. Four years later there were 29 nests. At a monitoring site in Kavewa Island, no turtle nests were found in 2010; almost 70 were identified four years later.Not every Fiji community shares Yadua\u2019s commitment to conservation. Barry Hill, 27, a Yadua monitor, recently came across divers heading away from the island with two dead turtles in their boat. An argument turned into a brawl, he said.\u201cI tell them it is not allowed, but they can\u2019t control themselves,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cThey want to eat turtles every day.\u201dEven though the ban was first imposed more than 20 years ago, it has been enforced only sporadically, and few, if any, violators have been fined or sent to prison, according to Kiji Vukikomoala, a lawyer at the Environmental Law Association.\u201cThe general feeling is these are low-priority cases because the penalties are so low,\u201d Ms. Vukikomoala said. Someone convicted of killing a turtle faces a maximum fine of about $240 and up to three months in jail.The endorsement of a chief is often crucial to involving communities in conservation, said Michael Donoghue, an adviser on threatened and migratory species at the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme.\u201cIf communities don\u2019t want to do it, it doesn\u2019t matter what the law says,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Donoghue said. \u201cEspecially in remote areas, it is unlikely to happen.\u201dThe World Wildlife Fund plans to press for an extension of the 10-year moratorium when it runs out next year.Conservation efforts in Yadua and other islands have demonstrated that turtle populations can expand significantly if the moratorium is observed. But in 2014 the monitoring program ran out of financing, as the World Wildlife Fund put those funds toward saving species in greater danger of extinction.And so, while participants used to get reimbursed for expenses like boat fuel and phone calls to report their data, now the monitors themselves have to absorb these expenses.\u201cI guess that is what makes it successful,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Tamata of the World Wildlife Fund said. \u201cIt is from the heart rather than for money.\u201dMr. Qarau hopes that his conservation work will create a sustainable harvest, enabling Fijians to eat turtles again.

Senators Hope to Speed Trump Cabinet Confirmations", "Date": "2017-01-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans will move this week to speed the confirmation of President Trump\u2019s cabinet, an effort that has been stymied by the combination of lax preparation by Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, his many unorthodox nominees and Democrats spoiling for a fight, albeit with few cards in their deck.On Monday, the Senate will vote on the confirmation of Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, after Democrats used one of the few procedural maneuvers left to them to force a debate on his inevitable approval.Also on Monday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, whose road to confirmation has been bumpy. Mr. Tillerson received a lift on Sunday when two Republicans, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said they would support him, after weeks of public hedging.Other nominees have been impeded by attempts to untangle their conflicts of interest, a process that Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team started far later than its predecessors and that has led to embarrassing revelations.Whether these mistakes will thwart the eventual confirmation of any nominee remains in doubt. For all the intraparty rancor and \u201cNever-Trumpism\u201d during the campaign, Republicans appear to have closed ranks on Capitol Hill to protect their unusual president and his cabinet choices, for now.They have, when possible, prevented Democrats from grilling the nominees too hard, as was the case with Ms. DeVos, when Republicans shut down the hearing after one round of questions from eager lawmakers.Ms. DeVos had been struggling through a series of befuddling answers that raised questions about her grasp of federal education policy, including one flourish \u2014 replayed widely on social media and cable television \u2014 in which she suggested that school officials should be armed to protect against prospective grizzly bears on the premises.For their part, Democrats showed the frustration that is likely to surface repeatedly now that they have lost the White House and do not have the filibuster available to them.But their approach in confirmation hearings, raw and blunt after a bitter election defeat, probably presages the tactics that lawmakers are already learning in the Trump era \u2014 and the defensive maneuvers Republicans will employ.Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, excoriated the civil rights record of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, breaking with a long-held Senate custom of comity in the chamber.Democrats lobbed hours of questions at Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the nominee for secretary of health and human services, about his trading of stocks in health care companies that may have benefited from his legislating, keeping Mr. Price on the defensive heading into another confirmation hearing this week.\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the questioning frequently has an edge to it,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \u201cThat is not to say that there aren\u2019t legitimate questions to be asked of the nominees. But it\u2019s the way they\u2019re asked that I\u2019ve found to be different this time.\u201dThe Senate typically confirms nearly all of a president\u2019s cabinet, and many Democrats, if not most, will vote for the bulk of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees. Democrats changed Senate rules when they were in power to make cabinet nominees subject to a mere majority \u2014 rather than 60 \u2014 vote threshold, empowering Mr. Trump to send up more conservative and unusual choices.Their numbers limited, Democrats have opted to put Republicans on the defensive as much as possible. Mr. Booker\u2019s decision to testify against a fellow senator particularly rankled opponents, who accused him of grandstanding.In other moments, Republicans have chafed more at Democrats\u2019 tone than at the content of their remarks.Democrats are eager to argue the irony of any complaints about partisanship and obstructionism. Many remain bitter over Republicans\u2019 blockade of Merrick B. Garland, Mr. Obama\u2019s choice for the Supreme Court in his final year in office.\u201cThe Republican majority in the United States Senate refused a hearing and a vote on a nominee to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, chastised Democrats for refusing to consent to a speedy confirmation of nominees on Friday. \u201cThat position on the highest court in the land remained vacant because of the specific political strategy of the Republican leader on the other side.\u201dOthers have pointed to the relentless inquiries into Hillary Clinton and the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, wondering aloud why only a single round of questions was allowed in hearings for Ms. DeVos and Mr. Price.After going over his allotted time questioning Mr. Price, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, grumbled that he would cede time in the nonexistent second round.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, was not amused. He later noted that Mr. Price had been questioned more than any nominee to the post in more than two decades.\u201cYou may be here by yourself,\u201d Mr. Alexander told Mr. Franken.\u201cThe Benghazi hearing was 11 hours,\u201d Mr. Franken shot back. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201dPaul C. Light, a professor of public service at New York University who has worked on Capitol Hill as an adviser on transitions, said the confirmation process had made clear that standards for acceptable nominee conduct have changed. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any controversy about things that used to be controversial,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lowered the bar in terms of offenses that would have taken out nominees.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rebuilding Infrastructure May Be Profitable for the Very Rich", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byBut a trillion dollars is hard to ignore, and investors looking to profit have numerous infrastructure mutual funds and exchange traded funds to choose from, though all of them have certain drawbacks.Because of this, infrastructure E.T.F.s, which typically own utilities, rose sharply earlier this year, peaked in September and have been listless, falling with bond prices despite the broader stock market rally since. The SPDR S&P Global Infrastructure E.T.F., heavily weighted in utilities, rose sharply for the year through Sept. 8, but declined in value through the end of the year.Utilities had become \u201cvery overvalued,\u201d said Tayfun Icten, a Morningstar analyst. \u201cWe might have a deeper sell-off in utilities,\u201d he added.

Most drinking-water and sewer systems are government-owned but \u201cin contrast to roads and airports, water public entities are privatizing,\u201d said Mr. Smith of Virtus.Mr. Santoro said the Columbia fund owned the oil service giants Schlumberger and Halliburton \u201cbecause they have the engineering and construction expertise that\u2019s needed.\u201dRailroads will also almost surely benefit from any uptick in economic activity set off by infrastructure spending. CSX, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific are three of the largest holdings in the Lazard fund.Some value-conscious infrastructure investors now favor Europe. \u201cWe\u2019ve been concerned about North American infrastructure valuations for several years,\u201d said Mr. Landy of Lazard. \u201cNorth American infrastructure assets look expensive, particularly utilities.\u201d European infrastructure assets are \u201ctrading at a big discount,\u201d he said.Passive investments like index mutual funds and E.T.F.s (which for the most part also track market indexes) have generally outperformed actively managed investments in recent years. But actively managed funds can avoid the utilities that are being hurt by rising interest rates and that are prominent in indexes tracked by broad infrastructure E.T.F.s. \u201cRising rates provide an opportunity for actively managed funds,\u201d Mr. Hammond said. Actively managed funds can also hunt for assets that will most directly benefit, if and when details of a Trump infrastructure plan emerge.But the reality is that private equity funds for wealthy investors may be best positioned to take advantage of future tax breaks. For one thing, they have the capital. And where roads are now in private hands, private equity funds are typically the owners, so they can make the tax-advantaged repairs and recover their investment with tolls.How good all of this will be for the general public remains to be seen. Some critics have questioned whether private developers would undertake needed public-interest projects that do not offer the prospect of profit. And on projects that do offer profit, ordinary people may end up footing the bill.\u201cTrump might dispute that his plan would require raising more in taxes,\u201d said Hunter Blair, federal budget analyst with the liberal Economic Policy Institute, \u201cbut it will certainly cost money through tolls and other user fees.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Economic Vows May Be Harder to Hit After a Slow 2016", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump\u2019s target for economic growth just got a little more distant.But however solid, the recovery under President Barack Obama never reached exuberance. It is the second longest recovery in American history but the first in the postwar era in which growth for a full year did not hit 3 percent.Mr. Trump made that data point a focus of his campaign, citing factories that closed during the recession but never reopened and workers who gave up looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force. And economists, even if they disagree with his policy prescriptions, acknowledge that many areas have been left behind.While Friday\u2019s report will provide more support for Mr. Trump\u2019s argument, the lackluster pace of economic growth may also complicate the new administration\u2019s plans. Indeed, some of the headwinds in 2016 \u2014 like a widening trade deficit and cautious spending by businesses \u2014 could persist into 2017 and beyond.In 2016, personal consumption \u2014 which accounts for a majority of economic activity \u2014 slowed from 2014 and 2015. In addition, the sharp plunge in oil prices over the same period prompted steep cuts in energy production and exploration, contributing to a drop in business investment.All of this underscores why analysts say that Mr. Trump\u2019s growth rate target of 4 percent is audacious at best and fanciful at worst, especially given broader factors like an aging population and the growth rate of 2 percent or so that has prevailed since the recovery began in 2009.\u201cIt would defy gravity,\u201d Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago, said. Four percent growth would require big gains in the size of the work force and productivity, but neither is in the offing, Ms. Swonk said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s simple math.\u201dAt the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it is ready to raise interest rates a few times this year, and a faster expansion would only accelerate the Fed\u2019s plan to tighten monetary policy to head off inflation.Whatever the growth trajectory is in 2017, Fed officials will have a tricky time navigating the political and economic currents under Mr. Trump. Not only did he criticize the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, during the campaign, but his assessment of the current economy is more downbeat than the Fed\u2019s.One week into the Trump administration, there are many other economic wild cards for policy makers and private forecasters to contemplate, including the impact of congressional efforts to reshape the corporate tax code, trade tensions with Mexico and China, and the proposed repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.Tax cuts could open the way for new spending and investment. But more expensive imports from Mexico could be painful for many consumers, for example, while a trade war with China would hurt American companies like Apple, General Electric and Caterpillar.What is more, although the Commerce Department report focused on the last three full months of Mr. Obama\u2019s second term, anemic economic activity could add to the revenue shortfall the federal government will most likely face from the personal and corporate tax cuts Mr. Trump has discussed.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see how we would get to 4 percent growth given the current structure of the economy, especially demographics and productivity growth,\u201d said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. \u201cThat would be true no matter who is the president.\u201dThe retirement of the baby boomers will limit the size of the labor force, he said, while productivity gains from technology are not expected to accelerate from the current level, as they did with the adoption of the internet or mobile phones in the 1990s.Weak growth does strengthen arguments for a federal program to fortify the nation\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 an approach Mr. Trump has advocated that could provide an economic stimulus.Since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November, many economists have been raising their projected growth rates for the latter half of 2017 and for 2018.That is not necessarily because they feel Mr. Trump\u2019s policies will prove beneficial in the long run. Instead, it is because the tax cuts and infrastructure investments he has called for could bolster the economy in the short term.Mr. Faucher lifted his growth forecast to 2.4 percent in 2017 and 2.7 percent in 2018. Previously, he expected output to expand by 2.25 percent in each year.\u201cTax cuts and infrastructure spending represent a much more expansionary fiscal policy than we\u2019ve had in some time,\u201d he said.But Mr. Faucher cautioned that increasing the federal deficit, which stood at $587 billion in 2016, by hundreds of billions more in the coming years could increase interest rates, which were already moving higher.Rates, including mortgage rates for home buyers, are already up more than half a percentage point since the election, on expectations of more borrowing and faster growth.But in economics, as in life, everything cuts both ways. The rise in interest rates has also strengthened the dollar relative to other currencies.While that has been good news for American tourists, a stronger currency is bad news for American exporters, with imports becoming cheaper while the price of American-made products abroad rises.The prospect of a stronger dollar also makes it more difficult to achieve another of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic goals: a revival of the American manufacturing sector. Manufacturers are more dependent on foreign sales than many other businesses, but a rising dollar makes their products less competitive overseas.The dollar is rising on expectations of faster growth in the United States and because of the jump in domestic interest rates, which make American financial assets like bonds more appealing to global investors than lower-yielding debt in Europe and Asia.\u201cMr. Trump can\u2019t control the dollar, and that will be a big factor this year,\u201d Mr. Faucher said. \u201cTrade is likely to be a drag on growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The president-elect wants to privatize health services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs. He wants to privatize public infrastructure \u2014 drawing private sector companies to fix, build and manage bridges and roads, water supplies and airports. He is selling privatization as a surefire winner that will deliver better services for less public money.\u201cThere\u2019s a magical thinking among business executives that something about the profit motive makes everything run better,\u201d noted Raymond Fisman, a professor of economics at Boston University. \u201cWhat is government going to be like when it is run by billionaire C.E.O.s that see the private sector as a solution to all the world\u2019s problems?\u201dA serious body of economics, not to mention reams of evidence from decades of privatizations around the world, suggests this belief is false.Of course, the government can also do a horrible job of running things. And private corporations do many things well. They tend to be much faster to innovate. In competitive markets, the profit motive makes for a powerful incentive to deliver all kinds of goods and services, from widgets to telephone calls, efficiently and effectively. A study found that opening nursing homes in Sweden to private providers actually improved patients\u2019 mortality rates.But it is critical to understand how profit seeking can go awry, giving companies a motivation to skimp on quality to bolster margins. When a private provider faces little or no competition, or when quality of service is difficult to track properly \u2014 think of the well-being of patients in a nursing home, or the health of prison inmates \u2014 there will be nothing to stop it from pursuing higher profits at society\u2019s expense.\u201cThe private sector is good at cutting costs and finding ways to save money,\u201d Oliver Hart, a professor of economics at Harvard, told me. \u201cSome are socially desirable; some are not.\u201d The critical issue is whether a contract can be written that reduces the space for socially undesirable tactics to a minimum.He is not at all opposed to privatization.

{"Headline": "Death Is Inevitable. Financial Turmoil Afterward Isn\u2019t.", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byRetiringMOST of us do not even want to contemplate the death of a spouse or partner \u2014 much less the prospect of having to take care of the financial end of such a loss while still grieving.There are, however, plenty of details that people can attend to in advance that can avoid some measure of stress when the time comes. Most people tend to ignore or procrastinate over such tasks \u2014 for obvious reasons \u2014 but planning can certainly ease some avoidable financial sorrows.The first step to prepare for this unhappy life stage is to make sure both partners have a thorough understanding of the couple\u2019s spousal and individual assets and where they are. Are there life insurance policies? Do they name the right survivors as beneficiaries? What about pensions and other retirement plans? How will the money flow after someone\u2019s death?As all too many people find out too late, this sort of preparation should start well before either spouse becomes disabled or dies. The general principle is to protect the survivor and enable him or her to make decisions about the estate\u2019s assets.That means setting up a durable power of attorney for health care and finances \u2014 two separate documents, one set for each spouse. You don\u2019t need a lawyer to put these in place, but they should be signed so that one spouse can make medical and financial decisions if the other is incapacitated.One couple who went through this exercise, Erika and John Lupo of Sparta, N.J., did so sooner than most, and it paid off. When Mr. Lupo died of cancer last year at age 57, Ms. Lupo, 51, who runs an acting school, was extraordinarily well prepared \u2014 unlike many widows.In his final days, Mr. Lupo, a former salesman, did everything he could to prepare his estate and make sure his wife knew where his assets were \u2014 and how they could be bequeathed to her and heirs.There was a bit of complex estate and financial planning involved, because Mr. Lupo had a daughter from a previous marriage, and the couple has a teenage son.Working with Mark Germain, a certified financial planner with Beacon Wealth Management in Hackensack, N.J., Mr. Lupo had several documents in order just a few weeks before he died.\u201cWe made out wills, durable powers of attorney and a trust\u201d for Mr. Lupo\u2019s daughter, Mr. Germain said. \u201cWe also made some arrangements for the son in the will. We had to do some sophisticated planning.\u201dFor Mr. Lupo\u2019s widow, the advance planning came as a great relief even as she mourned her husband. \u201cWe had everything in place,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no idea how to do any of this. They guided me seamlessly.\u201dOrganization of one\u2019s estate will certainly not lessen the emotional turmoil, but it will smooth the way to financial security in the fog of grief.More than 800,000 Americans lose their spouses each year, and 700,000 of them are women, according to the Census Bureau. Because women generally outlive men, they spend an average of 14 years without a spouse. There are now more than 14 million widows and widowers, accounting for about one-quarter of the over-65 population.Although in the past, one spouse \u2014 usually the husband \u2014 \u201ctook care\u201d of all of the financial planning, Mr. Germain said, most people don\u2019t do a very good job of it. That traditional role is often a smoke screen for partial preparation and keeping one\u2019s spouse largely in the dark, he said.\u201cDon\u2019t think of an estate plan as a \u2018death\u2019 plan,\u201d Mr. Germain advised. \u201cI try to get that out of my clients\u2019 minds. Many people don\u2019t have a clue as to what will happen with an estate after death.\u201d One client, he said, a 72-year-old man, changed ownership of his assets while his wife was dying, creating financial chaos.But times are clearly changing when it comes to traditional gender roles. \u201cTwenty years ago, the average husband did all of the finances,\u201d said Catherine Anne Seal, a Colorado Springs-based estate planning lawyer and the president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys. \u201cNow it\u2019s not uncommon for the wife to handle finances.\u201dWidows who are inexperienced with money management tend to make a common mistake, Ms. Seal said: They \u201cmake imprudent gifts to adult children\u201d within a year of their husband\u2019s death. Down the road, this may leave the widow short of money, depending on how long she survives her husband.Ms. Seal advises that couples title their assets \u201cjointly with rights of survivorship,\u201d particularly if their joint estate is under $4 million.But estate planning becomes more complex if there are multiple marriages and stepchildren involved.\u201cCouples in second marriages need good estate planning with attorneys who understand these issues,\u201d Ms. Seal said.Such professionals can provide a checklist of what both spouses should know: Where are the documents relating to Social Security? Insurance policies? Marriage and birth certificates? Wills? Powers of attorney? Living trusts? It is also important to have a list of all assets, such as real estate, stocks, bonds, savings accounts, safe deposit boxes and trusts.Also on the to-do list: locating the titles to all properties, ranging from autos to vacation homes. Veterans should have copies of all military discharge papers.Another vital step is to appoint capable, financially skilled trustees in your powers of attorney, Mr. Germain said. They could be family members, but they should have some working knowledge of how to handle money.You should also involve your tax planner and financial planner \u2014 if you have them. A certified financial planner who acts as fiduciary can work directly with your accountant and family lawyer.At the root of a transparent estate plan, most lawyers say, is openness and communication. Both spouses should attend the meetings with lawyers and financial professionals. And each spouse should know the location of all important documents and understand what will happen upon death.Contingency plans should be made in the event one spouse becomes disabled or incapacitated. Prepare a workable estate plan while you are healthy. Cognitive decline can take its toll on couples\u2019 abilities to manage and execute an estate plan.\u201cMost people are in denial about what the aging process looks like,\u201d Ms. Seal said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you need trustworthy agents in your powers-of-attorney documents. You need to create a plan for incapacity.\u201dMs. Lupo of New Jersey emphatically agrees. \u201cRealize that you need to take the time to understand your finances,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re well \u2014 that\u2019s when you need to plan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Like so many other cool things, it was also seized upon immediately by discerning Japanese dudes. Mr. Staunton now sells the shirts to Tokyo stores including Estnation and Beauty & Youth United Arrows, and Popeye Magazine, a Japanese style bible, included Virgil Normal in a guide to Los Angeles that continues to send new acolytes to its door.Advertisement"}
