{"Headline": "Tech Giants Seem Invincible. That Worries Lawmakers.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech \u2014 from IBM to Hewlett-Packard to Cisco to Yahoo \u2014 were eventually outmaneuvered by start-ups that came out of nowhere.The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place.Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable.In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world\u2019s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will.The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump\u2019s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds.This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year.Let\u2019s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends \u2014 mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs.Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech \u2014 on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance.The Five aren\u2019t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple\u2019s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet\u2019s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren\u2019t entirely safe from competition from start-ups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot.Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from start-ups; today\u2019s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five.But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you\u2019re supposed to in America \u2014 by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren\u2019t considered that bad. They weren\u2019t causing environmental disasters. They weren\u2019t selling cigarettes. They weren\u2019t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five\u2019s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn\u2019t I called them the Fabulous Five?Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with.During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos\u2019s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry\u2019s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public.For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised \u2014 entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others.\u201cDuring the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U.S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,\u201d said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them.During Mr. Genachowski\u2019s term at the F.C.C., and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201d which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies.But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. \u201cThe next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things \u2014 battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,\u201d he said.That\u2019s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger \u2014 their benefits to society as well as their potential costs \u2014 when deciding how to police them.But there\u2019s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today\u2019s start-ups. The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining, voice-activated assistants, self-driving cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five.That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more; and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cisco Pays Fantastical Price for Software Firm", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsCisco Systems is chasing a fairy tale.The networking giant\u2019s core switch and router businesses face tough times. Buying the software firm AppDynamics for $3.7 billion offers some respite from hardware woes, but Cisco is paying well over the odds to add a bit of excitement to its story.Cisco\u2019s revenue has stagnated over the last several years. Switches and routing account for more than 45 percent of sales, and demand for these is tepid. Virtual networking software reduces enterprises\u2019 need for high-end hardware. Chinese gear makers compete fiercely on the cheap end.The company \u2014 under Chuck Robbins, the chief executive \u2014 has tried to compensate by growing its software operations. AppDynamics fits the bill. Its software allows enterprises to monitor and manage the performance of applications. It is a fast-growing business, and better yet, most revenue comes in the form of sticky subscriptions. That is the sort of combination investors love.The problem is the price. Cisco snatched up AppDynamics literally on the eve of the company\u2019s initial public offering. At the top of the indicated price range for the offering, the company\u2019s market value would have been a bit above $2 billion, including outstanding equity grants. The stock might have priced above that range and popped once it made its market debut, considering the paucity of tech listings over the past year.But Cisco paid a substantial premium to prevent this possibility, handing a big payday to AppDynamics and its adviser, Qatalyst.AppDynamics is losing money \u2014 $95 million over the nine months ending Oct. 31 \u2014 and burning cash, albeit at a slower rate. So let\u2019s look at the price as a multiple of revenue. The outfit had about $200 million in revenue over the past 12 months and is growing around 50 percent annually. Assuming it can maintain that pace, Cisco is paying some 12 times estimated revenue. Relic, a similar software firm that is growing about as fast, is valued at roughly five times estimated revenue.It will take several years of rapid growth and improving margins for Cisco to earn a decent return on its unicorn purchase. Such a happy ending would be magical, but looks improbable.Advertisement"}
