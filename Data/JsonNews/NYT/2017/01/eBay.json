{"Headline": "With LeBron 14 Release, Nike Is Bypassing the Shoe Store", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last summer, shortly after claiming his third N.B.A. title, LeBron James said he was still chasing Michael Jordan and his six championship rings. But James is also chasing Jordan in the world of signature shoe sales \u2014 a realm still dominated by the Air Jordan line 13 years after its founder retired.So Nike and James are trying something new with their newest release, the LeBron 14, to build extra buzz. Instead of a standard rollout on Nike\u2019s website or at retailers, a small batch of the shoes is going directly to a secondary marketplace before a wider release \u2014 the sneaker world\u2019s equivalent of an initial public offering of a stock.The limited release of the 46 pairs \u2014 called Cavs Court SPO \u2014 come with special features including a hardwood box made from the Cleveland Cavaliers home court from last year\u2019s championship season and a version of the championship rings that the team gave to its employees (which are different from the players\u2019 rings).The chief executive of StockX, Josh Luber, said there was no way to accurately predict how much the shoes might sell for, but he said estimates among his team ranged from $3,000 to $25,000 per pair.That would be a significant bump from James\u2019s recent releases, which have not been embraced by collectors. The LeBron 13, released in September 2015, has been especially disappointing to hard-core sneaker enthusiasts, with some deadstock models \u2014 unworn shoes in the original box and packaging \u2014 selling for less than the original $200 retail price on secondary markets.When Nike released black and red Air Jordan 1 high-tops in September with the original Nike Air logo on the tongue \u2014 unlike the recent models that carry Jordan\u2019s Jumpman logo \u2014 the sneakers sold out in a matter of minutes and were almost immediately selling for more than double the $160 retail price in the secondary market.James and Nike are hoping to tap into a similar nostalgia with the reintroduction of James\u2019s rookie-year sneaker, the Air Zoom Generation, the first sneakers Nike made for James. James is one of the few players, including Jordan, to get a retro release of his own shoe line while he is still playing.\u201cThere is more inherent demand for LeBron\u2019s retro shoe than any of his shoes in the last three years,\u201d Luber said.Neil Schwartz, vice president at SportsOneSource, a market research firm for athletic footwear and apparel, said LeBron was the most popular basketball shoe frontman among active players, ahead of Kevin Durant (Nike), James Harden (Adidas) and Stephen Curry (Under Armour). But James is nowhere near being the king of basketball shoes.\u201cLeBron is not approaching Jordan in popularity,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cHe\u2019s not even close.\u201dLuber said Nike\u2019s willingness to release a high-profile shoe like the new LeBron sneakers on a secondary marketplace underlined the increasingly important role played by resellers in stoking demand for big-ticket sneakers.\u201cIf you asked someone three years ago, they would have said this would never happen,\u201d said Luber, who founded StockX with the Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. \u201cNike is finally acknowledging the secondary market.\u201dStockX estimates that resellers generate $1.5 billion worth of sales in the United States alone. Much of that underground economy is driven by enthusiasts, known as sneakerheads, who camp out overnight or create fast-bidding software programs to snap up new releases of rare models from big sneaker brands. Because many of those shoes are sold in limited quantities, many sneakerheads quickly resell those sneakers on eBay or reseller sites for a tidy profit.The shoe brands maintain a complicated relationship with resellers, who are often the most enthusiastic and well-informed customers. On one hand, long lines of sneakerheads waiting for new shoes are a marketing boon. But savvy resellers game the system for maximum profit, making it difficult for ordinary consumers to buy the hottest shoes without paying a large premium.But James\u2019s shoes have not reached the status of the Air Jordans. Jason Hart, a part-time actor who calls himself a \u201cdilettante sneaker reseller,\u201d said James\u2019s recent shoes had almost no value in the resale market because collectors do not like the shoes\u2019 appearance. Hart said he had spent about $75,000 in 2016 on 300 pairs of shoes and had not bought a single pair of LeBron sneakers. By comparison, half of his purchases were Jordan sneakers.\u201cLeBron is a little off the map,\u201d he said. \u201cNike is going to have to go back and cultivate that again.\u201dBidding for the sneakers opened Friday night and closes on Thursday. The top 23 bids for each shoe will win, and a portion of the proceeds will go to the Cavaliers Youth Foundation. Nike said the LeBron 14s would become widely available at retail later this month for $175, while Air Zoom Generations go on sale on Jan. 25 for $175.Advertisement"}

When he was cast in an international touring company of \u201cWest Side Story\u201d in 1998, he bought an etching at an antiques shop in Vienna. During a stop in Berlin, he bought a page from an old book. Assorted lithographs and sketches were purchased in other European capitals.\u201cThey were having trouble finding the right person,\u201d said Mr. von Essen, who saw the apartment and pronounced it amazing \u2014 \u201cthe spiral stairs and the two floors made it seem like a small house\u201d \u2014 but beyond his means.\u201cAnd my father said: \u2018Max, we\u2019ll help you out. You can\u2019t pass up this opportunity,\u2019\u201d continued Mr. von Essen, who respectfully declined to give his age. \u201cWe made it happen.\u201dSince moving in 12 years ago, he has made changes as his bank account has allowed. A leading role in the 2009 national tour of the musical \u201cXanadu\u201d paid for repairs to the oak floors and for a kitchen renovation that included raising the ceiling and losing some walls.Atop the Schumann is a Lalique lion, a cherished gift from old friends, one of several members of the animal kingdom represented in the apartment. When he was cast in \u201cAn American in Paris\u201d as the scion of a successful textile manufacturer in postwar France, Mr. von Essen did some research and learned that wealthy French families of the period liked to collect taxidermy.\u201cI decided I should get a piece of it, and I found something on eBay and fell in love with it,\u201d he said. The object of his affection, a stuffed bird, now sits on a skinny glass-topped side table. Meanwhile, Mr. von Essen\u2019s partner, Daniel Rowan, an actor, became similarly enthusiastic about a stuffed fox he bought at a vintage store in Dallas; it\u2019s perched under the stairs. And at holiday time, out comes the bearskin rug, complete with bear\u2019s head.He\u2019s got a couch. It\u2019s store-bought, unlike much of the furniture that surrounds it. For Mr. von Essen, this is about thinking green and saving green. But it\u2019s also about the pleasure he derives from owning things that have a history: the pair of nailhead-studded leather easy chairs that had been in his parents\u2019 bedroom; the silver-framed mirror that he inherited from his maternal grandparents; the bureau he got on eBay; the midcentury sideboard he found on Craigslist.But it would be hard to compete with the provenance of the simple wood classroom chair in the master bedroom. Mr. von Essen\u2019s father rescued it 40 years ago from a small fire at a vacant school in the South Bronx. \u201cMy dad had it in his office and then it was in our basement, and I said, \u2018Dad, that chair. I really love that chair. Can I have it?\u2019\u201d If he would promise to take care of it, absolutely, said his father.

Heastie first suggested that the so-called millionaires\u2019 tax might be a major issue in the session to come.\u201cNext year, we absolutely have to deal with what to do on income taxes,\u201d said Mr. Heastie, the Bronx Democrat who serves as speaker of the New York State Assembly. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll continue to push it.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the millionaires\u2019 tax, that is a $4 billion hole,\u201d Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said, citing projections of lost revenue. \u201cYou have no budget, you have nothing.\u201dThere is, however, a significant problem for Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Heastie: The Republicans who rule the State Senate are not fond of taxes or, of late, Mr. Cuomo. The governor campaigned against them last year with an eye toward tipping Albany\u2019s upper chamber into the Democrats\u2019 hands.Mr. Tedisco also said the governor played down efforts in the 2016 cycle \u2014 \u201c\u2018You can\u2019t call that campaigning,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tedisco said, recalling the governor\u2019s statement and adding that Mr. Cuomo said he had not been aggressive in using his own campaign money for other Democrats.Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, did not comment on the specifics on the meeting with the Republicans, but he said, \u201cThe governor campaigned for Democrats during the election cycle and the Senate Democrats thanked him for his efforts,\u201d adding, \u201cHe is now governing and is working in a bipartisan way.\u201dRegardless of the governor\u2019s motives, the very idea of extending the tax \u2014 which imposes a rate of 8.82 percent on individuals earning $1.1 million or more \u2014 still seemed to displease John J. Flanagan, a Republican and Senate leader. \u201cI believe in cutting taxes,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo has other plans to generate revenue, including changing New York\u2019s online sales tax law, which currently requires large online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay to collect sales tax on behalf of the state on shipments to New York buyers if the seller is also in New York.The middle-class idea may, in fact, be the key to a compromise. In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Flanagan said that the two areas in which he and the governor were in agreement were holding the line on property taxes and cutting middle-class rates.And cutting middle-class rates also syncs with Mr. Heastie\u2019s goals for the year, which he reiterated on Wednesday, but with a new wrinkle: proposing an even higher tax rate for multimillionaires to help fund education, and other programs favored by his Democratic colleagues.\u201cWe still feel we want to go beyond that,\u201d Mr. Heastie said, adding, \u201cJust the extension of the millionaires\u2019 tax won\u2019t satisfy the conference\u2019s needs.\u201dVivian Yee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And then, of course, the fees will follow. It took a chat with Robert Mujica, the governor\u2019s budget director, to explain the complexities of this change in state tax law, which is aimed at collecting taxes from those who are selling goods on the internet, but are not the principal sellers (a category it describes as \u201cmarketplace providers\u201d). Those providers \u2014 who bill for the goods \u2014 would now be responsible for collecting the sales tax under the proposal. The governor\u2019s office, however, emphasizes that the change is aimed at larger marketplace providers (see Amazon and eBay, among others), not small businesses, hence a $100 million threshold in the bill. And while the language is dense, the possible benefit to the bottom line is obvious: The Senate and the Assembly estimate the change could generate more than $135 million in revenue in fiscal year 2018-19.

The nonprofit theater, housed in the former Astor Library in NoHo, also acts as a meeting place, a public forum, a writer\u2019s brooder and a watering hole. On a recent Tuesday night, as icy winds whipped down Lafayette Street, the Public buzzed with cultural happenings. There was \u201cTiny Beautiful Things,\u201d a play adapted from a Cheryl Strayed novel; two shows at Joe\u2019s Pub (the astrologists Starsky and Cox, and the cabaret performer Justin Vivian Bond); and a meeting of the Young Presidents\u2019 Organization at the Library, its intimate restaurant and bar. Here in their roost, a flock of culture vultures paraded their plumage.What are you doing here tonight?Seeing Justin Vivian Bond.Your coat is like a Technicolor Dreamcoat.It is. It\u2019s a handmade, female, Uzbekistan, silk, ikat robe. This is a traditional pattern. I ordered it on eBay, literally from Uzbekistan. It arrived in paper, wrapped in twine and sealed with wax. Like it came out of the 1700s.And you\u2019re wearing a full-on jumpsuit underneath.I walked across Spain a couple years ago on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela. Near the end of it, I met a dairy farmer, and I asked him if he had an extra. This one was stained, so he gave it to me.Is it a pain when you need to go to the bathroom?Nah.Your spectacles look very specific.I got a Groupon for an optician in Park Slope.What about your boots?They\u2019re Swiss MBT boots. They\u2019ve got the half-moon shape. It\u2019s meant to emulate walking in sand. In the summer, I walk barefoot as much as I can, but in the winter I wear these.Your coat is magnificent.I love color. And I think it\u2019s wearable, walkable art. I designed this coat a couple years ago. It\u2019s my winter coat.You designed it yourself? How does one do that?You go into a furrier and you say, \u201cLet\u2019s dye some wool.\u201d This is Tibetan lamb, and it\u2019s nice and warm. Would you like to try it on?No, thank you. But tell me about the rest of your get-up.My boots are whatever. I\u2019d normally be wearing sparkle Uggs, but I\u2019m trying to behave tonight, so I\u2019m dressing very conservatively.Do you dress for the theater?No, I dress because I love color and I want to wear it. It pisses everybody off, but I dress for myself.Yet under your super-colorful coat you\u2019re wearing all dark colors.Yes. Black sweater and another fur. This one I bought in Spain. It\u2019s fox, and something else that died. It\u2019s knitted and very comfortable.What are you doing here tonight?Seeing Starsky and Cox \u2014 they\u2019re famous astrologists \u2014 which has been a tradition amongst friends for many years. I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll give us hope for the new year.It\u2019s zero degrees out, and you\u2019re wearing no socks.A little ankle is always sexy. Unless there\u2019s snow.Versace collection.

Cigarettes, phone, perfume: Santa Maria Novella potpourri.That\u2019s a big fur.This is one of the bigger pieces, one of three that I own. I\u2019m happy to say that I\u2019ve never bought any of the furs that I have. They\u2019ve all been passed on by elderly people. This one I actually found in my apartment when I moved in. An old lady had died, and all her stuff was there.What are you wearing underneath?A tangerine orange sweater, which is a color that makes me incredibly happy, given the weather we\u2019re having. I paired it with some olive green pants and Dr. Martens to protect me against the elements.And it\u2019s matched to your headband.This is intentional. Again, finding ways to make color pop that consciously work against the weather and the tide of the times. Also working with my skin tone. I\u2019m quite dark, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been ridiculed and exoticized for throughout my life. Coming to New York from South Africa has been exciting because I\u2019ve been able to embrace the darkness of my skin. Here it is an asset.What brings you to the Public?I\u2019m here to see a play. A friend invited me. She\u2019s a little late.Where\u2019s your coat from?Zara. It\u2019s not a big deal.You\u2019re doing a whole black look: black coat, black shirt black jeans.Those are all-American.

And they use these kind of gloves.Are you in a band?I used to be.Is this a Christmas sweater, a ski sweater or just a sweater?For me, this is a holiday sweater. I saw it at Target, right around Thanksgiving, and this is very much my style. I like the cable-knit apr\u00e8s-ski-ness of it.You\u2019ve got a little contrast collar going on underneath.I have several shirts like this from Zara. People always ask: \u201cIs it one shirt? Is it two shirts?\u201d It\u2019s one shirt with an underbelly.Very simple jeans. Perfectly slim.They\u2019re Uniqlo. People say that if you go to Uniqlo, you have to get everything tailored. You don\u2019t.The boots are neat.These are Cole Haan that I got at DSW, honest to God, probably four or five years ago. I call them my Jack boots because they look like what Jack was wearing in \u201cTitanic\u201d when he had to take his shoes off and throw them on the deck before he saved Rose.No briefcase. You\u2019re running around with a duffel bag.I\u2019m a swimmer, and I went swimming this morning before work. There\u2019s a little wear and tear to this bag, but Herschel makes a good, solid bag, and I can take it to the gym and not look ridiculous walking into work with it.Is that real fur?No, it\u2019s fake.Is that for political or financial reasons?Both.You\u2019ve paired it with a biker jacket.Is that a velvet dress underneath?A velvet, long-sleeve dress. I think it\u2019s really simple and I love the fabric. It\u2019s a really clean shape.Let\u2019s start with the hat. It can\u2019t be for warmth.It\u2019s warm because it\u2019s been painted. It\u2019s like a trademark.It\u2019s not lead paint is it? You\u2019re not like the Mad Hatter?No, it\u2019s acrylic paint. I\u2019m a painter.Your outfit is popping off with reds, like your scarf.Eighth Street. It\u2019s one of those things where I saw it and said: \u201cYes. No. Yes. No. It\u2019s very ugly. O.K., yes.\u201dThe red matches your sneakers.The sneakers are from the Kmart in Los Angeles. I had an exhibition in L.A. and needed some things for the installation and I saw these. You\u2019d never find this red in New York.Did you match them on purpose with your nails?The nails are not complete. They go with an installation I\u2019m building.Your green sweater, is that for Christmas?No. It was the only thing on the floor that wasn\u2019t dirty. It\u2019s from Goodwill.What are you doing here tonight?There\u2019s a meeting for the high-technology people at the Young Presidents\u2019 Organization.

She left her job to care for him, helping him until he died in March 2015.\u201cThe depth of my grief was really unbearable,\u201d Ms. Fludgate said. \u201cHe was my life for 32 years.

Each ball represents one of Justin Thomas\u2019s wins, starting in elementary school. In a nearby box, there are balls from his holes-in-one.Thomas\u2019s father, Mike, the club\u2019s head professional since 1990, will soon add two more balls to the collection, because his son won the Sony Open at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu on Sunday, his second victory in two weeks. In the opening round, Thomas became the seventh player in PGA Tour history \u2014 and, at 23, the youngest \u2014 to shoot a 59.\u201cWe\u2019ll get a separate glass case for that one,\u201d Mike Thomas said of the 59 ball, joking about what it might fetch on eBay. \u201cI can\u2019t have that one just sitting out in the shop.\u201dThe ball might be worth even more a few years from now.No one is playing better than Thomas at the moment. In his Sony Open victory, Thomas closed with a final-round 65 that included a birdie on the final hole and finished at 253 for the week, breaking the Tour\u2019s 72-hole scoring mark by a stroke. During the week, he also matched the Tour\u2019s lowest opening 18-hole score, broke the 36-hole mark and tied for the lowest 54-hole total.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the best of my career,\u201d Thomas said of his recent play. \u201cI definitely haven\u2019t shown the world my best golf. I haven\u2019t even shown the world great golf, or consistent, great golf.\u201dIt is also only the beginning.Thomas is among the talented golfers leading the sport\u2019s transition from the Tiger Woods era to one featuring a handful of brilliant 20-somethings, including the world No. 1 Jason Day (age 29), the second-ranked and four-time major champion Rory McIlroy (27), the two-time major winner Jordan Spieth (23), and Rickie Fowler (28), who has won six times around the world, including the Players Championship.Thomas\u2019s rapid rise, however, does not surprise those who know him best.From the first time he picked up a golf club at 18 months old \u2014 a MacGregor persimmon 2-wood that his father had cut down to child size \u2014 golf has been an obsession for Thomas, an only child. As soon as he could walk, Thomas would tag along whenever his father would practice.\u201cI remember one time him grabbing at my clubs and saying, \u2018I want to hit one,\u2019 \u201d Mike Thomas said. \u201cHe gripped the club cross-handed and started whacking balls. From that point on, all he wanted to do was hit balls. His mom would tee them up, and he\u2019d hit them.\u201dThe older Thomas said he often asked Justin if he wanted to go to the swimming pool or to play basketball. He was not interested.\u201cWhen he was 7 or 8 years old, he\u2019d call me on his way home from a tournament and say, \u2018I\u2019ll be home by 7:30, do you want to play nine holes?\u2019 \u201d Mike Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019d eat dinner at 9 or 9:30 every night. Selfishly, it allowed me to play more golf.\u201dThe older Thomas taught his son the fundamentals, but he was cautious about pushing him too hard. Most of their lessons would last 10 or 15 minutes, in part because Mike Thomas had a busy schedule teaching and competing, but also because he did not want to be overbearing.\u201cI\u2019ve seen it done wrong so many times,\u201d Mike Thomas said. \u201cIt was more important that we were friends than he was a good player.\u201dHe added: \u201cI\u2019d watch him hit a few balls and ask him what he thought was causing the ball to do what it did. I\u2019d tell him, What are you going to do, call me when you\u2019re on the 15th hole of a tournament? Because of that, he knows his own game.\u201dNot that Thomas needed any pushing. He was all in from early on, with his mother, Jani, shuttling him to tournaments.When Justin Thomas was 7, he was in the clubhouse at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky., about 20 miles from his home, when Tiger Woods battled Bob May at the 2000 PGA Championship. The autograph he sought that week was not from Woods, but from Jack Nicklaus, the career leader in major titles.Golf was in the younger Thomas\u2019s lineage, too. His father was a longtime P.G.A. of America professional who toiled on the mini tours before turning to teaching. His paternal grandfather, Paul, was the head professional at Zanesville Country Club in Ohio for more than 25 years and played in the United States Open.Justin has quickly surpassed them.In 2009, Thomas, then 16, made the cut at the PGA Tour\u2019s Wyndham Championship, and the next year he finished second in the United States Junior Amateur.As a freshman in 2011-12, Thomas became the first player at the University of Alabama to win his first career start. He went on to capture five more titles that season and was named college golf\u2019s player of the year. The following season, he helped lead Alabama to a national championship before going on to represent the United States against Europe in the Walker Cup, amateur golf\u2019s version of the Ryder Cup.Thomas turned pro in 2013 and earned his card for the Web.com Tour via qualifying school that December. He won his first professional tournament at the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital Championship in 2014 and ended the season third in the Web.com Tour finals to secure his PGA Tour card for 2015.Thomas is slight, at 5 feet 10 inches and 140 pounds, but he became one of the best strikers and longer hitters, accumulating seven top-10 finishes in 2015. He also finished second to Daniel Berger in the rookie of the year voting.But he was feeling the burden of expectation.Part of a notable high school class of 2011 that included Spieth and Berger, Thomas watched as Spieth, whom he had grown close to and had competed against for several years, reached superstardom after winning the first two majors of 2015.Thomas was also frustrated by a handful of missed opportunities to win that season. So he took Nicklaus up on an offer to call if he ever needed anything. Nicklaus invited Thomas to his home in Palm Beach, Fla., and the two talked for nearly three hours. There was a particularly telling insight.\u201cI had the same game plan during a tournament when I was playing bad as when I playing good: being just as aggressive, hitting at every pin,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re hitting it bad, you can\u2019t do that. When I\u2019m playing bad, I need to just hit the green. I remember that talk a lot.\u201dThe success of Spieth also pushed Thomas.\u201cI wasn\u2019t mad, but it was maybe a little frustrating sometimes seeing some friends and peers my age do well,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cNot because I wasn\u2019t cheering for them \u2014 because I feel like I was as good as them. It\u2019s just immature of me. I mean, the fact of the matter is, over the course of a long career, we\u2019re going to beat each other.\u201dNow Thomas is on top, and Spieth, who finished third Sunday, is not surprised.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cThere was no doubt, whether we believed it was as hard as it is or not, we just chose to shrug it off, and hey, we\u2019re just going to go to the next level and the next level.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s cool to have almost a dozen guys from our high school class out here on the PGA Tour in their early 20s. It\u2019s very rare. It\u2019s very cool. Not only that, but also winning and obviously we\u2019ve got a 59 now, the first 59 out of our class.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Helping Mobile Publishing? Some Publishers Are Not So Sure", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last month, Federico Viticci, who runs MacStories, a news site devoted to Apple and its products, made a change in how the site publishes articles for mobile gadgets. MacStories, he declared, would no longer support a Google-backed method for faster loading of mobile web pages, called AMP.AMP has since delivered on its promise of faster mobile web pages. Even so, publishers \u2014 of smaller sites, especially, or individual bloggers \u2014 are beginning to worry about giving too much control to Google in exchange for zippier web pages. What\u2019s more, Google\u2019s approach to AMP has rankled some critics already suspicious of the company\u2019s outsize influence on the internet.Much of the publishers\u2019 unease is rooted in Google\u2019s presentation of AMP stories, which appear as if they are Google articles. That\u2019s because Google, to speed up AMP, stores copies of publisher\u2019s pages and serves them from its own internet network. So when a reader clicks an AMP link, the address bar at the top of the page displays google.com instead of the actual web address from the publisher.\u201cIt looks like a Google story,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a web search news site. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why you\u2019re getting the nervousness from some of these publishers.\u201dGoogle said that it had designed AMP to prioritize speed and that it wanted to help \u2014 not harm \u2014 publishers, who get full accounting of traffic, data and advertising revenue. Publishers also retain control of their content and design. Google said serving up articles from its own internet network was the best way it knew to achieve the AMP speeds, which are as much as four times faster than a regular mobile web page.\u201cWe always try to present the content that is the best experience,\u201d said David Besbris, Google\u2019s vice president of engineering.Google started AMP in 2015 because it worried that competitors like Facebook were drawing web surfers inside their networks with faster-loading articles and keeping them there. For Google, those rival sites were siphoning people away from the open internet, where the search company \u2014 which created the internet\u2019s most valuable property by organizing the expanse of the World Wide Web \u2014 typically operates.Now articles that use AMP appear prominently in Google search results on mobile devices. A Google search for \u201cDonald Trump\u201d on a smartphone brings back a horizontal carousel of articles from media organizations like Slate and The Wall Street Journal at the top of the page. If someone clicks the first story in the carousel, he or she is moved into a browser and can swipe instantly from one story to another without leaving Google\u2019s network.Another benefit of AMP for Google is that it keeps activity on the web, and away from apps. More browsing on the internet means more web searches, and, in most cases, that means more Google. This is even more pronounced on mobile devices, where Google accounts for about 95 percent of all global web searches, according to StatCounter.David Gehring, a former Google employee and the chief executive of Relay Media, a company that works with publishers to convert pages to AMP, said the format had been positive for publishers grappling with shrinking revenue in the shift from print to online advertising. He estimated that up to 10 percent of mobile web content was already on AMP.Yet Mr. Gehring also said Google suffered from \u201ctone deafness\u201d when it came to explaining the benefits of AMP, such as the ability for publishers to syndicate articles across the mobile web without losing advertising or traffic.\u201cIt made me feel like my site wasn\u2019t my own,\u201d Mr. Kras said.Still, Mr. Kras decided to keep AMP because it was fast. \"For that, a lot of little things can be (temporarily) forgotten,\u201d he said.Several bigger publishers say they are pleased with AMP and do not see anything worrisome with Google.\u201cGoogle has been a good partner,\u201d said Mark Silverstein, the head of business development at The Huffington Post, which is planning to push almost all of its news content into AMP. \u201cWhen they make decisions, they do a good job of explaining why they reached that decision.\u201dEmily Smith, head of content operations at Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s Wired magazine, said supporting AMP had pushed its mobile articles to the top of search results. For web surfers conditioned to believe that the most relevant information is presented first in search results, it\u2019s important for a media organization to be near the top.\u201cIt\u2019s like being above the fold in a newspaper,\u201d she said.About 15 percent of The Washington Post\u2019s traffic comes from AMP pages. The Post is now using the lessons from AMP to move its articles to a separate, faster-running mobile platform that runs like an app but does so over the web.Joey Marburger, director of products for The Post, said that its readers were scrolling further on AMP stories, but that it was building its own fast system to gain greater control over ads and features.\u201cWe have to be where our readers are coming from,\u201d Mr. Marburger said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also important to have more control over our own content.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "$220 for a Vintage Prince T-Shirt? Um, Deal!", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byThe CollectorI probably shouldn\u2019t start out by telling you that I left the family Christmas table for 40 minutes trying, in vain, to buy myself a T-shirt on eBay. But someone had died: George Michael.The day before, I had been eyeing a shirt from his \u201cFaith\u201d tour that was selling on eBay for $60. Now, prices would surely skyrocket.Wasn\u2019t rock \u2019n\u2019 roll \u2014 at least, in part \u2014 a lament against rampant consumerism and bourgeois society?Ah, well. To be a vintage concert T-shirt collector in 2017 is to dispense with the ordinary customs of rational society.At least I\u2019m not alone. The retailer Jeffrey Kalinsky collects old Electric Light Orchestra and Pink Floyd T-shirts, which a tailor at the eponymous owner\u2019s store in the meatpacking district cuts down to his size.Craig Kallman, the chief executive of Atlantic Records, has amassed a surplus of more than a thousand T-shirts, the most expensive of which is a Led Zeppelin shirt from the Bath Festival in 1970. \u201cA thousand dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a museum piece.\u201dThe prices for a band\u2019s vintage merch largely jibe with its critical reputation. So shirts for Led Zeppelin and the Clash cost more than those for Guns N\u2019 Roses, which go for more than Def Leppard or Heart T-shirts, which fetch more than M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, which are basically tied with Bon Jovi.When I started collecting a decade ago, I had a rule against buying shirts for shows I hadn\u2019t attended. Then came a Prince and the Revolution shirt from the Purple Rain tour, which I found in the East Village for $45.The fit was perfect, but it was more than that. The shirt seemed to telegraph everything I hoped to be: Masculine, if not butch. An iconoclast, but not a pedantically esoteric one.So what if I hadn\u2019t been there? I had seen him on every tour since 1993. And it wasn\u2019t as if I was spending $150, a price only a moron would pay. Nor did I take my T-shirt to the tailor, a practice popularized by Jennifer Aniston.Those rules broke down soon enough. The Purple Rain shirt was my gateway drug.It got to be tissue-paper thin, so I replaced it with one I found on eBay for $85. When the replacement didn\u2019t fit as well, I had my neighborhood dry cleaner recut it to the shape of the one that was expiring. Last October, I wore the replacement to the gym and left it in the locker room, where it was snatched up by a thief with good taste.Since Prince had died, prices were skyrocketing. So I forked over $220 to a seller in Malaysia for another one. While waiting for it to arrive, I fell down a rabbit hole known as Etsy. It has less merchandise than eBay but is better curated, with fewer counterfeits.Thankfully, I didn\u2019t buy that one. It helped that it wasn\u2019t in my size.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Overcome Your Cash Conundrums With the Power of Psychology", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Adam Smith and the fathers of traditional economics gave us the idea of humans as rational economic actors, primed to make self-interested decisions that lead to good outcomes for everyone. We have the founders of behavioral economics to thank for tearing this idea down over the last few decades.The leading lights in the field, such as the psychologist Daniel Kahneman and the Chicago economist Richard Thaler, have cataloged the seemingly countless ways in which we fool ourselves into making bad decisions that lead to problematic economic outcomes.Claudia Hammond, a BBC journalist, has come along to provide an approachable and very practical field guide to putting these findings into use and making smarter decisions with our own money.Employing the time-tested tools of pop-science journalism \u2014 chatty tone, self-deferential personal anecdotes and real-world examples \u2014 she animates all the various research findings.To explain the concept of \u201canchoring,\u201d for instance, she looks at credit card companies and the minimum monthly payments their customers are required by law to pay. While intended to protect customers, they also work to the companies\u2019 advantage: With the set minimum, the research shows, customers end up paying less than if there were no minimum at all, racking up ever more debt. Our thinking gets anchored to the minimum as the proper amount to pay.There\u2019s a self-help quality to Hammond\u2019s approach. On anchoring, she says that in negotiations or when putting your Tommy Bahama shirt on eBay, avoid setting an opening price. Any number you provide will establish a guideline for what your shirt is worth and will discourage bidders from going much higher.Hammond also draws out broader social consequences. To stick with anchoring, she notes that when lawyers in an experiment were given the facts of a shoplifting case and were then asked to randomly roll some dice, they recommended a longer sentence if the number on the dice they rolled was higher, a hint of the way unexpected and unrelated stimulus can wield enormous influence.In a particularly sharp chapter, Hammond looks at the pitfalls of financial incentives. Studies of children who have been paid to paint pictures show they lose their intrinsic motivation to paint. And when Israeli parents were fined for picking up their children late at preschool, they started being late more often. They came to see their timeliness as part of a transaction rather than a social responsibility. \u201cThe offer of money had \u2018crowded out\u2019 people\u2019s sense of civic duty,\u201d she writes.The whole chapter serves as a potent reminder of how counterproductive market-based solutions can sometimes be.Too much of \u201cMind Over Money\u201d will be unsurprising if you\u2019ve paid even passing attention to the work being done by behavioral economists and the numerous financial advice columns they have inspired. Most readers probably have heard that there\u2019s more joy to be gained spending money on experiences rather than on things \u2014 or that winning the lottery will not make you happier in the long run. But Hammond still spends six pages describing those unhappy lottery winners.At the end of the book, she mentions having cited 263 different studies, and by this point, it comes as no surprise. The book occasionally feels like a long night at the bar with a bunch of researchers recounting every study they\u2019ve ever done, with only the thinnest of connective tissue. Some readers may just want to go back and read those who pioneered this research, like Kahneman and Dan Ariely, often good and entertaining writers themselves.But in a society that seems eager to introduce markets and money into more and more elements of daily life, there can be no shortage of reminders of how these markets \u2014 and our own irrationality in dealing with them \u2014 can lead us astray.Nathaniel Popper is a business reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
