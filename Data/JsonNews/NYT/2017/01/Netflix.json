{"Headline": "Ayelet Waldman: By the Book", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byBy the BookThe author, most recently, of \u201cA Really Good Day\u201d maybe isn\u2019t a fan of the \u201cnurse romance\u201d genre. But \u201ccome to think of it, \u2018Atonement,\u2019 by Ian McEwan, is one of my favorite contemporary novels, and what is that if not a nurse romance?\u201dWhat books are currently on your night stand?\u201cCertainty,\u201d by Madeleine Thien; \u201cA Meal in Winter,\u201d by Hubert Mingarelli; and the book that\u2019s currently breaking my heart, \u201cDear Friend, From My Life I Write to You in Your Life,\u201d by Yiyun Li.What\u2019s the last great book you read?\u201cExit West,\u201d by Mohsin Hamid, which I consumed in one frantic gulp a day or two after the election. It was as if Hamid knew what was going to happen to America and the world, and gave us a road map to our future. It\u2019s a novel about refugees and doors \u2014 portals \u2014 that magically whisk them away from the dangerous and deadly place to somewhere new. Sometimes those new places are themselves dangerous and deadly. Sometimes they\u2019re not. Generally, I am far too practical and cynical to enjoy magic realism, but this book blew the top off my head. It\u2019s at once terrifying and, in the end, oddly hopeful.What\u2019s the best classic novel you recently read for the first time?This summer my husband and I were invited to Dublin for Bloomsday, and at the last minute I found out that we were both to be interviewed, onstage, as part of the festivities. I had assumed I\u2019d be safely watching from the wings. In a panic, I tried (again) to read \u201cUlysses.\u201d The first time I attempted the book was in my senior year of high school, under the tutelage of an enthusiastic English teacher. Once a week, early in the morning before school started, we\u2019d gather in his classroom and struggle through a page or two. I made copious margin notes to the first dozen or so pages of my mother\u2019s college edition. Then I threw in the towel.I\u2019ve repeated that experience, minus the notes, six or seven times in the decades since. This time, however, I had a stroke of genius. Instead of battling it out on the page, I listened to it on audiobook. I got much farther than I ever had before, listening daily as I tromped through the woods with my sweet (and now sadly departed) dog. However, the audiobook is so damn long. Twenty-seven hours! Not even my dog had the energy for that much hiking. I ended up going onstage having only read about half of the book I was ostensibly there to celebrate. I\u2019d intended to fake it \u2014 it was Bloomsday in Dublin; surely I could count on the audience to be sufficiently in their cups not to notice \u2014 but I\u2019m a compulsive confessor. Within a minute I\u2019d admitted the truth. I like to think the audience was laughing with me, not at me.What\u2019s your favorite book no one else has heard of? \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d by Walter Tevis. I have exactly zero interest in chess, and yet I adore this book. It\u2019s suspenseful and heartbreaking and just wonderful.Which writers \u2014 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \u2014 working today do you admire most? For inspiration in these times I look to Dahlia Lithwick and Emily Bazelon, who are to my mind the two most sophisticated American writers on the intersection of law and politics. Rebecca Solnit\u2019s essays on environmentalism and feminism are required reading. Peggy Orenstein\u2019s work on gender, especially her latest book, \u201cGirls and Sex,\u201d is fascinating and important.For diversion (also important in these times), I highly recommend two writers of speculative fiction, Charlie Jane Anders and Naomi Alderman.What\u2019s the last book that made you laugh?\u201cLoving Day,\u201d by Mat Johnson, about a man who describes himself as a \u201cracial optical illusion.\u201d Among other fine moments is a particularly delicious one featuring a broken condom.The last book that made you furious?I was enraged when I read \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d by Michelle Alexander, but with a productive fury. The book is a fierce dissection of the American justice system and of the policies of mass incarceration that have immiserated generations of African-Americans. The country has begun to reckon with the systemic racism polluting the criminal justice system, inspired in no small part by Alexander\u2019s book and by others, like \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d by Ta-Nehisi Coates.Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?I\u2019ll read good writing in any genre. Well, maybe not nurse romance. Though, come to think of it, \u201cAtonement,\u201d by Ian McEwan, is one of my favorite contemporary novels, and what is that if not a nurse romance?How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night?I read both paper and electronically, though when I\u2019m home I prefer to read on paper. Out of the house, I read electronically, primarily because my greatest fear in life is finishing my book and being stuck with nothing to read.Though I\u2019m a frantic multitasker, what that usually means is that I do many things poorly, all at once. That\u2019s fine if what I\u2019m screwing up is cooking dinner or doing my taxes. Truly important things like reading, however, demand focus and attention. I read one book at a time, until I\u2019ve either finished it or tossed it aside as not worth the effort.I read primarily at night. My husband works at night, and my children are all old enough to be uninterested in my company, so every evening at around 8 I crawl into bed, watch TV for an hour or two (or six, depending on what Netflix is streaming), and then read until I fall asleep, at around midnight or 1 a.m. If a book is good, though, I\u2019ll just keep reading until I\u2019m done, whatever time that is. My favorite thing about being an adult is that there is no one who calls \u201cBedtime\u201d and snaps off my bedside light right in the middle of the best part. I get to read for as long as I want.How do you organize your books?Not long ago, my husband decided in a fit of who knows what lunatic O.C.D. to organize the books in our summer house by color, an odd move when you consider that both our sons are colorblind. The result has been that between the months of June and August, I have no idea where anything is, and am forced to just buy a second copy of any book I want to reread. A tip for book jacket designers looking to stand out: There are very few purple book jackets out there. Black, on the other hand, is sadly overused.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?I didn\u2019t have a lot of friends, my parents didn\u2019t have cable television and I\u2019m not at all athletic, so really all I ever did as a child was read. I read while I brushed my teeth, I read while I walked to school. I slipped novels behind my textbooks and read in class.My very favorite book was \u201cHalf Magic,\u201d by Edward Eager. I loved \u201cThe Railway Children,\u201d anything by Roald Dahl, the Little House books and the Borrowers series. I was an avid reader of science fiction, an obsession that began for me, like for so many, with \u201cThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\u201d and moved on to books like \u201cThe Chrysalids\u201d and \u201cThe Day of the Triffids,\u201d by John Wyndham, and the Chronicles of Amber, by Roger Zelazny. When I was very little, I loved the All-of-a-Kind Family books. Unlike most of the books I loved as a child, which hold up remarkably well, when I bought the All-of-a-Kind Family books to read to my kids, I found them to be nauseatingly cloying. Everyone was so well meaning and kind. I much prefer the twisted world of \u201cHarriet the Spy.\u201d As a preteen I went through a Holocaust literature phase. \u201cThe Diary of Anne Frank\u201d was my gateway drug.You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?Alice Waters, Julia Child and Yotam Ottolenghi. But only if it\u2019s potluck.Of the books you\u2019ve written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful? And do you have a favorite among the books written by your husband, Michael Chabon?\u201cDaughter\u2019s Keeper\u201d is not my best, but it\u2019s the novel that means the most to me. It was with \u201cDaughter\u2019s Keeper\u201d that I finally realized that I wasn\u2019t a lawyer on maternity leave, but a writer with aspirations beyond just keeping myself from going crazy while trapped in the house with babies. The book is about a young woman who gets caught up in a drug deal and ends up facing a long prison sentence. It\u2019s about the war on drugs and about motherhood. There are things I\u2019m embarrassed of in the book \u2014 my thinking on race in particular has evolved, as has, I hope, my prose \u2014 but, looking back, I admire my ambition.The two midwives in \u201cTelegraph Avenue\u201d are my favorite of my husband\u2019s characters. They feel more real to me than do most people I know.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lucas Hedges Moves From \u2018Manchester\u2019 to the Stage", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byWhen Lucas Hedges was a child, he fantasized about becoming an actor in Hollywood, imagining himself doing all the \u201csuperficial\u201d stuff \u2014 being interviewed, having his photo taken, getting an IMDB page, winning awards.He also shot two more high-profile films this year \u2014 Greta Gerwig\u2019s directorial debut, \u201cLady Bird,\u201d opposite Saoirse Ronan, and Martin McDonagh\u2019s \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d with Frances McDormand \u2014 while taking a year off from college at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, where he is majoring in drama. Right now, though, he\u2019s immersed in a new challenge, making his professional stage debut Off Broadway in Anna Jordan\u2019s \u201cYen.\u201d The play, produced by MCC Theater, begins previews on Thursday, Jan. 12.\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to be 20 years old and to have your wildest dreams come true,\u201d Mr. Hedges said over a veggie burger and fries near his parents\u2019 home in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like, where do you go from here?\u201dHis early forays into acting, though, were inauspicious. When Mr. Hedges was in sixth grade, he played Puck in his English class production of \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d and \u201cspent the entire time saying my lines and tying my shoe. My face was bright red because I was so nervous,\u201d he said.In seventh grade, he auditioned for the school play and was cast in an adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019s \u201cNicholas Nickleby,\u201d but he immediately decided he couldn\u2019t go through with it because of his stage fright. \u201cI ran outside and into my Mom\u2019s arms and burst into tears. She walked me around the block and said: \u2018You don\u2019t have to do it. But just take a day to think about it.\u2019\u201d That night he changed his mind.\u201cSure enough, every single day in the wings before I went on, my face turned bright red,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I persevered.\u201dSensitive and introspective, Mr. Hedges was a huge \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fan and a self-professed Anglophile as a child. So on the surface he doesn\u2019t share a lot in common with his character, Patrick, of \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d a snarky, easygoing teenager who juggles two girlfriends and plays in a terrible garage band. \u201cHe has a kind of all-American confidence that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had. Like I said before, I\u2019m a very insecure person and have a lot of self-doubt. I think Patrick has that, too. But his persona is that of extreme confidence and playfulness.\u201dMr. Lonergan praised Mr. Hedges for bringing the required \u201csensitivity and emotional transparency\u201d to the role. On set, he said, Mr. Hedges shared Patrick\u2019s liveliness and energy and ease at connecting with people, but he also brought a soul-searching quality to his performance. (Mr. Hedges\u2019s parents told him that he met Mr. Lonergan when he was very young, in a stroller.)\u201cLucas is definitely a real introspective person and thinks a lot about what he\u2019s doing and if he\u2019s doing the right thing, and I don\u2019t think Patrick thinks that way consciously,\u201d Mr. Lonergan said in a phone interview. \u201cBut I think the fact that Lucas is like that gives a bit more depth to Patrick, some inner layers, inner twists and turns that I hadn\u2019t thought of directly.\u201dHench, Mr. Hedges\u2019s 16-year-old character in the harsh but tender \u201cYen,\u201d is another lost, abandoned adolescent, crippled by shame. He and his younger brother live in a squalid flat. Their irresponsible, alcoholic mother, who hasn\u2019t been home in weeks, turns up passed out in the grass outside.The brothers share a single T-shirt between them, subsist on leftover junk food, and while away the hours streaming porn, playing video games and rarely venturing outside. But their feral existence gets upended when a neighbor barges in to check on their neglected dog, who she has seen scratching at the windows.\u201cI think if you were to like pluck out any given scene from the play and just look at it on its own, you might be appalled by some of these characters,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you see the play as a whole, it\u2019s impossible not to understand that the characters are deeply human and longing to be loved.\u201dMr. Hedges said he\u2019s happy to have \u201cYen\u201d as a distraction from the mania of awards season. Most important, he\u2019s trying to keep the self-doubt at bay and not put undue pressure on himself. \u201cI\u2019m a beginner. So I\u2019m just trying to get myself back into the head space of, \u2018This is the first play I\u2019ve ever done,\u2019 and out of the space of, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019 Because in reality, I have no idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the academy also moved past two #OscarsSoWhite years by honoring six black actors \u2014 a record \u2014 and including diverse films like \u201cMoonlight,\u201d \u201cFences\u201d and \u201cHidden Figures\u201d in the best picture race.\u201cIt makes me feel good to see such a multifaceted group of people get recognized,\u201d said Barry Jenkins, the director of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d which received eight nominations. Speaking by phone from Amsterdam, where he was promoting the film, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s an affirmation that film has the power to erode barriers and reveal what makes us all human.\u201dNine movies, most of them cobbled together outside the studio system, will compete for Hollywood\u2019s top prize.

And Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cSully\u201d had to make do with one nomination, for sound editing. Once again, the academy stubbornly refused to bow toward popular movies; the hard-campaigning \u201cDeadpool\u201d received nothing, even in work-a-day categories.In a sharp contrast to the previous two years, when the academy put forward all-white rosters of acting nominees, voters chose the largest number of black candidates ever. Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris each received a nod for their supporting work in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d a poetic drama about a young black man in Miami. Viola Davis (\u201cFences\u201d) and Octavia Spencer (\u201cHidden Figures\u201d) were also nominated for supporting actress. Joining Ms. Negga in the lead categories was Mr. Washington of \u201cFences,\u201d an adaptation of August Wilson\u2019s classic play about black life in 1950s Pittsburgh.Among companies, Amazon was a big winner on Tuesday, beating Netflix to become the first streaming service to earn an Academy Award nomination for best picture. Amazon bought \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival.

J.: Made in America,\u201d has found himself in dazzling company of late, thanks to the tremendous response to his documentary, which millions have seen.\u201cIf you think you\u2019re watching a film, it\u2019s a film,\u201d Mr. Meyers said. \u201cNo one\u2019s watching \u2018Dance Moms\u2019 going, \u2018Is this a movie?\u2019\u201dIn one sense, a big one, the point is moot, because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences deemed \u201cO. J.\u201d eligible. The film landed the newspaper review and theatrical release required under the academy\u2019s rules, which also demand four daily screenings. But \u201cO. J.,\u201d because of its length, was given the O.K. to screen twice a day instead.\u201cIt is not unprecedented for the academy to make special accommodations for films with long running times,\u201d a spokeswoman for the organization wrote in an email.And while the Bagger isn\u2019t putting \u201cO. J.\u201d on trial here, there is also the matter of intent.\u201cI told Connor from the start that I wouldn\u2019t make a mini-series,\u201d Mr. Edelman said. \u201cThe only reason I took this on was the challenge of making an epic film.\u201dThe result, culled from 800 hours of footage and 72 interviews, is a 7 hour 47 minute opus that wowed at its 2016 premiere at Sundance. The filmmaker Michael Moore, in an interview with the Bagger, called the work \u201cepic\u201d and \u201cbrilliant,\u201d and very much a film. He also noted that a few years ago, he successfully pushed for tighter academy rules to ensure that documentaries had proper theatrical releases.\u201cWe wanted to make sure that the system was not abused by TV networks to cop an extra gold statue,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that that\u2019s what was going on here. I don\u2019t think they begin their mornings at ESPN with: \u2018How do we get Oscars gold? I know \u2014 we need a nine-hour movie! That\u2019s it!\u2019\u201dAnother question about \u201cO. J.\u201d is whether it\u2019s fair for a work presented as a mini-series to be granted Oscar contention, and what precedent that might set. However, the film was broadcast all in one day, once, with commercials, on ESPN.Very long films have gained Oscar attention before. \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d which is more than seven hours, won best foreign-language film in 1969. \u201cLittle Dorrit,\u201d at about six hours, landed two nominations in 1989, apparently a year of great patience, for it was also when \u201cHotel Terminus,\u201d a four-and-a-half-hour film about Klaus Barbie, took home the Oscar for best documentary feature. Among the most famous Oscar snubs is Claude Lanzmann\u2019s 10-hour 1985 documentary, \u201cShoah,\u201d which didn\u2019t land a nomination.It\u2019s hard to say if any ill feelings toward Mr. Edelman\u2019s \u201cO. J.\u201d are really a thing or the product of sour grapes or whisper campaigns, which documentaries \u2014 especially those leading the race \u2014 are not immune to. \u201cI can guarantee you there is no one on that shortlist who didn\u2019t wish they\u2019d made it,\u201d said John Battsek, executive producer of the Oscar-winning nonfiction \u201cSearching for Sugar Man.\u201dMr. Kenner was evasive about whether he saw \u201cO. J.\u201d as movie or mini, but said stretching the boundaries of documentaries was a good thing: \u201cThe fact is it did qualify, and to judge it on its merits, it was a totally superior piece of work.\u201dAnd Ms. Johnson said she unequivocally saw it as a great film.\u201cA film finds its length, and if a film can earn its presence, that is what matters,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cMany subjects demand much more time than we give them to actually succeed.

From real princesses. Why resort to computer-animated Polynesian or Nordic teenagers when you can watch a tale of empowerment and agency about a young woman who actually became queen of the United Kingdom?And while sumptuous still applies, stuffy is not a word that in any way describes \u201cVictoria,\u201d which begins with one of the sturdiest of costume-drama clich\u00e9s: the pounding hooves, matched by pulse-quickening music, of a horse bearing a rider bearing news of great import. William IV has died, and his 18-year-old niece, Alexandrina Victoria, is the new queen.In many productions, this would be the occasion for some pomp and circumstance, but not in \u201cVictoria,\u201d which comes from the British network ITV, the BBC\u2019s commercial competitor. Here, the young queen climbs out of bed (flashing her shapely legs through her nightgown), looks longingly at a doll (childhood\u2019s over!), throws on a robe for a meeting with a couple of royal functionaries and then gambols down the halls of her palace with her pet spaniel.As palace-bound melodramas go, \u201cVictoria\u201d is perfectly easy to watch, as long as you don\u2019t mind that it never for a second feels as if you were watching something that could actually have taken place in the mid-19th century. Central to this effect is the casting of Jenna Coleman as Victoria. She plays the queen in much the same way she played the Doctor\u2019s companion on several seasons of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d \u2014 spunky, sharp-edged, thoroughly modern. She\u2019s immensely likable, and not in the least believable as a historical monarch.But Ms. Coleman is surrounded by people who give the series a little more weight, particularly Rufus Sewell as a pin-up version of Lord Melbourne, Victoria\u2019s first prime minister, on whom she has quite a bit more than a schoolgirl crush.The first season of \u201cVictoria\u201d takes its title character through the birth of her first child in 1840, which leaves 60 more years of her reign for future seasons. (A second is already in the works.) Taking a broader view, there are not that many queens of England, and only six have been undisputed monarchs. If someone hurries up and makes series about Anne, Elizabeth I and a couple of Marys, we\u2019ll have a complete set.Advertisement"}

A deadpan Prince Albert read her a lame joke from a magazine to cheer her up. \u201cWe are not amused,\u201d she muttered.\u201cAlthough \u2018Victoria\u2019 has a romantic sensibility, at its heart it is about a concept so modern that it still frightens people: a young woman in power,\u201d who had direction over her life that one doesn\u2019t expect in a period drama, Ms. Goodwin said.Ms. Goodwin, who studied history \u2014 with a focus on the Victorian \u2014 at Cambridge University, said that her vision of the adolescent, impetuous Victoria came in part from being a parent. \u201cI have a 16-year-old daughter, and we had a row one day, and I thought, what if we woke up and she was the boss of me?\u201d Ms. Goodwin said.Initially, she planned to write a novel about Victoria. \u201cI had read her diaries and had a sort of epiphany about her friskiness as a young girl,\u201d she said. \u201cI began to work on it, but I\u2019m not really equipped to be a novelist alone. I soon thought, why has no one done this as a TV series?\u201dIn a telephone interview, Mr. Sewell said that his research allayed any fears that Lord Melbourne had been too \u201csouped up\u201d for modern-day audiences. \u201cHe was very attractive to women all his life; he was a proper Regency rake, and he really liked women.\u201d But Mr. Sewell and Ms. Goodwin did decide to deviate from one part of the record: portraying Lord Melbourne in his historically correct late 50s. \u201cIt seemed a waste to lose my late 40s,\u201d he said.Eventually, Victoria falls for and marries Mr. Hughes\u2019s brooding, perfectly German-accented Albert, and the series ends with the birth of their first child.Ms. Goodwin, steeped in Victorian fiction, uses many of those tropes in the series: a bit of Emma, a bit of Mr. Knightley, a bit of Dickens. \u201cBut in those works, women are mostly such passive agents,\u201d she said. \u201cHere you can subvert the normal marriage plot, because it\u2019s Victoria who has the power and must propose to Albert.\u201dThe next season, Ms. Goodwin said, will deviate from the usual period drama fare as well. \u201cIt will be about the very modern dilemma of dealing with the job, children and a power struggle with your husband,\u201d she said.She added: \u201cIt\u2019s about a woman who gets to call the shots in her life at a time when that was very difficult for women, and that\u2019s a powerful thing. At the same time, it\u2019s quite sprightly and funny and romantic, and I think that\u2019s what is pretty much missing in the TV landscape now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Valeant Had a Bright Idea but Took It Too Far", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsValeant Pharmaceuticals International\u2019s failed strategy had a grain of sense at its center. Drug makers spend over $50 billion a year on research and development, but the payoff keeps declining. Valeant tried to address the problem by acquiring companies, slashing research outlays and jacking up prices to keep the top line growing. But its aggressive approach backfired.The projected return for the dozen biggest-spending companies \u2014 a group that includes Merck, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline \u2014 has declined to less than 4 percent last year from 10 percent in 2010, according to a report this month by Deloitte. The consultancy compared estimated future cash flows from new drugs with total expenditure on developing and licensing late-stage medicines.Both numbers are going the wrong way for the industry. The projected peak annual revenue for a typical new drug has declined to under $400 million \u2014 less than half what it was in 2010. And the associated development cost has risen by about 30 percent over the same period to $1.5 billion, according to Deloitte.But Valeant\u2019s solution carried an idea to excess. It ended up paying too much for companies with mediocre drugs, and its merger conveyor ground to a halt, leaving it teetering under a huge debt load. That is why it is offloading assets, including two roughly $1 billion sales this week.The company\u2019s steep price increases also fueled complaints, which led to political scrutiny of practices elsewhere \u2014 for example, Mylan\u2019s pricing of its EpiPen, a treatment for allergic shock. The biggest American drug distributor, McKesson, said in October that fewer companies were raising prices and by smaller-than-expected amounts.That means big drug makers are losing control of a lever that, used more judiciously, could keep their sales growing. Maybe they need to accept their own shortcomings in discovering new drugs and either shrink or build partnerships with smaller firms with more productive labs.Advertisement"}

Instead of offering conventional predictions, I\u2019m going to offer up some Black Swans \u2014 things that were considered unthinkable but may now be thinkable, in a blue-sky, the-world-is-upside-down kind of way. Consider some of these thought experiments, if nothing else.This one may be slightly more plausible: Masayoshi Son, the billionaire controlling shareholder of Sprint \u2014 and a newfound friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who pledged to invest $100 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs \u2014 makes a bid to merge Sprint with T-Mobile. Under most antitrust analysis, such a deal would be dead on arrival. But perhaps under a new business-friendly administration \u2014 and given Mr. Son\u2019s public support for the president-elect \u2014 the transaction gets the green light?Here\u2019s another: With the possibility that the Trump\u2019s administration will undo net-neutrality laws that allow content companies to transmit unlimited data over cable company pipes, Netflix will finally accept a takeover bid \u2014 from Disney, which has been looking for a way to create an even stronger direct relationship with its customers. It would be Robert A. Iger\u2019s final megadeal before his contract expires in 2018. It would also pave the way for Mr. Iger to hire digitally savvy Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, a Disney board member, to take over for him.John G. Stumpf, the chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo, wasn\u2019t supposed to end his career this way. He is a reasonable and \u2014 dare I say \u2014 decent man, yet he led a bank engaged in one of the most blatant financial scandals in recent memory. Wells opened up millions of accounts without the permission of its customers, just to goose internal numbers. In truth, customers lost only $1.5 million, which, if we\u2019re being honest, is minuscule for a bank the size of Wells Fargo. The problem is that Mr. Stumpf treated it as a blip on the radar screen and ignored the significant damage his bank was doing to real people. And when he was called to account, he didn\u2019t have the right answers. Ultimately, he resigned, which was the right decision. But it could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 all been avoided.President and Michelle Obama couldn\u2019t make it to dinner (the venue might have been a turnoff). But whatever you think of his stewardship of the nation, he deserves our thanks. For those of us who pay attention to economic statistics, Mr. Obama walked into the worst economic crisis in recent history. We are now in the longest economic expansion and monthly job creation in history. Was he alone responsible? No, but it happened on his watch. Could we have gone faster with different policies? Very possibly. We will see just how much faster we can grow and if there is a cost to doing so under the next administration. Was he perfect? Of course not. But in a town that\u2019s filled with scandals and red flags about conflicts of interest \u2014 which are often skewered in this annual column \u2014 the Obamas stand out for avoiding those questions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Netflix Is Deepening Our Cultural Echo Chambers", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtWhen \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d started its run on CBS in December 1975, it became an instant hit and remained so for almost a decade.In its first year, \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d a sitcom about working-class families produced by the TV impresario Norman Lear, regularly attracted 17 million viewers every week, according to Nielsen. Mr. Lear\u2019s other comedies were even bigger hits: One out of every three households with a television watched \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d for instance.Yet, well intentioned and charming as the new streaming version may be, there\u2019s a crucial aspect of the old \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d that it will almost certainly fail to replicate: broad cultural reach.It\u2019s not just TV, either. Across the entertainment business, from music to movies to video games, technology has flooded us with a profusion of cultural choice.Instead, we\u2019re returning to the cultural era that predated radio and TV, an era in which entertainment was fragmented and bespoke, and satisfying a niche was a greater economic imperative than entertaining the mainstream.\u201cWe\u2019re back to normal, in a way, because before there was broadcasting, there wasn\u2019t much of a shared culture,\u201d said Lance Strate, a professor of communication at Fordham University. \u201cFor most of the history of civilization, there was nothing like TV. It was a really odd moment in history to have so many people watching the same thing at the same time.\u201dYet for a brief while, from the 1950s to the late 1980s, broadcast television served cultural, social and political roles far greater than the banality of its content would suggest. Because it featured little choice, TV offered something else: the raw material for a shared culture. Television was the thing just about everyone else was watching at the same time as you. In its enforced similitude, it became a kind of social glue, stitching together a new national identity across a vast, growing and otherwise diverse nation.\u201cWhat we gained was a shared identity and shared experience,\u201d Mr. Strate said. \u201cThe famous example was Kennedy\u2019s funeral, where the nation mourned together in a way that had never happened before. But it was also our experience watching \u2018I Love Lucy\u2019 and \u2018All in the Family\u2019 that created a shared set of references that everyone knew.\u201dAs the broadcast era changed into one of cable and then streaming, TV was transformed from a wasteland into a bubbling sea of creativity. But it has become a sea in which everyone swims in smaller schools.Netflix does not release viewership numbers, but a few independent measurement companies have come up with ways to estimate them. One such company, Symphony Advanced Media, said Netflix\u2019s biggest original drama last year, \u201cStranger Things,\u201d was seen by about 14 million adults in the month after it first aired. \u201cFuller House,\u201d Netflix\u2019s reboot of the broadcast sitcom \u201cFull House,\u201d attracted an audience of nearly 16 million. On Wednesday, Symphony said that about 300,000 viewers watched the new \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d in its first three days on Netflix. (These numbers are for the entire season, not for single episodes.)For perspective, during much of the 1980s, a broadcast show that attracted 14 million to 16 million viewers would have been in danger of cancellation.\u201cThis is just generally true with how blockbusters across the media are going,\u201d said James G. Webster, a professor of the School of Communication at Northwestern. \u201cSome big ones could get bigger than ever, but generally the audience for everything else is just peanuts.\u201dI buy this argument; obviously, powerful cultural products can produce an impact even if they\u2019re not seen by everyone.Advertisement"}

I feel like if Tom Waits walked into my man cave, he\u2019d go, [rumbling imitation of Waits] \u201cI could write an album in here.\u201dOn \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d [Drogo] doesn\u2019t say much. So how do you convey him? There\u2019s nothing in the script. So I said: \u201cI have this idea. Is it O.K. to do [a dance] before the audition?\u201d And they were like, \u201cOh, sure.\u201d Then I did the Haka. It was challenging to do the audition afterward \u2014 I couldn\u2019t stop my heart from beating. The first time I did it, they were very scared. But then they wanted me to come back in so they could put it on tape.What\u2019s the trick to playing a nomadic horse-lord?You have to walk around like you\u2019re a king. I\u2019m not the king in my own house. I have to wash the dishes and take out the trash and say \u201cYes, baby.\u201d I\u2019m 6-foot-5, but I kind of walk around hunched over. I\u2019m not like, \u201cHey, check me out.\u201d But Drogo had to have that posture.Most of your work is too violent for your kids to see.That\u2019s the tough part. That\u2019s why I\u2019m really excited about \u201cJustice League.\u201d This summer, [my children] came out on my birthday and they put on the Batman cowl and Lola got to put on a Wonder Woman tiara. Me and my son got pictures on the Batmobile. I\u2019m a big kid. It\u2019s pretty cool that Pops could make that happen.What speaks to you about playing Aquaman? Aquaman\u2019s mom\u2019s from Atlantis, and his dad\u2019s from Earth. It\u2019s something that I [relate to] growing up [half Hawaiian] in Iowa, raised by [a single mother]. Iowa is an amazing place. But I didn\u2019t have much race around me. I was definitely not like everyone there. I think it\u2019s really cool that he was raised by his mother and isn\u2019t really accepted in either world. There\u2019s a lot of people who can identify with that. A lot of people love [Aquaman], and a lot make fun of him. But let\u2019s see if they\u2019re still laughing when I\u2019m done with it.When fans approach, do they have odd requests?They like it if I grab them by the throats or pretend I\u2019m going to punch them in the face or act like they\u2019re choking me out. But you know what? I\u2019m appreciative. We do our job, we leave, then a year and a half [later], people watch it and they may like it or they may not. But if they do, and they say, \u201cYou did a great job.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cThank you very much, and if you want me to choke you and your girlfriend out at the same time, and smile, sure.\u201d [laughs]Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Turntable Reborn Turns Its Back on Its Hip-Hop Legacy", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported byUTSUNOMIYA, Japan \u2014 In the sofa-appointed listening room of a factory north of Tokyo, hi-fi fans can listen to vintage vinyl records on a sound system costing $45,000, including a sleek silver turntable. Musical choices include rock \u2014 the Eagles\u2019 \u201cHotel California,\u201d sounding warm and vivid through four-foot-tall speakers \u2014 jazz and classical.Not on the menu: hip-hop.Or disco. Or the thumping, floor-convulsing sounds of modern techno or house music, which helped make the record player at the center of this audiophile\u2019s paradise famous.The turntable, the Technics SL-1200, may not enjoy the name recognition of, say, Fender electric guitars or Steinway pianos. But if you have watched a D.J. scratching furiously behind a rapper in the last few decades, you have almost certainly seen one, or, more likely, a deftly manipulated pair.\u201cAt the after-party for \u2018Hip-Hop Evolution,\u2019 the club had another brand,\u201d Mr. Wheeler recalled during a phone interview, in a tone that suggested both mystification and embarrassment. \u201cThe D.J. looked at me and said, \u2018What the hell, Darby, no 1200s?\u2019\u201dThat legacy seems like an easy sales hook for the Panasonic Corporation of Japan, which has reintroduced the turntable to great fanfare.Panasonic has chosen mostly to ignore it.\u201cOur concept is analog records for hi-fi listening,\u201d said Hiro Morishita, a creative director at Technics. \u201cD.J.s are fine, too, but as a marketing target it\u2019s problematic. We don\u2019t want to sell the 1200 as the best tool for D.J.ing. The 1200 is the 1200.\u201dIt is a dilemma most marketers would long for: a product with a built-in fan base and perhaps too much cultural cachet. For all their passion, Panasonic calculated, the SL-1200\u2019s core customers were not numerous enough, or rich enough, to make reviving the Technics brand financially worthwhile. It needed to reach wealthy, older audiophiles who would spend extravagantly on gear \u2014 not only the turntable, but also the amplifier, speakers and other equipment that the company markets alongside it.And too few such people, it figured, appreciate the finer points of hip-hop.Panasonic admits it struggled with how to acknowledge the SL-1200\u2019s history and fans.\u201cThere was a lot of debate,\u201d Mr. Morishita said. \u201cWould we keep the name? Would we change the design?\u201d In the end, he said, the company decided the turntable was too iconic to change drastically. The latest version, the SL-1200G, has an upgraded motor and a few other touches, but is otherwise the same as the players that Technics made in decades past.The main difference is in the marketing. Instead of sponsoring D.J. contests, Technics has hired a German classical pianist, Alice Sara Ott, to be its \u201cglobal brand ambassador\u201d and provided an SL-1200G to Abbey Road Studios, of Beatles fame. Serene connoisseurship, not sweaty nightclubs, is the theme.\u201cListening to records is like tea ceremony, or flower arranging,\u201d said Michiko Ogawa, director of the Technics division. She added that music recorded by live musicians showed off Technics\u2019s hi-fi qualities best.\u201cIt\u2019s unusual in that you\u2019ve had relatively positive associations and decided to disown that,\u201d said Ravi Dhar, a professor of marketing at Yale.\u201cWhen the brand already has an image that is associated with certain groups, if you try to move away from it, it\u2019s risky,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for them, the associations weren\u2019t positive for the market they\u2019re targeting.\u201dSome famous users have been harsher. \u201cThey never really gave support to the D.J. community,\u201d Jeffrey Allen Townes, better known as DJ Jazzy Jeff, said in a Facebook post after the revival announcement, criticizing Panasonic for high prices and for ignoring the consumers who stuck by the SL-1200 during vinyl\u2019s lean years.The SL-1200 was first made in the 1970s, and while plenty of other record players have come and gone, none are as central to the global culture of hip-hop and dance music.In 2008, Panasonic said it was closing its Technics audio division and would discontinue most of the division\u2019s products. Turntables seemed like a particular extravagance, since hardly anyone listened to records anymore. Panasonic dismantled the SL-1200 assembly line and converted the factory to other uses, including an experimental vegetable farm.For die-hard fans, the decision was a blow. Prices of used SL-1200s jumped. Devotees urged Panasonic to bring the machine back, starting an online petition that eventually collected more than 27,000 names.\u201cThe D.J.s of the world almost unanimously recognized that here was the perfect record player,\u201d said Tony Prince, director of DMC World, which organizes the long-running D.J. competition that Mr. Oakley won. The turntable\u2019s stability, ruggedness and responsiveness to coaxing fingers are hard to replicate on newer gear like CD players or iPads \u2014 as is the look of spinning on authentic old-school decks. Many pros kept using older SL-1200 models, often with specially designed adapters so they could play digital music files alongside their records.\u201cThere\u2019s just something about the look and feel of 1200s,\u201d said Richard Quitevis, a.k.a. D.J. Qbert, an American former world champ who estimates he owns 20 older models, mostly received through sponsorships. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s bought the new one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s mostly for collectors.\u201dPanasonic emphasizes the effort that goes into making the turntables, which are now produced at a different factory about two hours from Tokyo. Only 20 are assembled a day, with most of the work done by hand. Each unit\u2019s record platter is checked by lasers and human workers to ensure perfect balance. A specially developed machine drills tiny holes at strategic points in the undersides until they spin just right. These days, such deliberately crafted products are simply too costly to compete for a mass market.\u201cWe brought the 1200 back just in time,\u201d Mr. Morishita said. \u201cWe\u2019re very familiar with digital products now, but the know-how for this kind of precision mechanical work is disappearing.\u201dThe company does not disclose sales numbers, but said an initial set of 300 special-edition SL-1200Gs, made available online when sales restarted this year, sold out in 30 minutes. Even at nearly $3,000, the turntable may not make any money for Panasonic, instead serving as a loss leader for other Technics products.\u201cI understand why they\u2019ve done it, even if it\u2019s disappointing,\u201d Mr. Oakley said of Technics\u2019s marketing strategy. \u201cAt least I\u2019ve learned how to repair my old ones.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Al Gore, the film\u2019s centerpiece, suggested Melissa Etheridge.Mr. Guggenheim drove to her house in the San Fernando Valley and watched the film with her on a TV, he recalled. \u201cAt the end, she said \u2014 in a very kind way \u2014 \u2018You should leave now. I need to write a song.\u2019\u201dFor nonfiction films, traditionally ignored at the Oscars in everything but the actual documentary categories, a song has meant a 100 percent increase in their Academy Award chances. It has also helped raise awareness of what Mr. Guggenheim wryly described as \u201cchallenging\u201d films. \u201cSo you say, \u2018Well, maybe a song by a famous person will help you.\u2019\u201dArguably, a knockout musical performance on Oscar night brings more attention to a film than any award: At last year\u2019s ceremony, after Lady Gaga\u2019s incendiary rendition of \u201cTil It Happens to You\u201d (written with Diane Warren for the campus-rape documentary \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d), much of the audience may have assumed that the song won the 2016 award. (The actual winner was \u201cWriting\u2019s on the Wall\u201d from \u201cSpectre.\u201d) But the attention that a high-profile song can bring to a documentary \u2014 especially one promoting a social cause \u2014 is really the point.The motives of the artists are, perhaps, another question.The money is definitely not the lure. Mr. Ralph said he and Sting were not paid for their work on \u201cJim,\u201d about the journalist James Foley, who was executed by Islamic State jihadists in 2014. Mr. Ralph, a specialist in documentary scores, has been nominated twice for best original song (\u201cManta Ray\u201d from \u201cRacing Extinction,\u201d and \u201cBefore My Time\u201d from \u201cChasing Ice,\u201d performed by Scarlett Johansson and Joshua Bell). For \u201cJim,\u201d he said he and Sting donated their time as well as the song. \u201cIt was just something we both wanted to help,\u201d he said.Sting concurred. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very, very important movie,\u201d he said, \u201cand my support of it is really because I want more people to see it.\u201dMr. Cogan said that in any case, money wasn\u2019t enough of a draw for stars at Sting\u2019s level. \u201cThere has to be an affinity for the issue, or it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d\u201cNetflix sent me the film to look at to see if I could hear music,\u201d Ms. Amos said, \u201cbut after watching it I was completely silenced.\u201d She said she had to watch it again and speak to the directors, who hoped her song would address issues surrounding internet shaming, including \u201cthe culpability of the people in the towns, the schools, people who didn\u2019t want to get involved.\u201dLike most of the documentary songs, \u201cFlicker\u201d was always intended to play over the end credits, Ms. Amos said, but not as a balm to anyone\u2019s emotional wounds.\u201cWe said, \u2018Look, the job is not to make people feel better,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s to make them cry and be shocked and realize someone died.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Ambivalence Toward Trump Turns to Anger", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Friday morning, Silicon Valley was largely ambivalent about President Trump. The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration.By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination.In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades.Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the 10th-richest man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He good-naturedly obliged.The tech companies\u2019 reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did.That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump\u2019s order proclaimed that \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d and would be suspended indefinitely.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said that his great-grandparents had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam.Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was \u201cnot the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201d Mr. Musk was born in South Africa.Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, \u201cthere was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is.\u201dBeyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world.\u201cAlmost every company\u2019s products \u2014 Google, Apple, Airbnb \u2014 has a global customer base,\u201d Mr. Levie said. \u201cThese policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors.\u201dBy early last week, the companies sensed trouble.Murtadha al-Tameemi, 24, an Iraqi-born software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out.\u201cIt may be my na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how politics and industries interact, but I don\u2019t interpret the tech community\u2019s opposition to the president as a political stance,\u201d Mr. Tameemi said. \u201cIt seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them.\u201dThe larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was \u201cconcerned.\u201d Apple said, \u201cIt is not a policy we support.\u201d Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards\u201d and said it would create \u201ccollateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dIt was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. \u201cIt feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,\u201d said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One.Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists.Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media.Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory team.That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day.In an email to employees on Saturday titled \u201cStanding up for what\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday.As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers \u2014 largely immigrants \u2014 began a one-hour work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order.Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen.\u201cAfter the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,\u201d Mr. Altman said. \u201cNow they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come.\u201dMr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p.m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall Street Reassures Employees, Without Wholly Rejecting Travel Ban", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byWall Street is an industry built on courting clients around the globe and hiring some of the best and brightest, wherever they may be.Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, issued perhaps the only condemnation by a Wall Street firm of Mr. Trump\u2019s order, saying it was \u201cnot a policy we support.\u201dMr. Blankfein\u2019s carefully worded criticism still stood as one of the sharpest responses from the finance industry, where business is fundamentally about moving money across the globe. Wall Street has deep roots to immigrants. Marcus Goldman, as a case in point, was a German immigrant, as were the Lehman brothers.And Wall Street, perhaps more than any other industry except the technology business, has prided itself on hiring top job candidates from anywhere in the world. That said, some banking executives said it was unclear how much the still-evolving contours of the travel ban would affect their staffs, with some saying relatively few employees appeared to have been affected thus far.Still, the finance sector has had to confront growing nationalist sentiment in the United States and Britain, where the vote to leave the European Union, widely known as Brexit, has threatened to drive out much of that country\u2019s financial industry, which could limit global trade and the flow of both money and qualified employees.\u201cI think it would probably hurt them because they do tend to rely on the best international talent, regardless of where they\u2019re from,\u201d said Charles Geisst, a professor at Manhattan College who has studied Wall Street.But the finance industry has largely been cautious in moving into political controversy outside its focus on regulation.So perhaps it was unsurprising that Mr. Blankfein used a voice mail message sent to employees on Sunday \u2014 a time-honored Wall Street way of delivering firmwide messages \u2014 to criticize the travel ban and note that parts of the executive order had been at least temporarily suspended.In his message, Mr. Blankfein cited Goldman\u2019s business principles, which included the line \u201cBeing diverse is not optional; it is what we must be.\u201dCitigroup\u2019s chief executive, Mike Corbat, told employees in an internal memorandum on Monday that the firm was \u201cconcerned about the message the executive order sends,\u201d and he encouraged finding \u201cthe right balance between protecting the country and its longstanding role as an open and welcoming society.\u201dAnd top officials at the asset-management giant BlackRock, which oversees $5 trillion in investments and counts big Middle Eastern countries as clients, said that while they recognized the need to keep the United States safe, any approach needed to respect the law.\u201cWe, of course, all want to promote security and combat terrorism, but we believe it needs to be done with respect for due process, individual rights and the principle of inclusion,\u201d the executives, including Laurence D. Fink, a founder and the chief executive, wrote.Still, other firms took a more cautious approach, refraining from outright criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. Most companies that issued statements said they intended to focus on helping any affected employees.In an internal memo, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s top executives said that they were both \u201cgrateful\u201d for efforts to keep the United States safe and supportive of diversity. Wells Fargo also posted a statement on its employee website saying that it was still assessing what the executive order meant for its business and employees but that it was \u201ccommitted to fostering a culture of diversity.\u201dBank of America said in a message from its chief executive, Brian Moynihan, that it was working to ensure it had the most accurate information to best help affected employees.The chief executive of Morgan Stanley, James P. Gorman, wrote to his employees, \u201cContinuing to draw on talent from across the globe is a key element of Morgan Stanley\u2019s culture and ultimately to our success in serving our clients.\u201dOther firms, such as Blackstone and TPG, had declined to comment.Here are the various responses that major financial firms have sent to their employees regarding the executive order. (Some have been edited to remove internal company phone numbers.) We\u2019ll update the list with more responses as we collect them.This is Lloyd. The president has issued an executive order that, generally, bans individuals from seven different countries from entering the United States and freezes the broader refugee program. This is not a policy we support, and I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court, and some of the order has been enjoined at least temporarily.If the order were to become or remain effective, I recognize that there is potential for disruption to the firm, and especially to some of our people and their families. I want to assure all of you that we will work to minimize such disruption to the extent we can within the law and are focused on supporting our colleagues and their families who may be affected.Let me close by quoting from our business principles: \u201cFor us to be successful, our men and women must reflect the diversity of the communities and cultures in which we operate. That means we must attract, retain and motivate people from many backgrounds and perspectives. Being diverse is not optional; it is what we must be.\u201d Now is a fitting time to reflect on those words and the principles that underlie them.To: All EmployeesFrom: James GormanWe are closely monitoring developments around the new United States travel restrictions imposed this weekend. While no individual employees were impacted in their travel to date, we are concerned for those individuals and their families who could be impacted and will provide them support as needed.Any employee who has questions about upcoming travel should contact the Global Travel and Security teams.We value immensely the contribution of all our employees from all over the world. Continuing to draw on talent from across the globe is a key element of Morgan Stanley\u2019s culture and ultimately to our success in serving our clients.In light of recent executive orders in the United States regarding immigration policy, we want every one of you to know of our unwavering commitment to the dedicated people working here at JPMorgan Chase. This includes a number of our outstanding employees \u2014 all of whom have adhered to our country\u2019s immigration and employment processes \u2014 who have come to the United States to serve our company, clients and communities.Over the weekend, we have worked to reach out to all JPMorgan Chase employees on sponsored visas who are potentially impacted by the recent orders. We understand the situation is evolving quickly, so if you have any concerns about your own situation and have not been contacted, please reach out to your local immigration specialist or human resources team.With more than 140,000 employees in the United States alone, we are grateful for the hard work and sacrifices made to keep our country safe. At the same time, we understand that our country, economy and well-being are strengthened by the rich diversity of the world around us, where we are dedicated to serving customers and communities in more than 100 countries every day.Thank you.Dear Colleagues,Since the weekend, we have been reviewing the executive order on immigration, as well as statements by administration officials, to assess its impact. As a United States company and the world\u2019s most global financial institution, we are concerned about the message the executive order sends, as well as the impact immigration policies could have on our ability to serve our clients and contribute to growth. We have been advising colleagues who could be affected and will continue to support them and their families.We are proud of Citi\u2019s diversity and the fact that we hail from over 100 countries. We encourage the leaders of the United States to find the right balance between protecting the country and its longstanding role as an open and welcoming society.Dear colleagues,Since Friday, we have been in touch with many colleagues, clients and friends worldwide concerned about the United States executive order restricting travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa.As a truly global company, we are proud of the diversity at BlackRock and proud of the diversity of our client relationships. We have long had valued colleagues and clients in Muslim nations, and, from the earliest days of our company, we have worked hard to build an inclusive culture that welcomes and values the contributions of people from all parts of the world.BlackRock will continue to embrace our values and culture, notwithstanding the challenges created by this order. Indeed, we believe that it is more important than ever that we promote our principles, which we established at the founding of our company 29 years ago, including our commitment to inclusion. We, of course, all want to promote security and combat terrorism, but we believe it needs to be done with respect for due process, individual rights and the principle of inclusion.In addition to the broader implications of this order, we have been working to assess the impact it may have on travel for BlackRock\u2019s employees. At this time, we believe there are relatively few individuals whose travel will be directly impacted, but of course the full implications are still being assessed. We also are closely monitoring the repercussions for United States citizens traveling abroad.As you have likely already seen in news reports, there are protests at many United States airports. Anyone traveling either internationally or domestically should anticipate longer delays getting to or from airports and passing through immigration. If you have any questions or concerns about your travel, please call the Corporate Security hotline 24 hours a day. We will continue to keep you posted as the situation evolves.BlackRock always has and will continue to engage with and welcome people in all parts of the world. That is at the root of who we are and always will be.Larry Fink, chairman and C.E.O.Rob Kapito, presidentJeff Smith, global head of human resourcesOn Friday, President Trump signed an executive order on immigration that includes a provision blocking citizens of seven countries from entering the United States for 90 days \u2014 these countries are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.The company is currently reviewing the executive order and its implications to determine whether it has any direct effect on team members or our business.\u201cWhile we are still assessing what this change means for Wells Fargo, we know that it may have deeply personal implications for team members who may have friends or family affected by it,\u201d says chief administrative officer Hope Hardison. \u201cAs always, Wells Fargo is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion where our team members are encouraged to value and respect others for their differences. These values will continue to be of great importance as we support team members who have been affected by this executive order.\u201dBelow is a message from C.E.O. Brian Moynihan.As a global company, we depend upon the diverse sources of talent that our teammates represent. In view of this, we are closely monitoring the recent refugee- and immigration-related executive order in the United States, and subsequent developments.We are connecting with teammates who may be affected, in response to questions. We also are working to ensure we have the most accurate and timely information to best assist potentially impacted teammates. We will share information and provide updates as the situation continues to develop.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Fortunate Reinvention of \u2018A Series of Unfortunate Events\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cMr. Poe\u2019s bank looks like what you picture a bank looking like when you\u2019re 8, and someone\u2019s father works at a bank,\u201d said Daniel Handler, 46, the author of the books and an executive producer on the series, which began streaming on Friday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like a bank, it looks like what you imagine.\u201dThat concept \u2014 a cartoonish visual approximation of youthful imagination, perception and memory \u2014 is the closest thing to a defining aesthetic you can find in a series that lacks any firm sense of time or geography. In that regard, it mimics the source material, which chronicles the outlandish misfortunes endured by three newly orphaned children, Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire. Many aspects of the books were left \u201cpurposefully vague,\u201d Mr. Handler said, \u201cin order for young readers to fill in the blanks themselves.\u201d (He wrote the series under the name, and in the persona, of Lemony Snicket, a mysterious researcher.)This tactic encourages young imaginations to flourish. \u201cI\u2019ve been all over the world, talking about these books, and I\u2019ve seen drawings, and school plays, and radio shows, and all these tiny little adaptations \u2014 tiny in terms of audience,\u201d Mr. Handler said in a telephone interview.But it has also meant that when it comes time to design a larger adaptation \u2014 for a much larger audience \u2014 the producers have some decisions to make.Members of the television series\u2019s creative team, which included Barry Sonnenfeld, an executive producer and the director of four of the eight episodes, began by asking themselves some questions about the world they were creating.\u201cAre there cellphones? Are there computers? What year does it take place? Are they in America?\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of its own place and its own time.\u201dSo what\u2019s in? British cars from the \u201940s, as are 1970s Oldsmobile Toronados. Trolleys and early-\u201960s walkie-talkies are, too, but so is the new Fiat 500. The mishmash is of a piece with the world of the books, in which horse-drawn carriages and motorcycles share the same cobblestone streets; urgent messages are relayed via telegram; a \u201chot-air mobile home\u201d provides for a quick getaway and \u2014 most fantastical of all \u2014 newspapering is portrayed as a robust, if unsavory, trade.Mr. Sonnenfeld, a veteran story adapter who also directed all three \u201cMen in Black\u201d movies (based on a series of comic books) as well as \u201cThe Addams Family,\u201d described achieving a sort of synchronicity with the series\u2019s production designer and prop master, such that they could agree on all manner of mismatched ephemera\u2019s belonging in the same world, yet they would balk at the idea of a character\u2019s having a cellphone.\u201cWe have these very subjective rules about what works and doesn\u2019t work in the show,\u201d he said.Mr. Sonnenfeld enlisted Bo Welch, a longtime collaborator who also directed \u201cThe Cat in the Hat\u201d and was the production designer on \u201cEdward Scissorhands.\u201d Echoes of that film\u2019s picture of suburbia, which Mr. Handler described as \u201cfamiliar but completely imaginary,\u201d crop up in \u201cA Series of Unfortunate Events.\u201dIn one shot, for instance, panning from the home of a kindly neighbor to that of the brooding, malevolent Count Olaf (Neil Patrick Harris), \u201cthe camera moves across the street, and the architecture is entirely different,\u201d Mr. Handler said. \u201cThe lighting is entirely different, the weather is entirely different: That\u2019s kind of what you remember, even though, if you went back and checked, that might not be what it looked like.\u201dAs they built the world of the show on a Vancouver soundstage, Mr. Sonnenfeld and Mr. Welch injected nearly every element with \u201ca slight bit of artifice,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said, and they often did it the old-fashioned way. The production eschewed green screens in many places where they might have been expected, even using 200 feet of painted canvas as a stand-in for the sky.\u201cThey called me in a little bit at the end, as a consultant, which was extremely difficult for me, because there were a gazillion things I would have done differently, and that were all too late to do anything differently about,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when Netflix first approached me, I said, \u2018We can talk about any range of roles that I will be doing, but what I won\u2019t be doing is coming in at the last minute as a consultant.\u2019\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t hire your ex to plan your wedding,\u201d he added.Instead of compressing the action of three books into one 108-minute movie, as the 2004 film did, each of the first four books\u2019 plots unspools over the course of two episodes. The result, Mr. Handler said, comes closer to approximating the cadence of serialized melodramas like \u201cThe Perils of Pauline,\u201d to which his series owes a debt.\u201cIt probably should\u2019ve always been a television series,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said.Mr. Handler worked closely with Mr. Sonnenfeld while drafting his episodes. (Although Mr. Handler set out to write only the first three teleplays of the season, he ended up with a writing credit on five of the eight.) \u201cNetflix, sensibly, was not going to have me hole up and completely write the whole show and then give it to them,\u201d he said.Returning to the material, which Mr. Handler had thought he was done with for good after his experience on the movie, was deeply uncomfortable for him. Rereading all the volumes of \u201cA Series of Unfortunate Events,\u201d the last of which came out in 2006 \u2014 also on Friday the 13th \u2014 \u201cactually turned out to be the most painful part,\u201d he said.Mr. Sonnenfeld, however, had no such reservations.\u201cI read all these books to my daughter, Chloe, when she was growing up, and at some point she sort of left them, but I continued to read them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved the books.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Everyone will know where I come from.\u201dBefore the company broke for lunch, two other actors, Flaco Navaja and Luis Vega \u2014 playing a luckless cocaine enthusiast named Hugo and a clown-like figure called El Mago in Old San Juan \u2014 ran a scene in which they have drug-induced visions. The dialogue is gritty but lyrical, sprinkled with Spanish and pocked with profanity.Ms. L\u00e1zaro drank it in, plainly still tickled to hear her words read back to her by pros. As Mr. Vega patted down and shook out his jacket, pretending to look for Hugo\u2019s fix, she bent over laughing. She then stared, rapt, as El Mago shed his joyful mask and addressed a spirit from his past.El Mago (Spanish for magician) is based on Ms. L\u00e1zaro\u2019s paternal grandfather, who has so longed to be reunited with his dead wife that he has devised various suicide strategies, and related them \u2014 with some humor, apparently \u2014 to the playwright\u2019s mother. \u201cHe says, \u2018Tell the kids to come visit me in the next 20 days, because I\u2019m going to die,\u2019\u201d Ms. L\u00e1zaro recalled. \u201cPoor man, he\u2019s 97, and he keeps living and living.\u201dAt 28, Ms. L\u00e1zaro is as effervescent as her wit is sometimes morose, and she sees no contradiction in that. \u201cThe pain comes in through my back,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019m always questioning: How do my characters stay sane? How do I stay sane in the world? When I leave my apartment, what mask do I need to navigate it?\u201d\u201cI was not doing good,\u201d she added, \u201cand these people came into my life like angels.\u201dFor Mr. Guirgis, \u201cThe mentoring process was about sorting out which demons are your friends, which you can use and run with, and which need day-to-day management. So much of her stuff is really big and deep and painful, and intensely personal.\u201dIndeed, Ms. L\u00e1zaro said of her new play: \u201cMost of this is based on my family and people I grew up with, and yes, there\u2019s a lot of me in it. I\u2019m showing concepts of love that may seem faulty \u2014 that are faulty, but they are love. They were to me, you know?\u201dThe community represented in \u201cTell Hector\u201d would seem more disenfranchised than the one that produced Ms. L\u00e1zaro, whose parents are both professionals; Ms. L\u00e1zaro lived with them in a suburb of San Juan before moving, at 17, to study at the State University of New York at Purchase.But the plot has echoes in her personal experience, including a character with fetal-alcohol syndrome inspired by her uncle.Ms. L\u00e1zaro was also interested in addressing broader issues in Latino culture, as well as universal themes. \u201cThis could be any neighborhood,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s always about the relationships. I\u2019m asking, where is the love in macho culture, in tradition?\u201dIn \u201cTell Hector,\u201d mind you, love can blossom when the guys aren\u2019t around. Ms. Polanco\u2019s Malena \u2014 \u201cthe hottest woman in the neighborhood,\u201d Ms. L\u00e1zaro noted \u2014 is coveted by Isis, a breathless teenage girl.\u201cPeople think that in Hispanic countries they don\u2019t accept gay people, and in some cases they don\u2019t \u2014 there are parents that would try to beat that out of you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are parents who are more accepting.\u201dMs. L\u00e1zaro defines herself as pansexual; her own parents, she said, are \u201cthe people you can come to with all your problems, and they won\u2019t judge you.\u201dShe paused. \u201cThey\u2019re the people you can come to and say, \u2018I want to kill myself.\u2019\u201d Her eyes were warm as she uttered the last sentence, offering reassurance, telling you not to worry.\u201cShe\u2019s grown so much,\u201d Mr. Guirgis said. \u201cEverything great about her was there from the beginning, but she\u2019s really blossomed. She\u2019s become my best friend, really.\u201d When Philip Seymour Hoffman, who collaborated frequently with Mr. Guirgis, died in 2014, \u201cPaola was the one who called me first, and she was over in 15 minutes.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a bravery and power in Paola\u2019s writing I find rare among young writers, but also a maturity,\u201d he said. \u201cShe spoke so empathetically to the humanity of these characters, and she also understood how to flesh them out dramatically.\u201dThough now consumed with \u201cTell Hector,\u201d Ms. L\u00e1zaro has finished another play and has been auditioning for film and television roles. (She\u2019ll play a prostitute in the coming movies \u201cPimp\u201d and an undercover cop in \u201cScenes From the Underground.\u201d) \u201cI\u2019d love to make this play into a film,\u201d she said of the Atlantic show. \u201cAnd I\u2019d love to write for television. I think there should be more Hispanic writers, especially for shows that have anything to do with Hispanic people. Let\u2019s write our own stories and create work for ourselves.\u201dShe tapped her left wrist again. \u201cIt all comes back to the same thing, to here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s for the people who supported me \u2014 and the people who brought me down, too. My thing is, if I show you my heart, maybe you won\u2019t feel alone. If I show you my pain, maybe you can express yours. And we can all work through it, together.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Internet of Things Is Coming for Us", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisThe Moche people lived on Peru\u2019s north coast long before the Spanish conquest of the Americas. They grew corn and squash, built monumental adobe temples and were master craftsmen in gold and ceramics.They never had the chance to sell their wares on Etsy, and yet they anticipated some of our most modern anxieties.Like us, they saw themselves living in a vulnerable world where the technology created to make their lives better was just as likely to turn against them. While we worry about our baby monitors and home routers being hijacked by malicious hackers, they perceived a world in which everyday objects like jugs and clothes might come to life with ominous consequences.Moche artists painted scenes of this happening on ceramic vessels and on the walls of their temples. They appear whimsical to us today \u2014 items of clothing, weaving implements, weapons, all with arms and legs, hands and feet, some with heads and faces, on parade or engaged in battle \u2014 but for the Moche they may have represented a deep-seated uncertainty and fear about the ultimate fate of the human-created world.In some scenes, the animated objects are docile. In one, bowls piled with food and jugs have grown legs and walk toward human figures participating in a ceremony; some helpful jugs even bend over to pour liquid into vessels.But other paintings show a world turned upside down, where the objects have taken charge: They fight and defeat human warriors and parade naked human captives.In an excavation in 1991 near the town of San Jos\u00e9 de Moro, archaeologists, including one of the authors of this piece, Luis Jaime Castillo Butters, discovered the lavish tomb of a Moche priestess. Her coffin had been anthropomorphized, with a mask representing the priestess\u2019 face on top and with arms and legs fashioned from copper on the sides.Inherent in the idea that objects have life is the more subversive concept that they also have desires; feel hate and love; seek revenge; and have the capacity to act on their own.In the modern world, most of the objects that surround us are a result of an impersonal process of production \u2014 they come from factories, we buy them in stores or online. For the Moche, objects were not produced \u2014 they were created, imbuing them with the ambiguity and mystery with which life is given to animated beings.Such objects could be either beneficial or dangerous, depending on whether they decided to serve their creators or turn against them, either of their own volition or through the black arts of others.We now live in a world where objects once again have life. We can talk to them and they can answer back, as is the case with Alexa and Siri and their digital kin. With their help we can control and organize the world around us: We can make sure our homes are safe, turn lights and appliances on or off, summon a taxi or order food from a restaurant. Little by little we are transferring to these technologies the tasks that we used to do ourselves, and at the same time, we are giving them control over our surroundings.The internet of things is made up of billions of everyday devices connected for convenience to the web. Last fall, hackers attacked this network, commandeering as many as 100,000 of these devices by using malicious software that guessed at their simple, factory-set passwords, and then ordering them to send volleys of nuisance messages to the computers of a company called Dyn, which functions as a sort of switchboard for the internet. That was enough to cripple many major websites, including Twitter and Netflix. We have given life to these things, but now we know that they do not obey only us.There are alternative interpretations of the Moche ceramic paintings, and some researchers do not see a sinister component. But the paintings have an echo in a myth collected in central Peru in the early 17th century. In the myth, the sun dies, the world is plunged into darkness and household objects and domesticated animals revolt: Mortars and grinding stones eat people, and llamas drive humans.Andean people before the conquest created a philosophical and spiritual system built around the concepts of duality and transformation \u2014 light versus darkness, order versus chaos.The modern world is full of such opportunities for chaos, often created by humans and the increasing sophistication and technology-centeredness of modern life. A solar flare has the potential to disrupt electrical networks. A tsunami can flood a nuclear reactor. The digitalization of stock markets leads to flash crashes. Russian hackers stealing Democratic Party emails seek to influence an American presidential election.Order gives way to chaos. The internet of things turns on its makers.The Moche culture collapsed around A.D. 850. The reasons are not clear, but the collapse was most likely a result of the Moche\u2019s inability to cope with a hostile and perhaps changing environment, including the failure of their technology, knowledge and institutions to help them overcome those challenges. We can be certain that the technology they created did not rebel against them. But neither did it save them when they needed it the most.William Neuman, the former Andes region bureau chief for The Times, covers City Hall in New York. Luis Jaime Castillo Butters is a professor of archaeology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.Advertisement"}

Parents: Brace yourselves for a dark turn in your children\u2019s senses of humor and a marked improvement in their vocabularies.The story follows three children, the Baudelaires, who, it seems, are orphaned by a fire within the first few minutes. Violet (Malina Weissman), the oldest, is a tinkerer, a sort of young MacGyver. Klaus (Louis Hynes), who is \u201ca little older than 12,\u201d reads more than any 12-year-old should. And a special casting prize should go to whoever found Presley Smith, a very expressive infant portraying Sunny, whose preverbal blatherings are not as meaningless as they sound (something we learn from subtitles).The child actors are all quite good, as they have to be \u2014 this series is all about tone, and not every young performer could nail the one required here. Things really fall into place, though, when Neil Patrick Harris materializes. It might require a double take to recognize him, as he is rather heavily made up for the role of Count Olaf, the villain of the tale, who becomes the children\u2019s first guardian through questionable means and does not exactly have their best interests at heart. What he does have is a lust for the money they have inherited.Mr. Harris\u2019s performance proves that there\u2019s an art to over the top. His Olaf is just as attention-getting, even scene-stealing, but somehow not irritating. He seems to be having a wonderful time being wicked, and he invites you, the viewer, to enjoy his enjoyment.The running gag of breaking from the action to explain what various $4 and $5 words mean works beautifully, and the cast surrounding the core players is well chosen (especially Joan Cusack as Justice Strauss, Olaf\u2019s neighbor). The whole enterprise is wrapped in a big-budget look and served with a respect for the ability of young minds to perceive offbeat, incongruous humor, the very quality that made the books so successful in the first place.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Uncertain Terms: Why a \u2018Three-Line Whip\u2019 Means Business", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byWhat is this \u201cwhip,\u201d and how did the term originate?Like most of what happens in the British Parliament, there is history here. The term derives from hunting terminology; a \u201cwhipper in\u201d being a huntsman\u2019s assistant who prevents hounds from straying, using a whip to drive them back to the pack. Exactly when the word was first used in this context is unclear, though it was not recently. According to the House of Commons library, the Oxford Dictionary first recorded use of the term \u201cwhipper in\u201d in the annual Register of 1772, but \u201cThe House of Commons in the 18th Century,\u201d by P. D. G. Thomas, cites two earlier references, one in 1769, another in 1742.Who or what is the chief whip?The job of leader of the whips, known as the chief whip, seems to have been formalized in the early 19th century. In more recent times the post became one of power and patronage. In the British version of the Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d (based on the book by Michael Dobbs), the sinister and Machiavellian antihero Francis Urquhart starts out as chief whip. In real life, some senior whips also have been scary. The former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw has told of his first encounter, as a young lawmaker, with the party\u2019s deputy chief whip, Walter Harrison, who pushed him against a wall and grabbed him by the testicles. When Mr. Straw managed to ask what he had done wrong, the answer was nothing, though he said Mr. Harrison added: \u201cBut think what I\u2019d do if you crossed me.\u201dWhat do whips do?The main job of the chief whip is to get the government\u2019s legislation through Parliament, and that of the opposition chief whip is to oppose it. They are supported by a deputy and a small group of junior whips. There are teams in the elected House of Commons and the unelected second chamber, the House of Lords. Their duties include keeping lawmakers up-to-date on coming votes, and ensuring that they attend debates and vote in line with their party\u2019s policies. Chief whips also communicate the views of lawmakers to the party leadership, and advise leaders on whom to promote.What is a three-line whip?The whip is a document circulated regularly to lawmakers listing coming business and expectations on how they should vote. The importance of the vote is reflected in the number of times it is underlined, hence the phrase \u201cthree-line whip,\u201d which indicates a measure that must be supported. Defying one of these generally means that a government minister or shadow minister will resign or be dismissed from that position.How powerful are the whips and how do they enforce their will?The whips can help determine whether or not a lawmaker is promoted but are probably no longer as powerful, or as ruthless, as they once were. The Conservative chief whip reputedly once kept a \u201cblack book\u201d recording lawmakers\u2019 misdemeanors and personal weaknesses, which could be used to coerce them back into line.According to one former Labour lawmaker, Joe Ashton, during the 1970s, when the Labour government needed every vote to get legislation through, one whip was routinely dispatched at voting time to check who was in the lavatories, peering over the top of the door when necessary.The Whips Office, Mr. Ashton added, \u201ckilled six people\u201d \u2014 some were forced to attend Parliament to vote hours after surgery, some postponed important operations. Despite suffering a severe heart attack, one lawmaker was taken to the House in an ambulance, where the whips went to count his vote, Mr. Ashton recalled. He added that when one whip asked \u201chow do we know that he is alive?\u201d his counterpart for the opposition leaned forward and \u201cturned the knob on the heart machine.\u201d When the green light went around, he then declared the sick lawmaker to have cast a crucial vote, adding \u201c\u2018There, you\u2019ve lost.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Movies and TV Address Rape and Revenge", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported by\u201cSweet/Vicious\u201d may be television\u2019s first campus-rape buddy comedy. In this MTV series, the bubbly sorority girl Jules and the perma-stoned hacker Ophelia team up to terrorize accused rapists at their college. Every time the cops shelve a sexual assault case, these women dress up like ninjas and slam the accused against brick walls, slash them with switchblades and Taser them in the crotch.But when it comes to Jules\u2019s own assailant \u2014 the quarterback boyfriend of her sorority sister \u2014 she is paralyzed. When she finally does confront him, in a transformative episode this month, she doesn\u2019t grab her Taser. She pushes him against the wall, holds her hand over his mouth, and speaks.\u201cI\u2019ve done everything I can, except this \u2014 which is tell you how alone and broken I feel watching you with my best friend,\u201d she tells him through tears. \u201cYou don\u2019t carry this like I do, and I hate you for that. And I envy you for that.\u201dBut at their best, the violence works largely as metaphor, luring audiences in to more complex and intriguing examinations of rape\u2019s psychological consequences.Jules\u2019s own story line introduces an alternative vision of revenge. Her rapist writes it off as a consensual affair, and what Jules seems to want most of all \u2014 more than breaking his fingers or jailing him \u2014 is to have her own experience acknowledged. Here \u201cSweet/Vicious\u201d advances a different kind of fantasy, one where assailants admit their crimes. On campus, such cases are often dismissed as he-said-she-said disputes. So, before they attack, the \u201cSweet/Vicious\u201d heroines extract clear confessions that no courtroom or campus panel could hope to obtain. \u201cYou didn\u2019t stop when she said no, did you?\u201d Jules says, grilling one offender. \u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t stop!\u201d he replies. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d The show is about making rapists pay, sure, but it\u2019s also about centering victims in their own narratives.In an even more meta riff on the genre, all of HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld\u201d inhabits a Hollywood rape-revenge story line. Westworld is a futuristic theme park modeled after old westerns. In the park, human \u201cguests\u201d can enact their cinematic fantasies using hyper-realistic robot \u201chosts\u201d \u2014 beat them up, shoot them dead, have sex with them. Of course, if you view the hosts as people instead of machines, the sexual fantasy amounts to systematic rape and torture. At the conclusion of the first season, two hosts \u2014 one created in the mold of a virginal farm girl, the other a seasoned madam \u2014 seem to become self-aware and lead a revolt against their human captors. But a final twist suggests that these rogue hosts were, in fact, programmed to turn on their masters and attempt escape. They\u2019ve been coded to enact yet another spectacular fantasy \u2014 that of the robot uprising, yes, but also of the rape victim getting vengeance.The show raises the question of whether these rape-revenge fantasies \u2014 even the ones where women play the heroes \u2014 are just repackaging old masculine appetites for sex, violence and violent sex. Even as \u201cWestworld\u201d mounts its critique of the people who pay to have their way with the hosts, the cameras linger on the robots\u2019 taut naked bodies. The show invites the audience to enjoy its images of bendable sex dolls even as it ostensibly condemns the enterprise. (\u201cEx Machina,\u201d too, tries to have it both ways.)The best executions of the theme don\u2019t just question the revenge half of the rape-revenge narrative. Many of them also revise what rape looks like onscreen, and what rapists look like, too. In \u201cElle,\u201d Mich\u00e8le unmasks her rapist to reveal her kindly, handsome neighbor, a man on whom she had nursed a crush. That plays in the film as a kind of sick joke, but it also makes a fair point: Many rapists aren\u2019t the degenerate brutes they appear to be in thrillers like \u201cI Spit on Your Grave.\u201d The rapists of \u201cSweet/Vicious,\u201d for instance, are cute barflies, dopey frat boys and star athletes. The series also makes strides in defining rape as a lack of consent. It\u2019s a violent crime that\u2019s not always accompanied by, say, a gun to the head or a punch to the face. In the show, victims say no, freeze in shock, or are too incapacitated to consent. And \u201cWestworld\u201d acknowledges that men can be victims, too.It\u2019s notable that in the new wave of rape-revenge tales, the rapist dominates his victims through mind control. It\u2019s a helpful metaphor for understanding that rape isn\u2019t just a violation of a person\u2019s body \u2014 it\u2019s also a denial of her agency. In \u201cJessica Jones,\u201d the Marvel adaptation on Netflix, Jessica is no damsel \u2014 she possesses superhuman strength \u2014 but she is forced into sex slavery by the mental powers of her nemesis, Kilgrave. When Jessica escapes and seeks revenge, her struggle is as psychological as it is physical \u2014 she is reeling from a post-traumatic stress disorder that manifests itself in the form of triggered memories, social isolation and a nasty drinking problem.It\u2019s probably not a coincidence that some of the most powerful riffs on this genre have come at a boom time for television, and the accompanying rise of female storytellers like the \u201cJessica Jones\u201d showrunner, Melissa Rosenberg, and the \u201cSweet/Vicious\u201d creator and co-executive producer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. The effects of rape on its victims are complex, lasting and largely misunderstood. Doing justice to the offense requires a depth of insight into the crime and the time to tell it all. For decades, films have staged rapes of women, then directed their attention to some man\u2019s story instead. We\u2019re just beginning to see what it looks like when the camera doesn\u2019t turn away.An article last Sunday about the portrayal of rape and sexual violence in recent TV shows and movies misstated Jennifer Kaytin Robinson\u2019s title on the MTV show \u201cSweet/ Vicious.\u201d She is the creator and co-executive producer, not the showrunner.

{"Headline": "Netflix and CBS Try to Shake Up Reality TV", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byOn Sunday, CBS got the news it wanted for its new reality show, \u201cHunted.\u201d With the aid of a muscular lead-in from an N.F.L. playoff game, the show had nearly 12 million viewers and the highest ratings for the premiere of a reality TV series since \u201cThe X-Factor\u201d in 2011.Now comes the hard part.And CBS is not the only outlet trying to breathe new life into a sleepy genre.Netflix is jumping into the reality game for the first time with an athletic competition show, \u201cUltimate Beastmaster,\u201d that will debut next month.In recent years, Netflix has invested in and tried to conquer every genre, including children\u2019s programming, documentaries, stand-up specials, sitcoms and period dramas. Intuitively, the next place to turn was reality TV.And in vintage Netflix form, \u201cUltimate Beastmaster,\u201d which features an elaborate obstacle course and an international cast, has already been renewed for a second season before the first has even debuted.But can either of these shows work?But newcomers? That has been much trickier. In the 2015-16 television season, \u201cThe Voice\u201d was the only unscripted competition show among the top 10 programs on network television for adults under 50 years old, according to Nielsen. Between 2010 and 2013, there were regularly four or five reality shows in the top 10.Cable networks like Bravo remain committed to reality TV, and they do just fine. With lower expectations for ratings and plenty of airtime to get people hooked with marathon viewings, the margin of error is bigger.But for a network TV show like \u201cHunted,\u201d the numbers have to be big \u2014 \u201cSurvivor\u201d averages more than eight million viewers \u2014 and people have to watch it within three days of the original broadcast date if it is going to translate into real money.\u201cSocial experiment has been fallow for a few years due to pretty big and expensive failures,\u201d said Mark Cronin, a veteran reality TV producer behind shows like \u201cBelow Deck\u201d and \u201cThe Surreal Life.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s due to the fault of the genre \u2014 if a hit can reappear, it can open up the door once again.\u201dCBS\u2019s \u201cHunted\u201d is an adaptation of a British show of the same name. There are essentially two teams: the so-called fugitives and the hunters. In pairs of two, the fugitives need to stay unrecognized for a 28-day stretch in a radius of 100,000 square miles that covers parts of South Carolina, Florida, Alabama and Georgia.The hunters are a group of former officials from agencies such as the United States Marshals Service and the Central Intelligence Agency. They use social media, A.T.M. records and surveillance techniques to try to track the down the fugitives.Network executives hope that the show\u2019s central concept \u2014 tracking down fugitives \u2014 will appeal to its core audience, which adores CBS\u2019s procedural dramas. And though female viewers represent a significant chunk of reality TV\u2019s audience, drawing in young men would not hurt.\u201cIt does really well in the U.K. with that elusive male 18-to-34-year-old audience,\u201d Glenn Geller, the president of CBS Entertainment, said. By putting it on after the football game on Sunday, Mr. Geller said, he was hoping to \u201cexpose it to as many people as we can who may not always be watching CBS.\u201dNetflix, as a subscription service, is not saddled with the same ratings pressure. But it has high hopes for \u201cUltimate Beastmaster,\u201d which is produced by Sylvester Stallone and David Broome, an executive producer of \u201cThe Biggest Loser.\u201dTed Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, said the show is \u201cour first big step\u201d in reality shows, with many more to come.Though Netflix denies that it has any interest in making a bid for live sporting rights, a show like \u201cBeastmaster\u201d may scratch at that itch.Within a giant obstacle course \u2014 named \u201cthe beast\u201d because it is laid out in the shape of, well, some sort of giant creature \u2014 competitors try to navigate muscle-straining activities to collect the most points possible. The beeps that are set off when a competitor hits a mark sound like a video game, which was quite intentional \u2014 producers for the show want it to feel like a \u201chuman video game,\u201d Mr. Broome said.Mr. Sarandos drew parallels to NBC\u2019s athletic competition show \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior,\u201d which still draws good numbers, even when it is in repeats.The show is \u201cresults oriented but something people will want to watch a year from now,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said, adding \u201cit\u2019s more about the heart of the competitors and less about the \u2018here\u2019s who won, it\u2019s over.\u2019\u201dOne of the big draws for Netflix was the international focus of \u201cBeastmaster\u201d: It will feature 108 competitors come from countries like Brazil, Germany, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the United States. They include ice climbers, military veterans and CrossFit enthusiasts.Netflix, which depends on a global subscriber base, will provide each host country its own pair of broadcasters, which means that in Brazil, for example, the show will be broadcast in Portuguese. (In the United States, the \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d actor Terry Crews and Fox Sports\u2019s Charissa Thompson are the broadcasters).Unlike most things Netflix, the show\u2019s budget will not reach into outer space. Mr. Broome, the creator, said that it is \u201cin line\u201d with other reality shows. \u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t break the bank by any stretch,\u201d he said.For Mr. Broome, the show is as much about shaking up the reality format with a new entrant that does not have a cast of singers and a jury appraising their every move.\u201cThe genre needs to move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time now of a lot of the same.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I quote her not to scold her, or to hold her to her word, but to underscore that passions in the format-platform controversies run high.Still, smartphone movie-watching is for many a kind of line in the sand, albeit one that streaming services are obliged to ignore. The whole point of a streaming service is that it makes content available to watch on a panoply of devices, from a big-screen display to a tablet or Nook or Kindle or Galaxy or iPhone.

And we just kept getting older.\u201dDespite Lydia\u2019s being a big and broad character, you\u2019re careful to keep her from becoming a one-note character or a trope.Whenever you\u2019re playing a character that big, you really have to be on constant alert. I love when Lydia says things like, \u201cOh, jes, I found it on the joo-tube.\u201d But you have to be very careful or you can turn into a caricature.This is a Cuban-American family, but you\u2019re Puerto Rican. Did you try to do a Cuban accent?The accent is all my mother\u2019s. It\u2019s much closer to a Puerto Rican accent. That was easy. Here was the fun part: Justina Machado and I looped in our voices for [the dubbed versions for] the Spanish countries. Our own voices. Otherwise, they go to Mexico and find voices there.What kind of Latino stories would you like to see more of on television?I\u2019ve been talking to the writers about the trajectory for Lydia, because of a story I read in the paper. It was about an older Latina woman wanting to get involved with local politics who was given a hard time because of her accent and the way she dressed. I would love for my character\u2019s second season to have a running thread of wanting to get involved in local politics.Would Lydia be a Cuban Republican or Democrat?Ah, I haven\u2019t decided. I have a feeling she\u2019s both. I think she\u2019s very traditional, which is not necessarily political, it\u2019s just emotional.One of Lydia\u2019s biggest moments on the show this season was when she revealed she left her older sister behind in Cuba.Oh my God! I could barely get through that speech. I kept crying! The director said, \u201cYou\u2019re peaking too early in the scene.\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t help it!\u201dI\u2019m a very emotional person anyway. I\u2019m not an 85-year-old Puerto Rican female for nothing.That\u2019s right. I never saw him again. It was very sad. I finally found out what happened to him after the book went to print. He died in New York, it turns out. One of the saddest parts is, I think he went to his death deeply saddened and disappointed by my absence. It\u2019s not something you get over.Debbie and I became sort of girlfriends during the filming, and every now and then we would get together to go see a movie or something. One time, she invited me over to her house. I was in her bedroom while she was changing, and then she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019m ready.\u201d We get to the door when she says, \u201cWait a minute, I almost forgot.\u201d She went and opened a drawer, took out two giant powder puffs and stuck them in her bra. Without even thinking twice. She just put them there and said, \u201cO.K., I\u2019m ready.\u201dAn article on Monday about the actress Rita Moreno, who appears in a rebooted version of the sitcom \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d misidentified the creators of the original version of the show.

{"Headline": "Mubi: A Streaming Service With a Ticking Clock", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byStreamingSpeaking as a user, I consider it an interesting, compelling and sometimes maddening strategy. Recently, while browsing the site\u2019s \u201cNow Showing\u201d page, I spotted a Russian science-fiction film from 2011, \u201cTarget,\u201d directed by Alexander Zeldovich. I saw a screening of it a couple of years ago and have wanted to revisit it ever since. The left-hand corner of the screen read \u201c6 Days Left.\u201d (It\u2019s off the site now, as you read this.) There\u2019s something about that ticking clock that produces anxiety.On the other hand, the diversity and the quality of the selections are exhilarating. Mubi is one of several first-rate sites that cater to cinephiles, and its mix of current and vintage films, the global scope of the selections, and the truly eclectic array of genres is great. (There are films from Australia, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, Israel, Italy and Britain as I write, and none from Senegal, Mali and Morocco, but there have been, and I\u2019m sure there will be others.) You could watch one movie a day and never feel aesthetically pigeonholed.Mubi started about 10 years ago under the name the Auteurs. It ran a small number of films and had a feisty editorial section called (then and now) the Notebook, which I know a bit about because I was one of its early regular contributors. Its social network component was vibrant, but its identity as a film provider in those early days struck me as a little murky. The site was founded by Efe Cakarel, a voluble entrepreneur who, in a recent phone conversation, described the process that led to Mubi\u2019s way of doing things. \u201cIn the beginning, we wanted to be like Netflix, but the unit economies of an \u2018all-you-can-eat\u2019 site is very capital intensive,\u201d Mr. Cakarel said. \u201cThe question becomes, how do you create a compelling experience? If you can\u2019t get 10,000 titles, how about a limited selection?\u201d\u201cAlthough we started as an online site, we have a consistent belief in cinema as a theatrical experience \u2014 films should be seen on a big screen \u2014 so this was a culmination of an ambition,\u201d Mr. Cakarel explained.A few years ago at the Cannes Film Festival, I was having a conversation with a revered veteran French film critic about a movie that had just screened, one that he jocularly wrote off as \u201ca film festival film \u2014 financed with festival money, aimed at festival audiences; no couple living on the Upper West Side is going to say, \u2018Let\u2019s see this film\u2019 on any weekend night.\u201d While I don\u2019t personally include a film such as \u201cBaden Baden\u201d in the category he so disdained, it is true that a lot of movies that do well with festival audiences don\u2019t get far enough out into the marketplace to even start to find a broader audience.Which is where Mubi hopes to offer something: Mr. Cakarel says he\u2019s going into the festival season this year with substantially more money than last year. As for \u201cBaden Baden,\u201d he says it will be available after its Mubi run, on different platforms.\u201cWhen some great film premieres at Cannes, and the rights are bought piecemeal, what typically happens is that after a theatrical run, the movie enters a transactional window \u2014 iTunes, DVD, Blu-ray and so on \u2014 and then a pay TV window, where it will stay exclusively for about 18 months,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring that time, Netflix, with all the money in the world, won\u2019t be able to stream that film. The only way to break this up is to get all the rights to the film, even to go into production.\u201d Netflix and Amazon have made strong impressions in film production, and Mr. Cakarel expressed an ambition to do the same.In February, Mubi will start a \u201cDiscoveries\u201d program, which, as its title implies, focuses on new films that have impressed its programmers at film festivals; it kicks off with \u201cLe Parc,\u201d directed by Damien Manivel, a surreal animated date movie. One film it has in the series for April is a short by the acclaimed French director Bertrand Bonello. Its next theatrical release, slated for spring, is \u201cThe Happiest Day in the Life of Olli M\u00e4ki,\u201d a boxing movie directed by Juho Kuosmanen, about a real-life Finnish fighter and his 1962 world featherweight championship match against the American Davey Moore. (Yes, that\u2019s the same Davey Moore who in 1963, a year after the events of the film, inspired songs by both Phil Ochs and Bob Dylan.)I mentioned to Mr. Cakarel that his approach to brand identity reminded me of certain record labels of the 1970s, specifically Island, which had an eclectic roster of artists and put out products of such consistent quality across the board that even if you bought one of its records without having heard a note of it, you were still likely to have gotten something interesting. He laughed. \u201cI was at a dinner last week where I met [the Island Records founder] Chris Blackwell, and he told me that Mubi reminded him of what he had tried to do with the label.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Proposed Football League Envisions a No-College Path to the Pros", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byThe sports landscape is littered with failed professional football leagues, such is the dominance of the N.F.L.Yet the sports agent Don Yee, who represents New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, thinks he may have found a model that will work: a league for 18- to 21-year-old players who skip college to play professionally right away.Most fledgling leagues, like the defunct U.F.L. or the X.F.L., had rosters filled with castoffs who had gone undrafted out of college or who had bounced around pro teams. The quality of play was uneven, while games often overlapped with the N.F.L. and N.C.A.A. calendars, making it hard to gain attention.Yee and his investment group see their new Pacific Pro Football league, which is expected to start in summer 2018, as more of a development league filled with players who want to immediately start playing a pro-style game while getting a paycheck, rather than risking injury on a college team and receiving no compensation.\u201cMost other leagues usually took players who were deemed not good enough for the N.F.L.,\u201d Yee said. \u201cWe\u2019re now trying to go to the head of the line at the buffet instead of getting the picked-over ones.\u201dThe N.F.L. also has toyed with starting a developmental league. In October, Commissioner Roger Goodell said the team owners had discussed the idea of working with 300 to 400 players to make them \u201cready to play as quickly as possible,\u201d though nothing concrete emerged from the discussions.Other leagues already employ teenagers who skip college. Major League Baseball clubs draft young players and send them to their academies or minor league affiliates. Many N.H.L. teams have players as young as 18 on their rosters. Players can join N.B.A. teams if they are 19 and a year removed from high school. (In 2001, the N.B.A. started its own development league, where the players can be 18.)N.F.L. teams can draft only players who are three years removed from their high school class\u2019s graduation, a rule the league said is intended to protect younger, less physically developed players.\u201cThe physical, mental and emotional demands of our sport would make it almost impossible for someone to have success in the N.F.L. at an earlier age,\u201d said Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman.Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, or Tides, said that the N.F.L. had an incentive not to undercut college football, which he said was a \u201cgreat feeder system.\u201dEven with an alternate league, college football, where players get scholarships but are not paid, would remain a strong draw for high school players because of the potential exposure, he said. He added that requiring athletes to spend more time in college makes it more likely that they will be prepared for life in the N.F.L. and after they retire from the game.\u201cI don\u2019t know how broad the interest in academic development is by the pro leagues, but someone who has a broader range of interests has a more balanced life and has the potential to be a better athlete,\u201d he said.Yee acknowledged that his venture was risky, something his advisers have echoed. Fans already have a lot of options for watching college and professional football, and just paying for the necessary training facilities and transportation could be enough to bankrupt a new league.\u201cI\u2019ve danced with at least three of these groups before, but money was always what killed them,\u201d said Jim Steeg, who is an unpaid adviser to Yee and ran the Super Bowl for the N.F.L. for decades.Steeg estimated that between $5 million and $7 million would be needed to cover the costs of each team for one season, along with a comparable sum to run the league office.Still, Steeg was encouraged that Yee was starting small and aiming for a unique pool of players, and that he had already received funding from an \u201cangel\u201d investor. Yee said he hoped to attract enough money in the next phase of fund-raising to cover the cost of a first season.The league would have four teams based in Southern California, both to reduce expenses and because the region has so many young players. The league would have a six-game schedule plus playoffs, and finish before the college season begins. Players would be paid an average of $50,000 in salary and benefits, including workers\u2019 compensation, a 401(k) plan and free community college tuition.Yee wants to partner with companies in the area to create internships for the players to prepare them for when their football days are over.In addition to Steeg, Yee said he was being advised by, among others, the former N.F.L. coach Mike Shanahan; Mike Pereira, who was in charge of officiating for the N.F.L.; and the ESPN analyst Adam Schefter. Ed McCaffrey, a former Denver Broncos wide receiver, is a co-investor.Having enough money to get a league off the ground is one challenge. Finding a way to publicize it is another. With television already cluttered with dozens of games each week, the chances of a new league finding space on a widely distributed cable network are remote.Yee said that internet giants like Amazon and Netflix were looking for sports content to distribute. It is far from clear, however, whether one of those companies will pay Yee\u2019s league to show games.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018The Tempest,\u2019 Liberation and Exhilaration", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "Supported byThat may seem to you a fair definition of theater \u2014 or, for that matter, life itself. But for the participants in this particular rendering of Shakespeare\u2019s great valedictory romance, the concept takes on a more literal meaning.They are all inmates in a women\u2019s prison. So there\u2019s special resonance when the play\u2019s long-exiled hero, the usurped duke and mighty magician known as Prospero, asks his daughter, \u201cCanst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell?\u201dThis \u201cTempest\u201d is the third and last installment of the director Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s triumphant series of Shakespeare plays for Donmar Warehouse in London, in which women play every role. It is the most purely pleasurable of the trilogy and the most entertaining \u201cTempest\u201d I\u2019ve ever seen.Like its predecessors, Ms. Lloyd\u2019s \u201cTempest\u201d introduces us to its cast in the theater lobby, where we watch the prisoners file through, manacled together. They look shamed by such exposure, which lends their subsequent metamorphoses a savory tang of revenge.Bunny Christie\u2019s immersive prison environment, which seems both shabby and sanitized, in that way peculiar to state institutions, is reminder enough that this is not your usual stage set. The isolated world that is Prospero\u2019s private kingdom is evoked by a circular reef built in the center of the scuffed basketball court of a floor, made of what look like a week\u2019s recyclables: bottles, cartons and cans that will be used as props later on.Ms. Lloyd\u2019s production sustains the atmosphere of do-it-yourself creativity, though the marvelous senses-scrambling lighting (James Farncombe) and sound design (Pete Malkin) are probably beyond most prison arts-and-crafts budgets. And somehow the rudimentary aspect of the special effects makes the illusions wrought by Prospero seem the most persuasive of any production I\u2019ve seen.Part of that has to do with the ecstatic energy with which the cast members infuse their roles, bringing to mind children let loose on the playground after weeks of rain. In this version, Prospero\u2019s cloistered daughter, Miranda (Leah Harvey), is no fairy tale princess awaiting deliverance, but a restless, urchin adolescent.Her relationship with the castaway Prince Ferdinand (Shelia Atim), the son of the king who banished Prospero from Milan (Martina Laird), is steeped in a youthful headiness that makes their courtship scenes, for once, irresistible highlights of the play. Their delirious glee is matched, in another key, by the drunken court underlings (Jackie Clune and Karen Dunbar), who devise an ill-fated rebellion against Prospero with his bestial servant, Caliban (a much-put-upon Sophie Stanton, seen in the \u201cHenry\u201d plays as Falstaff).Watching the unspooling of the various plots within plots to gain power in \u201cThe Tempest\u201d (the king\u2019s corrupt associates, played by Shiloh Coke and Carolina Vald\u00e9s, have their eyes on his crown), you\u2019re newly aware of how much the play is about struggles for control over others. The abundant images of bondage and slavery glow with revitalized significance.This sorcerer emerges, more than ever, as the presiding intelligence of the reality set before us \u2014 playwright, director and star \u2014 who bends all to his will with an insouciant wave of the hand. But Ms. Walter\u2019s wizard is a man of rueful contemplation, too, conscious of himself as a victim of his own hunger for control, and wrenchingly unresolved about the traitorous enemies he must forgive.And for all the contagious giddiness of the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne that Prospero sets whirling, an ineradicable sense of disgust whispers through these enchantments. The pageant of spirits that Prospero conjures to celebrate his daughter\u2019s nuptials is here rendered as an airborne ballet of white balloons, onto which are projected an eloquent series of images. (Duncan McLean is the video designer.)Those visuals progress from exquisite views of natural landscapes to increasingly industrial ones, replete with flashy automobiles and brand-name logos. And the \u201cbrave new world\u201d beyond Prospero\u2019s cell suddenly feels more revolting than tempting. Pure freedom, it seems, exists only as a state of mind.Advertisement"}

That growth, in domestic and international markets, beat its forecast of 5.2 million new members for the quarter. Netflix now has a total of 93.8 million members.Fueling the increase in subscribers was a rapid rise in Netflix memberships abroad. The company said it is learning \u201chow best to match content with audiences tastes around the world.\u201d It added 5.1 million international members in the quarter, and now has 44.4 million members outside the United States, more than than 47 percent of its total membership.Netflix cited its original series \u201cMarvel\u2019s Luke Cage\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d as worldwide hits. It said it planned to invest more than $6 billion in content this year, up from $5 billion in 2016.Profits are rising steadily.

The company projected that profits would reach $165 million in the current quarter, up from $28 million in the period a year ago.\u201cWe don\u2019t really believe in hockey-stick businesses, like suddenly we will turn significantly profitable at 200 million members,\u201d Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, said during a conference call. \u201cWe think it is much smarter to grow into that bit by bit.\u201dCompetition in streaming television is becoming more fierce and remains a big challenge for Netflix. The company, a pioneer in the market, listed a number of competitors that are encroaching on its turf, including Amazon, which recently announced a global expansion, and YouTube, which leads online video viewing time worldwide. Meanwhile, satellite television companies and traditional television outlets are pouring more resources into streaming offerings.\u201cIn short, it\u2019s becoming an internet TV world, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Netflix as we strive to earn screen time,\u201d Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.The company predicted that subscriptions would continue to grow in the current quarter, although slower than in the period last year. It forecast that it would add 5.2 million members, 1.5 million of them in the United States and 3.7 million abroad. It attributed the slowdown to tough comparisons from the same period last year, particularly with the introduction of the service in 130 countries last January.The quarter was the 10th anniversary of Netflix\u2019s streaming service, which began with the vision that internet television would ultimately replace traditional television.

Asked about his ultimate vision for the company during the conference call, he said, \u201cYou never want to characterize something as an ultimate vision, because when you get there, there is always more you want to do.\u201d\u201cThink of us as just continuing to iterate on the basic cycle of more content and better product, that combines at a great service at a great price,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, with that we can attract many more people to join Netflix, and then that fuels the whole cycle.

But they are not talking, so that is unclear. The M.C. for the night said he had no idea.The first comedian to perform said he knew some \u201cheavy hitters\u201d were in the club. That, in itself, did not surprise him; household names have been known to drop by to work out new material.But that comedian, Ryan Hamilton, was astonished when he was followed by a murderers\u2019 row so loaded that the last one to take the stage, Dave Chappelle, told the crowd, according to people who were there, \u201cYou guys saw a billion dollars\u2019 worth of comedians tonight.\u201d\u201cThe audience just felt really amped from the beginning,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said in an interview. \u201cThere was no reason they would be aware of what was going to happen.\u201dA seemingly momentous pop culture event had come together, apparently, on the spur of the moment. No advance notice. No HBO documentary crews. No reporters.

On the night she auditioned, she went on before Louis C.K.; another night, she followed him.\u201cI think one of the best things is when you become a fan again,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re around comedy all the time, and you become jaded by it.\u201d But she fed off the energy in the room on Wednesday. \u201cOh, yeah!\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why I do this.\u201dOn Thursday, for the first show of the night, Mr. Laster returned as host.There was friendly teasing of a young couple visiting from Australia, and another comic asked a man from Michigan in the front row how he had met his wife. The lineup for the show included comedians who might not be household names but have movie and television credits, like appearances on \u201cLast Comic Standing\u201d or cable specials. One of the comics was testing out jokes. Some worked; one got laughs only after he conceded how terrible it was.Then, as the show neared its end, Mr. Laster told the crowd something that many probably already knew \u2014 part of the appeal of the Comedy Cellar was the possibility of a drop-in. And now, here was Mr. Ansari, preparing for \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201dOn this night, Mr. Ansari was the only surprise performer, and the only one from the show on Wednesday to have returned.

After two episodes, it\u2019s still not clear who, if anyone, has redeeming value in this rough wilderness. Are we supposed to be rooting for the young stowaway who accidentally finds himself in the Americas? Or perhaps for the renegade fellow of mixed ancestry? Or perhaps for no one?Aboard Benton\u2019s ship is Michael Smyth (Landon Liboiron), a petty thief who ended up there unintentionally and, once discovered, is put to use by Benton as a sort of spy: He is to infiltrate Harp\u2019s camp and provide Benton with intelligence.

{"Headline": "Frantic Phoning Among C.E.O.s: How to Address Trump Ban?", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byDealBookThe phone calls flew back and forth among the nation\u2019s top chief executives over the weekend, all asking the same questions: \u201cWhat are you going to say publicly about Trump\u2019s executive order? And what can we say about it without becoming his next punching bag?\u201dWelcome to the new reality for corporate America.Last fall, John Chipman, the director-general and chief executive of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, advanced the notion that in our globalized world, \u201cevery company needs a foreign policy.\u201d Now, our largest companies also have to think about having a domestic policy \u2014 and possibly a moral policy, too.For corporate executives, the decision about whether to speak out against a policy from Mr. Trump so early in his administration has clearly been nerve-racking.The reaction from major American companies to President Trump\u2019s order has ranged from silence to outrage.While it may appear as though a tidal wave of executives has come forward to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order over immigration during the last 48 hours, each did so with a different flavor and tone \u2014 and most didn\u2019t go public until some of their rivals and peers did first, as they sought safety in numbers.Much of the early criticism came from the West Coast: Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook weighed in first, and then Tim Cook of Apple as well as Howard Schultz of Starbucks, who pledged to hire 10,000 refugees.But other big firms, including those on Wall Street and in the consumer-goods sector, took much longer to respond \u2014 if at all \u2014 because of worries about blowback from regulators and customers.And for good reason: Mr. Schultz\u2019s comments prompted calls for a boycott from Trump supporters who started the hashtag #boycottStarbucks on Twitter. But there was a counterpunch. For every tweet about plans to boycott, someone else tweeted something like this: \u201cThere is a #boycottStarbucks going around because they\u2019re pledging to hire refugees, you know what that means? Time to get some Starbucks.\u201dCoca-Cola didn\u2019t say anything until late Monday, when the chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said the company opposed the travel ban. Many other large companies have so far remained silent on the issue. Among them are Blackstone Group, Disney, General Motors and Pepsico.And while the criticism (although limited) was real, few took shots directly at Mr. Trump, for fear of retribution. The harshest comment from a C.E.O. of a large, public company appeared to come from Reed Hastings of Netflix, who directly named the president: \u201cTrump\u2019s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all.\u201d(It\u2019s easy to surmise that Netflix could soon be on the losing end of Mr. Trump\u2019s possible plan to upend net-neutrality laws.)But most top executives took a more circuitous route. The wording was purposely dripping with politeness: \u201cThis executive order is one we do not support,\u201d became the language almost universally adopted by C.E.O.s.Of course, the business community, up until this past weekend, has largely cheered many of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to lower taxes, remove regulations and invest in infrastructure.Several dozen chief executives have found their ways onto a variety of councils to meet with Mr. Trump and advise him on business issues, making it even thornier to criticize him in public.By all accounts, people close to Mr. Musk say he was upset about Mr. Trump\u2019s order, but offered a somewhat tepid rebuke on Twitter: \u201cThe blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201dHe quickly found himself as the target of criticism from fans who wanted him to go further. \u201cExpected a much more forceful condemnation from someone like Elon,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.A lot of the discussion among C.E.O.s, which they shared with me anonymously for fear of retribution for even discussing the subject, said that in the Venn diagram they made about how to deal with public issues like this, they came back to the word \u201ctrade-off.\u201dWhat\u2019s the best alternative? One executive explained that he could offer a morally righteous argument that would feel good in the moment and probably cause a series of cheering \u2014 and booing \u2014 from his various constituents, while potentially losing whatever influence he might have on the president to guide him to make sensible policy in other areas. Or he could offer a Milquetoast response that appeased his employees and nodded at the issue without upsetting his relationship with the president.Given that Mr. Musk has been willing to bring up contentious subjects with Mr. Trump in the past \u2014 like introducing a carbon tax \u2014 perhaps making the point in person will do more than doing so in an email or on Twitter.Whatever the case, the first shots between the business world and the White House have been fired. And more are likely to come.\u201cThere\u2019s some strange mythology that when you go public you can\u2019t speak up,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve heard from plenty of investors appreciating our stance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eyeing Emergency Exits From Mergers in Anxious Times", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe merger escape hatch may be about to open.Surprises are inevitable, especially as the merger cycle turns downward. Abbott is crying MAC after Alere unexpectedly delayed filing financial statements, revealed billing-practice and bribery investigations and revised its financial results. A gigantic hack of email users at Yahoo is shaking Verizon Communications\u2019 desire to complete its $4.8 billion takeover of the internet firm\u2019s core business.That suggests conditions are ripe for beefier MAC clauses. Buyers may get the gumption to balk at typical exemptions, including certain changes in regulation, from the definition of a material adverse change, hoping to cover any Trump-era bombshells. They also could press harder to enforce the clauses. Judges are sounding more in the mood to oblige.Justice E. Leo Strine Jr. of Delaware Supreme Court ruled as a lower court judge in 2001 that the poultry producer Tyson Foods couldn\u2019t jilt the meatpacker IBP just because IBP reported two bad quarters and a subsidiary was shaky. In a landmark opinion, he defined MACs as \u201cunknown events that substantially threaten the overall earnings potential of the target in a durationally significant manner,\u201d a standard so high it has never been met.Often forgotten, though, is that Mr. Strine said he was \u201cconfessedly torn about the correct outcome.\u201d He ruled against Tyson largely because it had signed the deal knowing of IBP\u2019s cyclical business and troubled division, and was merely suffering from \u201cbuyer\u2019s regret.\u201dBut two bad quarters might be far less \u201cdurationally significant\u201d to a corporate buyer like Tyson than to, say, a private equity firm that expects to recoup its investment within a few years. That\u2019s especially true if the poor financial results were serious enough to jeopardize financing for the acquisition.Courts also seem more willing to read MAC clauses broadly. In 2013, Apollo Tyres of India argued it could walk away from its $2.5 billion deal to buy Cooper Tire and Rubber because labor troubles at a Chinese division prevented the target from delivering required financial information.Cooper argued that a MAC carve-out shifted the risk of any labor unrest to Apollo. While conceding that was true, a Delaware judge said the escape clause still covered anything, presumably including a labor dispute, that could \u201creasonably be expected\u201d to prevent Cooper from performing under the merger agreement. Besides, Cooper had breached its promise to sustain normal operations at the Chinese subsidiary. On that basis alone, the judge allowed Apollo to bail.The judiciary aside, MAC clauses are most useful as leverage in renegotiating terms. The buyout firm Cerberus and a partner, Chatham Lodging Trusts, were able to shave nearly 10 percent off the $1.1 billion price for Innkeepers in 2011 by invoking a material adverse change. A similar tactic may play out in Verizon\u2019s courtship of Yahoo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medicaid\u2019s Data Gets an Internet-Era Makeover", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byJini Kim\u2019s relationship with Medicaid is business and personal.Andrew M. Slavitt, acting director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, described the cloud database as \u201cnear historic.\u201d Largely because Medicaid information resides in so many state-level computing silos, Mr. Slavitt explained, \u201cwe\u2019ve never had a systemwide view across the program.\u201dHealth data on its own \u2014 billing, diagnostic and treatment information, typically recorded in arcane, shorthand codes \u2014 is not very useful. But if it can be aggregated and analyzed economically and quickly, that data is seen as a vital ingredient in transforming health care.The health care marketplace in the traditional fee-for-service model values volume. More doctor visits, hospital stays, operations and pills mean more revenue and profit for health care providers. But the push in recent years has been toward what is known as value-based health care. In the value model, medical groups are paid for outcomes: patients treated more efficiently and people who are healthier.But that transition only becomes possible with accurate, reliable data as the raw material for measuring outcomes and discovering what works and what does not. That is the reason for the excitement about and investment in health information technology, and the goal of the Medicaid work with Nuna. The data set will be stripped of identifying information before it is released to researchers.Ms. Kim, 35, a former Google product manager, has firsthand experience with Medicaid. Her brother, Kimong, who is a year younger, is severely autistic. When he was 8, Kimong started having monthly grand mal seizures, which are characterized by loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. The ambulance, hospital, doctor and therapy bills piled up. As a 9-year-old, Ms. Kim helped her Korean immigrant parents complete the Medicaid application forms.\u201cOur family would have gone bankrupt without Medicaid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt saved us.\u201dThe Medicaid system covers millions of working families, older people, children and people with disabilities. In fact, 40 percent of Medicaid spending goes to the disabled. Half of long-term care in America, mainly for older people, is through Medicaid. And nearly half of the children born in the United States are in the Medicaid system.The trouble with traditional health data warehouses, specialists say, is that they resemble digital vaults. It is difficult and time-consuming to get information in or out, and only people with specialized skills can use them.But the new cloud-based technology, using internet-era software, is flexible and interactive. It opens the door to real-time monitoring of emerging disease clusters, billing patterns and program effects. For example, did the percentage of low birth-weight babies decline after a Medicaid program was put in place? If so, how much?\u201cThis kind of data can help move health care policy from a partisan ideological debate to one informed by knowing who the people affected are and what will likely happen to Medicaid recipients,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research organization.\u201cHealth care is hard, and humility is important,\u201d Ms. Kim said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just put technology on something and assume it\u2019s going to work. You really have to understand the ecosystem in health care.\u201dThat government experience, Ms. Kim said, \u201cpaved the way\u201d for Nuna\u2019s work with Medicaid data. It demonstrated, she said, that internet technology and software methods could be applied to government health data from the mainframe era.Her brother is still on Medicaid, and caring for him is a family affair. Ms. Kim lives with her parents and Kimong in Hercules, Calif., in the Bay Area, about 10 miles north of Berkeley. When excited, Kimong waves his arms. When frustrated, he bangs his head against a wall. He can be loud and disruptive when he is anxious, and the family has been escorted off a few plane flights. \u201cHe\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Ms. Kim said.To relieve her parents, Ms. Kim takes Kimong with her to work some days. He can only say a few words, and one of them became the start-up\u2019s name \u2014 \u201cNuna,\u201d or \u201cbig sister\u201d in Korean.Nuna, founded in 2010, had only one full-time employee, Ms. Kim, until 2014, when it got an early round of venture financing. And no one was paid until then. David Chen, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief data officer, holds a Ph.D. in bioinformatics from Stanford University, but he also was a data scientist at Netflix for three years while Nuna was getting off the ground.Nuna is applying the technology and lessons learned from its Medicaid work to pursue business from private health plans, especially at large companies, to help them improve the efficiency and quality of care for workers.Ms. Kim expressed pride in her start-up\u2019s work, but also a sense of personal satisfaction. \u201cThis is my love letter to Medicaid for saving my family,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

My heart was so happy I almost forgot why I was even in Herald Square to begin with.When I was a kid, the famous Apollo Theater had come to my hometown to audition kids for \u201cShowtime at the Apollo.\u201d My parents had allowed me to audition not once, not twice, but three times.For this chubby, dark-haired, chocolate 11-year-old, the third time was not the charm. I remember crying as I walked back to the car with my father. \u201cDanielle, only one out of thousands of thousands of people will make it,\u201d he reminded me, referring to the entertainment business. I remember thinking to myself: Well, I want to be that one.Months before starting rehearsals for the show, the other two leads and I had glammed up for our first promo shoot. By the time we were headed into previews, taking those photos had vanished from my memory until one random fall day.My best friend had come to visit from South Carolina. As we were walking through the subway station, I turned to my left, and that happy-heart feeling crept over me once more. There it was, my second ad for the second-biggest gig of my career. We cried a bit, giggled a bit, took an us-ie (you might call it a selfie) and headed to the theater for her first Broadway show. She was so proud of her friend, and I was so proud to make her proud.Soon after, Lane Bryant approached me to be one of the faces of its fall campaign. I was thrilled! After shooting photos, I received an email showing me how the ad team planned on using them: on billboards, subway ads and double-decker buses in Los Angeles and New York. I was so excited.One night, I was on set and my manager sent me a text: Check your email, but make sure you are sitting. I was getting anxious, and of course the service up in Rockland County, where we shoot \u201cOrange,\u201d was as slow as molasses. I sat as instructed, trying to take deep patient breaths, waiting for the email to come through.It finally opened, and there it was \u2014 a sketch photo of me on a billboard in Times Square. Not just any billboard, but the one Sean Combs, also known as Diddy, was hogging for years. Eighteen stories high. It would be replaced with the nearly 17-story image of this semi-known, curly-haired-and-curvy girl from South Carolina in a leotard and heels. Yeah, I needed to sit.As soon as the billboard went up, people started to post pictures of it. The first time I saw it in person, I was in a car, being driven home from \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d\u201cOMG,\u201d I screamed. \u201cThat\u2019s me. Those are my thighs. Pull over.\u201dI felt like my parents had when they first met Oprah. They were so excited they got out of the car before it was fully parked. That was me now. I started to cry.To be blessed with all I\u2019ve received in life leaves me speechless. What made this different? This was the first time I was on a billboard by myself. I wasn\u2019t in a costume. I wasn\u2019t Taystee. I wasn\u2019t Sofia. I was Danielle Brooks. And at the bottom of the billboard were the words \u201cSee Danielle shine.\u201dNo denying I was shining. The sky was shining that night something special. Not from the LED lights or neon signs of Times Square, but because the dreams of that determined 11-year-old girl with dark skin and kinky hair had been realized. For the first time, the possibilities felt limitless, and I quietly said to myself, \u201cDad, I made it!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Ads to Appear on Instagram, Now on \u2018Stories\u2019 Feature", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byA little more than a year ago, Instagram opened its photo feed to advertisers large and small. Now, more ads are coming to the free app \u2014 this time through Instagram Stories, a successful feature it introduced in August.While people might post carefully filtered photographs of their new dogs to Instagram\u2019s regular mobile feed, the Stories feature enables them to showcase a more spontaneous collection of images and short videos, which disappear after 24 hours \u2014 say, a clip of tug of war and images of a dog\u2019s snout and eyes with silly captions and emojis.Ads will now show up between some Stories, which take up the full phone screen and otherwise seamlessly transition from one account to the next. (Snapchat, which has 150 million daily users over all, runs similar ads.) Instagram will soon begin with ads from more than 30 companies \u2014 including General Motors, Netflix, Airbnb and Capital One \u2014 before expanding to all advertisers in coming weeks. It will monitor feedback to determine how often the ads will appear, said James Quarles, the vice president of Instagram Business.\u201cWe\u2019ll watch it closely, but I think we\u2019ll introduce it and over time it will be expected just like on home feed \u2014 you see the sponsored logo and know ads are just a part of the experience,\u201d Mr. Quarles said. He expressed optimism about how users would respond, adding, \u201cThis is going to be another great part of the experience, and I do think you\u2019ll hear people say, \u2018I discovered this from this business because of this story.\u2019\u201d\u201cAs a user, you might be feeling it on Instagram, because it\u2019s gone from basically nothing to something in maybe a year\u2019s time,\u201d said David Cohen, the president of North America at Magna Global, a major ad-buying firm. Still, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve stepped over the line as far as I can tell.\u201dWhen asked about the possibility of selling subscriptions to users who may want to avoid ads and regain the chronological timeline, Mr. Quarles said that the company had \u201ccertainly looked at it,\u201d but that advertising \u201creally fits the product.\u201d\u201cWhen you get into subscriptions and haves and have-nots, it just changes the experience,\u201d he said.Instagram Stories offers a unique advertising opportunity to companies, Mr. Quarles said, because they are more immersive than in-feed ads and play with sound 70 percent of the time.\u201cWe have been really thoughtful and we are seeing this great momentum there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe absolutely don\u2019t want this to at all change the experience that people have.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the job title of an Instagram executive, James Quarles.

{"Headline": "\u2018La La Land\u2019 Wins Seven Golden Globes; \u2018Moonlight\u2019 Wins Best Drama", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byGolden Globes Briefing\u2022 The record seven awards for the musical \u201cLa La Land\u201d included for best picture comedy or musical and wins by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. \u201cMoonlight\u201d won for best picture drama.\u2022 And in TV categories, \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cAtlanta\u201d were triumphant.The jazz-infused, Popsicle-colored \u201cLa La Land\u201d dominated the 74th Golden Globes on Sunday, receiving a promotional boost in the form of a lavish tribute that kicked off the awards telecast and collecting a record seven prizes, including one for best comedy or musical.No film has won more than four Globes since 1979, when the crime drama \u201cMidnight Express\u201d received six, the previous record-holding number.\u201cI\u2019m in a daze now officially,\u201d said the force behind \u201cLa La Land,\u201d Damien Chazelle, 31, as he accepted the directing award. Noting the \u201cLa La Land\u201d plot \u2014 star-crossed dreamers try to make it in show business \u2014 Emma Stone said in accepting the award for best actress in a musical or comedy, \u201cI think that hope and creativity are two of the most important things in the world, and that\u2019s what this movie is about.\u201d \u201cLa La Land,\u201d made by Lionsgate, also won Globes for song, score, screenplay and actor.The bliss felt by the \u201cLa La Land\u201d cast and crew was likely mirrored by the disappointment of those involved with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d the night\u2019s second-most-nominated film. Despite six nominations, \u201cMoonlight,\u201d about a young black man growing up in Miami, received a lone trophy \u2014 albeit an important one: best drama. \u201cPlease, tell a friend, tell a friend, tell a friend,\u201d Barry Jenkins, the director of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d said in accepting the award, trying to boost the art film\u2019s box office performance.A year after Hollywood was excoriated for its lack of diversity at the Oscars, inclusion was a major theme on Sunday. \u201cThis is for all of the women of color and colorful people whose stories, ideas, thoughts are not always considered worthy,\u201d said Tracee Ellis Ross, as she accepted the best television actress Globe for her role in the ABC series \u201cblack-ish.\u201d \u201cI want you to know that I see you. We see you.\u201d Ms. Ross was the first black woman to win in the category since 1983, when Debbie Allen won for \u201cFame.\u201dThere were several surprises. Isabelle Huppert took best actress in a drama for the French film \u201cElle,\u201d beating Natalie Portman, who was favored to win for \u201cJackie.\u201d (\u201cElle,\u201d a thriller about a businesswoman who tracks her rapist, also won best foreign film.) The foreign journalists who bestow the Globes are known for spreading their awards far and wide, but several films received nothing, including \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins,\u201d \u201cLion,\u201d \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d and \u201cHell or High Water.\u201d \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d despite five nominations, was honored only in the best actor category for Casey Affleck.HBO, despite 14 nominations, the most of any network, was shut out altogether.The first award of the night, for best supporting actor, dropped jaws: Aaron Taylor-Johnson won for his performance in Tom Ford\u2019s little-seen \u201cNocturnal Animals,\u201d beating favorites like Mahershala Ali of \u201cMoonlight.\u201d \u201cI made it \u2014 thank you,\u201d Mr. Taylor-Johnson said, looking a bit startled. To the surprise of almost no one, Viola Davis took the supporting actress prize for playing a 1950s homemaker in \u201cFences.\u201d After doling out two kisses, one to her husband and one to Denzel Washington, who directed \u201cFences\u201d and stars in it, Ms. Davis thanked its producers for taking a risk on the film.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t scream moneymaker,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it does scream art. It does scream heart.\u201dEarly television awards were widely distributed. The slow-burning FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d about an aspiring rapper and his manager cousin, was honored as best comedy and Donald Glover won for best comedic actor for his performance in the show. Beating the likes of Rami Malek (\u201cMr. Robot\u201d) and Bob Odenkirk (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d) for best actor in a drama was Billy Bob Thornton, honored for his performance in \u201cGoliath,\u201d a show with little buzz. Best actress in a TV drama went to Claire Foy, who plays a young Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Crown,\u201d which won for best dramatic series.As expected, \u201cThe People vs. O. J. Simpson: Crime Story\u201d was named best mini-series, and Sarah Paulson, repeating her win at the Emmys, collected a trophy for her portrayal of the prosecutor Marcia Clark in that show. A misty-eyed Ms. Paulson was showered with hugs from A-listers as she returned to her seat.The night got off to a jerky start. After the host, Jimmy Fallon, opened the show with the taped \u201cLa La Land\u201d-themed number, he became befuddled after a teleprompter malfunction. Still, he kept it breezy.\u201cLet\u2019s make tonight a celebration,\u201d Mr. Fallon said in his monologue. Despite promises in preshow interviews to zing Donald J. Trump ahead of his inauguration, Mr. Fallon even kept his political jokes to a minimum. \u201cOne of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote,\u201d he said, almost in a mumble.For casual movie fans, the annual Oscar race starts with the Globes. (Oscar nomination ballots are due on Friday.) But the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group behind the Globes, has worked in recent years to make its television honors more relevant by leaning toward rookie shows like \u201cThe Affair\u201d and \u201cTransparent.\u201d\u201cTake your broken heart, make it into art,\u201d she said, quoting Carrie Fisher.\u201cMeryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to Ms. Streep\u2019s remarks at the Democratic National Convention last summer on behalf of Mrs. Clinton.While winners steered away from directly criticizing Mr. Trump, several used their moment onstage to take clear jabs. The British actor Hugh Laurie, collecting a best-supporting actor award for \u201cThe Night Manager,\u201d said: \u201cI can say I won this at the last-ever Golden Globes. I mean, it has the words \u2018Hollywood,\u2019 \u201cForeign\u2019 and \u2018Press\u2019 in it.\u201d He added, \u201cI also think to some Republicans, even the word \u2018Association\u2019 is sketchy.\u201dThe Golden Globes are great fun, and so is its red carpet. Among this year\u2019s first arrivals were the Stallone sisters, this year\u2019s Miss Golden Globes, shepherded about by their father Sylvester\u2019s old-school, no-nonsense publicist; no buttering up of reporters. A news crew from Canada was promised a question with the sisters but then told \u201cThey need to go do Twitter\u201d first.Issa Rae and Donald Glover were among the luminaries who admitted to feeling slightly intimidated to being there. Mr. Glover said he really wanted to meet Ms. Davis, and that he was still shocked at the huge response to \u201cAtlanta,\u201d his FX series. \u201cIt was supposed to be a punk show,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they screened it at A.F.I. and Scorsese was laughing.\u201d Ms. Rae, of the HBO show \u201cInsecure,\u201d said she was still adjusting to her growing fame. \u201cI\u2019m an introvert, I barely leave the house,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be out here is a blessing but I\u2019m like: \u2018Wow, guys. It\u2019s just me.\u201dEven though Netflix has upended the TV industry, that streaming service had never won in the best drama or comedy category at the Globes (and the Emmys, for that matter). That changed this year with \u201cThe Crown,\u201d , which was named best drama. Claire Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth, won for best actress in a drama.\u201cThe Crown\u201d beat out \u201cStranger Things,\u201d also from Netflix; \u201cWestworld,\u201d the HBO series that practically requires a Ph.D. to understand it; NBC\u2019s feel-good \u201cThis Is Us\u201d; and HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dAnother closely watched television race was for best comedic actress, where Ms. Ross beat out some stiff competition to become the first black woman to win in the category since Debbie Allen in 1983. Also nominated were the four-time Globe winner Sarah Jessica Parker, for her role as a 40-something suburban mother in HBO\u2019s \u201cDivorce\u201d; Ms. Rae, nominated for her much-loved performance in HBO\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d; Julia Louis-Dreyfus from the network\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d; and last year\u2019s winner, Rachel Bloom (\u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d).Globe voters have ardently tried to leave behind their reputation for paying more attention to celebrity than honoring the year\u2019s best performances. Once upon a time, Globe attendees also bellied up to the open bar in a boozy spectacle, but nominees \u2014 heeding the scolding eyes of their publicists \u2014 have largely started sticking to water.Despite moments of seriousness, however, the Globes lived up its raucous reputation. The \u201cModern Family\u201d star Sofia Vergara made anus jokes from the stage. NBC censors bleeped expletives from Amy Schumer. Dinner guests in multiple instances chatted right through the speeches. As ever, the ballroom\u2019s smoking patio was chockablock with stars; at one moment, Sophie Turner from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d lit her cigarette off one held by her co-star Maisie Williams. The young \u201cStranger Things\u201d cast members ran around taking selfies.As ever, the ceremony\u2019s success will be determined by the Nielsen ratings. About 18.5 million people watched last year, down from 19.3 million in 2015. Televised award shows in general have been suffering from viewer erosion, partly because there is a seemingly endless array of them, but NBC had high hopes for Mr. Fallon. He has a much wider fan base than Mr. Gervais and has been using his \u201cTonight Show\u201d perch as a promotional platform for the gig.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified one of the producers of the film \u201cLa La Land.\u201d He is Marc Platt, not Fred Berger.John Koblin and Patrick Healy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 2017 Class Divide, as Dissected by a New \u2018One Day at a Time\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookIt\u2019s a casual line that sets up a joke. (Penelope reminds Alex that they have a TV, a refrigerator and a laptop. \u201cThose are things poor people have!\u201d he says.) But it\u2019s based on an acknowledgment you don\u2019t really hear in prime time anymore: that there is a class divide, nebulous but real, and that your family is closer to the bad side of it.The new \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d arriving on Friday, is lively and full of voice, a rare reboot that\u2019s better than the original. It\u2019s a throwback in the best sense, to an era of mainstream, socially engaged kitchen-sink sitcoms. And just as the political debate has pitted diversity against class in a zero-sum contest, it\u2019s a reminder that the two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.With few exceptions (like ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Middle\u201d), sitcoms moved into offices, cafes and living rooms populated by comfortably white-collar characters. (A recent \u201cblack-ish\u201d slyly acknowledged this remove; its affluent parents were mortified when their youngest son took an aptitude test that pegged him as a future \u201cskilled laborer.\u201d)Work \u2014 nonprofessional, non-doctor/lawyer/cop work \u2014 became the stuff of basic-cable reality TV (\u201cDeadliest Catch\u201d). Just as actual labor became increasingly invisible to consumers, shunted off overseas or hidden through e-commerce, working-class people entered TV through the poor door, or not at all.With \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d \u2014 like \u201cFuller House\u201d and \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d another product of Netflix\u2019s drive to exhume our every nostalgic memory \u2014 peak TV is restoring something of what peak TV took away: the kind of family that buys discounted meat at the grocery store and whose old car stalls when you turn on the air-conditioning.But it spoke to the times. Compared with Mr. Lear\u2019s outspoken Maude, Ann Romano (Bonnie Franklin) expressed her feminism practically \u2014 bouncing from job to job, getting the rent paid and raising two independent girls. (This was in 1975, just five years after it was deemed too outrageous to have Mary Richards be divorced in \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show.\u201d)The update, which Mr. Lear produces with Gloria Calder\u00f3n Kellett and Mike Royce, moves the setting from Indianapolis to Echo Park, Los Angeles, and reimagines the family as Cuban-American. (Mr. Lear\u2019s cross-cultural remake of his own work recalls how he adapted the British \u201cSteptoe and Son\u201d as \u201cSanford and Son,\u201d with an African-American cast.)The most productive rethinking involves Penelope, a veteran of Afghanistan who works as a medical assistant. The war ended her marriage \u2014 she separated from her husband, also a soldier, who developed a drinking problem from stress \u2014 and left her with anxiety and a bum shoulder. The show understands, in a way comedies about more privileged families don\u2019t have to, that circumstances shape choices and exact costs.Despite the studio-audience laughs, the series works best in character-driven dramedy mode. The season has a serial arc, and Ms. Machado (previously of \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d) handles the emotional material with a light touch. One of the strongest episodes is built around a long, frustrating phone call with the Department of Veterans Affairs as Penelope tries to wrangle a chiropractor referral.The zinger-based humor is clunkier. Stephen Tobolowsky carries some familiar workplace subplots as Penelope\u2019s sad-sack boss, and the show leans heavily on Ricky Ricardo-esque jokes about Lydia\u2019s accent.Still, if the comedy can be dated, the retro approach \u2014 multicamera, theatrical, issues-based \u2014 feels current, as the headlines recall the tumult of the \u201970s and the president-elect seems to be tweeting from Archie Bunker\u2019s armchair. (One of the season\u2019s themes, immigration, lands harder, if differently, from the way it might have before the election.)If TV can help divided Americans see one another better, it\u2019s by telling more specific stories of every kind. It\u2019s true that we don\u2019t see enough working-class people on TV, or military veterans or Hispanic families. And guess what? Sometimes, this \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d reminds us, you find all those people under the same roof.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Understood the Power of Art. And He Wanted You to Get It, Too.", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byAnyone inclined to find joy when a president\u2019s taste collides with yours had a lot to choose from with Barack Obama.But of all the culture Barack Obama has been a part of, inspired, commented on or cultivated, of all the ways in which the culture seemed to evolve around \u2014 and unconsciously respond to \u2014 him, the thing that says so much about his unprecedented relationship to art and popular culture is actually, in the vast scheme of things, just a footnote. Which is to say it\u2019s pretty small yet so illustrative of his sense of respect, professionalism and awe. It was the time he was emailed for a quote.\u201cNobody embodies more fully the connection between the African-American spiritual, the blues, R. & B., rock and roll \u2014 the way that hardship and sorrow were transformed into something full of beauty and vitality and hope,\u201d he wrote back, through his press secretary. \u201cAmerican history wells up when Aretha sings. That\u2019s why, when she sits down at a piano and sings \u2018A Natural Woman,\u2019 she can move me to tears \u2014 the same way that Ray Charles\u2019s version of \u2018America the Beautiful\u2019 will always be in my view the most patriotic piece of music ever performed \u2014 because it captures the fullness of the American experience, the view from the bottom as well as the top, the good and the bad, and the possibility of synthesis, reconciliation, transcendence.\u201dMr. Remnick wrote to him because he knew that Barack Obama would deliver. Mr. Remnick asked for two cents. The president gave him a dollar. Mr. Obama, for nearly all of his tenure, was fully aware of, interested in, and knowledgeable about popular culture, even as it grew impossible to take it all in. He tried: sports, movies, television, the internet, music, books. He was protean and catholic. He was thoughtful and self-deprecating, cool and yet far from it. He was a version of America\u2019s dad and the dad some kids wished theirs could be: fit for world leadership, fit for a sitcom.In other words, Mr. Obama\u2019s place in popular culture has always felt new, alive and mostly underappreciated.Mr. Obama brought all kinds of art and culture into the White House, and he sought culture out. At the same time, how we experience that art and culture, changed as much as the culture itself. When he entered office, in 2009, Netflix was a movies-by-mail service. Now it\u2019s a major reason we no longer watch TV; we scarf it down.But that disruption \u2014 from channels and networks to platforms and apps \u2014 also unleashed TV that looked more like America: more nonwhite characters, more women, more gays. He presided over an era in which television and movies grappled with the meaning and meaninglessness of race, whether to laugh at it or take it seriously or ignore it altogether, whether the idea of a so-called postracial America was ever possible, as though electing a black man for eight years erases the traumas of 400.One of the happiest cultural events I\u2019ve ever watched was the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony in November. The honor went to 21 men and women, from Robert De Niro and Tom Hanks and Michael Jordan to Cicely Tyson and Diana Ross and Ellen DeGeneres. Bill and Melinda Gates were honored. So were Maya Lin and Robert Redford. Mr. Obama had good material for most of them \u2014 philanthropists, movies stars, architect, alike. And, as he so often does and gets nary enough credit for, he delivered it with perfectly timed drollery. (He could easily enjoy a second career as a comedian.) These people meant something to him. His joshing notwithstanding, a few of them appeared to mean everything.The knock on Mr. Obama was that he was dry and aloof. Perhaps but not always. He understood what laughter could do. He knew the power of songs.

They wait until the office is behind him, for the right mix of distance and scholarship. In the meantime, Barack Obama\u2019s performance as president \u2014 meaning the performance he gave in the role of president of the United States \u2014 was flawless.
