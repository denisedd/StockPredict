But it\u2019s nearly impossible to create a technological angel on your right shoulder without also building in a workaround that is vulnerable to the devil on your left. Put another way: Any alarm clock user who denies that he has heard the siren song of the snooze button is lying.

Almost any distraction can lead to an accident. If a driver slammed his car into someone because he took his hands off the steering wheel to unwrap a taco, surely we wouldn\u2019t hold Taco Bell responsible, or outlaw the eating of tacos while driving. That being said, companies do have a social responsibility to be mindful of hazards that arise from misuse of their products and take sensible precautions. In the case of Apple, it would be absolutely reasonable for it to use  a non-intrusive mechanism to detect with near perfect accuracy when a user is driving to prevent hazardous distractions.The state of deep learning technology is at a place where companies like Apple should explore its use for safety purposes.

Snapchat wants to make a lot of money, so it is worrying about both.As Katie Benner writes, Snapchat is putting important restrictions on its news channel, Discover, in the interest of delivering to its audience more reliable information. Graphic and misleading images are now off limits, and the service clarified its ban on linking to questionable news sources.Discover was added to Snapchat two years ago as a way for conventional and newer publishers to reach Snapchat\u2019s typically young audience. And it built on Snapchat\u2019s core service, which is a way for friends to send each other ephemeral images and text.That self-deleting quality was intended to promote more natural communication between people: Friends could trust each other, confident that their communications would not be stored and mined for some unknown future use.Sustaining trust is important to Snapchat, which has been more vigilant than most social media companies in policing fake news. That\u2019s why it wants Discover to be free of the kinds of salacious photos that are used lure readers into ordinary stories; a gimmick that has become all too common in online news.If you\u2019ve ever clicked on one of those pictures, you know the feeling when you find out you\u2019ve been misled: a little cheated, a little cynical, a little less trusting of the site that took you there.There is a continuing argument in the technology world about whether companies like Yahoo, Facebook and Snapchat are, at their heart, tech companies or media companies.

{"Headline": "2016 Was a Bad Year for Celebrity Deaths, by These Measures", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported by8 PhotosOmg I just found out George Michael is really dead! So many great people died this year! And so young! And 2016 isn't even over yet!For one thing, celebrity is a subjective quality, and the claim that more celebrities died in any given year is not easily supportable with objective data.But that has not stopped different media companies, including The New York Times, from trying. The British Broadcasting Corporation and Legacy.com, a company that produces online obituaries with funeral homes and newspapers (among them The Times), began investigating the perceived phenomenon this spring, when they first noticed a spate of sorrowful emails and social media posts about the high number of celebrity deaths. Both concluded that there was an unusual proliferation of them in 2016, though each used a different method to support that claim.\u201cSince I\u2019ve been doing this job, for 10 years, we\u2019ve never used this many obituaries,\u201d Nick Serpell, the BBC\u2019s obituary editor, said in a recent telephone interview, referring to obituaries written in advance.Mr. Serpell acknowledged that using the number of obituaries written in advance as an indicator of major deaths was \u201cflawed,\u201d but said he thought it was \u201cthe only way to measure something.\u201d\u201cObviously we have people in the U.K. who you\u2019ve never heard of who are famous for us, and you\u2019ve got people that we\u2019ve never heard of, usually linebackers from American football,\u201d he said.In a recent telephone interview she acknowledged that the lists were still somewhat subjective.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a data project, but it\u2019s not quite as objective as a purely data project would be,\u201d Ms. Crowther said.She maintained that most people would agree that the celebrities she counted merited the designation.\u201cEverybody has slightly different ideas about what constitutes celebrity,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look at Wikipedia\u2019s list of celebrities, there are more than 6,000, and some of them are horses. Those didn\u2019t make it to my list.\u201dMs. Crowther counted a total of 95 celebrity deaths in 2016, compared with an annual average of 59 for the years 2010 through 2015. She counted 32 major celebrity deaths in 2016 compared with an annual average of 13 for the six previous years.Ms. Crowther also counted an unusually high number of deaths in the first quarter of 2016. She noted that the average age of people whose deaths she measured in 2016 was 74.2, slightly younger than the 2010-15 average of 76.7, and that an unusually large number of the deceased \u2014 like David Bowie, Sharon Jones and George Michael \u2014 came from the music world.The Times, in its own assessment of the incidence of major deaths in 2016, used two different subjective measurements, neither a perfect indicator of celebrity. Most of what was found supported the conclusions of the BBC and Legacy.com, except for one crucial difference.Notable Deaths has grown significantly larger every year since it was created in 2010, which seems to support the trend noted by Legacy.com and the BBC.Next we counted the number of obituaries that appeared on the front page of the newspaper in 2016 and 2015, either as an article, a photograph or an item in the short summaries that appear at the bottom of the page. Most of these obituaries were also promoted on The Times\u2019s home page and in its social media accounts.In 2015, 31 obituaries ran on the front page compared with 29 in 2016. A total of 147 obituaries were mentioned on the front page in 2015 and just 135 in 2016. In January 2016, 25 obituaries appeared on the front page, the most of any single month.So 2016 represented either the latest year of increasing celebrity deaths or a small step back from 2015, depending on the metric The Times used.Of course, there are obvious problems with both of these measurements, as there are with those used in the other studies, because they are based on subjective judgments.Placement in The Times is a result of editorial decisions; some deaths that might otherwise be reported on the front page, for example, could be displaced by other news \u2014 particularly in an election and Olympic year. The opposite could be true for the Notable Deaths feature, which grew in part because of decisions to expand it by recognizing important but lesser-known subjects.An obituary on the front page of The Times is also not reserved for conventional celebrities. Some are there because the subjects made fascinating contributions to the world but never found wide fame. (Exceptional writing may have also helped push some obituaries onto Page 1.)Even if 2016 was an unusually heavy year for celebrity deaths, the number may seem typical a few years from now. Both Mr. Serpell and Ms. Crowther said that deaths of major figures had been trending upward in the years they examined and that they expected the trend to continue.They speculated that was a reflection in part of the widespread embrace of television in the 1950s and \u201960s; those generations of stars are now passing from the scene.\u201cIs 2017 going to, quote, \u2018settle back down\u2019?\u201d Ms. Crowther asked. \u201cProbably not.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Her doctor assured her that reconstructive surgery would spare her nipples and leave her with natural-looking breasts.It did. But while Ms. McCree\u2019s rebuilt chest may resemble natural breasts, it is now completely numb. Her nipples lack any feeling. She cannot sense the slightest touch of her breasts, perceive warmth or cold, feel an itch if she has a rash or pain if she bangs into a door.And no one warned her.\u201cI can\u2019t even feel it when my kids hug me,\u201d said Ms. McCree, 31, a store manager in Grand Junction, Colo., who is raising two daughters on her own.Plastic surgeons performed more than 106,000 breast reconstructions in 2015, up 35 percent from 2000. And they have embraced cutting-edge techniques to improve the appearance of reconstructed breasts and give them a more natural \u201clook and feel\u201d \u2014 using a woman\u2019s belly fat to create the new breast, sparing the nipple, minimizing scarring with creative incisions and offering enhancements like larger, firmer lifted breasts.Doctors often promise patients that their reconstructed breasts will look even better than the breasts they had before. But they often describe the potential consequences of the surgery in ambiguous terms. Women say the fact that sensation and sexual arousal will not be restored is not made clear.The main problem is using the word \u201cfeel,\u201d said Dr. Clara Lee, an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who does reconstructive breast surgery. Surgeons who use a woman\u2019s own tissue to recreate a breast might tell the patient that it will \u201cfeel\u201d like a natural breast, referring to how it feels to someone else, not the woman.\u201cWe don\u2019t always mean what\u2019s important to the patient,\u201d Dr. Lee said.\u201cOur focus has been on what women look like,\u201d said Dr. Andrea L. Pusic, a plastic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who specializes in breast reconstruction and studies patients\u2019 quality of life after breast surgery. \u201cWhat it feels like to the woman has been a kind of blind spot in breast surgery. That\u2019s the next frontier.\u201dThe focus on how breasts look and feel to other people, rather than how they feel to the patient, speaks to the fact that women are still largely judged by their appearance, said Victoria Pitts-Taylor, a professor and the head of feminist, gender and sexuality studies at Wesleyan University.\u201cThere\u2019s such a strong cultural gaze at women\u2019s breasts,\u201d Dr. Pitts-Taylor said. \u201cIt does raise the question: Who is breast reconstruction for?\u201dAdding to the confusion has been the excitement over surgical innovations, particularly \u201cnipple-sparing\u201d mastectomies. During a traditional mastectomy, doctors remove the nipple and scoop out breast tissue, causing considerable nerve damage. But now, in certain cases, the nipple can be spared, raising hopes that some feeling will be preserved.For many women, the loss of sensation in their breasts can be devastating.\u201cNo one said, \u2018You will not have sexual arousal in your chest again,\u2019\u201d Ms. McCree said. \u201cI thought that because I was able to keep my nipples and the blood supply, I\u2019d keep my feeling.\u201dEve Wallinga, 60, a cancer survivor from St. Cloud, Minn., said many women who choose risk-reducing mastectomies believe that reconstructive surgery will make them \u201cwhole\u201d again and are not told that the sensation lost during the surgery is unlikely to come back.\u201cThey go into it thinking everything will be the same when they come out \u2014 they\u2019ll just have cancer-proof stuffing in their breasts,\u201d Ms. Wallinga said. \u201cSome are very angry and upset, and say, \u2018Why wasn\u2019t I told?\u2019 They feel very betrayed.\u201dSeveral women interviewed recounted times when they had not realized a bra was cutting into their skin until they saw blood. Many described embarrassing \u201cwardrobe malfunctions,\u201d when a bathing suit or T-shirt shifted to reveal part of their breast without their knowing because they did not feel the air on their exposed skin.A doctor recalled a patient who had burned herself while draining hot pasta for dinner; she did not realize she was hurt until she saw red marks on her skin in the shower several hours later.Some women described losing the sense of the position of their breasts.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the sexual arousal, it\u2019s the awkwardness,\u201d said Cathy Balsamo of Berkeley Heights, N.J. \u201cYou can\u2019t figure out your space \u2014 almost like you\u2019re bigger than you really are. It\u2019s a bizarre feeling.\u201dShe added, \u201cWhen I put on a sports bra, I have to look in the mirror and focus on the breasts to make sure they\u2019re in the pocket where they belong.\u201dNerve damage during mastectomies can create post-mastectomy pain syndrome. Some women experience tingling sensations, and others have debilitating pain. Patients say physicians minimize the condition, even though it is fairly common, affecting anywhere from 25 percent to 60 percent of mastectomy patients, according to published studies.Michelle Lamon Romero, 45, of East Longmeadow, Mass., said she had been incapacitated by pain since having a double mastectomy two years ago. She lost her job and now relies on a cocktail of five drugs to keep the pain at a manageable level.\u201cThe surface of the skin is numb \u2014 if you run a needle over it, I can\u2019t feel it,\u201d Ms. Romero said. \u201cBut I can feel the pain underneath just radiating everywhere.\u201dShe added that her plastic surgeon had told her that she was an anomaly and that \u201cthis isn\u2019t real, it\u2019s all in your head.\u201d Other patients Ms. Romero has met through Facebook have had the same experience.\u201cSo many women who join are just relieved to know they\u2019re not alone,\u201d Ms. Romero said. \u201cThey all start out the same way: \u2018My doctor told me I was crazy.\u2019\u201dMost surgeons agree that the best chance for sensory restoration after a mastectomy is a procedure that uses a woman\u2019s own body tissue rather than an implant because nerves have a better chance of regenerating in natural tissue. The procedure has produced modest results. If sensation returns, it is usually limited to the perception of pressure, without improved sensation related to touch, temperature or sexual arousal.\u201cIt\u2019s a shadow of the degree of sensation that people had before,\u201d said Dr. Edwin G. Wilkins, a plastic surgeon at the University of Michigan who is running a large study on reconstruction outcomes and complications with Dr. Pusic. \u201cIt\u2019s a poor substitute.\u201dDr. Aldona J. Spiegel, a plastic surgeon in Houston who has pioneered techniques to reconnect nerves in the breast and restore sensation, said the procedure remained promising.\u201cI tell patients that if I am able to reconnect nerves in the reconstructed breast, it will improve the sensation. But I never tell them it will be normal,\u201d Dr. Spiegel said.She added that many of her patients had shown \u201cvery significant improvement.\u201dOne of her patients, Karen Holt, 65, a retired principal from Houston, had her left breast removed and reconstructed from her own tissue 14 years ago. Ms. Holt knows she\u2019s unusual, she said, but claims she has \u201cjust about as much erogenous sensation in the left breast as in the right.\u201dBut doctors say such results are rare.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to give people false hope,\u201d said Dr. Frank J. DellaCroce, a plastic surgeon and a founder of the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans.Restoring sensation is \u201cone of those things that\u2019s regarded as the holy grail of breast reconstruction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no one has shown in any scientific article to date that we\u2019re able to return sensation in any reliable way.\u201dDr. Christine Laronga, a breast oncologist at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla., said she tried to make clear to patients that feeling would not be restored after reconstruction, telling them, \u201cIt may look like a breast, but it won\u2019t feel like a breast.\u201dWhile doctors agree on the need for a mastectomy procedure that spares nerves, they note that the goal of the surgery is to make sure the cancer is gone. There is also a risk that efforts to restore sensation will trigger a pain syndrome.\u201cIt\u2019s a very tricky area,\u201d said Dr. Ida K. Fox, a plastic surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in breast and hand surgery. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to restore sensation and give someone chronic pain.\u201dMs. Balsamo, 50, who had a double mastectomy after testing positive for a genetic mutation that increases breast cancer risk, said she did not regret the surgery, but wished she had been better informed.\u201cI just wish I had known,\u201d Ms. Balsamo said. \u201cThey said there\u2019s going to be a difference in the sensation \u2014 not that there wouldn\u2019t be any.

Then, observing a senior colleague\u2019s contracts class, I spied one student shopping for half the class. Another was surfing Facebook. Both took notes when my colleague spoke, but resumed the rest of their lives instead of listening to classmates.Laptops at best reduce education to the clackety-clack of transcribing lectures on shiny screens and, at worst, provide students with a constant escape from whatever is hard, challenging or uncomfortable about learning. And yet, education requires constant interaction in which professor and students are fully present for an exchange.Students need two skills to succeed as lawyers and as professionals: listening and communicating. We must listen with care, which requires patience, focus, eye contact and managing moments of ennui productively \u2014 perhaps by double-checking one\u2019s notes instead of a friend\u2019s latest Instagram. Multitasking and the mediation of screens kill empathy.Likewise, we must communicate \u2014 in writing or in speech \u2014 with clarity and precision. The student who speaks in class learns to convey his or her points effectively because everyone else is listening. Classmates will respond with their accord or dissent. Lawyers can acquire hallmark precision only through repeated exercises of concentration. It does happen on occasion that a client loses millions of dollars over a misplaced comma or period.Once, a senior associate for whom I was working berated me for such a mistake and said, \u201cGetting these things right is the easy part, and if you can\u2019t get that right, what does it say about your ability to analyze the law properly?\u201d I learned my lesson. To restore the focus-training function of the classroom, I stopped allowing laptops in class early in my teaching career. Since then research has confirmed the wisdom of my choice.For all these reasons, starting with smaller classes, I banned laptops, and it improved the students\u2019 engagement. With constant eye contact, I could see and feel when they understood me, and when they did not. Energized by the connection, we moved faster, further and deeper into the material. I broadened my rule to include one of my large upper-level courses. The pushback was real: A week before class, I posted the syllabus, which announced my policy. Two students wrote me to ask if I would reconsider, and dropped the class when I refused. But more important, after my class ends, many students continue to take notes by hand even when it\u2019s not required.Putting aside medical exemptions, many students are just resistant. They are used to typing and prefer it to writing. They may feel they take better notes by keyboard. They may feel they know how to take notes by hand but do not want to have to do so. They can look up material, and there\u2019s no need to print assignments. Some may have terrible handwriting, or find it uncomfortable or even painful to write.To them, I\u2019ll let the Rolling Stones answer: You can\u2019t always get what you want, but sometimes you get what you need. My students need to learn how to be lawyers and professionals. To succeed they must internalize an ethos of caution, care and respect. To instill these values and skills in my students, I have no choice but to limit laptop use in the classroom.An earlier version of this article misstated how much laptops and tablets in the classroom hurt exam performance. Their presence lowered results by 1.7 percent, according to a study, not 18 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Snap Goes Public, Some Shareholders\u2019 Voting Rights May Disappear", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe current rising star of tech start-ups, the parent company of the messaging app Snapchat, is apparently planning to issue shares with no voting rights when it goes public this year.It\u2019s another sign of how the balance of power has tilted to tech founders. But Snap may have gone too far.Still, a total disenfranchisement of public shareholders has been a long time coming among technology companies.When Apple and Microsoft went public decades ago they had the traditional corporate structure of one share, one vote. Google started the trend of making public shareholders lesser citizens in 2004, when it issued to public shareholders shares having one vote while the founders and insiders held shares with 10 votes.That has become the norm among new tech companies, as Facebook, Zynga and Groupon (among others) followed, as well as nontech companies such as Shake Shack. The typical structure was to give 10 votes per share to the Class A stock held by the founders and one vote to the public, though some companies went even further: Zynga\u2019s class A had 70 votes per share. (Twitter, however, was a noticeable exception and instead adopted a more traditional one-share, one-vote structure.)But Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, as well as other tech founders, soon discovered a problem. Even with all of those high-vote shares, they might lose control if they sold their stock to fund their charities or other ventures. As a result, Google, Zillow and even Under Armour have created no-vote shares to issue to employees and for future offerings.This is having your cake and eating it, too.Snap could go public with a Google-like structure and then issue out no-vote shares later. But why deal with all those pesky shareholders who may challenge such a conversion?Instead, Snap is apparently going to make sure that the public has no vote and hence never the opportunity to have a say in the company\u2019s governance. While public shareholders will be totally disenfranchised, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy are reportedly going to have 70 percent of the total vote despite owning only 40 percent of Snap.The discrepancy is not bad compared with other companies. At Facebook, for example, Mark Zuckerberg currently casts 53.8 percent of Facebook\u2019s votes while owning 15 percent of the company.Snap\u2019s rationale for wanting its co-founders to have this power has not been explained. But from news media reports and otherwise, we can figure out the gist. Snap is likely to argue that Mr. Spiegel, 26, is a visionary who knows how to sell to teenagers and 20-somethings. He is the one who can lead the company to join the superpower ranks of Facebook and Google, justifying Snap\u2019s valuation of over $20 billion.Indeed, that appears to be why Snapchat changed its name to Snap, so it could mimic the big boys like Google and be an umbrella company for other innovative and presumably lucrative products. Mr. Spiegel, the argument goes, needs total control over the company to ensure that this ambitious vision is executed.There are warning signs that the hype over Snap\u2019s initial public offering is going to be extreme. Already the company is indicating that it will focus not on revenues or profits, but on alternative metrics like user engagement.Yet is there any doubt that Snap\u2019s initial public offering will be a stunning success? After all, how can you miss out on the Next Big Thing, like, say, Myspace, Zynga, Groupon or perhaps Theranos? Oh, Snap.Sarcasm aside, few big social media players come to market, so investors will be sure to gobble up Snap shares.And risks and governance problems will be ignored in the rush not to miss out. The euphoria over Snap is noticeable even among banks, which are providing the company with a loan of $1.4 billion \u2014 more than Snap\u2019s entire expected 2017 revenue. So much for sober and prudent banking.When you think about it, this emphasis on vision in technology is tiresome. It drives money to companies but often seems hype to build up the egos of founders who often get lucky. I mean, were messages that disappear \u201cvisionary\u201d five years ago?Couldn\u2019t it be easier to say that instead of a visionary, Mr. Spiegel will be a multibillionaire with total control of a company and a track record of only a few years?Without picking on Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy, this type of corporate power concentration in one or two people has too much chance of going wrong \u2014 especially someone who might be around for 70 years and is running a company with so much uncertainty in its future. Their vision may change or just go bad, but shareholders who own part of the company are stuck as are the employees and consumers of the company who then are kept in this scenario.Even Google was criticized for overspending on investment, something shareholder pressure pushed back on and caused the company to change. Shareholders can provide some measure of check on these issues, but Snap would be saying: We won\u2019t care.Defenders of such a class-share structure point to the ability to look at the long term while arguing that the market will price any governance defects. Shareholders will pay less for Snap\u2019s shares because of these risks.This assumes a rational market, but it is hard not to see that people may be discounting the risks in the rush to buy the next hot tech stock. And while there may be real benefits to this structure in preserving a singular mission, given the early trajectory of Snap, it seems too risky.Perhaps the supporters are right. But the real test of this structure will come if the institutional investment firms who have the greatest influence in the stock market, like Vanguard and BlackRock, idly stand by.But I doubt that the institutions will do much more than complain, instead leaving Snap with corporate governance that mimics its disappearing messages, leaving nothing there.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "As Scandal Roils South Korea, Fingers Point to Mixing of Politics and Business", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The heir apparent to the Samsung empire, Jay Y. Lee, was trying to push through a corporate merger seen as critical to his plans to succeed his father as chairman.The court has never before ousted a president, though seven of the last eight have left office tainted by allegations of corruption. Whatever the court decides, the Park scandal has already put recurring collusion between big business and government in South Korea under intense scrutiny and could reshape the nation\u2019s flawed, young democracy.\u201cChaebol are accomplices!\u201d protesters have chanted, carrying effigies of their leaders dressed in blue prison uniforms. Damning new details emerge weekly.Prosecutors allege that Ms. Choi conspired with Ms. Park to force 53 companies to donate more than $69 million to the two foundations under Ms. Choi\u2019s control.The National Assembly went further in its impeachment motion, describing the donations as bribes personally benefiting Ms. Choi and paid in return for favors for the companies, ranging from lucrative licenses to presidential pardons.Ms. Park has denied the charges. At an extraordinary parliamentary hearing, Mr. Lee and eight other chaebol leaders also denied receiving or seeking special treatment for the donations. But they appeared to acknowledge that the payments were not entirely voluntary.\u201cIt was difficult to go against the government\u2019s wishes,\u201d testified Koo Bon-moo, the chairman of LG, the multinational electronics company.Mr. Lee called Samsung\u2019s contribution \u201cnot voluntary\u201d but \u201cinevitable.\u201dThe meeting with Mr. Lee was one of eight that Ms. Park held with top chaebol executives in July 2015. Her lawyers have acknowledged that she asked for contributions to the two foundations in the meetings but deny that she promised any favors. Little is known about what else was discussed in these one-on-one sessions.But there is no doubt the chaebol have benefited from government support for decades.These companies eventually grew into industrial conglomerates, fueling the export-driven growth that lifted South Korea out of postwar poverty and made it one of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies.Some of the firms, such as Samsung, Hyundai and LG, are now global brands with publicly listed shares. But the founding families still dominate almost all the conglomerates, in part, critics say, because of lax enforcement of corporate governance and tax laws.In return for their support, Park and many of his successors as president expected the chaebol to contribute to government projects. And the chaebol did more than that, sometimes channeling money to the presidents\u2019 personal coffers or those of their relatives and associates.The chaebol also face competition from China, which has begun producing many of the same goods, like petrochemicals, more cheaply. Some have angered the public by shifting manufacturing abroad even as their tentacle-like grip on the economy at home is blamed for squeezing start-ups and stifling innovation.Yet the conglomerates still enjoy some of the benefits that Park Chung-hee conferred on them more than four decades ago. They are taxed at lower effective rates than most companies or individuals, and receive more tax breaks. Businesses also pay lower electricity rates than individual consumers in South Korea.The benefits of such policies, Professor You said, \u201cis a very different order of magnitude compared to the sums of money that were donated to the foundations.\u201d\u201cAll decisions are made with the interests of the chaebol in mind,\u201d he added of policy-making in recent decades. Politicians and the chaebol, he said, \u201chave been relying on each other to maintain their power.\u201dFew South Koreans believe the chaebol are innocent victims in the unfolding case. But while Ms. Choi and Mr. Ahn, the president\u2019s economic adviser, have been arrested, the authorities have not taken action against executives at any of the businesses.Historically, the chaebol titans have not been immune from prosecution. On the contrary, several have been convicted of bribery, tax evasion and embezzlement \u2014 yet remained at the helm of their businesses.That is because they are often granted suspended sentences or presidential pardons. At least six of the nation\u2019s top 10 chaebol, which generate revenue equivalent to more than 80 percent of gross domestic product, are led by men with criminal records.Since taking office in 2013, Ms. Park has granted two such pardons. Chey Tae-won, chairman of the SK Group, which spans chemicals, petroleum, telecommunications and semiconductors, received one in the summer of 2015. The other went this past summer to Lee Jae-hyun, the chairman of the CJ Group, which comprises businesses in foods, pharmaceuticals, entertainment and media.Both men had been imprisoned on corruption charges. Representatives of both men met with Ms. Park in 2015. And both the SK Group and the CJ Group made donations to Ms. Choi\u2019s foundations at the president\u2019s request, prosecutors said. The impeachment motion cites the pardons in accusing Ms. Park of selling favors.Lawmakers have also noted that the money for the foundations was collected through the Federation of Korean Industries, which lobbies on behalf of the chaebol.The prosecutor is investigating reports that Ms. Choi used funds donated by Samsung to buy a house and motel in Germany, as well as to cover her daughter\u2019s personal expenses, including accessories for her pet dogs.Some of the payments made by the chaebol occurred while the government was weighing important decisions concerning the companies. For example, the SK Group and the retail conglomerate Lotte had lost valuable licenses to run duty-free shops in 2015 and lobbied to regain them last year. Lotte won back its license in December.While Mr. Shin was under investigation, prosecutors say, Ms. Park and Mr. Ahn pressured Lotte into donating $6 million for a sports complex to be built and managed by a company founded by Ms. Choi. The money was later returned.Prosecutors say other chaebol, including Hyundai, directed millions of dollars\u2019 worth of contracts at Mr. Ahn\u2019s request to companies owned by Ms. Choi and her associates.The chaebol all wrote checks, prosecutors say, usually after Mr. Ahn uttered the magic words: \u201cThe president is interested in this.\u201d\u201cWhat we need is a great national cleanup,\u201d said Moon Jae-in, an opposition leader who is the leading candidate to succeed Ms. Park. \u201cWe must sternly punish politics-business collusion, a legacy of the dictatorial era, and take this as an opportunity to reform chaebol.\u201dThis is a recurring promise among presidential aspirants in South Korea. Almost every candidate in recent elections \u2014 including Ms. Park \u2014 has vowed to end government collusion with the chaebol. But the culture remains entrenched.Some lawmakers are calling for constitutional revisions to shift some of the president\u2019s authority to the prime minister, or even to abolish the presidency and introduce a parliamentary government.Another problem is the news media, which can be hesitant to confront the government and the chaebol, who are major advertisers. The president effectively handpicks the heads of the two biggest television stations, and the government can revoke the licenses of cable news channels.Journalists who tried to investigate Ms. Choi suffered a vicious official backlash.As early as 2014, the Segye Ilbo newspaper reported on an intelligence document alleging influence-peddling by Ms. Choi\u2019s family. Ms. Park attacked the leak, and her office pressed the newspaper to fire its president, according to the impeachment motion.Instead of investigating the allegations in the document, prosecutors interrogated Segye journalists on possible defamation charges, and reporters at the newspaper said the tax authorities had begun investigating businesses owned by the paper\u2019s parent company.A police officer accused of leaking the document killed himself. \u201cListen, journalists!\u201d Lt. Choi Kyong-rak wrote in his suicide note. \u201cThe people\u2019s right to know is what you live and exist for. Please do your job.\u201dGiven the authority of the presidency, relatives and close friends often operate as rainmakers. In the past, the presidents\u2019 siblings and sons, while holding no official titles, often wielded enormous power as \u201cjunior presidents.\u201dMs. Park is unmarried, childless and estranged from her siblings, a status that she said would free her from nepotism and break the pattern. But she had Ms. Choi, whose family befriended her after the assassination of her mother in 1974.Prosecutors did not aggressively investigate the allegations against Ms. Choi until after Ms. Park delivered her first televised apology in October, a day after a local cable channel reported that Ms. Choi had edited the president\u2019s speeches.The story emboldened the press, prompting a flood of other damaging disclosures and then the huge street protests that eventually led prosecutors to conclude it was no longer politically tenable to do nothing.Cho Eung-cheon, a former prosecutor who is now an opposition lawmaker, said the authorities had moved too late.\u201cThe prosecutors we see now,\u201d he wrote on his Facebook page, \u201care nothing more or less than a pack of hyenas attacking a crippled lion.\u201dAn article on Jan. 3 about concern in South Korea over the mixing of business and politics amid the impeachment case against President Park Geun-hye misspelled, in some editions, the surname of the chairman of the SK Group, who was pardoned by Ms. Park in 2015 after his imprisonment on corruption charges. He is Chey Tae-won, not Choi Tae-won.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday, but a large number of religious leaders will take part in the ceremony, reading Scripture and offering prayers for his administration.Six religious leaders \u2014 including a rabbi, a cardinal, and a diverse group of Protestant preachers \u2014 will participate, more than for any previous president, said Jim Bendat, an author and historian of inaugural ceremonies. Each will have 60 to 90 seconds to offer a reading or lead a prayer.\u201cSome inaugurations have had just one, others have had two or three covering different religions, but this is a record,\u201d Mr. Bendat said.Here are those who are scheduled to participate:Cardinal Dolan has been the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York since 2009. His participation in the inauguration has been controversial in part because he has criticized Mr. Trump.Last week on his radio show, the cardinal said he was \u201chonored\u201d to be invited to take part in the inauguration and said he would have done the same thing had Hillary Clinton won the election.\u201cIt\u2019s not the person, it\u2019s the office, right?\u201d he said. \u201cI pray with prisoners. That doesn\u2019t mean I approve of what they\u2019ve done.\u201dMr. Rodriguez is the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, an organization that says it represents roughly 100 million Hispanic evangelicals in the United States and Latin America. In a statement, he said that he saw participating in the inauguration as \u201cnot just a patriotic honor\u201d but \u201cas a sacred duty.\u201dMr. Rodriguez has walked a tightrope in the past, defending Mr. Trump against accusations of racism (he called them \u201chyperbole from the liberal media\u201d) but also speaking up for undocumented immigrants, many of whom attend evangelical churches.\u201cYour sacrificial offering will be a seed for blessings for the remainder of the year,\u201d Pastor White wrote. \u201cAccording to Ezekiel 44, when you present your First Fruits offering, it will cause a blessing to rest upon your house!\u201dRabbi Hier is the founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization named after the 20th-century Nazi hunter and Holocaust survivor.Critics have called for him to drop out of the inauguration, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s support among white nationalist groups, but the rabbi said participating in the ceremony was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d for him.\u201cThere are 364 days a year for politics, for the two sides to pile on each other. Three hundred sixty-four days of that is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce every four years, the president of United States deserves a pass from both sides from political bickering; otherwise, we weaken our democracy.\u201dRabbi Hier will be the first Jewish religious leader to take part in an inaugural ceremony since 1985, he said, a fact that weighed in his decision to attend.\u201cIf a rabbi turned this down and said no?\u201d he said, \u201cIt would be a tremendous backlash. Many people would say \u2018look at how ungrateful the Jewish community is.\u2019\u201dMr. Graham is the son of Billy Graham, a pioneering televangelist and longtime spiritual adviser to American presidents from both parties.He has continued much of his father\u2019s work. He is president and chief executive of Samaritan\u2019s Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and has been a vocal Trump supporter.He continued:Hundreds of thousands of Christians from across the United States have been praying. This year, they came out to every state capitol to pray for this election and for the future of America. Prayer groups were started. Families prayed. Churches prayed.

{"Headline": "Wintry Blast in Greece Imperils Refugees in Crowded Camps", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byFirst it was the icy snow. Now comes the freezing rain.An arctic blast that has reached as far south as the Mediterranean is generating perilous conditions for thousands of refugees in overcrowded migrant camps in Greece and prompting the European Union to declare the situation \u201cuntenable.\u201dOn Wednesday, a Greek navy ship docked at Lesbos island to take on as many as 500 refugees. They have been struggling to survive the subzero temperatures in the severely overcrowded main camp in Moria, using pup tents that were supposed to be temporary when they were set up last year in warmer weather.Video and photos taken by migrants inside the camp and posted to social media showed flimsy shelters sagging under a blanket of snow, and people waiting in long lines in the falling snow for food and to use bathrooms.Imploring officials of the European Union to look at the situation themselves, he said: \u201cWhy can\u2019t people leave here? How is it possible to live in these conditions, my God?\u201dOn Tuesday night, the snow turned to freezing rain, forming rivers of muck around the camp and drenching tents and clothing, aid organizations reported. On Samos, another island where the main migrant camp is overflowing, refugees reported freezing conditions with no heat.At refugee camps on the Greek mainland, and especially near the northern border, migrants continued to grapple with living outside under heavy snowfall.\u201cThis is unbearable,\u201d said Roland Schoenbauer, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, who said he was receiving reports from doctors in camps across Greece warning of rising health risks from the cold and humidity. \u201cIt shows what happens when you try to squeeze too many people into these camps. You can\u2019t stockpile human beings.\u201dEric Kempson, a British citizen who has been living on Lesbos for over a decade, has been documenting the deteriorating conditions in the Moria refugee camp, posting videos of tents collapsing under the weight of snow and migrants slogging through muddy walkways.\u201cIt is now heavy rain and melting snow, which is causing flooding in the camp,\u201d Mr. Kempson wrote to The New York Times, via Facebook, describing the conditions in the camp on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s like we begin the vicious circle again and nothing gets better, only worse.\u201dOn Monday, the European Commission issued a statement saying the Greek refugee situation was the responsibility of Greek authorities. \u201cThe situation has become untenable,\u201d a spokeswoman, Natasha Bertaud, said in Brussels.The United Nations refugee agency and other aid groups have been working to move migrants from camps into better shelters, including hotels. In some cases, however, they have met resistance: Hotel owners on Samos, for example, were generally refusing to house migrants, Mr. Schoenbauer said.That is partly because the European Union has sent just a fraction of the assistance it pledged to Greece last year to help clear the backlog.A separate European Union plan to ease Greece\u2019s burden by relocating tens of thousands of asylum seekers has also failed to take off, with European countries taking only a few thousand of the many stuck in Greece.The bottlenecks have overwhelmed many of the camps, especially on the Greek islands, where migrants arriving after the March deal are supposed to be held until being deported to Turkey.The camp at Moria, for instance, run by the Greek police and nongovernmental organizations and designed for about 3,000 people, was reinforced with small container shelters that can each house up to 30 people.But hundreds of makeshift tents have been set up outside for months to accommodate an overflow of asylum seekers \u2014 first under the beating Greek sun, and now under the pelting snow and rain.\u201cThe snow is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Mr. Schoenbauer said. \u201cThe bigger problem is the overcrowding of the islands, and one reason for the overcrowding is the fact that the asylum procedure remains far too slow.\u201dMegan Specia contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

It comes in the shower. It comes when you\u2019re doodling or playing trains with your son. \u2018Hamilton\u2019 forced me to double down on being awake to the inspirations of just living my life.\u201dMr. Miranda\u2019s observation bodes ill for the future, not just of creativity but also of healthy bodies, minds and relationships. No doubt you\u2019ve seen the following scenarios, probably many times:\u2022 Young couples out to dinner pull out their smartphones to check messages, emails and social networks even before scanning the menu, and check their phones repeatedly throughout the meal.\u2022 Shoppers and commuters standing in line, people crossing busy streets, even cyclists and drivers whose eyes are on their phones instead of their surroundings.\u2022 Toddlers in strollers playing with a digital device \u2014 a parent\u2019s or perhaps even their own \u2014 instead of observing and learning from the world around them.The near-universal access to digital technology, starting at ever younger ages, is transforming modern society in ways that can have negative effects on physical and mental health, neurological development and personal relationships, not to mention safety on our roads and sidewalks.Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m no Luddite. I love technology. I love the convenience and assistance afforded by the myriad apps on my cellphone, a pocket-size information bank. I remember being amazed, as a Times reporter back in the early 1980s, when I started using word processing and realized how much faster I could write an article. Now computers save tons of time and effort and avert countless embarrassing errors because I can look up facts, figures, spelling, definitions and scholarly publications without leaving my ergonomic chair.But I also love putting my computer in sleep mode and going for a walk with my dog, meeting and chatting with friends, acquaintances and strangers, some of whom have become friends.As with so much else in life, moderation in our digital world should be the hallmark of a healthy relationship with technology. Too many of us have become slaves to the devices that were supposed to free us, giving us more time to experience life and the people we love. Instead, we\u2019re constantly bombarded by bells, buzzes and chimes that alert us to messages we feel compelled to view and respond to immediately.I fear we are turning into digital robots. Will future generations know how to converse with one another face to face? Will they notice the birds, trees, sunrise and the people with whom they share the planet?Instead of visiting art galleries, attending concerts or walking on picturesque wooded paths, one woman I know who came to Woodstock, N.Y., last summer spent the weekend on her iPad communing with her many \u201cfriends\u201d on Facebook. All I could think was \u201cWhat a waste!\u201dWhy, you may ask, is it so important to limit our digital lives? \u201cWithout open spaces and downtime, the nervous system never shuts down \u2014 it\u2019s in constant fight-or-flight mode,\u201d Ms. Colier said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re wired and tired all the time. Even computers reboot, but we\u2019re not doing it.\u201dShe continued, \u201cIt\u2019s connections to other human beings \u2014 real-life connections, not digital ones \u2014 that nourish us and make us feel like we count. Our presence, our full attention is the most important thing we can give each other. Digital communications don\u2019t result in deeper connections, in feeling loved and supported.\u201dHow often is your real work interrupted by signals from your smartphone that you find impossible to ignore? Have you ever avoided intimacy with your partner because you\u2019re in the midst of iPhone Scrabble? Is endlessly snapping selfies and posting your every action and thought on social media creating an unhealthy self-centeredness?As for physical well-being, every hour spent on a device is likely to be an indoor, sedentary one. Screens are stealing time that children and adolescents should be spending on physical activity and sports, reading, or creating and engaging directly with other children, all of which are critical to healthy physical and social development.Ms. Colier, a licensed clinical social worker, said, \u201cThe only difference between digital addiction and other addictions is that this is a socially condoned behavior.\u201d While her book contains a 30-day digital detox program, in our interview she offered three steps to help curb one\u2019s digital dependence.1. Start by recognizing how much digital use is really needed, say, for work or navigation or letting family members know you\u2019re O.K., and what is merely a habit of responding, posting and self-distraction.2. Make little changes. Refrain from using your device while eating or spending time with friends, and add one thing a day that\u2019s done without the phone.3. Become very conscious of what is important to you, what really nourishes you, and devote more time and attention to it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clearing Out the App Stores: Government Censorship Made Easier", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThere\u2019s a new form of digital censorship sweeping the globe, and it could be the start of something devastating.These moves may sound incremental, and perhaps not immediately alarming. China has been restricting the web forever, and Russia is no bastion of free speech. So what\u2019s so dangerous about blocking apps?Here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s a more effective form of censorship.But that\u2019s not the end of this story. The banning of apps highlights a deeper flaw in our modern communications architecture: It\u2019s the centralization of information, stupid.\u201cI think the app store censorship issue is one layer of ice on the surface of the iceberg above the waterline,\u201d said Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School and a leader in the free software movement of activists who have long been warning about the dangers of centrally managed, commercial software.For more than a decade, we users of digital devices have actively championed an online infrastructure that now looks uniquely vulnerable to the sanctions of despots and others who seek to control information. We flocked to smartphones, app stores, social networks and cloud storage. Publishers like The New York Times are investing in apps and content posted to social networks instead of the comparatively open World Wide Web. Some start-ups now rely exclusively on apps; Snapchat, for instance, exists only as a mobile app.Compared with older forms of distributing software, apps downloaded from app stores are more convenient for users and often more secure from malware, and they can be more lucrative for creators. But like so much else online now, they risk feeding into mechanisms of central control. In most countries, the Apple and Google app stores are the only places to find apps for devices running their respective operating systems. (There are more choices for Android app stores in China, where Google does not offer its store.)The internet\u2019s earliest boosters considered it a magical tool to liberate people from restrictions on speech. The easy banning of apps suggests that if we let it, the internet could instead become something quite the opposite \u2014 one of the most efficient choke points of communication the world has ever seen.As the threat of nuclear attack diminished and the internet grew, its decentralized design became as much a political selling point as a technical one.What the creators and early proselytizers of the internet did not foresee was the rapid commercialization of the network. The internet that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Gilmore envisioned was built and maintained by collectives of users; the one that users flocked to was tamed by companies whose very success turned them into some of the largest corporations on the planet.The internet is now no longer \u201ceverywhere and nowhere.\u201d Just about all of its economic value is instead connected to two very specific somewheres: the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, the homes of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook, the four monstrously large companies that own the internet\u2019s central information platforms. As these companies began to build ever-larger empires online, they have evolved into convenient choke points \u2014 the very points of control that the internet was designed to eliminate.Apple offered this statement in response to my queries on how it decides to take down apps: \u201cFor some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China, and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.\u201d Google declined to comment.But Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights activist organization, said the internet giants were not without leverage in this fight.\u201cThe flip side of that is, is China going to block the entire Apple App Store over a single app?\u201d she asked. Interestingly, the internet giants\u2019 hold on every aspect of online life works toward their advantage in battling governments.\u201cThe bigger a company is, the bigger the risk that blocking them will lead to riots in the streets because you have come between people and their pictures of cats,\u201d Ms. Galperin said. \u201cThose are the companies that governments are going to be more wary of blocking, and they should be the ones that stand up to government pressure. They have a special responsibility.\u201dUsers and app developers who are now at risk of being censored also bear some responsibility. When I asked Mr. Moglen at Columbia about app bans, he was incensed that I didn\u2019t recognize The New York Times\u2019s own complicity in this story.The Times, he argued, could have stuck with the old way of publishing news. The company could have declined to create a downloadable app and instead invested all of its engineering resources into making its news available on the web, anonymously. The Times could have refused to profile users for advertising purposes, or to have its articles hosted on Facebook, or to monitor what people read in order to recommend more articles to keep people engaged. In short, The Times could have refused to play the modern digital-publishing game. But like every other publisher, it went along.\u201cWhat did you expect would happen?\u201d Mr. Moglen asked. \u201cChina didn\u2019t have to build a Great Firewall to do this. You all offered them an opportunity to piggyback onto your disrespect for the privacy and integrity and autonomy of your readers and users.\u201dI don\u2019t agree with Mr. Moglen that The Times disrespects its readers by offering a news app. (I think it\u2019s a very nice app.) But he is right that a lot of people online walked blindly into the no-win position we are in now, where our only recourse against censorship might be the good will of a few giant corporations that control most of the internet.There has to be some other way. Let\u2019s maybe work on finding it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Afraid of Nonviolence?", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIssa Amro, a native of the city of Hebron and a prominent Palestinian advocate of nonviolent resistance, has been waiting now for nearly two months to find out when he can expect to face trial in an Israeli military courtroom. He has been accused of a series of offenses ranging from demonstrating without a permit to \u201cinsulting a soldier.\u201dThe two most serious charges are for assaulting a pair of soldiers and a settlement security coordinator. In both instances, one in 2010 and the other in 2013, the military claims that Mr. Amro pushed his antagonists.A dispute over whom Mr. Amro called \u201cstupid,\u201d however, is not the only absurdity here. He is also charged with assaulting an Israeli settler during an altercation over a camera, which reportedly happened at a protest. Mr. Amro is accused of spitting at the settler, pushing him and throwing his camera to the ground. But Mr. Amro says that though he was at the demonstration, he had already been arrested and was in military custody when the camera incident took place.Cruel absurdities are a commonplace of life in the occupied territories, but nowhere are they quite as intense as in Hebron. In the center of this city of some 200,000 Palestinians, a group of 800 Israeli settlers occupies heavily fortified positions, guarded by 650 Israeli soldiers. To manage this inherently combustible situation, the Israeli military has turned swaths of the central city into \u201csterile zones\u201d in which Palestinians are no longer allowed to drive.Mr. Amro, 36, is among the most successful community organizers to have come of age in the Hebron of minority rule and sterile zones. For 13 years, he has been engaged in a creative, nonviolent campaign against the Israeli occupation. Through the organization he founded, Youth Against Settlements, he provides a space \u2014 a community center \u2014 and an outlet for young people to express their resistance to the occupation in nonviolent ways.Every week, up to a hundred kids gather at the center, where Mr. Amro screens inspirational films and instructs them in principles of political nonviolence. He involves them in projects that maintain the public pathways and repair stairway railings and water pipes. They run a summer camp and built and operate a kindergarten. For this work, the United Nations bestowed on Mr. Amro its \u201cHuman Rights Defender of the Year in Palestine\u201d award in 2010.The neighbor understood that the girl\u2019s plan was to try to stab an Israeli soldier. The neighbor knew that the likely result of such an attack would be the death of the girl, not of the soldier. And the neighbor knew that when you hoped to avoid violence, Issa Amro was the person to call.Mr. Amro sprinted to the checkpoint and found the girl there, huddled and trembling. He knelt next to her and began to talk. He told her that if she carried out the attack, she was likely to die. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t care, there\u2019s no hope for me.\u201d Mr. Amro told the girl that her death would not help Palestine, that her community needed her. He talked about the myriad ways the occupation could be opposed without violence and without martyrdom.\u201cShe didn\u2019t believe me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I started giving example after example.\u201d He quoted Quranic teachings about the sanctity of life and the sin of suicide, and in time, he said, \u201cI could see her hold on to a little bit of hope.\u201d Eventually, she handed him the knife. He turned her over to the Palestinian police.Since then he has received other urgent requests for help in averting violence. Among them was one from a young woman who messaged him on Facebook, telling him that she wanted to take up a knife and become a martyr to the Palestinian cause. He discouraged her, pleading the cause of nonviolence. He reached out to her friends and sent them to her house, where they successfully interceded.This is the man who now faces a long sentence in an Israeli military prison over offenses that include a schoolyard taunt he says he never uttered and an assault he says he could not possibly have carried out. The prosecution has yet to respond to a motion by Mr. Amro\u2019s lawyer to drop 14 of the 18 charges, on the basis of \u201cabuse of justice,\u201d and its pursuit of Mr. Amro has been widely condemned.In the eyes of the world, Mr. Amro\u2019s commitment to nonviolence has made him a particularly appealing and visible spokesman for his people. In the past year, he received visits from members of Congress and even as his original trial date approached, he traveled to Belgium, where he spoke to members of the the European Parliament and met with its president.Self-assured, articulate and principled, Mr. Amro and his rising public profile serve as an embarrassment to the Israeli military regime that controls Palestine. As Amos Gilad, the director of the Political-Military Affairs Bureau at Israel\u2019s defense ministry, told American officials in a comment that came to light as a result of WikiLeaks, \u201cWe don\u2019t do Gandhi very well.\u201dThere are Palestinians who murder, who strap on suicide vests, use vehicles as weapons, assault Israeli soldiers and civilians with knives. Issa Amro is not one of them. On the contrary, his commitment to nonviolent resistance as the only legitimate path to lasting change is the best hope of peace for Palestinians and Israelis alike.If Israel harasses and prosecutes community organizers like Mr. Amro, the youth of Palestine will have no models of resistance to turn to in their frustration and despair but people like Mohammad Tarayreh, who on June 30, 2016, in the settlement of Kiryat Arba, on the outskirts of Hebron, broke into the bedroom of a 13-year-old Israeli girl, Hallel Yaffa Ariel, and stabbed her to death. In binding the upraised fist of resistance, they will leave only the hand that is holding the knife.Michael Chabon is a novelist and the author, most recently, of \u201cMoonglow\u201d; Ayelet Waldman is a novelist and memoirist, and the author, most recently, of \u201cA Really Good Day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is scheduled to rise to $15 by 2022.Supporters argue that higher pay is essential to improving the lives of the working poor.But leaders of low-wage industries say many companies will be forced to fire workers, leave the state or simply close.\u201cYou know that in the entire country: You raise the minimum wage, you will have less employees,\u201d said Ilse Metchek, president of the California Fashion Association.Among economists, the question is contested.David Neumark, an economics professor at U.C.

Last month, a special prosecutor asked the authorities in Germany, where Ms. Chung, a former member of South Korea\u2019s national equestrian team, had been training, to detain and extradite her. South Korean officials had also asked Interpol to look for her and threatened to invalidate her passport.Ms. Chung was holed up with her infant son, a nanny and two male guardians in a house in the northern Danish city of Aalborg when the local authorities found her on Sunday night, said the South Korean news channel JTBC, which was at the scene when she was apprehended. It said its reporters first alerted the authorities to her whereabouts.\u201cWe will request her emergency extradition, working with the special prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d Lee Chul-sung, the chief of the National Police Agency, said at a news conference in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Monday.The Danish police said on Monday that they had arrested Ms. Chung after receiving a tip from a South Korean journalist Sunday afternoon and confirmation from the international law enforcement agency Interpol that an international warrant for her arrest had been registered last Tuesday.Ms. Chung confirmed that she was aware that the South Korean authorities wanted to question her, the police said, and added that she was in Denmark for horse racing.The police said that Ms. Chung had not been charged with a crime in Denmark, although prosecutors said they had asked the court to keep Ms. Chung in custody while the question of possible extradition was clarified. South Korea and Denmark have an extradition treaty.Ms. Chung was accused of illegally enrolling in Ewha Womans University in Seoul in 2015, using her mother\u2019s political connections to force the elite school to accept her despite poor qualifications. An inquiry by the Education Ministry revealed that the school had admitted her at the expense of other candidates with better credentials. Her enrollment was revoked in November.Ms. Chung has become a lightning rod for public anger as lurid accusations have emerged about her lifestyle. The accusations of illegal enrollment against her have been particularly inflammatory in South Korea, where students cram for years to prepare for intensely competitive college entrance exams. Ewha students were the first to take to the streets to protest the Choi family\u2019s reported influence peddling.After Ms. Chung lost a gold medal to a rival in a domestic equestrian competition in 2013, her family was accused of using its connections to open a government audit of the local equestrian association.Two officials at the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism who looked into the scandal lost their jobs for not siding with Ms. Chung\u2019s family, a former culture minister said. Ms. Park called the officials \u201cbad men,\u201d according to the former minister, Yoo Jin-ryong.Ms. Chung\u2019s family also used its influence to get Ewha to give her good grades even though she hardly attended classes, Education Ministry officials said.On Tuesday, the special prosecutor asked a court to issue an arrest warrant for an Ewha professor who was accused of ordering his teaching assistants to complete assignments for Ms. Chung.\u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing but your parents to blame for your lack of resources,\u201d Ms. Chung wrote in a Facebook post in 2014. The post was shared widely in South Korea, where widening economic inequality has fueled increasing public anger.Dan Bilefsky contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Americans Come Together", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported bySportingBut the demolition of this repository of youthful memories should not have surprised me. For decades, roller skating rinks have fought for their survival, and over the past five years, participation in roller skating is down about 4 percent, according to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association.Nostalgia can be a tricky, fickle bedfellow, but there did seem to be the threat of the loss of a sense of shared, cordial space, particularly in communities that were physically spread out. As Robert Putnam noted in his 2000 book \u201cBowling Alone\u201d \u2014 before the smartphone and social media era \u2014 our bridge clubs, civic groups, square dances and the like have long been a melting iceberg. Skate World felt like a giant chunk falling off.Skate World, sandwiched between Interstate 5 and the backside of Gateway Mall, carved out an unlikely sanctuary in the hearts of locals as a place for birthday parties, school field trips and other childhood loitering. It bore an ominous sign at entry, creating a crucial air of mystery and danger: \u201cSkate at Your Own Risk.\u201dThat was the motto our family lived by. We had a couple of roller-related hospital trips, one on Skate World\u2019s floors: My mother fell while sailing across its floors and broke her arm shortly after I was born, a testament to the bizarre stoicism of her desire to chase her trip to the maternity ward with a few laps. We weren\u2019t a graceful people, but Skate World welcomed us nonetheless, and politely asked if we\u2019d like to add wrist guards to our skate rentals.Many a crush was nursed within those carpeted walls, where kitschy pop and disco songs were requested one-by-one on steady rotation, the smell of stale nachos and body odor permeated the air, and beige skates were rented out with questionable aromas of their own. I was an ambidextrous child, and the symmetry of roller skating was a welcome respite from my awkwardness with physical activities that involved a ball or a racket.For a small fee, paid in loose change and crumpled dollar bills, carnations could be dedicated to those circulating on the baby blue floor, eliciting a round of giggles or groans. Chewing gum and \u201cfoul language\u201d were supposedly banned; I can now come clean about dropping obscenity bombs in a rebellious preadolescent fervor and sneaking in Bubble Yum on multiple occasions. In a mud hole of constant drizzle, skating was a welcome activity for cooped-up children and their exhausted parents, a more kid-friendly bowling alley. As a community gathering spot, the rink felt less classist than a shopping mall but less intimidating than a church, and much less soggy than a park.It was perfect.I also found myself wondering about the consequences of a beloved shared space closing its doors in this era of great disconnection. Some communities are formed through schools, churches, workplaces. But much of how we learn about one another as a society comes from physically being together in places like skating rinks. Today, we\u2019re more likely to sext than skate, to troll online than to twirl on a floor, to rant on Twitter than dedicate carnations to one another. Social media has created a digital latticework, but it has also, for some, created abusive commenters, silos and validation rather than curiosity.As a Skate World kid, I don\u2019t think I could have told you, nor did I care, about the political leanings of my classmates or their families. We were bound by something different from the angry Facebook stream we grew up to inhabit: a genuine interest in spending time together.I haven\u2019t skated in years and am fairly certain my neon-pink Rollerblades were liquidated several garage sales ago. I\u2019ve often wondered if the trade-off for growing up in the relative newness and freshness of the West Coast was befuddlement when it comes to historical preservation. We don\u2019t have many old things, and we don\u2019t really know what to do with the few that are around when our default response is to compost or field burn.On a recent visit home, I asked my 15-year-old nephew if he had been to Skate World in the last couple of years. He shrugged, then told me about the latest video game he was into. Not a scientific sample, but a hard moment to shake.But later in the year, I got a great surprise: Skate World would be saved.Dave and Debbie Berg of Puyallup, Wash., secured financing to purchase it from the Sacramento-based trusts that had controlled it. They plan to keep it open.\u201cIt\u2019s good for the community,\u201d Debbie Berg told me. For Berg, the purchase was personal. She worked at the rink from 1978 to 1998, she told me, and has been an impassioned skater since she was 13. \u201cEveryone has fun here. It\u2019s been here for 40 years. I think Bill Cook, who designed it, always wanted to keep it open as a rink. It was his baby.\u201dBerg said that operating one of the state\u2019s few skating rinks isn\u2019t always easy. Payroll costs are going up, and she will probably have to raise the admission fee to accommodate those staffing costs and renovations.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to change it a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cJust little tweaks here or there.\u201dThe twists and turns at Skate World have made me wonder if today I am still a small-town skater, a New York City elitist, or maybe something in between.I\u2019m still figuring that out. But the next time I\u2019m in town, I know that I\u2019ll be grateful for the opportunity to lace up some skates.For now, at least, it isn\u2019t the end of the world after all.Mary Pilon, the author of \u201cThe Monopolists\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cThe Kevin Show,\u201d previously covered sports at The New York Times and business at The Wall Street Journal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bullet Misses Its Mark, and Then Takes a Fatal Detour", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Murder in the 4-0Maribel Cavero\u2019s death in the South Bronx initially puzzled detectives. But swift evidence-gathering and help from a witness led to the arrest of a man they believe fired a gun nearly two blocks from the victim.Supported byA quarter-ounce of copper-jacketed lead exploded from the barrel of a 9-millimeter pistol at 1,300 feet per second. The bullet sped toward 28-year-old Carlos Vasquez, who ran just steps ahead of the gunman.But it missed its mark, just outside the Melrose Houses in the South Bronx, and kept whistling through the air. It sailed for 150 yards along East 154th Street, down the slope between Courtlandt and Elton Avenues, staying airborne as the ground fell away.Maribel Cavero, 45, was crossing the street at the base of that hill, unaware that a shot had been fired during a running fight between young men in the housing project. She had just delivered a carton of sugar substitute to her diabetic grandmother on East 154th Street and was on her way to pick up her 13-year-old niece from school.The bullet slowed and tumbled as it dropped. Then, with the last of its fading energy, it tore into Ms. Cavero.Alejandro Almonte, 45, a passer-by, heard Ms. Cavero yelp and saw her fall. He later said he thought she must have had a seizure. He ran to where she lay, facedown, on the blacktop by a small car\u2019s bumper. She was dying, the bullet having pierced her heart at about 12:50 p.m. on Nov. 2, a sunny Wednesday. The slug passed through her chest and rolled to a stop under a Jeep parked near a wood-frame house at 426 East 154th Street.The bullet was strangely pristine, hardly deformed by its deadly work.\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have hit a tree?\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cA light pole? A sign?\u201dNow, less than a mile away and five months later, the police had another mystery and another blameless bystander lying crumpled on the ground. Detectives were initially unable to explain what had happened.The mayor\u2019s office called the chief of detectives, and the chief of detectives called Sergeant LoPuzzo. The message was simple: Do all you can.The department flooded the streets with rookies who picked through trash and shined flashlights in alleyways and sewer grates searching for any potential evidence. Detectives checked Ms. Cavero\u2019s background for clues. The head of Bronx detectives, Deputy Chief Jason Wilcox, stalked the streets between the projects and the businesses on Third Avenue, the area around him abuzz with the police.By late the next night, Orlando Oquendo, a 17-year-old who the police believed had fired the bullet, was in handcuffs, having been identified in a lineup by Mr. Vasquez, the man who said he was the target. Mr. Oquendo, who still looked very much a teenager, had been arrested several times, including twice on gun possession charges, according to court documents and his mother.\u201cThat kid was on a road,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said. \u201cIt was just a matter of time.\u201dLess than 48 hours elapsed from death to arrest, and what detectives in this corner of the city say they hope for but rarely see came to pass: The police and the people in the community had cooperated to solve a killing.\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to read like a book,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said weeks later, explaining how he wished all cases went that way. \u201cWhere you can read all the steps in the investigation, and what they saw and what they found and what the video shows and what the evidence shows. So it\u2019s all one big package.\u201dIt was a luxury, the sergeant said, his squad often did not have.The day she died, Maribel Cavero and her 67-year-old mother, Maria Reyes, had cooked crabs for an early lunch, using a recipe from their native Ecuador. Together, with Ms. Cavero\u2019s younger sister, Alexandra Cavero, 44, they sat at a small table in the family\u2019s fifth-floor apartment in the Melrose Houses, only a block from the corner where the shot would be fired. Ms. Cavero regaled them with family gossip and news from their home country.The sisters had joined their mother in the United States in 2008, about 12 years after she followed her own mother from Guayaquil, Ecuador, to the South Bronx in hopes of more earnings and a better life.When lunch was finished, Ms. Cavero\u2019s mother reminded her to drop off the box of sugar substitute to her grandmother, Marcela Troncoso, the 86-year-old family matriarch, who lived in an apartment on East 154th Street. As she did most days, Ms. Cavero was headed to pick up her sister\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Gabriela Encalada, from school, because her sister had to leave for her job as a bus driver. But Ms. Cavero would make time for the delivery.\u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019m in a hurry, but I\u2019ll do it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Reyes said in a recent interview. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201dMs. Cavero had no husband, no boyfriend and no children, her relatives said. She enjoyed certain solitary pursuits, like romance novels and the online game FarmVille. And aside from family, her regular social activity was Mass at Immaculate Conception Church on East 150th Street. \u201cShe lived in her own world,\u201d her sister said. \u201cShe was still very na\u00efve.\u201dWith what relatives called a tranquil focus, she poured her energy into caring for her mother and helping to raise her niece, whom she considered like a daughter. She loved tragic poetry, her sister said, and the writings of Pablo Neruda and the novels of Cor\u00edn Tellado, a prolific romance writer. At night, she would watch Elvis Presley movies, referring to the singer as her eternal love. She watched James Bond movies, too, but told friends she avoided real romantic entanglements because in her view they always brought pain.\u201cIn high school, they used to say she seemed like she was in love because when she was into a book, into a piece of literature, she expressed it, and the others would tell her, \u2018You\u2019re in love,\u2019 and her answer would be \u2018Yes, I\u2019m in love with life,\u2019\u201d her sister said. \u201c\u2018In some ways you seem like a little girl, and in some ways you\u2019re like an old lady,\u2019 I used to tell her.\u201dMs. Cavero worked for a few years as a part-time nanny, her mother said. But as the children she watched grew, the $100-a-week job ended and she wound up working another job her stepfather found for her at a McDonald\u2019s on Sixth Avenue and 28th Street in Manhattan. The shifts began late in the day, which gave her time to pick up Gabriela. But they often ended near midnight.Coming home that late, she usually called her mother to tell her she was leaving work. Her mother said Ms. Cavero was afraid of the neighborhood. \u201cThis is a bad place here,\u201d Ms. Reyes said. \u201cSometimes gunfights are heard outside.\u201dWhen the McDonald\u2019s was being remodeled in the fall, Ms. Cavero seized the opportunity to go to Ecuador. She stayed for 45 days with her father, Luis Cavero. She wasn\u2019t thrilled to return to New York, where she had been frustrated in finding meaningful work, and she talked of moving home once her niece was older, her sister said.\u201cWhy did this happen?\u201d her sister asked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. She was a person who had no vices.\u201dFor the investigation into Ms. Cavero\u2019s killing, finding the small, smooth slug under a Jeep near the body was the case\u2019s first big break.Detectives who found it cordoned off the area with crime scene tape.One hunched down, unloaded the magazine of his own 9-millimeter pistol and pulled out a bullet to compare. The slugs were the same size.Another bystander told officers he had seen a man running wildly with something black in his hand through the Melrose playground a block and a half away.Detectives traced a ballistic path westward along East 154th Street and found a plumber who told them he had seen the shooting as he walked with his lunch from the Twin Deli Grocery at East 154th and Courtlandt.The plumber told detectives he saw one young man chase another, then stop and raise his arm. He heard a gunshot and the tinkle of a brass shell hitting the sidewalk as the gunman turned back and sprinted into the Melrose Houses.The shell was there, under some scaffolding, on the northeast corner, and detectives placed a white foam cup over it to preserve it as evidence.After detectives went looking for surveillance video, they found footage from at least five nearby stores and buildings, a bonanza in a neighborhood where security cameras are scarce and often out of order. One video showed a teenager racking a gun, dropping something, then firing. On the street, besides the shell casing, detectives discovered an object they believed had also fallen from the gunman\u2019s hands: a silver cigarette lighter.Television satellite trucks began showing up, a rare but welcome sight for investigators in this part of the city, who hoped publicity might encourage witnesses to come forward. The evening news broadcasts were soon underway, and in a place where even horrific killings often draw only brief coverage, the local stations were going big with the news of an innocent bystander shot dead.For Sergeant LoPuzzo, a steady diet of coffee and cigarettes does nothing to blunt his frustration over witnesses who will not speak. In case after case, as recently as a shooting on New Year\u2019s Day, even seriously injured victims tell a similar story: \u201cFelt pain, saw nothing.\u201dBut the Cavero case was already going differently, and then a call came from the 40th Precinct station house on Alexander Avenue. Detectives told the sergeant, who was still at the scene, that a man had walked into the second-floor squad room claiming to have been in the gunman\u2019s cross hairs.\u201cI said, \u2018Do not let him leave,\u2019\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo recalled.Within minutes, the man, Carlos Vasquez, was putting his account in writing in front of a detective. In his statement, he said he saw the news of Ms. Cavero\u2019s death on television and realized \u201cthat a woman was shot and killed by the bullet that was intended for me.\u201d\u201cI informed my family that I was going to the precinct so I can tell the detectives what happened and tell them I wanted this guy brought to justice,\u201d he said in his statement, which both he and a detective signed.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the rare things where he\u2019s got a conscience,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo later said.Mr. Vasquez had been arrested more than a dozen times and had been convicted of drug dealing and illegal possession of a knife. He was a well-known, if small-time, drug dealer. He sold in the Melrose Houses near the corner of East 153rd Street and Courtlandt Avenue, where his mother lived, according to court records and the police.In implicating Mr. Oquendo, Mr. Vasquez never explained how the fight had started. In his own words, he said he had left his building on Nov. 2 \u201cin search of marijuana\u201d and was waiting for a dealer near a flagpole at the neighboring Jackson Houses when two men assaulted him. He ran. But before he could make it to the safety of his mother\u2019s house, one of the assailants closed the gap, with a gun in hand.\u201cAs I\u2019m running, I turn around to see him point a gun at me and fire it,\u201d Mr. Vasquez said in his statement, though he did not know Mr. Oquendo\u2019s name. \u201cI ducked between cars.\u201dEven before Mr. Vasquez came in, detectives reviewing the recovered video images from the deli\u2019s cameras thought they had identified a suspect. Officers assigned to a plainclothes street-crime unit recognized the person in the surveillance footage as Mr. Oquendo, the teenager with a lengthy arrest record who was known to officers as \u201cGumby.\u201dThe case detective, Ivan Monge, also knew the gunman when he saw the video. He had arrested Mr. Oquendo\u2019s older sister on assault charges in October. \u201cI told myself, \u2018Wait, this is Gumby, this is Oquendo,\u2019\u201d he said.Detectives did not recover the gun. But with the videos, the witnesses, the bullet, the shell casing and the name of the suspect lining up, Sergeant LoPuzzo\u2019s team made one more breakthrough: Detective David Rodriguez remembered that the suspect\u2019s mother was an old neighbor of his from Spanish Harlem. They had grown up together, their families had attended the same church and they had spoken after one of Mr. Oquendo\u2019s previous arrests.The detective contacted the mother\u2019s relatives on Facebook and eventually got her on the phone. He told her he needed her to bring in her son safely. \u201cLike a mother, she didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Detective Rodriguez said. \u201cAnd she wanted the proof.\u201dDetective Rodriguez went to her home and took her to the squad room, where he showed her a wanted flier with an image of her son taken from the videos. She came in only \u201cbecause she trusted him,\u201d said Detective John Caruso, another detective working on the case.Finally she broke down. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said, according to Detective Rodriguez, \u201cthat\u2019s my son.\u201dBy the next night, the detectives were packed in the lobby of the Legal Aid Society\u2019s office on East 161st Street in the Bronx. Steven Mechanic, a veteran public defender who had represented Mr. Oquendo against several criminal charges in the past, surrendered him to the police. \u201cThere are no winners in this case,\u201d Mr. Mechanic said later, declining to discuss the new charges or Mr. Oquendo\u2019s previous convictions.Mr. Oquendo was led away. His parents cried.\u201cHe told me he came over from Cuba on a boat, 20 years ago,\u201d Detective Rodriguez said of the suspect\u2019s father. \u201cI know the mother\u2019s side of the family personally. I\u2019ve known them for years. He comes from a good family, but everyone takes their own path in life.\u201dOrlando Oquendo\u2019s mother sat in her living room in the Jackson Houses one recent night, with a stack of letters written by her son in jail piled on her lap. She nodded toward the streets outside her sixth-floor window and spoke of her son\u2019s sorrow for Ms. Cavero\u2019s death.\u201cIf he did do it, it was not intentional. It was not toward her,\u201d she said of the shooting. \u201cA person was lost, so it\u2019s going to hurt.\u201dShe felt a kinship for Ms. Cavero\u2019s family. Both were Latino families, she said, one from Puerto Rico and Cuba, the other from Ecuador. Both were churchgoing, and both were living in a crime-plagued area they wanted to escape.Mr. Oquendo\u2019s mother said that taking the apartment in the Jackson Houses 11 years ago was the worst decision she had ever made. Mr. Oquendo, the fourth of her six children, was troubled and, from a young age, attended a special school for emotionally disturbed children. It was hard to stay neutral in the project\u2019s ever-simmering gang feuds, and he got into fights constantly. He seemed unable to back down from a threat.He would not \u201cstay shut\u201d when challenged, said his mother, who spoke on the condition that her name not be published. \u201cHe had good hands. He could defend himself.\u201dTwice, her son was accused of crimes involving guns, according to court documents and law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential records. In February 2014, a young woman told the police that Mr. Oquendo, who was 15, fired several shots at her, one official said. He was indicted on a gun possession charge in that case, which was transferred to family court and sealed.Then, in August 2015, he was arrested when a police officer saw him drop a .38-caliber revolver wrapped in a T-shirt on Courtlandt Avenue near East 157th Street, a criminal complaint said. He later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and was given a conditional discharge, the official said.Mr. Oquendo\u2019s mother said he was supposed to be graduating from high school this month and then going to work for his father\u2019s plumbing business. Her son had been coaching young basketball players at the local Classic Community Center, on the courts where Chris McCullough of the Brooklyn Nets once reigned. He had proposed to his longtime girlfriend, telling her they could someday move to a safer neighborhood with their son, O. J., born on Aug. 16.\u201cIf this kid could relive this day, I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t do the same thing that he did,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said. \u201cBut once you pull that trigger, you can\u2019t pull that back.\u201dStill, the pressures were mounting, said Mr. Oquendo\u2019s mother, who referred to him as her \u201cprayer baby\u201d for his constant comfort of her. He watched her battle diabetes and heart disease and saw his maternal grandmother dying of colon cancer. The streets enveloped him, she said. In October, he had a dispute with Mr. Vasquez outside a local barbershop.On the day of the shooting, Mr. Vasquez\u2019s nephew, a friend of the Oquendo family, sent messages to Mr. Oquendo\u2019s sister to find out what had happened. After speaking with Detective Rodriguez, Mr. Oquendo\u2019s mother reached her son and asked him to surrender.\u201cI told him, \u2018The best thing to do is to turn yourself in, and let\u2019s see what happens,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want my son out on the run.\u201dNow, he is in a Rikers Island jail cell, facing a five-count indictment on murder and other charges. He turned 18 there and spent Thanksgiving and Christmas alone. But his letters and cards keep coming, almost daily, filled with apologies for letting his mother down and promising to come home.In a letter on Dec. 30, he told her not to worry, writing, \u201cGod has a plan,\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s hope God gives us a short, easy punishment.\u201dMs. Cavero\u2019s relatives, who are tracking the suspect\u2019s court appearances, are afraid of just that: a light sentence. Detectives said that Mr. Oquendo\u2019s intended victim, Mr. Vasquez, picked him out of a police lineup, but that the plumber who witnessed the shooting had been too afraid to try the same. DNA tests on the silver lighter recovered near the shell casing were inconclusive.In her living room, two blocks from the Oquendo family, Ms. Cavero\u2019s mother, Ms. Reyes, also sat on a couch with a pile of envelopes, these containing court papers and other official documents.She thought back to the moment the police informed her of her daughter\u2019s killing. Detective Monge, the case detective, had knocked on her door to deliver the news in Spanish, and she was grateful for his compassion. But even after a wake, in which her daughter was dressed all in white, and a funeral, in Ecuador, she said the randomness of the death \u2014 in which a person with no enemies or vices was taken violently \u2014 remained the abiding mystery. It is a question the police cannot answer.\u201cThat is what I ask myself,\u201d Ms. Reyes said, tears falling down her cheeks. \u201cWhy did this happen this way?\u201dReporting was contributed by Sandra E. Garcia, Ashley Southall and Nate Schweber from New York, and Maggy Ayala Samaniego from Ecuador. Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: Making a Marilyn Monroe Moment", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byNew York TodayUpdated, 7:18 a.m.Good morning on this cooling Friday.It\u2019s an iconic moment in cinema: Marilyn Monroe standing on a subway grate, her pleated white dress billowing up like a parachute.In September 1954, thousands of people gathered at 52nd Street and Lexington Avenue to watch as it was being staged for the film \u201cThe Seven Year Itch.\u201dBut the shoot in New York is said to have been a publicity stunt; the footage used in the film was taken on a 20th Century Fox lot in Los Angeles.We started outside 164 East 61st Street, the townhouse shown in the film.The house is still standing, and this week, it appeared to be the only one on the block still adorned with Christmas decorations.We regret to inform you that the eatery is long gone. It\u2019s now Sprinkles, a cupcake shop, and the outside of the building has an A.T.M. that dispenses cupcakes. (How far we\u2019ve come in 63 years!)We headed south, to 52nd Street, the site of the celebrated subway grate.So we stopped above what we imagined was the same grate, now in front of the bistro Le Relais de Venise l\u2019Entrec\u00f4te, to see if it might elicit an out-of-body experience.Not quite.The long, narrow subway grate was sandwiched on one end by a garbage can, and on the other by a large, thirsty-looking potted plant.When we stood over the grate, we didn\u2019t feel the swoosh of the subway swiftly blowing at our heels. When we looked down, all we could see was our own reflection in some murky water. And we certainly didn\u2019t look like we were having an exceptional hair day.What we\u2019d suggest, to better recreate that unforgettable New York (but made in Hollywood) moment, is to ask a friend to come along with a giant fan and an iPhone. Ask that kind soul to turn on the fan, encourage passers-by to cheer your name, and let the photo shoot begin.Here\u2019s what else is happening:It\u2019s a slow stumble to snow.But while the morning starts off in the 50s, the mercury will plummet all day long. By this afternoon, it will feel like the mid-30s with the wind.Then snow (possibly) on Saturday.Saturday Sunday The founding father \u2014 who loved New York dearly \u2014 would have turned 260 this week.You\u2019ll be able to meet and learn about a young Hamilton (well, a re-enactor) and peruse the books he used to educate himself.You can also meet Revolutionary War Hamilton \u2014 as well as George Washington \u2014 and help out at a military encampment.The event will take place on Jan. 21 at the society\u2019s DiMenna Children\u2019s History Museum on the Upper West Side.There will be no New York Today on Monday, in observance of Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday. We\u2019ll be back on Tuesday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Perpetual Revolution\u2019 Shows Artists Shaping Their Times", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewA new exhibition, \u201cPerpetual Revolution: The Image and Social Change,\u201d reflects those shifts. It\u2019s as committedly topical as anything the center has done, with sections focused on climate change, immigration, gender issues, racial turmoil, terrorism and the 2016 election. At the same time, it looks different from shows past because digital media \u2014 smartphone videos, Twitter outtakes, Instagram feeds \u2014 outnumber photographic prints.The embrace of the digital was probably inevitable for the center, an institution that clearly doesn\u2019t want to freeze into a yesterday-museum. But it necessitates a rethinking of old ideas. It requires seeing photography as part of a larger, amorphous category, one morally up for grabs, called visual culture. And it requires recognizing that in the digital present, visual culture does more than reflect reality: For better and for worse, it creates it.It pushes the use of new media even further, but in a directed way, and with nuances attributable, my guess is, to the fact that this is a group effort. The center curators Carol Squiers and Cynthia Young have led a team that includes the assistant curators Susan Carlson and Claartje van Dijk, and the adjunct curators Joanna Lehan and Kalia Brooks, with assistance from Akshay Bhoan and Quito Ziegler. Different curators handled individual sections, but everyone was working with a shared model.Other works bring cosmically scaled events down to ground level. In a mural-like collage, made from internet-sourced photos and Post-it notes, the artist Rachel Schragis reconstructs the New York People\u2019s Climate March of 2014. Instagram pictures by the Native American photographer Camille Seaman document a protest in progress against the laying of a fuel pipeline at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota.You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any relief to this grim picture, though the show comes up with one in a fanciful video by Mel Chin, shot in Paris during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, when the city was still reeling from terrorist attacks. The film makes the point that all violence \u2014 personal, ideological, environmental \u2014 is connected. And it does so through an apparitional figure: an Inuit visitor who drives a sled pulled by French poodles through Paris parks and insists that the earth\u2019s condition, though dire, is reparable if people will lay down their arms and work together.It\u2019s a spirit lifter to encounter Mr. Orfahli (and infuriating to think that if he\u2019d arrived on American shores under our newly proposed refugee policies, he might have been turned away). Yet my eye kept returning to conventional photographs hung or projected on the gallery wall: to black-and-white images of people trying to flee war-torn Europe in the 1930s and \u201940s, by Robert Capa and Ruth Gruber; and 2015 pictures of Middle Eastern refugees arriving, exhausted and shaken, in Greece, by Daniel Etter and Sergey Ponomarev.Is my partly unconscious preference for the still picture simply the result of long-established habits of looking? Or is there another, resistant factor involved? When I look at moving images, my viewing time and pace is predetermined; I\u2019m on someone else\u2019s clock. When I look at a photograph, I\u2019m on my own clock. I see an image, but I also have the option of contemplating it, living in it, savoring its details, thinking it through.The show picks up on the bottom level of the center\u2019s duplex space, with nearly three dozen photographs in a section called \u201cBlack Lives (Have Always) Mattered.\u201d These pictures are from the center\u2019s collection and constitute a capsule tour of African-American history from before the Civil War to the 1960s.It\u2019s a story of heroes (Marian Anderson, Elizabeth Eckford) and horrors (an 1863 shot of a man\u2019s whip-scarred back; a 1968 picture of a Black Panthers\u2019 office window pierced by police bullets). It\u2019s also about everyday African-American life, intrinsically political and captured in images of 19th-century cotton field workers; World War I soldiers; black members of the South Carolina legislature during Reconstruction.And the chronicle is brought up to date in three strong video pieces connected to the Black Lives Matter movement. One, by the collective HowDoYouSayYaminAfrican?, is a solid wall of images, playing on 32 stacked monitors, related to the killing of Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo. Another is a set of digital memorials to Philando Castile, who was also killed by a white officer, compiled by the Minnesota website Pollen Midwest. And the third video, by Sheila Pree Bright, layers old and recent documentary material, including Ms. Simone\u2019s interview, to make a case for a new black civil rights movement. And that movement overlaps with another, explored in an adjoining section called \u201cThe Fluidity of Gender.\u201dThe ethnic variety of this section is wide, as suggested by hashtags like #queerappalachia and #QueerMuslim. And the degree, and kind, of self-invention is dizzying, and contagious.Unsurprisingly, this sense of openness bumps up hard against the show\u2019s penultimate section, \u201cPropaganda and the Islamic State,\u201d which consists of ISIS promotional videos. Designed for internet distribution, they\u2019re complicated and artful. They, too, play with self-invention and theater, but with the aim of hammering down, rather than loosening up, utopian possibilities.It\u2019s oppressive stuff, installed, as if for maximum discretion, like a traditional photography display: a line of small, harmless-looking framed things \u2014 video screens in this case \u2014 on the wall. Oppressive, too, is the exhibition\u2019s coda, \u201cThe Right-Wing Fringe and the 2016 Election.\u201d With Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as the primary platforms for its racist and misogynistic images, it suggests two things.At the moment, the shaping power is up for grabs by opposing revolutions, one led by the White House, the other by feet in the street. The street needs to take visual culture \u2014 including photography \u2014 and make it its own, right now. This is where artists come in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Love and Black Lives, in Pictures Found on a Brooklyn Street", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byOne night six years ago, on a quiet side street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, I came across a photo album that had been put out with the trash. I lived around the corner, and I was walking home when I saw it sitting beneath a streetlamp on Lincoln Place.It looked handmade, with a wooden cover bound with a shoelace. But it had been tied up with twine, like a bunch of old newspapers, and left atop a pile of recycling.After hesitating a moment, I picked it up and took it home.The pages were fragile, and they cracked when I turned them, as if the album hadn\u2019t been opened in a long time, but the photos were perfectly preserved. They seemed to chronicle the life of a black couple at midcentury: a beautiful woman with a big smile and a man who looked serious, or was maybe just camera-shy, and had served in World War II.As I turned the pages, the scenery changed from country picnics to city streets and crowded dance halls in what appeared to be Harlem, and the couple went from youth to middle age. Looking at the album, I was struck by how joyful the photos were \u2014 and by the fact that as fabled as this era was, I had never seen a black family\u2019s own account of that time.I wondered who these neighbors were, and who had thrown the album out.For decades, this part of Crown Heights had been mostly black. When I arrived in the neighborhood, several years before, I was one of the few nonblack residents on the block. The neighborhood was changing, though; newcomers were arriving and longtime residents were moving out.I went back to Lincoln Place, hoping to find the album\u2019s owner; it had surely been thrown out by mistake. Lincoln Place was the very image of old Brooklyn promoted by real estate agents. On other blocks, the houses were carved up or crumbling. Or they had been torn down and replaced by big buildings with spotlights and no-loitering signs. But on Lincoln Place, the stately rowhouses were still intact and well loved. The block was preserved in amber.I knocked on doors and left my number, but I never heard from anyone. So I put the album on my bookshelf. A few years later, my landlords got an offer they couldn\u2019t refuse, and my short time in Crown Heights was up. I stumbled upon the album while packing and pulled it off the shelf. Now I really had to reckon with it.I decided to uncover its story. I thought it would be simple. But chasing the album would become something of a journey, one that would take me far from present-day Brooklyn to the Jim Crow South, from a remote island in the Pacific to the packed tenements of Harlem, before returning me to Lincoln Place at another moment of great change.Last spring, I began the search.The photos were arranged on black blotter-paper pages with little mounting corners and Scotch tape that had turned yellow with age. There were 167 pictures, and they covered both sides of the pages, as if to save space. But the photos stopped about halfway through the album. The rest of it was blank.I looked behind every photo, but there were only a few clues, handwritten notes like \u201cFrom your old pal Duke,\u201d \u201cMyself and Sylvia\u201d or \u201cLove to Etta Mae, From Dorothy.\u201dThe name Etta Mae was written on three or four photos, and I began to suspect she was the woman who appeared throughout the album. She had a full figure and elegant hands. She smoked. But I always spotted her by her smile.She was often with the same man. They were embracing, or they were in separate photos on the same page. I guessed that he was her husband; on one photo, someone had written, \u201cTo my best friend\u2019s hubby.\u201dCarrying photocopies of a few pictures, I went back to Crown Heights.I had been gone less than two years, but there were all sorts of changes. On Nostrand Avenue, a West Indian market that had carried buckets of salt cod had closed. Where once the only coffee had come in yellow cans of Bustelo, cafes served locally roasted espresso. There was a retro cocktail bar.On Lincoln Place, a for-sale sign hung outside one house, and another was under renovation. There was a Pilates studio. There were more young families now, and when I asked them about the album as they swept the sidewalk or sat on their stoops, they apologized: They were new to the block and couldn\u2019t help.One evening, I was close to giving up when a young man in a garden apartment told me to talk to Jimmy, the oldest guy on the block. He pointed to a red house a few doors down.An old man answered the door. Yes, he said, he was Jimmy \u2014 James Burton. I showed him the photocopied pictures, and he squinted. \u201cThat\u2019s Mrs. Taylor,\u201d he said. \u201cEtta Mae.\u201dThe man in the pictures was her husband, Isaiah Taylor. Everyone called him Ike, Mr. Burton said. The Taylors had lived on Lincoln Place forever. He pointed next door, at a white house with classical molding.When I returned to Lincoln Place a few days later with the whole album, Mr. Burton and his wife, Lenore, were doing a puzzle at a card table. \u201cYou say you just found this album on the street?\u201d she asked, laughing. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t touch it. I\u2019m amazed you would touch it.\u201d\u201cWould you pick it up?\u201d she asked her husband.\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said.They were in their late 80s. Ms. Burton had worked as a bookkeeper, and Mr. Burton had been a chauffeur and a shipping clerk. They had lived on Lincoln Place since the early 1950s, and raised their two daughters there.The Taylors had been their neighbors and close friends, almost like family.\u201cIn those days, we knew most everybody, and then they started disappearing and dying and moving away,\u201d Mr. Burton said. \u201cNow I\u2019m lucky if I know 10 people.\u201dWe sat on the couch and opened the album. Pages had torn loose from the binding, and as we passed them between us, black flakes fluttered to the floor.\u201cNo, no,\u201d Mr. Burton said, peering at the faces to see if he recognized anyone. \u201cEtta and Ike. That\u2019s all I know is them two.\u201dHalfway through, we came to a page crowded with small pictures.Mr. Burton paused.\u201cThat looks like me,\u201d he said, his voice a little louder. \u201cYour mother, Uncle Fernando \u2014 that\u2019s my wedding.\u201dI was hooked. Now that I had names, I enlisted a researcher at The New York Times, Susan C. Beachy, and she pulled documents for Etta Mae Taylor: census records; birth, death and marriage certificates; old phone books; newspaper clippings.Etta Mae didn\u2019t have children. Her siblings had all died. But she had relatives scattered across the country.The Burtons remembered a niece from North Carolina, and the researcher found someone in Raleigh named Joann Barnes. She was now in her 70s. For months, the only other thing I knew about her was that she didn\u2019t pick up her phone.I didn\u2019t blame her. \u201cHello,\u201d I would say when I left voice mail messages, \u201cI\u2019m calling about a photo album that may have belonged to your family.\u201d Even as I said it, I knew it sounded like a scam.I tried her relatives, calling, sending emails and friendly Facebook messages, but always with the same result: silence.The documents, at least, gave me the beginnings of Etta Mae\u2019s story.The first pages in the album seemed to be of Wilson; several photos had stamps from photographers\u2019 studios there. There were portraits of women in flouncy dresses, babies, a boy with a dog, a group in straw hats in a field.In two portraits placed side by side, a middle-aged couple posed by a flowering bush, in front of a clapboard house. I wondered if they were Etta Mae\u2019s parents.Etta Mae\u2019s mother, Anna Bell Green Barnes, was born in Virginia and worked as a hanger at a tobacco company, the documents revealed. Her father, James Frank Barnes, was a grocery store clerk. His family went back generations in Wilson County.Etta Mae left school after seventh grade and went to work as a housekeeper in a private home, according to the 1940 census. That year, 10 other people were living at the Barneses\u2019, including an aunt; an adopted daughter; Etta Mae\u2019s sister Mildred; Mildred\u2019s husband, Jack Artis; and their baby, Charles.In 1940, Etta Mae left her crowded home. But she didn\u2019t go north just yet. She went to Suffolk, Va., where, according to her marriage license, she wed Isaiah Taylor on the day after her 22nd birthday.Ike Taylor was three years younger than Etta Mae, and when they married, he had recently graduated from high school and was working as a deliveryman. His father was a cook. His mother worked at a peanut processing plant.The Taylors\u2019 wedding announcement in a local paper said, \u201cThe couple will reside here.\u201d But in 1941, the United States entered World War II, and farm work had grown scarce amid an agriculture crisis. Hundreds of thousands of black Southerners rushed to enlist, and Ike was one of them.There were about a dozen photographs from the war in the album, loose snapshots tucked in the back. They showed black soldiers amid spindly trees and what looked like Japanese shrines.On Tinian, they lived apart from the white soldiers. They slept in tents in a separate camp, ate separately and drank from water tanks that they filled, separately, from a mountain spring.These men may have enlisted in the army to escape Jim Crow, but instead they found themselves on a tropical island in the Pacific that had become a replica of the segregated South.This was where records trailed off. To go any further, I needed a guide.One night in the fall, I found one. I got a Facebook message from someone in Wilson named Craig Barnes Jr., whom I had written to months before. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just seeing this now,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you still have that photo?\u201dI replied immediately with a smiley face. \u201cI have the entire album!\u201dOver the phone, Mr. Barnes, 25, said that he was related to Etta Mae, but that he didn\u2019t know much about her; the person to talk to was his grandmother, Joann Barnes \u2014 the woman in Raleigh who hadn\u2019t taken my calls. He promised to set up a conversation, but weeks went by. When we finally spoke, he had bad news: She wasn\u2019t answering the phone.But that was all I had. So a week later, I boarded a flight for Raleigh, the album in my bag.I met up with a photographer and we drove to the last listed address for Ms. Barnes: a retirement complex in a low-slung apartment building surrounded by trees.I was unsure if she even lived there, much less how she would feel about my visit, and as we approached, I felt nervous for the first time. I had come all this way, and though I thought the album was important, maybe I was just intruding.I pressed the buzzer and identified myself over the intercom as a reporter from New York. After a long moment, a woman\u2019s voice crackled through the speaker.\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll buzz you in, dear.\u201dAs we walked down the hall toward her apartment, Ms. Barnes stepped out from her door, as if she planned to give us only a minute. She had short gray hair and wore a floral-print blouse.\u201cAre you a relative of Etta Mae Taylor?\u201d I asked.\u201cYes, I was her niece,\u201d she said.I explained, quickly, how I had met the Burtons, that they had told me Etta Mae\u2019s name and that I should look for her niece.\u201cO.K.,\u201d she said.\u201cAnd, well,\u201d I said, \u201cbasically, I found this on the street.\u201dI held out the album.She gave a surprised laugh. I laughed too, with relief.\u201cYou know, it kind of makes you leery,\u201d Ms. Barnes said. She had gotten my messages, and her grandson\u2019s, but she was skeptical because she had never seen her aunt\u2019s photo album.She invited us in. Her apartment was small and neat. She had been cleaning, and after she washed her hands, we sat down. She was from Wilson, she said, but she left when she was young and spent nearly 30 years in New York, where she was a visiting nurse.She opened the album.\u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are from way back.\u201dShe spotted her grandparents \u2014 Etta Mae\u2019s parents \u2014 in front of the clapboard house in Wilson where she, too, had grown up. There, in the yard, they played horseshoes and caught pigeons.She named her aunts and uncles and cousins. \u201cAnd that\u2019s me,\u201d she said, touching a photo of a little girl.\u201cI always liked this picture. I believe my father made this skirt. He used to make clothes for me when I was small. And I always had those big bows.\u201dShe shook her head and smiled.\u201cLittle knock knees,\u201d she said.Wilson was about an hour\u2019s drive east. The downtown was deserted, the brick warehouses the only remnant of the tobacco era. Across the tracks, the house where Etta Mae grew up had been torn down. In the empty lot where it once stood, there was no trace of the family that had become so real to me. A pickup was parked in the overgrown grass.Most of Etta Mae\u2019s family had left Wilson and scattered, but Craig Barnes Jr. was still there. We met up at an Applebee\u2019s off the highway. I thanked him for writing to me and handed him the album.As he turned the pages, I said I had never seen a black family\u2019s photos from this era. He said he hadn\u2019t either.\u201cThe lifestyle they\u2019re living looks amazing,\u201d he said.\u201cNew York was the place to be,\u201d Ms. Barnes said.From the time she was little, Ms. Barnes would take the train every year to visit the Taylors. \u201cI was a Southern girl; I used to go every summer with my grandmother,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I would see them dressed up, it was exciting. Like these were some movie stars or something.\u201dOf her two aunts, Ms. Barnes said, Etta Mae was the serious one. \u201cMae thought she was the boss. She always thought she was smarter than everybody else. She was always saying, \u2018Sister, you shouldn\u2019t do that; Sister, you should.\u2019\u201dBut she loved to dance, Ms. Barnes said. \u201cAnd she could sing, too.\u201dThe photos speak to the glamour of life in Harlem, but they barely hint at its struggles. Housing discrimination largely confined black people to Harlem, and in the 1940s, as more Southern migrants surged into the city, its blocks became some of the most densely populated in the world. Landlords charged high rents and let their buildings fall into ruin. They knew their tenants had nowhere else to go.Etta Mae and her sister lived in a packed tenement on West 116th Street. Their brother Charles, who in the album looks dashing in a dark suit with a pocket square, worked as a deliveryman for a florist, and shared his apartment on 131st Street with his wife and seven lodgers from the South.In the middle of the album was a series of oversize portraits of couples gathered around bottle-strewn tables in night clubs. I couldn\u2019t figure out where they were taken until a clue cropped up in an old newspaper: Ike was listed among the members of the Eight Chaps Social Club, a men\u2019s club composed of Suffolkians that was hosting a dance in Harlem.Seven of the Chaps were dead now, but the eighth picked up the phone.\u201cIsaiah Taylor?\u201d Walter Howell, 95, said. Of course he remembered him. \u201cGood buddy of mine.\u201dHe told me the photos were, indeed, from the club\u2019s dances. They look glamorous, but all of the Chaps, Mr. Howell said, had blue-collar jobs. He had worked in a fur-dressing plant preparing minks and sables.Then he answered a question that hadn\u2019t occurred to me, which was why the Taylors had such a dazzling record of their social life. The reason was that one member of the club, Jesse Williams, was a professional photographer.\u201cThat informal network is how you access news about where you can move,\u201d Professor Wilder said, \u201cwhere black people are moving and welcome.\u201dCrown Heights was predominantly white at the time. And when Etta Mae and Ike moved to Lincoln Place around 1950, renting a room from a black hairdresser named Lucille Stewart, they became some of the first black residents on the block.The Burtons, the neighbors whose wedding photos were in the album, came soon after. \u201cWe were about the second blacks on the block,\u201d Lenore Burton said.Ms. Burton\u2019s parents, Clara and Cannon Harper, moved into the white house with the classical molding, with their daughter Jackie. After they got married, the Burtons bought the red house next door.Etta Mae and Ike soon moved into the third floor of the Harpers\u2019 white house, and the two households became like one.Etta Mae\u2019s album captures their communal life: They shared meals, gave each other haircuts, gathered in the kitchen in their bathrobes.Ms. Burton\u2019s sister, Jackie Jones, still lives in the white house that she grew up in and eventually inherited from her parents. On one of my visits to the Burtons\u2019, she appeared, magically, in their living room: Back in the 1950s, they had installed a door between their homes. \u201cAll the families were intertwined more or less, though they weren\u2019t blood relations,\u201d Ms. Jones, 89, said.The picture the Burtons painted of the 1950s was a happy one. And it took me a moment to step back and see the obvious: During this time, as black people arrived on Lincoln Place, white families were leaving.It was a sign of what was coming. In the next decades, hundreds of thousands of white families would leave the city, and black families would move into their homes, a phenomenon that came to be known as white flight.In 1950, the Taylors\u2019 census tract was 95 percent white. By 1970, it was 87 percent black. White flight is often associated with the poverty and crime that plagued New York City in the later decades of the 20th century, and conjures images of muggings, abandoned buildings and urban blight.But these photos too were images of the white-flight era: People posing beside a 1950s television console, a man at a piano, a sunny picnic.The Burtons pointed out a few houses on Lincoln Place where old-timers still lived. A neighbor, Marilyn LeGall, 72, grew up visiting her aunt and uncle on Lincoln Place. \u201cYou played stickball, you jumped rope,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone looked after the other.\u201dThat was life on Lincoln Place, said Arthur Bates Jr., 56, who grew up on the block. \u201cIt was a real neighborhood, and a black experience no one talks about, because it wasn\u2019t filled with drugs and it wasn\u2019t filled with poverty,\u201d Mr. Bates said. \u201cIt was public schools, it was playing ball, it was playing music.\u201dNow, he added, everyone was discovering brownstone Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s been sitting here, like so many aspects of our lives. People say, \u2018It\u2019s dripping with original details.\u2019 Who do you think maintained it? Where were you?\u201dEtta Mae and Ike settled down on Lincoln Place after a decade of war and uncertainty and living in cramped quarters in Harlem.Etta Mae kept working in the garment district. She went bargain hunting on Flatbush Avenue for outfits and nice furniture for their apartment. She joined a book club.Ike got dogs \u2014 and cars. \u201cA blue Chevy,\u201d Mr. Burton recalled.On the weekends, they would go to their dances, and Mildred came over. They drank cocktails and listened to records. \u201cThey were good-times folks,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cYou could come and sit and drink and smoke and laugh. They loved to laugh.\u201dThey traveled, driving south to see one of Ike\u2019s sisters in Washington, and to their hometowns. In the 1960s, they went on cruises.New York gave them a good life. And if it was lived in the shadow of white flight, it was a life they never could have had in the South.Ike\u2019s niece, Brenda Oliver, 67, remembered her aunt arriving in Virginia wearing pretty clothes, smelling good. Ms. Oliver\u2019s mother was a maid. \u201cMy mom lived in a house with a coal stove. She was so impressed that her siblings had gotten out of the South and made a life for themselves.\u201dIn their later years, Ike and Etta Mae look content. In one photo, they stand beside each other, she in a dress, he in a suit. She is giving him a knowing little smile. His arm is around her shoulder. It is the last photo of the two of them together.On Aug. 5, 1971, Ike died of cancer. He was 50.After he died, Etta Mae stopped keeping the album. That was why half of the pages were blank.Etta Mae stayed on Lincoln Place. She took care of children for working couples, recalled the Burtons\u2019 daughter, Carol Burton, 58. Etta Mae got books in the mail, never putting them on the shelf until they were read. She went to church every Sunday, at Berean Baptist nearby. She took in relatives once or twice, for brief spells, but otherwise lived alone.I found former residents of Lincoln Place. They remembered Etta Mae, but not as the young woman in the album. \u201cShe was always an old lady,\u201d Sherrie Tanner Hammonds, 47, said. She grew up on the block with her grandmother, Ms. Stewart, the hairdresser, and now lives in Rochester. \u201cShe always had a small dog. She had a little set schedule. She would walk morning and night.\u201d\u201cRain or shine,\u201d said Constance P. Jermin, 83, who left Lincoln Place for Georgia in 2002. \u201cShe was very deliberate and devoted. And she always greeted everyone. Always with a big smile.\u201dFor a few years, Etta Mae and I shared the block. Our bedroom windows looked out on the same backyards, and every day, she must have walked past my house, though I can\u2019t recall if I ever actually saw her.When she could no longer get around, Ms. Jones, her landlady, took care of her. \u201cShe was feisty,\u201d said Ms. Jones, who said she never raised her rent from $200. \u201cShe was good until the end.\u201dThe end was swift. In 2010, Etta Mae fell and went to the hospital, and from there, to a nursing home in East New York, Brooklyn. She died there, five long miles from Lincoln Place, on June 4, 2011. She was 92.Etta Mae\u2019s funeral program ends, \u201cEtta lived a full life.\u201d It was all in the album: the Great Migration, Harlem at its most chaotic and crowded, the transformation of Brooklyn.For her neighbors on Lincoln Place, Etta Mae\u2019s album brought back happy memories of their first years on the block, but it did not stop the clock from ticking. In October, Lenore Burton died. Her widower, James Burton, plans to stay in their home on Lincoln Place.For Etta Mae\u2019s family, the album helped fill the void left by relatives who moved to the North. They let me hold onto the album until the publication of this article.I had one last question: How did the album end up on the curb?After her aunt died, Joann Barnes came from Raleigh to arrange the funeral in Brooklyn. She hadn\u2019t been to Lincoln Place in years and was surprised by how little her aunt\u2019s home had changed. She had moved into the back rooms and left the rest untouched.Everything was from the 1950s \u2014 the kitchen sink and cabinets, the furniture in the living room, which was covered in plastic. In Ike\u2019s old office, there was a record player, hundreds of records, and a shelf with glasses and little stirrers, the remnants of his bar.The closets were stuffed with linens and old clothes. When she went to dry her hands after washing them in the bathroom, the hand towel was so old it split in two. She was tired from the funeral, and overwhelmed. She just wanted to get home.She packed up some wedding dishes for her sister, a few pots and pans. For herself, she took some change from a drawer. \u201cA silver dollar, some old coins,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just me. I have my memory of her and our trips and what we did together. I\u2019m not a keeper.\u201dAs she got ready to go, Ms. Jones came in. \u201cShe asked me if I was coming back,\u201d Ms. Barnes said, \u201cand I said no. \u2018Open the doors and let the neighbors come and take what they want. Just open it up.\u2019\u201dIn the weeks afterward, Ms. Jones worked her way through the apartment. She bagged up the clothes. She pulled the records off the shelf. She boxed up Etta Mae\u2019s books. When she found the album, she tied it up with twine. And one evening, before the trucks came to pick up the recycling, she carried it outside with a few boxes and left it on the curb.A few minutes, or a few hours, passed. Then, just as Etta Mae had walked past my house so many times before, I walked by hers, picked up her album and carried it home.Advertisement"}

And for several reasons, that\u2019s going to be harder in this presidency than ever before.Of course time will bring a certain clarity. We\u2019ll find out whether Trump\u2019s refugee and visa freezes from Muslim countries are actually temporary, a means to stricter screening, or whether they become permanent. We\u2019ll move from speculation to reality on Russia policy. We\u2019ll find out how far the president intends to run with the voter-fraud nonsense. We\u2019ll see how often his angry tweets and behind-the-scenes obsessions cash out, and how often they\u2019re just a way of venting.I ended last week\u2019s column with a warning for the press corps, about their potential contribution to a climate of political hysteria. But this column\u2019s warning is for the president and his advisers, some of whom clearly like the fog and seem to imagine that it will help them govern just as it probably helped them win.They shouldn\u2019t be so confident. For legislators, too much fog is paralyzing. For voters, it\u2019s a recipe for nervous exhaustion. For allies, it\u2019s confusing; for enemies, it looks like an opportunity.Trump is not a popular president, he has not actually built an electoral majority, his team is not particularly experienced. If he can\u2019t provide clarity and reassurance and a little light around his agenda, it will be very easy for a fog-bound presidency to simply run aground.Advertisement"}

Tillerson, the secretary of state nominee, cleared a key Senate hurdle to all but assure his own confirmation.Despite some shaky appearances from his nominees on Capitol Hill and often blistering Democratic opposition, Mr. Trump has thus far faced few meaningful obstacles in installing the team of his choice \u2014 aided by Senate Republicans who are eager to expedite the confirmation process.Mr. Rubio had sharply questioned Mr. Tillerson at a hearing this month, chastising him in a series of interrogations over Mr. Tillerson\u2019s equivocating testimony on human rights issues. Mr. Rubio also had left open the possibility of opposing him on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where Republicans hold a one-member majority.Several hours later, by a party-line vote of 11-10, Mr. Tillerson won the committee\u2019s recommendation. As Mr. Rubio explained his vote to reporters after the hearing, a heckler sidled up beside him with a teasing prop: a model of a spine.On Monday, Mr. Pompeo joined them, with the Senate convening to approve his selection, 66 to 32, after a debate that stretched into the evening.In their bid to confirm cabinet picks quickly, Republicans have been hamstrung at times by lax preparation from Mr. Trump\u2019s team and the sprawling financial holdings of many of his nominees, which have produced reams of ethics paperwork.Still, Democrats are powerless to stop any nominees on their own. They have sought to use the confirmation process as a showcase for what they call the extreme positions of the prospective Trump cabinet and the ethical lapses that have dogged some of his selections.\u201cI know why our Republican colleagues want to rush these nominees through,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, who has taken to calling Mr. Trump\u2019s team a \u201cswamp cabinet.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not stalling nominations,\u201d he added. \u201cThis isn\u2019t sport. This is serious stuff.\u201dSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, urged Democrats to stand down. \u201cLet\u2019s join hands and move forward,\u201d he said.Earlier, a group of Democratic senators formally requested a second hearing for Betsy DeVos, the nominee for education secretary, after an initial review of her ethics papers. They cited potential conflicts of interest and efforts by Republicans to limit questions at her hearing last week.In response to the Democrats\u2019 letter, the office of Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the committee\u2019s chairman, said there would be no second hearing, adding that Ms. DeVos had already spent more time and answered more questions than former President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees for education secretary had.Ms. DeVos is scheduled for a committee vote next week. Several other nominees are expected to be considered by other Senate committees this week, clearing the path for their confirmations. They include Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general; Ben Carson, his pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development; Wilbur L. Ross, the nominee for commerce secretary; and Elaine Chao, the nominee for transportation secretary.Hearings are scheduled on Tuesday for Representative Tom Price of Georgia, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services; Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, his choice for White House budget director; and Linda McMahon, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Small Business Administration.On Monday, the chamber\u2019s focus was on Mr. Pompeo. Though Republicans had hoped to hold the vote just after the inauguration, some Democrats objected to what they viewed as an effort to curb debate on intelligence issues.\u201cWe ought to have a debate in broad daylight, not when senators are trying to figure out if their tux is going to fit,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said at the time.Mr. Wyden continued his push on Monday, suggesting Mr. Pompeo\u2019s record conveyed \u201centhusiasm for sweeping new surveillance programs targeting Americans,\u201d among other concerns.But Mr. Pompeo did earn the support of some Democrats, limiting drama on the floor.But Mr. Rubio also seemed to feed critics\u2019 perception of him as squishy on matters of conviction, reinforcing his history of public vacillating and backtracking.He worked on immigration reform in 2013, before distancing himself from the legislation during last year\u2019s Republican primaries. He sold \u201c#NeverTrump\u201d bumper stickers on his campaign website, before announcing his support for Mr. Trump once he dropped out. He said he would not run for re-election to the Senate, weeks before revealing a change of heart.\u201cThe only thing you can consistently count on when it comes to Marco Rubio is his capacity to cave,\u201d said Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist, a conservative online publication.In his statement on Facebook, Mr. Rubio concluded with a warning: \u201cUpcoming appointments to critical posts in the Department of State are not entitled to, and will not receive from me, the same level of deference I have given this nomination.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Israeli Soldier Who Shot Wounded Palestinian Assailant Is Convicted", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The fate of just one low-ranking Israeli soldier was hanging in the balance. But for many Israelis, the guilty verdict announced on Wednesday was a critical turn in the battle for the character of the state.Prof. David Enoch, an expert in the philosophy of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said he thought the manslaughter conviction was \u201cjustified\u201d but added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure this verdict will be welcomed by many of the soldiers and much of the public.\u201dIsrael\u2019s defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, called Wednesday\u2019s decision \u201ca tough verdict.\u201d\u201cThe first thing I ask of all of us \u2014 those who like the verdict and those like me who like it much less \u2014 we are all obligated to respect the court\u2019s decision,\u201d Mr. Lieberman said. \u201cWe are obligated to maintain restraint.\u201dMr. Lieberman, as a member of the parliamentary opposition before his cabinet appointment, had attended the military court to support Sergeant Azaria and called the legal proceedings a \u201ctheater of the absurd.\u201d But on Wednesday, he said, \u201cWe must keep the army above and beyond all political argument.\u201dPoliticians to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right and left have also called for a pardon, including the education minister, Naftali Bennett, and Shelly Yacimovich of the Labor Party, who said that \u201cAzaria\u2019s shoulders are too narrow to bear the entire weight of the fissure\u201d the case has exposed.It helped shape the army\u2019s ethos. Now, some fear that in the lower ranks, it has begun to erode.In a measure of the tensions, the verdict was handed down in a special court inside the walled and heavily guarded compound of the military\u2019s headquarters in Tel Aviv, rather than in the courtroom where the trial was held, to keep demonstrators at bay.Video footage showed Sergeant Azaria smiling as he entered the courtroom to applause, and he was embraced by his family and friends. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound, shouting slogans like \u201cfree the boy.\u201dCol. Maya Heller, one of the military judges, spent more than two and a half hours delivering the verdict. She systematically rejected the main points of the defense and said there had been \u201cno justification\u201d for the shooting, according to reports from the courtroom.Describing Sergeant Azaria\u2019s telling of the event as \u201ctwisting\u201d and \u201cevolving,\u201d the judge said the defense had tried to \u201chold the rope at both ends.\u201d On one hand it asserted that the victim, Abed al-Fatah al-Sharif, appeared to pose a danger because he was still moving, and on the other it brought medical witnesses who contended that he was dead by the time Sergeant Azaria shot him in the head.The judge seemed to give great weight to statements Sergeant Azaria, a medic who was 19 at the time, made at the scene, indicating he had acted not out of fear but for revenge.A soldier testified that before the shooting, Sergeant Azaria had said, \u201cHow is it that my friend was stabbed and the terrorist is still alive?\u201d After the shooting, a commander who was at the scene recalled Sergeant Azaria saying, \u201cThe terrorist deserved to die.\u201dIlan Katz, one of Sergeant Azaria\u2019s lawyers, vowed to appeal.The military\u2019s high command had denounced the shooting immediately after it happened, calling it a grave breach of proper military conduct. But Israeli society was divided; against the backdrop of continued Palestinian attacks, many right-wing politicians and celebrities, along with Jewish parents of soldiers, hailed Sergeant Azaria as a hero.Mr. Netanyahu first condemned Sergeant Azaria\u2019s actions, then phoned the soldier\u2019s family to offer sympathy and reassurances that he would be treated fairly.Local television stations frequently showed images of Sergeant Azaria\u2019s distraught parents hugging him in court. Appealing to public sentiment in a country blighted by wars and terrorism, and where most Jewish 18-year-olds are conscripted for up to 32 months of military service, his supporters portrayed him as \u201ceverybody\u2019s child.\u201dIn remarks recorded before the verdict, the military\u2019s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, tried to puncture that narrative. \u201cAn 18-year-old in the Israeli Army is not \u2018everybody\u2019s child,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a fighter, a soldier who must dedicate his life to carry out the tasks we give him. We cannot be confused about this.\u201dThe episode began when two Palestinian men stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint in Hebron. Israeli soldiers killed one and wounded the other, Mr. Sharif, 21.Sergeant Azaria arrived at the scene about six minutes later. The video showed calm had been restored. Yet 11 minutes after the initial attack, he cocked his rifle and shot Mr. Sharif as he lay on the road.Lawyers representing Sergeant Azaria said he had acted to save his comrades, in the belief that Mr. Sharif, who was still moving, might have been concealing an explosive belt under his jacket.But Sergeant Azaria did not warn the other soldiers or the medical staff nearby to move away.Yusri al-Sharif, Mr. Sharif\u2019s father, told reporters that the verdict was \u201ca good step\u201d but that he hoped there would be no lenience in the sentencing, which is scheduled for Jan. 15.Irit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But in recent months, Ms. Atwood has been hearing from anxious readers who see eerie parallels between the novel\u2019s oppressive society and the current Republican administration\u2019s policy goals of curtailing reproductive rights.In 2016, sales of the book, which is in its 52nd printing, were up 30 percent over the previous year. Ms. Atwood\u2019s publisher has reprinted 100,000 copies in the last three months to meet a spike in demand after the election.\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is among several classic dystopian novels that seem to be resonating with readers at a moment of heightened anxiety about the state of American democracy. Sales have also risen drastically for George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d and \u201c1984,\u201d which shot to the top of Amazon\u2019s best-seller list this week.To many observers, her comment evoked Orwell\u2019s vision of a totalitarian society in which language becomes a political weapon and reality itself is defined by those in power. The remarks prompted a cascade of Twitter messages referencing Orwell and \u201c1984.\u201d According to a Twitter spokesman, the novel was referenced more than 290,000 times on the social network this week. The book began climbing Amazon\u2019s best-seller list, which in turn drove more readers to it, in a sort of algorithm-driven feedback loop. It amounted to a blizzard of free advertising for a 68-year-old novel.On Wednesday, the CNN host Van Jones read a famous passage from the novel about efforts to force citizens to \u201creject the evidence of your eyes and ears,\u201d and urged his viewers not to become complacent when faced with a barrage of falsehoods. \u201cLet\u2019s not go down the Orwellian road, and I hope that\u2019s not where Trump is trying to lead us,\u201d he said.Of course, it is not the first time that readers and pundits have invoked the novel to criticize the actions and statements of a government. It is such a standard trope that Orwell\u2019s name has become an adjective. And because so many American readers are exposed to the novel in high school or college, most people have a passing familiarity with its basic themes about the dangers of authoritarianism, and use phrases like \u201cbig brother\u201d as a shorthand to describe a multitude of things, from Google to homeland security.\u201cIt\u2019s a frame of reference that people can reach for in response to government deception, propaganda, the misuse of language, and those are things that occur all the time,\u201d said Alex Woloch, an English professor at Stanford University who has written about the roots of Orwell\u2019s political language. \u201cThere are certain things this administration is doing that has set off these alarm bells, and people are hungry for frames of reference to understand this new reality.\u201dThe sudden prominence of such novels reflects a renewed public interest in decades-old works of speculative fiction as guides for understanding our current political moment. Readers who are grappling with a jolting shift in American politics, when easily verifiable facts are subject to debate and civil liberties and democratic norms feel fragile, are turning to dystopian novels for guidance and insight.\u201cMany of these books are becoming more important to the average American reader because they want to know what\u2019s next, because we\u2019ve never been through this before,\u201d said the novelist Gary Shteyngart, author of the dystopian novel \u201cSuper Sad True Love Story. \u201cLanguage is being used to destabilize people\u2019s perception of reality, and that\u2019s very new to this country.\u201dReaders may also be returning to the comfort (if you can call it that) of familiar dystopian novels because these stories offer moral clarity at a time when it can be difficult to keep up with the convulsions of the daily news cycle, and the fire hose of information and disinformation on social media.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a feeling that nonfiction has failed us, that journalism has not been able to keep up with things,\u201d Mr. Shteyngart said.\u201cThe book has certainly been known and alluded to since its publication, but now it\u2019s really caught on because there are so many astonishing parallels to the present,\u201d said Michael Meyer, an emeritus English professor at the University of Connecticut, who wrote an introduction to the novel. \u201cIt\u2019s a satire about the politics of someone like Trump.\u201dThe novel \u201c1984\u201d is a reliable best seller \u2014 it was an instant hit when it was first published in 1949, and it continues to sell some 400,000 paperback copies in the United States annually. Still, the recent demand caught the publisher and some booksellers off guard. Signet, which publishes the mass-market paperback edition of \u201c1984,\u201d is reprinting 200,000 more copies of the book, and another 100,000 copies of \u201cAnimal Farm.\u201d (Its edition of \u201c1984\u201d is currently out of stock on Amazon.)\u201cWe\u2019re getting significant reorders from all our accounts,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cWe\u2019ve printed, just this week, about half of what we normally sell in a year.\u201dPublishers and book retailers have been quick to seize the momentum and take advantage of renewed interest in decades-old titles. The Amazon page for \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d now features a bold print quote from Salon, calling the book \u201cthe novel that foreshadowed Donald Trump\u2019s authoritarian appeal.\u201d This week, Penguin started an online advertising and social media campaign to promote \u201c1984,\u201d which included posts with quotes from the novel on Facebook and Instagram.There\u2019s perhaps another reason that readers are returning to \u201c1984\u201d and other dystopian classics during unsettling times.

They\u2019re sleeker and are considered more environmentally friendly.(Before those gas-powered carts, the park\u2019s roads were filled with giant garbage trucks that, between emissions and pedestrian hazards, did more harm than good to the park.)The electric carts that you will soon see skedaddling around the lawns, meadows and playgrounds are just the latest in a decades-long transformation of trash management.In the 1980s, when the park welcomed 12 million visitors a year, the place was filthy.But today, with 42 million guests annually, it is nearly spotless.\u201cThe public comes into the park and sees how beautiful it is, but they may take it for granted,\u201d Mr. Blonksy added. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand there\u2019s a huge team of people working here 24 hours a day to keep this place as beautiful as it is.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:The sun will also be tidying things up today.\u201cGood news for the snow haters,\u201d said Brian Ciemnecki, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. \u201cThe warmer weather will melt a lot of the snow that\u2019s left.\u201dIt\u2019s the start of a trend.Tomorrow a high of 58 is on tap.It\u2019s all temporary, of course.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Every enclave seems to produce one successful photographer. On the Lower East Side\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gay arts scene of the 1970s, Robert Mapplethorpe broke out to achieve fame and notoriety. But, there was also Peter Hujar, Mapplethorpe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prolific contemporary. He, like Mapplethorpe, depicted aspects of gay life, was an insider among a circle of famous artists and writers, and even preferred the square format. Yet his photographs, overshadowed by Mapplethorpe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, tell different stories. Now, 30 years after he died from complications of AIDS, Mr. Hujar is finally getting his due: a traveling retrospective, organized by the Morgan Library & Museum.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPart of the reason he was eclipsed was because of the great success of Mapplethorpe, who filled a niche and very spectacularly filled the image of a bad-boy photographer privy to those kinds of secrets of dark, nighttime gay lifestyle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joel Smith, curator of photography at the Morgan Library & Museum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was easy for the mainstream culture to think of him as \u00e2\u0080\u0098the other one,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098the minor one.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He did not have Mapplethorpe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knack of promoting himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Hujar\u2019s retrospective is likely to change that. Consisting of some 160 images, it will begin at the Fundaci\u00c3\u00b3n Mapfre in Barcelona this month, go to the The Hague in July, the Morgan in January of 2018, and end that fall at the Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive. A catalog published by Aperture accompanies the exhibition and includes essays by Mr. Smith, photo critic Philip Gefter, and a personal anecdote by friend and poet Steve Turtell.\u201cMapplethorpe was considered menacing and sinister because he represented sexual behavior on the edges of mainstream society so directly, and people found it horrifying,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Gefter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Hujar\u2019s work is psychologically dangerous in that he explored territory more emotionally uncomfortable.\u201dOne key difference is that Mr. Hujar printed his own work, while Mapplethorpe did not. Both explored themes of gay male desire, but Mapplethorpe\u2019s prints are as shocking as his subject matter, with piercing highlights and rich blacks. Mr. Hujar\u2019s provocation, however, hangs in his midtones. Whether the photograph is of a man in mid-orgasm or a pile of grass in Port Jefferson, Mr. Hujar\u2019s ability to achieve a certain, stormy luminosity in the darkroom is what invites the viewer to linger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe midtone is not always about pretty, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the psychological and emotional place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gary Schneider, who now prints Mr. Hujar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt becomes murkier in the gray, so that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of stuck there emotionally when you are looking at the prints.\u201d One of his most famous photographs is of Candy Darling, a transsexual icon of the Andy Warhol studio, on her deathbed. Mr. Hujar could have focused on the cancer that was killing Ms. Darling, the sickness of the scene, the glow of hospital white.  Instead, as Mr. Gefter notes in his essay, he chose to take a portrait \u00e2\u0080\u009cimbued with the glamour of a Hollywood film still.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(In contrast, as Arthur C. Danto noted in his 1998 essay, \u201cThe Naked Truth,\u201d Richard Avedon\u2019s \u00e2\u0080\u009cAndy Warhol and Members of the Factory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d depicts Candy Darling in what Danto called an \u201caggressive picture.\u201d For this group photograph, Avedon chose some men to stand naked and others clothed. All the women were clothed, though, except for Candy Darling, who with her long hair, is grouped with the naked men, her gender assignment fully revealed.) Despite Mr. Hujar\u2019s prolific talent, \u00e2\u0080\u009che could not emotionally promote himself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stephen Koch, a writer friend who inherited Mr. Hujar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire estate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe would hang up on dealers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   His bouts of anger and depression might have stemmed from an abusive childhood. His parents abandoned him. By the time his mother took him back, she was drunk most nights and eventually threw a bottle at his head, prompting him to leave for good at the age of 16. Mr. Hujar died on Thanksgiving day, in 1987, at age 53. He died so poor that, according to another friend, Fran Lebowitz, he couldn\u2019t afford to do laundry. But he seemed to have an inkling he would become famous after death. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe once said when he died he wanted two graves, one for his body and one for his work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Koch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe knew he was good, knew his work was important; he did not know how, exactly. Somewhere in him he had profound confidence in what he was doing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Justice Helping to Oversee Brazil Graft Inquiry Dies in Plane Crash", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe justice, Teori Zavascki, 68, was killed along with at least two other people traveling on a Beechcraft King Air C90 when it crashed into the Atlantic near Paraty, a town of colonial-era buildings on the coast between S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, according to Brazilian news reports.The cause of the crash was unknown as of Thursday night. The federal police have begun an investigation that will be closely watched across Brazil, given Justice Zavascki\u2019s influence in Brazil\u2019s legal system.Justice Zavascki, who had kept a low public profile since being named to the 11-member court in 2012, was responsible for some of the boldest moves in Brazil\u2019s judiciary in recent years, earning him a reputation as a judge prepared to curb abuses by influential lawmakers and business leaders.Within the court, justices were maneuvering quickly on Thursday to nominate a successor to oversee the Petrobras case, expressing concern about delays that could allow legislators to avoid going to jail. Under Brazilian law, the Supreme Court handles cases involving lawmakers and other senior politicians who enjoy special legal standing.Justice Marco Aur\u00e9lio Mello said it would be a mistake to await Mr. Temer\u2019s nomination of a new court member, which would be followed by Senate hearings that could take almost a year.The plane carrying Justice Zavascki was owned by Emiliano, a Brazilian luxury hotel operator. The owner of Emiliano, Carlos Alberto Filgueiras, 69, and the pilot of the plane, Osmar Rodrigues, 56, also died in the crash. The hotel company said in a statement that Justice Zavascki and Mr. Filgueiras were \u201cclose friends.\u201dBrazilian news outlets also reported that a woman, whose identity was not disclosed, had died.Justice Zavascki, a specialist in tax legislation before becoming a judge, was named to the court by Ms. Rousseff, who was replaced last year by Mr. Temer, her vice president.Sergio Moro, the judge overseeing much of the Petrobras inquiry, called Justice Zavascki \u201can example for all judges, prosecutors and lawyers in this country.\u201d\u201cWithout him, there would not have been the Carwash investigation,\u201d Judge Moro said.Legal scholars agreed that Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court, along with Justice Zavascki\u2019s replacement, would come under scrutiny.\u201cThis thing isn\u2019t for amateurs,\u201d said Antonio Valverde, a professor of ethics and philosophy at Catholic University in S\u00e3o Paulo, citing reports that some of Brazil\u2019s most powerful men received bribes in the Carwash inquiry. \u201cThe names in those reports are in the federal government.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Moura from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Instant Pot: Here\u2019s Why Cooks Love It", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetitePeople have fallen in love with their Instant Pots.They may like their blenders, cherish their slow cookers and need their food processors.If you\u2019re a cook and got through last year without bumping into people who couldn\u2019t stop talking about their Instant Pots \u2014 or any of the other multifunctional electric pressure cookers on the market (Breville and Cuisinart both make versions) \u2014 then you won\u2019t have to wait much longer.Electric pressure cookers is one of the fastest growing kitchen appliance sectors on the market, with sales doubling and tripling over the last four years, according to Robert Wang, the C.E.O. of Instant Pot Company.When the Instant Pot debuted in 2009, it was one of the first brands to hit North America; electric pressure cookers were already gaining popularity in China. In 2010, approximately 300,000 electric pressure cookers were sold in the United States and Canada, said Dr. Wang. By 2015, that number rose to over three million. (He declined to give exact sales figures, as did representatives from Breville and Cuisinart.)So why do electric pressure cookers inspire such a devoted following?I bought one to find out.A confession: I already own a stovetop pressure cooker, the conventional kind that you would heat over a burner and then regulate yourself. It is currently supporting a colony of dust bunnies in the back of my highest cabinet, behind the panini press. I never got over my fear of exploding split-pea soup to use it with any regularity.What makes this newest generation of electric pressure cookers different is that it is designed with a slew of self-regulating safety features, including sensors to monitor the unit\u2019s temperature and amount of pressure. All you do is plug it in and tap a button, and it does everything else. It\u2019s as user-friendly as a slow cooker \u2014 except that it gets dinner on the table a day or so faster.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Paleo or vegan or just trying to eat better, pressure cooking is the answer for healthy fast food,\u201d Ms. Sass said.After cooking a pork shoulder in the electric pressure cooker, I could easily see why the appliance has struck a chord, with the Paleo community in particular: It cooks large hunks of meat superbly and speedily. After a mere 90 minutes, the meat was spoon tender and deeply flavored, even before I covered the soft shreds with spicy barbecue sauce. The same recipe made in my slow cooker took seven hours, and the meat wasn\u2019t quite as uniformly juicy.It was that pork shoulder that turned me into a believer.Lamb shanks were velvety soft in 40 minutes, short ribs fell off the bone in 30, and spare ribs were porky perfection in 20 minutes.Perhaps most convenient, the collagen-rich beef bone broth that took two days to cook down in my slow cooker was ready in an afternoon, without making the whole house smell like soup (which is nice for the first couple of hours but then gets really old).But the electric pressure cooker does have its shortcomings. The most notable failure in the meat category was the whole chicken. The recipes I tested came out with slack and soggy skin, and either stringy and dry white meat or undercooked dark meat. I did have more success with sake-steamed skinless chicken breasts, which were evenly cooked and perfumed with the delicate rice wine and fresh ginger. A nice dish, though how often does one really want to eat steamed skinless chicken breasts?I didn\u2019t like it much for vegetables either, most of which don\u2019t benefit from the intense pressure of high-heat steam (beets and artichokes being the important exceptions here). Broccoli, kale, zucchini, fennel, brussels sprouts and mushrooms turned limp and unappealing.They also took longer to cook than if I had used a skillet on the stove. The manual tells you an ingredient only needs, say, five minutes to cook, but that doesn\u2019t take into account the 10 to 15 minutes required for the machine to build pressure, in addition to the time needed to release the pressure, which brings the total to around 20 minutes. I can do a lot of great things to vegetables with a skillet, some olive oil and garlic in 20 minutes. In general, this is a good rule of thumb: If something takes 20 minutes or less to cook conventionally on the stove, use the stove.Another pressure cooker downside: They just don\u2019t do crisp or crunchy. Although most cookers allow you to brown meats and vegetables on the saut\u00e9 function before cooking, any crunchy bits will wilt under the pressurized steam once you lock on the lid. Though I might use the pressure cooker for potatoes if I were going to mash them, I would never be able to achieve anything like the crisp-edged roasted potatoes I can get in the oven. And in the future, I\u2019ll stick to roasting my whole chickens, so I can crunch on the shards of browned, salty skin.The key to pressure cooker happiness is choosing recipes in which softness and succulence is the goal, and which traditionally take hours to get there.For example, I\u2019ll never go back to a Dutch oven for chili, which I made in the electric pressure cooker in an hour starting from dried beans.\u201cPeople want to use their pressure cookers for everything, but they\u2019re better for some things than others,\u201d Ms. Sass said. \u201cStick to soups, stews, beans and risotto. It makes fabulous risotto.\u201dI also like the machine for polenta, which eliminates the stirring (and the splatters of molten blobs).I also tried out some of the other functions, including the slow cooker, rice cooker and yogurt maker settings. The unit worked as well as my separate, stand-alone slow cooker, though I can see a future in which I pressure-cook more, and slow-cook less; the results are similar, but one is a whole lot faster. For cooking rice, I preferred both the brown and white rice I made in my separate rice cooker. The pressure cooker was faster, but the rice a bit heavier and chewier. And for yogurt, which I\u2019d gotten into the habit of making every other week on the stove, I have to admit that the machine worked like a dream.So after all that cooking, did I fall in love with the electric pressure cooker?It takes up a lot of space, it\u2019s not at all intuitive, and I hate not being able to check on my food as it cooks. But even so, I don\u2019t plan on giving mine up anytime soon.My friend Robin, who bought an Instant Pot six month ago, summed it up well.\u201cI\u2019m out of the honeymoon phase,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we\u2019re settling into a relationship. And I\u2019ve accepted its limitations, like the fact that there\u2019s no reason to ever make oatmeal or rice in it. But between the lamb stew and the butternut squash soup, I know we will be together forever.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "7 Young People on Their Views of Gender", "Date": null, "News": "Supported byAbout\u00a0two\u00a0years ago, I began photographing transgender and\u00a0\u201cgender-expansive\u201d\u00a0children and young adults\u00a0in the United States and Europe. I wanted to ask this question: \u201cWho are we beyond ideas tied to our gender?\u201d The answer is critical\u00a0not only to\u00a0the transgender community, I believe, but to\u00a0everyone.In the younger participants, I have found self-assuredness and confidence; they are clear about who they are. In the older youths \u2014 especially the\u00a0nonbinary\u00a0ones who identify as both genders, or neither \u2014 I see a willingness to break free from boxes society puts us into. In all of them, there is creativity and compassion for peers and strangers alike.Below are some pictures and brief thoughts that a few participants have shared with me, condensed for clarity and space.\u201cI asked my mom if I could text her something. I texted her that I am attracted to boys and that I feel more girl than boy. Later that year, I found the term nonbinary. It just felt right. I still am often scared of the reactions of people when I tell them.\u201cAs a trans person who has experienced hate, I want people to understand that nobody deserves to be hated. Everyone deserves love, regardless of race, gender, sexuality.\u201d\u201cI want to make sure the world does not take as long as it did to be open to gay and bi people. I hope that I am able to help girls like me, so they don\u2019t go through what I did. I want to slay the gods 100 times over doing things that trans girls have never done. I want to be the face of equality.\u201d\u201cAfter coming out, I had huge dysphoria and struggled hugely leaving the house and speaking when I was out in public. There were moments when I would feel like I was doing the right thing and moments I thought I was going crazy. Gradually over time I started to feel the benefits of being truthful to myself.\u201cLiving in a body that you feel doesn\u2019t fully belong to you yet is extremely painful, but dealing with people who think you are disgusting and sick is mentally draining....I understand that my gender does not define me or who I am. I refuse to let gender roles and female-male privilege control me.\u201cI am perfectly imperfect. And proud.\u201d\u201cWhen I was 12, I realized that transgender was a thing. It made sense. I\u2019m straight \u2014 I\u2019m a straight guy in a girl\u2019s body.\u201cI had very distorted expectations, though, and thought that I would be able to have hormones and operations straightaway. The process is too long. I hate looking like this, I hate the body that I have. I want it to transform, and it is wrong that I have to wait until I\u2019m an adult.\u201d\u201cWhile other kids are developing, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re either on hormone blockers or you don\u2019t know what to do yet. Also, nobody really has a crush on you, because they think you\u2019re weird or different because they think you\u2019re really not the gender you are.\u201cAt the end of the day, people can say what they want about you, but the only voice that matters to you is yours. They just don\u2019t struggle with the things we struggle with.\u201d\u201cI feel most comfortable in the space between the gender binary, a space where I\u2019m allowed to construct my own ideas of gender and gender expression. That means I feel more masculine than feminine. For many, this is a hard concept to understand.\u201cGender still baffles me, and I didn\u2019t grow up seeing it the way others do. I can\u2019t say I now understand gender on a personal level, but I have a better understanding of it on a societal and institutional level. Trans identities expose the underpinnings of gender in ways that our society often deems as dangerous.________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Data Could Be the Next Tech Hot Button for Regulators", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byWealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on.Now data \u2014 gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations \u2014 is increasingly a focus of technology competition. And academics and some policy makers, especially in Europe, are considering whether big internet companies like Google and Facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation.In recent years, Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion, privacy or antitrust investigations. But in the coming years, who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in American tech giants.As government regulators dig into this new era of data competition, they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make. Using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit, for example. And higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services.The competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990s about software and Microsoft. The worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers, and gather more data, a powerful \u201cnetwork effect\u201d effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform, like Google in search or Facebook in consumer social networks.Evidence of the rising importance of data can be seen from the frontiers of artificial intelligence to mainstream business software. And certain data sets can be remarkably valuable for companies working on those technologies.Microsoft is betting LinkedIn, combined with data on how hundreds of millions of workers use its Office 365 online software, and consumer data from search behavior on Bing, will \u201cpower a set of insights that we think is unprecedented,\u201d said James Phillips, vice president for business applications at Microsoft.IBM estimates that 70 percent of the world\u2019s data is not out on the public web, but in private databases, often to protect privacy or trade secrets. IBM\u2019s strategy is to take the data it has acquired, add customer data and use that to train its Watson artificial intelligence software to pursue such tasks as helping medical researchers discover novel disease therapies, or flagging suspect financial transactions for independent auditors.\u201cOur focus is mainly on nonpublic data sets and extending that advantage for clients in business and science,\u201d said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s Watson and cloud businesses.At Google, the company\u2019s drive into cloud-delivered business software is fueled by data, building on years of work done on its search and other consumer services, and its recent advances in image identification, speech recognition and language translation.For example, a new Google business offering \u2014 still in the test, or alpha, stage \u2014 is a software service to improve job finding and recruiting. Its data includes more than 17 million online job postings and the public profiles and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of more than 200 million people.Its machine-learning algorithms distilled that to about four million unique job titles, ranked the most common ones and identified specific skills. The job sites CareerBuilder and Dice are using the Google technology to show job seekers more relevant openings. And FedEx, the giant package shipper, is adding the service to its recruiting site.That is just one case, said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google\u2019s cloud business, of what is becoming increasingly possible \u2014 using the tools of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, to sift through huge quantities of data to provide machine-curated data services.\u201cYou can turn this technology to whatever field you want, from manufacturing to medicine,\u201d Ms. Greene said.Fei-Fei Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is taking a sabbatical to become chief scientist for artificial intelligence at Google\u2019s cloud unit.

{"Headline": "Alphabet\u2019s Profits Stay Predictably Good in a Volatile Industry", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It is almost boring how predictably good Alphabet\u2019s earnings are these days \u2014 a trait not always shared by the company\u2019s tech conglomerate peers.But fourth-quarter results announced on Thursday from Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, proved once again that the company is the model of moneymaking consistency.The heart of Alphabet\u2019s consistent earnings remains the company\u2019s search engine. While a consumer can delay an iPhone purchase or shop somewhere other than Amazon, Google\u2019s search engine is an indispensable tool for anyone using the internet. The shift to mobile devices, once considered a threat to Google\u2019s search business, has only strengthened it.Google\u2019s market share on desktop search is around 78 percent, but it is above 90 percent on mobile devices, according to research from NetMarketShare.com. What is more, on smaller mobile displays, Google\u2019s ads occupy a large portion of the screen \u2014 making it more likely a user will click on them.Clicks on Google ads increased 36 percent in the quarter, but what advertisers paid for each click decreased 15 percent.Google is also sitting on many of the internet\u2019s most valuable properties \u2014 the places where people go to stay in touch on email, find driving directions or seek out entertainment.While clicks on Google\u2019s ads across the internet are rising, they are growing faster on its own websites like YouTube. Alphabet does not break out results for YouTube, but the site continues to amass a huge audience. Google said more than a billion people watched YouTube every month, viewing hundreds of millions of hours of its videos every day.Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said company assets like search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play, constituted \u201cprime time in the mobile era.\u201dEven Alphabet\u2019s unexpected hiccups are a little dull. The company\u2019s earnings per share were $7.56, or 11 cents below analysts\u2019 estimates. It said the reason for the shortfall was that it paid more in taxes. The company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 percent, compared with 5 percent in the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet said it paid more in United States taxes but did not explain why.Alphabet shares were down 2 percent in after-hours trading. The stock reached a record high on Wednesday.While the dominance of the Google search engine seems unassailable today, Alphabet is investing heavily in new technologies that may threaten its stronghold. Devices like the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated smart speaker, portend a future where artificially intelligent digital assistants fetch information without needing to access a search engine directly.Google did not provide figures for how those products sold, but the \u201cother revenue\u201d category, which included hardware sales along with revenue from Google Play, rose 62 percent to $3.4 billion.Part of the company\u2019s financial stability came from Google\u2019s creation of Alphabet in 2015. The reorganization into a holding company split the company\u2019s core search business from a growing list of fledgling operations, like the newly minted Waymo \u2014 what used to be Google\u2019s self-driving car project until it was spun off as an independent Alphabet company in 2016.Under the watch of Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, the company has scaled back costs and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 the ambition of its speculative investments into new technologies. During the quarter, Alphabet said quarterly revenue from \u201cother bets\u201d rose 75 percent to $262 million, while operating losses narrowed to $1.09 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.Advertisement"}

But it has been slinging as much mud at activists and independent media as they are hurling accusations at it, and all this is only obscuring the vexing complexities of the situation in Rakhine. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has inherited an intractable-seeming problem after decades of military rule, and its specifics need to be understood if the Rohingya stand any chance of being helped effectively.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s aura as an international human rights icon has understandably been tarnished. At the same time, criticism of her is so sweeping and excessive that it obscures the considerable obstacles she and her government face, and the complex realities of post-authoritarian Myanmar.The government of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has already taken important steps to address these deep fissures. She announced the creation of the Central Committee for Implementation of Peace and Development in Rakhine State, as well as plans for comprehensive economic development. An Advisory Commission on Rakhine State was also formed, comprising several prominent international and Myanmar diplomats, human rights commissioners and retired officials, and with the former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan at its head.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is also being taken to task for acts committed by the security forces, yet she has no means of reining them in. She is formally circumscribed by the 2008 Constitution, which gives senior military officers control over three key security ministries: defense, border affairs and home affairs. If she condemned abuses and insisted on holding perpetrators accountable, she would have few levers over the military to do much about them: The Constitution also reserves for the Tatmadaw one-quarter of all seats in Parliament.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s failure to speak out against the military\u2019s culture of impunity may indeed be emboldening its behavior in Rakhine. But she has to strike a very delicate balance \u2014 and pursue a broad reform agenda, partly in the hope of amending the undemocratic Constitution, while making sure not to antagonize the Tatmadaw, which has the most to lose from further liberalization. The Rohingya issue also is unpopular: The group is widely reviled by the ethnic-Burmese and Buddhist majority.The international community, if it is serious about helping the Rohingya, must better understand the complex realities of Myanmar\u2019s continuing transition, and balance its fixation with their plight \u2014 an obsession out of proportion with the scale of the problem \u2014 with the inescapable challenges that the N.L.D. government has inherited after decades of military mismanagement. Positioning the deplorable repression of the Rohingya in this broader political context does not exculpate the state\u2019s failure to prevent and punish any abuses, or exonerate Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi for her seemingly tacit endorsement of heartless official denials. But only a more calibrated understanding of the difficulties faced by her government and Myanmar as a whole \u2014 not blanket condemnation \u2014 stands any chance of yielding practical measures that could alleviate the Rohingya\u2019s suffering.David Scott Mathieson, Senior Researcher on Myanmar for Human Rights Watch from 2006 to 2016, is an independent analyst based in Yangon.Advertisement"}

I wanted to make it right away.Now I have, and now I think you should, too, an early-week no-recipe recipe that you could knock down on a Monday night with ease.Shred the cabbage and caramelize it in a pan with the butter and the golden syrup (use a mixture of molasses and light corn syrup if you can\u2019t find golden, or a spray of brown sugar, or just omit because we shouldn\u2019t be eating so much sugar, anyway). Let it get really tantalizingly close to burned. Then mix about a third of that with the meat, onion, cream, bread crumbs and soy sauce, along with some salt and pepper, and mold it all into a buttered loaf pan.

{"Headline": "These Booths Are Made For Talking: Soothers Hit the Streets", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byCirca NowA week after the presidential election, while walking through the farmers\u2019 market in Union Square, I came across a young woman giving out free hugs to strangers. I gladly accepted one. Balm.A day later, a friend told me that a Lutheran pastor on the Upper East Side has been dispensing free counsel on the sidewalk on Tuesday mornings while sitting in a wooden booth that he had made to the exact specifications of Lucy\u2019s in the comic strip \u201cPeanuts,\u201d complete with a sign reading, \u201cSpiritual Help, 5 cents. The pastor is in.\u201d (Nickels are provided.)Street preachers. Huggers without portfolio. If stores and restaurants can pop up, why can\u2019t the helping professions?\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that there\u2019s a resurgence of this stuff,\u201d said Anna Carter Florence, an ordained Presbyterian minister and the Peter Marshall Professor of Preaching at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga., who said she saw a group of women giving free hugs outdoors in Toronto in November. \u201cHistorically, street preaching has to do with the proclamation of injustice and freedom for the oppressed. It\u2019s a kind of street theater. It\u2019s sacred jesters.\u201dIndeed, some of today\u2019s pop-up spiritualists are overtly political. Amichai Lau-Lavie, a Conservative rabbi who is the founder of both Lab/Shul NYC and Storahtelling Inc., helped organize an interfaith vigil in Washington Square Park on the night of the election. \u201cWe sang, we shared words of comfort, I made everyone do a primal scream,\u201d he said. \u201cA couple hundred people, 30 seconds of screaming. So powerful.\u201dTen days later, Mr. Lau-Lavie stood with other protesters in front of a mosque on 55th Street, holding signs bearing words of solidarity with Muslims. \u201cA lot of passers-by did a double take,\u201d Mr. Lau-Lavie said. \u201cBut interrupting business as usual and defying the normal, it\u2019s very profound.\u201dJustin Normand, a manager of a Dallas sign shop, had a similar idea in November: He stood in front of the Islamic Center of Irving in Irving, Tex., holding a sign reading, \u201cYou belong.\u201d Though Mr. Normand does not typically wear a cowboy hat, he did during his vigil, hoping to symbolize a part of Texas that he felt Muslims needed to hear from.In a subsequent Facebook post, Mr. Normand explained his efforts: \u201cThis was about binding up the wounded. About showing compassion and empathy for the hurting and fearful among us. Or, in some Christian traditions, this was about washing my brother\u2019s feet. This was about my religion, not theirs.\u201dBut other pop-up spiritualists say their aim is not political. The Rev. Gregory Fryer, the pastor of Immanuel Lutheran Church in Manhattan, said his \u201cPeanuts\u201d-style booth had nothing to do with the election.\u201cI simply believe that there are hungry hearts in this city,\u201d he said. Asked if publicity was a motivator, he confessed: \u201cWell, that is true. The first times I set up the booth, in October, I hoped people would begin to recognize me and the church. This church is a little intimidating-looking; people may think it\u2019s an armory. But, as time has gone by, things have reversed. Now I think of myself as Jason Bourne: I\u2019m memorizing the face of everyone who goes by. I want to recognize that these are my neighbors.\u201dThe jurisdiction of today\u2019s pop-up spiritualists is not confined to the tactile and the spiritual. Ciro Ortiz, 11, has been offering \u201cemotional advice\u201d for $2 a session at the Bedford Avenue subway stop on the L line in Brooklyn since October. Two springs ago, Jedediah Purses started offering free psychological counseling on the streets of San Francisco. \u201cI\u2019d done a lot of informal trainings in this kind of work and wanted to see what my skill set was,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m endlessly fascinated with what it\u2019s like to offer yourself up and to let the world come at you.\u201dMr. Purses has had clients confess \u201call sorts of crazy crimes\u201d to him. He has befriended homeless people. He\u2019s fended off numerous offers from passers-by selling drugs. He\u2019s had extended conversations with police officers about the moral and ethical struggles of their job.\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with anger from people of color who were annoyed to see white people shedding tears over the election \u2014 \u2018You didn\u2019t know that it\u2019s like this all the time for us?\u2019\u201d he said.The demands of the street are not insignificant. Pastor Fryer stocks his booth with Kleenex; Mr. Normand has his husband fielding media requests.\u201cThis sounds like a New Yorker cartoon come to life,\u201d said Andrew Walsh, the associate director of the Leonard E. Greenberg Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life at Trinity College in Hartford. \u201cThe forces of orderly commerce do seem, however, to have excluded these folk from the shopping malls.\u201dOn a blustery December day, I talked to Bugun Choi, who had already spent four hours holding a placard in Union Square to bring attention to his self-help nonprofit organization, the Society of Natural Science. I suggested to Mr. Choi that it was a cold day to be standing on a street corner. \u201cI am armed perfectly,\u201d he said. \u201cI bought these earmuffs for this.\u201dThen, when our conversation stretched 12 or 15 minutes longer than I hoped, I confessed: \u201cI need to go inside. I\u2019m starting to feel frostbit on my delicate parts.\u201d Mr. Choi smiled wanly.Many people ascribe to street preachers and freelance huggers a touch of craziness. \u201cMost of us give them a wide berth,\u201d said Ms. Florence, the priest and professor. \u201cI see them in Times Square and think, wow, but for a health plan and a set of meds, there go I.\u201dAccordingly, some pop-up spiritualists will take pains to be noninvasive and approachable. \u201cI let people come to me,\u201d said Mr. Purses, the counselor in San Francisco. \u201cI occupy myself by reading a book or taking notes, which gives people the chance to shamelessly check me out without the possibility of me looking back at them.\u201dMr. Lau-Lavie, the rabbi, said he labored to \u201cbe cautious, be alert, be polite\u201d when conducting services alfresco.\u201cI\u2019ll be perfectly honest, there\u2019s an element of fear,\u201d he said. \u201cAt our vigil on election night, there were some people at the edge of our circle who started yelling, \u2018Trump! Trump! Trump!\u2019 It was never violent, but it was hard.\u201dIf there is an element of gonzo to this new crop of pop-up spiritualist, such assiduousness is in perfect keeping with the history of street preaching. Ms. Florence cited research done by her colleague Charles Campbell, a professor of homiletics at Duke Divinity School, to point out that there is a long tradition of street preachers who preach naked.\u201cSt. Basil spent 70 years wandering the streets, completely naked in the Russian winter, preaching,\u201d she said. \u201cThe nakedness was intentional, and meant to unmask social hierarchy. Ivan the Terrible was so troubled by Basil, and so terrified of him, that he never had him arrested or killed. Basil used to throw meat at him!\u201dIf the measures that pop-up spiritualists take sometimes seem over the top \u2014 the primal screaming, the cartoon-derived booth, the cowboy hat \u2014 they are part of the package. Ms. Florence said, \u201cHoly fools speak in big language, trying to say something like what Flannery O\u2019Connor said: When you\u2019re preaching to those whose imaginations have grown numb, you have to preach big.\u201dHenry Alford is the author of \u201cWould It Kill You to Stop Doing That?

Now, for the first time in more than half a century, the president has a young son.Shortly after President Trump took the oath of office on Friday, a comedy writer for \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d Katie Rich, tweeted what was intended to be a joke about Barron Trump and school shootings, prompting a barrage of criticism. Within a few hours, Ms. Rich deleted the tweet and locked down her Twitter account, but it remained a topic on social media all weekend.\u201cBarron Trump deserves the chance every child does \u2014 to be a kid,\u201d Ms. Clinton wrote in a post that received more than 105,000 reactions and was shared close to 9,000 times, as others recirculated her message on their own feeds.\u201cStanding up for every kid also means opposing POTUS policies that hurt kids,\u201d Ms. Clinton added.Commenters agreed. A typical reply: \u201cMany did not give the same respect to the Obama children, which made me so sad. I will give respect to Barron because he deserves it no matter what his father does.\u201dIt was a rare point of agreement across the political spectrum on social media over a weekend during which hundreds of thousands of people marched to protest the new administration.\u201cIt is a longstanding tradition that the children of presidents are afforded the opportunity to grow up outside of the political spotlight,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe White House fully expects this tradition to continue.\u201dThough Barron will be in New York for at least several more months to finish his school year, he will be the first young boy in the White House since John F.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Only Way We Can Fight Back Is to Excel\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "FeatureUndocumented college students face an uncertain future under the Trump administration.Supported byIt was also the opposite of her own life. Indira left Mexico for the United States at age 6 with her parents and two younger sisters. Her mother cleaned houses when she wasn\u2019t caring for the children \u2014 there would eventually be seven of them \u2014 and her father worked in construction, and there was no money for after-school lessons or soccer clubs, let alone traveling. \u201cI\u2019d hear about trips and experiences of my white friends, and I remember thinking: I\u2019ll never go to the beach or Disney World for spring break,\u201d Indira says. Her parents told her that education was all that mattered, and she had to spend all her free time inside, reading and writing. \u201cI tell my children this country is a blessing to all the people living here,\u201d her mother told me. \u201cIf you have the opportunity to be good, it\u2019s very important to take it.\u201d Indira took this advice to heart. By the time she was in fifth grade, her reading skills had improved so much that she tested into the top reading group. By middle school, she consistently got A\u2019s, which qualified her for a celebratory school trip every time report cards came out. \u201cThey rewarded us by taking us skating or bowling,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like I was so smart, just getting the chance to go out for the whole school day with friends. That\u2019s when I said: \u2018I can make it.\u2019\u2009\u201dIndira began to throw herself into everything. At recess, she played soccer and basketball, competing so fiercely that everyone took notice. Boys usually picked other boys for their teams, and white kids tended to favor other white kids. But everyone started picking Indira. In middle school, she was on the track team, running long-distance races. Her coach was stunned by her determination. In meets, even when she won her event, she scolded herself unless she broke her previous record. After practices ended, she would keep running. \u201cI wanted to think,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d stay after practice and run and run and run.\u201dIndira remembers understanding vaguely that it wasn\u2019t just poverty that set her and her family apart. Her parents had been doctors in Mexico. She admired pictures in their dresser drawer of the two of them in their 20s standing together, tall and proud in their white coats \u2014 before they all fled the violence of drug gangs who were then taking over their home state, Guerrero. When she asked her parents why they were no longer doctors, they explained it was because they were not American citizens. It didn\u2019t make sense to Indira. Why would her father have shed that beautiful crisp white coat for the fraying pants and shirts he now wore?Soon after Indira turned 13, in 2011, she was riding home from track practice with her mother when another car sideswiped the family\u2019s Ford Expedition. The other driver, who was at fault, insisted on calling the police, according to Indira and a lawyer who assisted the family. Indira pleaded not to involve the police, explaining that her mother did not have a driver\u2019s license because she was not an American citizen. (In Georgia and most other states, undocumented immigrants cannot obtain driver\u2019s licenses.) But the driver said she needed a police report to get insurance to cover the damage to her car.A police officer arrived and asked for Indira\u2019s mother\u2019s license. When she said she did not have one \u2014 a state crime \u2014 she was told to get out of the car. Indira got out, too. She remembers two of her younger siblings sleeping in the back, one in a booster seat, one in a car seat. Two elders from the church they attended arrived to ask for mercy. She has seven children, they told the officer. He responded that he was simply enforcing the law. Indira\u2019s mother turned to her and began to cry. \u201cIndira, I don\u2019t know what is going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to take me.\u201d Indira remembers remaining strangely calm. \u201cWhen she was being handcuffed, I said: \u2018Mom, everything is going to be O.K.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cThat woke me up,\u201d Indira says. \u201cUntil then, I thought the world was happy.\u201d In fact, she now realized, it was only American citizens who seemed truly happy. \u201cIt must feel pretty good, I guess, to not have to worry about whether your family could be taken away any day.\u201dShe was distressed to discover that Georgia barred undocumented immigrants from attending its top public universities and charged them out-of-state tuition at all others \u2014 triple the rate for citizen residents. She then turned to researching financial aid and learned that Congress barred her from accessing federal Pell grants, loans, scholarships and work-study jobs \u2014 the most common forms of assistance for low-income students. At first, she greeted this as just another set of obstacles to surmount, but as time went on, she began to despair. She would retreat to the classroom of her science teacher, Teresa Leach, who had become her mentor, in need of encouragement. \u201cThere were a couple of times when I just cried to her because I was tired,\u201d she said. \u201cI questioned myself if it was all worth the effort.\u201d All the while, Indira told me, she held onto her religious conviction that God had a plan, and that she must respect it.At a college fair attended by representatives of numerous Georgia colleges, she asked admissions officers what kind of help was available for undocumented students. No one had any to offer her. She switched her focus to private colleges and was admitted to Atlanta\u2019s Agnes Scott, which she says awarded her $20,000 annually in financial aid, less than half of what she needed. She researched full-ride private scholarships and found two for undocumented students, but she was selected for neither. She was awarded seven small scholarships, which totaled $10,000, enough to go to a nearby public commuter college for only one semester at the out-of-state tuition rate.Last May, Indira attended her graduation ceremony at Gainesville High School, but she had nowhere to go next. In every picture from that day, she wears a wide smile, but she was in pain inside, particularly when she caught a glimpse of her mother in the crowd, looking distraught. Unable to bring herself to celebrate with friends, she went home to be with her family.Days later, a friend told her about a philanthropic organization called TheDream.US, which was offering undocumented students full four-year scholarships to Delaware State University or Eastern Connecticut State University. The application was demanding, and only 76 students would be chosen. She poured herself into the essays, spending hours composing them alongside an English teacher, Cindy Lloyd. She applied to Delaware State, a historically black college in Dover, five hours closer to home than Eastern Connecticut. In late June, she received an email from TheDream.US. \u201cI saw \u2018Congratulations,\u2019\u2009\u201d she remembers, \u201cand I read no more.\u201dIn late August, Indira made the 11-hour drive with her parents from Gainesville to Delaware State in unusual silence. She was thinking hard about each of her six younger siblings, wondering how they would fare without her. Over breakfast at a Cracker Barrel in South Carolina, when her mother pressed her about how she was feeling, she talked only of her concerns about not being at home to help everyone. When she arrived on campus \u2014 a flat expanse of grassy courtyards and buildings amid strip malls, auto dealers and chain restaurants just beyond Dover\u2019s historic capital area \u2014 she found 33 other \u201copportunity scholars,\u201d just as worried and hopeful as she was. All of them were assigned to a dorm about a quarter of a mile from the D.S.U. campus, a former Sheraton hotel acquired a few years earlier by the university as part of an expansion. They bonded instantly, traveling as a posse from classes to the library to the cafeteria, often ending up together late at night in the dorm lobby or in a lounge that had been a large hotel suite on the second floor.While most of the students are 18 or 19, typical for college freshmen, some have worked for years in hopes of one day saving enough for college. Olivia Bekale, who is 27 and grew up in Baton Rouge, arrived in Louisiana from Gabon as a child. She graduated from high school in 2008 with a 3.9 G.P.A. from the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, a prestigious state-supported boarding school for top achievers. Unable to afford college, she cycled from one low-wage position to the next \u2014 server at the Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant; retail sales consultant for Sprint; customer-service agent for Marriott; pharmacy tech for Walgreens. Olivia, who had wanted to be a doctor since an aunt died of AIDS when she was 5, had been out of high school for eight years when she learned of the opportunity scholarship; she applied immediately.All but one of the students were enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Created in 2012 by an Obama-administration executive action, DACA allowed teenagers and young adults who came to the United States illegally as children with their parents to register with the government and in turn receive a two-year renewable protection against deportation, along with work permits and Social Security numbers. Most of the students, like Indira, signed up at age 15, as soon as they were eligible. With DACA, Indira, who is now 18, was able to get a driver\u2019s license and a job at a Publix supermarket when she was in high school, working 20 hours a week as a cashier and bagger. Being able to work and drive legally, free of the fears her mother faced, and fitting in with her classmates, Indira says, was \u201cliving the American dream.\u201d With her income from Publix, she even was able to get braces for her teeth.Undocumented children poured into the nation\u2019s schools over the next generation, and as they reached college age, they coalesced into a movement, advocating access to higher education as well as full citizenship. In 2001, they began calling themselves Dreamers, now an estimated 2.1 million young immigrants who have grown up as Americans in almost every way except for their passports. The name came from the Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors), introduced in Congress in 2001 by Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, and for which activists fought for over a decade. The measure, which would have put undocumented children on a path to citizenship, never passed, but the vast network of Dreamers became a compelling political force.In 2001, hundreds of them turned out to testify in Texas in favor of legislation to allow undocumented residents to pay in-state college tuition if they graduated from Texas high schools and lived in the state for three years. \u201cSomething magical happened when those kids told their stories,\u201d says the former Texas state representative Rick Noriega, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. \u201cIt was a humanizing of a very real issue dealing with children\u2019s dreams and hopes. Every heart on that committee was touched, Republicans and Democrats.\u201d The legislation passed both houses almost unanimously and was signed by Rick Perry, then governor of Texas and now President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for energy secretary. Texas became the first state, followed quickly by California, to allow Dreamers to pay in-state tuition. Today, 21 states charge Dreamers the same tuition as legal residents, including six carried by Trump \u2014 Florida, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Texas.In many of those states, however, the once-bipartisan issue has turned politically treacherous. In Texas, efforts to repeal the tuition law come closer to passing every year, and Noriega says there is no chance the original measure would pass today. The leading national opponents of in-state tuition for Dreamers include the Republican senator Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general, and the secretary of state of Kansas, Kris Kobach, a Republican who was a leader of Trump\u2019s transition team on immigration. Each argues that students who are in the United States illegally should not get a public benefit in any state that is denied to a citizen from another state. In other words, if Dreamers pay in-state tuition in Texas, citizen students next door in Arkansas and Oklahoma \u2014 or Massachusetts, for that matter \u2014 should have the same right. \u201cHow much sense does that make, to have people here illegally, and they have more benefits than those who are here legally?\u201d Sessions asked in a Senate floor statement. Kobach used the same argument to bring class-action lawsuits against in-state tuition for Dreamers in Kansas and California. Judges found no legal basis for the claims and dismissed the cases.The larger debate over how to treat an estimated 11 million immigrants who came here illegally has been at a stalemate for decades, with advocates seeking a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d for law-abiding families who have been in the country for years and opponents denouncing \u201camnesty\u201d for people who broke the law to enter the country. Amid hardening resistance in Congress to immigration reform, Dreamers brought pressure on Obama \u2014 including sit-ins and hunger strikes at his 2012 campaign offices \u2014 to use his executive power to create DACA. The program, announced on June 15, 2012, the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s Plyler decision, proved transformative for Dreamers. They have entered college, taken on-the-books jobs, received driver\u2019s licenses, bought cars. They now fly on planes, passing effortlessly through airport security. They still lack legal immigration status, but no longer are they exactly undocumented. \u201cDACAmented,\u201d many have called themselves.Even in states where they pay in-state tuition, Dreamers still struggle to afford college because they are disproportionately low-income and have no access to federal financial aid. Fewer than 10 percent of Dreamers who graduate from high school enroll in college. At a time when college graduates earn 70 percent more than those without degrees, these numbers conjure the 1982 warning by the Supreme Court that undocumented children could become a permanent underclass.In response, a handful of philanthropies have adopted the cause of sending students with DACA status to college. The biggest of these, TheDream.US, has raised $90 million to eventually finance 4,000 students at public colleges, with significant contributions from Donald Graham, former publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, and his family; Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan; Bill and Melinda Gates; the hedge-fund executive William Ackman; and Michael Bloomberg, among others. (I was a reporter at The Washington Post from 1980 to 2008.) In 2014, TheDream.US began offering Dreamers full scholarships in states that charge them in-state tuition. Last year, in partnership with Delaware and Connecticut, the organization created the opportunity-scholarship program for students from the other 29 states, financed by $41 million in philanthropy from Graham and his family and two anonymous donors. The governors of Delaware and Connecticut agreed to charge roughly in-state tuition rates for the 34 scholars at Delaware State and the 42 at Eastern Connecticut State \u2014 a total of $80,000 per student for tuition, room and board for four years. In an effort to pre-empt political opposition, Graham says, the philanthropy works only with schools, like Delaware State and Eastern Connecticut State, that have excess capacity, so that undocumented students are not displacing citizens. And private donors pay all expenses, so that no state dollars are spent.Still, when The Delaware State News ran an article in September about the D.S.U. opportunity scholars, the online comments complained that undocumented immigrants, not citizens, were benefiting. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t perfect, but I will vote for him because he puts Americans FIRST,\u201d wrote a reader named John Huff of Magnolia, Del. \u201cThere are plenty of kids who are citizens who have the same dream and should come first.\u201d And as news of the scholarship spread on the Delaware campus this fall, a number of African-American students told Dreamers that they resented that their own families had to go into debt for a portion of their education costs while the DACA students got full scholarships.By then, Trump had mobilized anti-immigrant anger in large swaths of the country, having kicked off his campaign criticizing Mexican immigrants \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u201d \u2014 and vowing to build a wall on the border to keep them out. In stump speeches, he promised to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and, in his first 100 days in office, to terminate DACA, labeling it \u201cillegal amnesty.\u201d Both vows became instant applause lines.Separation from family, from home, even from Mexican food made most of the opportunity scholars profoundly lonely. Estephany Martinez, a petite criminal-justice major with long black hair, couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her sisters in the first weeks. \u201cWhenever we came home from school, all four sisters would sit in the living room and do our homework and talk and watch TV,\u201d she recalled wistfully of her life in Winder, Ga. In Delaware, \u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody that cared for me. I didn\u2019t have anyone to come home to.\u201d In early September, she summoned all the scholars to a gathering in the dorm\u2019s second-floor lounge. \u201cAll right, you guys, we\u2019re going to be here for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cThat part of our lives \u2014 being undocumented \u2014 is critical to who we are. We have to share our stories.\u201d Everyone crowded in, sitting on the sofa, spilling onto the floor, sitting shoulder to shoulder on counters that once were part of a kitchenette, sprawling into one another\u2019s space.Carlos Gonzales of Manteo, N.C., a lanky and cheerful marketing major whose mother is a restaurant cook, broke down crying when he recalled the violence that drove his family from Mexico City. He, his mother and his younger sister moved to North Carolina when he was 7. It was his mother who encouraged him, beginning in elementary school, to reach for college. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to live the life we\u2019re living now,\u201d she told him. In high school, he was an honor student and varsity wrestler and runner, working nights and weekends at McDonald\u2019s in his Outer Banks town. When he received the email telling him he was an opportunity scholar, he said: \u201cI hugged my mom and cried for two hours. The only reason I stopped was I had to go to work.\u201dIndira told the harrowing story that led to her own family\u2019s departure from Mexico. In 2004, when she was 6, three masked gunmen broke into their home, which housed her parents\u2019 clinic, and robbed them of everything \u2014 money, jewelry, a new computer, a television, cameras and medications. They filed a report with the police, they said, who didn\u2019t investigate, in deference to cartels then taking over Guerrero, now the most violent state in Mexico. An uncle of her father\u2019s already had been killed. In subsequent years, a cousin of her mother\u2019s, a veterinarian, was kidnapped and never found. Two nephews disappeared. Her mother\u2019s sister has been kidnapped twice \u2014 most recently this past November \u2014 and returned only after her family paid steep ransoms.Weeks after the robbery, Indira\u2019s family of five arrived in the United States on a tourist visa that her father procured a month earlier in hopes of taking everyone to Disney World. Instead, they went to Gainesville, where her father\u2019s brother worked in construction \u2014 one of thousands of Mexican workers who flocked to the north Georgia community in the last 25 years, swelling the Hispanic population to more than 40 percent in 2013 from 8 percent in 1990. Indira said her parents are certain they would have been killed had they stayed. They decided to forfeit their careers for their family\u2019s safety. \u201cI no longer saw my future, but I saw my children\u2019s future,\u201d her father said to me.Antonio Patino, a computer-science major who is a lifeguard and plays bass and guitar in his spare time, told the group about riding with his family in their car in 2015 in Lawrenceville, Ga., when a police officer pulled them over, though none of them understood why. His father, who is undocumented and processes returns for a local manufacturer, was driving but did not have a license. Antonio and his mother, younger sister and brother all watched in terror as his father was handcuffed, placed in a police cruiser and driven off to jail. As it turned out, he was released the next day after paying a fine of more than $800 and was not referred to immigration court for further proceedings, but the incident shook Antonio\u2019s sense of belonging in America. \u201cI felt like I got slapped in the face just for living, trying to be a normal person in this beautiful country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like a hole inside me.\u201d He said he now found himself gripped with fears for his parents\u2019 safety at random moments during his days at D.S.U. It is as if he has swapped roles with his mother and father. \u201cLike I\u2019m now the parent and they\u2019re the child, and I\u2019m worried for them,\u201d he told me. \u201cNot being there, all these what-ifs swarm into my mind. What if out of nowhere they get pulled over again?\u201d Calling them and hearing their voices usually comforts him. But after one such call, he said: \u201cI went outside, and I had to cry a little. I was feeling like I couldn\u2019t help them.\u201dA number of students shared the enormous sacrifices they had seen their parents make for them. Juan Chavez, 23, who grew up in Plymouth, Ind., and worked for five years after high school, told of his mother suffering a breakdown after her divorce from his father. He saw it as a response to the crushing instability of their lives, moving from one home to another in search of shelter. \u201cShe\u2019s the strongest person I\u2019ll ever know,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my role model. My father figure as well as my mother.\u201d He continued: \u201cI felt so helpless to make things better. I decided almost right then I\u2019ll go to college and medical school if it takes me the rest of my life.\u201d He is now a psychology and pre-med major, intending to become a psychiatrist.On and on the students went until almost 3 a.m., the common threads in their stories drawing them closer. It was the first time most of them had talked openly about being undocumented, but instead of feeling exposed, they felt safer. Until then, Antonio had gone out of his way to avoid conversations with non-Dreamers at D.S.U. about his scholarship, not wanting to have to explain that he got it because he was undocumented. The next day, though, he fell into conversation with a student who asked him how he happened to come all the way from Georgia to D.S.U., and he said without hesitation: \u201cI got a scholarship.\u201d\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m undocumented,\u201d Antonio said, surprised at how comfortable this felt.\u201cO.K., man, that\u2019s cool,\u201d the student said.After their long night talking, the scholars also better understood what had propelled them all for as long as they could remember. Throughout high school, the opportunity scholars watched undocumented friends and siblings give up and drop out, shamed and beaten down by public scorn over illegal immigration and the dead-end options awaiting even those who excelled in high school. But they kept on striving, steeled to the insults, positioning themselves for a breakthrough they couldn\u2019t yet see. Now this all made sense. \u201cThis pain \u2014 it pushes us,\u201d Estephany said. \u201cIt\u2019s motivation. It has made me who I am. It makes me go through every day.\u201d\u201cNow we know what drives us,\u201d Indira said.A similar scene unfolded that morning in the ultramodern science center, in computational-thinking class, where Antonio and Jose Reyes Rios, another computer-science major, sat front and center with an African-American classmate named Hanqaamo Lintisio, who is from Maryland and has a track scholarship. The three had formed a study group and tutored one another so effectively that they all scored above 100 on the midterm. (They nailed the bonus question.) Theirs were the only A\u2019s in the class.The Dreamers gather daily at a long Formica table in a D.S.U. cafeteria for food and conversation. At lunch, Carla Moreno propped her English composition textbook, \u201cPatterns for College Writing,\u201d against a napkin holder, securing it with an apple. She paged through a chapter while eating her salad and chili dog. \u201cIt\u2019s just a quiz,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I want to keep my A.\u201d\u201cI deal with a lot of students, and I feel like the Dreamers are at a different level,\u201d says Kevin Noriega, the adviser for their scholarships. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got to make this happen because it\u2019s my only option.\u2019\u2009\u201d Of the 488 scholars funded by TheDream.US who began college in 2014, 94 percent remain enrolled after their sophomore year; research shows that only 66 percent of low-income college students nationally return after one year. \u201cThis is a low-income population with retention rates like Harvard\u2019s,\u201d Donald Graham says. Because beneficiaries of TheDream.US have full rides, they avoid a common problem faced by other disadvantaged students: running short of money for costs not covered by Pell grants or other forms of aid.One night in October before a biology exam, Indira went to the D.S.U. athletic center for a workout to relieve stress. She was armed with a stack of homemade flash cards and her iPhone, on which she had downloaded discussions of test topics from various websites. While pounding out three miles on the treadmill, she flipped through her study cards, then plugged in her earbuds for a YouTube lecture on glycolysis. Returning to her dorm, she sat down at her desk for a final review. Hanging on the wall in front of her was a collage of family photographs. One showed the whole family of nine around their dinner table. \u201cWhen I\u2019m struggling, I look at a picture of my mom or dad, and I say, \u2018I\u2019m working for that person,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. That night, her studying complete, she took a last look at her parents\u2019 picture and fell asleep listening to recordings of her biology professor\u2019s lectures. She got an A on the exam.Such unsinkable optimism, which I heard from many D.S.U. Dreamers in the early fall, is hard to maintain, and many of the estimated 65,000 undocumented immigrants who graduate from high school every year \u2014 and thousands who drop out \u2014 simply can\u2019t muster it. In a recent book, \u201cLives in Limbo,\u201d Roberto G. Gonzales, an assistant professor at Harvard\u2019s graduate school of education, writes that academically successful Dreamers are far outnumbered by those who become casualties of \u201cthe deeper and more far-reaching consequences of being undocumented: living in poverty, having parents and family members who also bear the burdens of being undocumented, watching friends moving forward but being unable to join them, watching opportunities pass you by, navigating a world of exclusions while constantly looking over your shoulder.\u201dAt least some of the opportunity scholars\u2019 optimism last fall came from their assumption, based on reported polls, that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. They were heartened by her speeches about keeping families together and pursuing comprehensive immigration reform. At the very least, they were confident that DACA would remain in effect under her leadership. Though they didn\u2019t believe Trump could win, he unnerved them with his speeches branding Mexicans criminals who stole Americans\u2019 jobs and lived off their tax dollars. They took this rhetoric as a personal affront and were horrified by the hatred they saw on the faces of those who cheered his words. \u201cThe only thing that depresses me is so many people support him,\u201d Jose Reyes Rios, the computer-science major, who aspires to work at Google one day, said in late September.On election night, a group of Dreamers gathered around the flat-screen TV in the dorm lobby, many of them studying as they watched returns. Indira had exams the next day in math and biology and arrived equipped with her flash cards. The mood turned dark after Trump won Florida. Everyone\u2019s mind flooded with his vows that they had discounted until now \u2014 to revoke DACA, to deputize local police departments to enforce federal immigration laws. \u201cWe will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings,\u201d Trump said last summer in Arizona. As all of them knew well, these crimes included one of their parents\u2019 daily activities \u2014 driving without a license. If DACA disappeared, and with it their Social Security numbers, their own driver\u2019s licenses would be worthless. So would their federal work authorization, meaning most would lose the jobs that paid for their books, phones, clothes, travel home and anything else they needed.By 1 a.m., Indira became too distressed to concentrate. Olivia Bekale was one of four opportunity scholars who watched until Trump was declared the president-elect. \u201cWe were just looking at each other and crying,\u201d she says. \u201cWe hugged each other and went to our rooms.\u201dSocial media brought aftershocks for all of them as they discovered that many of their best friends voted for Trump. Almost all of Antonio\u2019s high-school swim teammates in Lawrenceville had Trump filters on their Facebook and Snapchat profile pictures. \u201cAll I could think was: You voted against me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did I do to you?\u201dThe day after the election, Indira couldn\u2019t bear to call her mother until the afternoon. Instead, she confided her fears in text messages to her former science teacher, Teresa Leach. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so disappointed in this country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so powerless. ... I\u2019m scared about my family, my mom. ... Not sure if I\u2019ll even get my degree, much less go to medical school here.\u201d When Indira finally did call home, her mother insisted she was not afraid and told Indira that education was now even more important.Several of Indira\u2019s friends back home told her they doubted Trump would follow through on all his campaign promises, and in any case, they couldn\u2019t imagine he would target her. \u201cThese are people who helped me get to where I am, who remind me they love me, and I love them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll never understand what we feel. They say, \u2018He won\u2019t do that.\u2019 Do they think he\u2019s going to send back all the immigrants except Indira?\u201dA lifeline of sorts arrived the week after the election, when the students received letters from TheDream.US, Governor Markell and the president of D.S.U., pledging to stand behind their scholarships no matter what became of DACA. Donald Graham lined up attorneys to represent them if anyone challenged their right to be in school.But their bigger fears were for their parents. Antonio and Indira went home for Christmas to find their families filled with trepidation. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be invisible, trying to stay hidden,\u201d Antonio\u2019s father said, \u201cdo only the things we have to do to live, like go to work, go buy groceries.\u201d During the 2015 holiday season, they took a driving tour of the Christmas lights and celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve in downtown Lawrenceville. \u201cNow we can\u2019t go to any festivities because for us it\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d his mother told me in their apartment in a complex in Buford, Ga. \u201cThere are a lot of police there.\u201dAntonio\u2019s father said he worries about driving his daughter, Litzy, 15, home from her swim-team practice at rush hour, when the police presence increases. Litzy was born in Georgia, and he thought of asking her to leave the team until she is old enough to drive because, as a citizen, she will be able to get a driver\u2019s license. \u201cBut then I said to myself: \u2018No! That\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here \u2014 for our kids. So they can take advantage of every opportunity.\u2019\u2009\u201d He continues to ferry her \u2014 carefully \u2014 during rush hour.Indira found her mother more frightened than at any time since receiving her deportation order. Her mother says she has no choice but to drive when someone at her church asks for help, when her children call for rides home and when she is needed at a charity medical clinic where she volunteers as a doctor\u2019s assistant and translator. \u201cLife changed after the election,\u201d she told me in December, in her living room decorated with framed academic awards for each child. She was surrounded by her kids, who listened carefully. \u201cThe children know I don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. They know at any time maybe the police will take me again. \u2018If I can\u2019t come back,\u2019 I tell them, \u2018you have to go to school every day. You have to study hard \u2014 even harder.\u2019\u2009\u201dEstephany Martinez focused on her life\u2019s mission. \u201cMy goal is being a police chief \u2014 something that makes my voice louder,\u201d said the criminal-justice major. \u201cI have to educate myself to get there. I want to show people who don\u2019t believe in us: \u2018I got all the way here. I\u2019m starting from the bottom with education, and I\u2019m going to get there.\u2019\u2009\u201dAs they settled into the semester, they monitored everything Trump and his close allies were saying about immigration, their moods shifting with each utterance. Back in December, they felt hopeful when Trump, in his interview as Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year, said approving things about Dreamers and indicated that he would deport serious criminals before other undocumented immigrants. They were discouraged in January when Jeff Sessions, in his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, appeared unconcerned about the consequences of revoking DACA. They took heart two days later when Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, said in a CNN town-hall meeting that he wanted Congress to pass legislation making Dreamers \u201cright with the law.\u201dSoon after classes started, the opportunity scholars learned that their collective grade point average for the first semester was a 3.76. Six of the 34 students had achieved a perfect 4.0. Indira was one of them. \u201cSucceeding for me is how I can get my revenge,\u201d she told me over the phone, interrupting her biology homework for a few minutes. \u201cI want to break the stereotype of us being here taking jobs away and not helping the economy. I want Trump to see we\u2019re the total opposite of what he thinks.\u201dDale Russakoff is a freelance writer and the author of \u201cThe Prize: Who\u2019s in Charge of America\u2019s Schools.\u201d This is her first article for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "State Dept. Dissent Cable on Trump\u2019s Ban Draws 1,000 Signatures", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 It started out in Washington.Then it went to Jakarta. Then across Africa.One version even showed up on Facebook.The cable wended its way through dozens of American embassies around the world, quickly emerging as one of the broadest protests by American officials against their president\u2019s policies. And it is not over yet.By 4 p.m. on Tuesday, the letter had attracted around 1,000 signatures, State Department officials said, far more than any dissent cable in recent years. It was being delivered to management, and department officials said more diplomats wanted to add their names to it.The State Department has 7,600 Foreign Service officers and 11,000 civil servants.The letter had been evolving since this weekend, when the first draft emerged. It was edited as it moved along, with some diplomats adding words and others striking out passages.For example, one diplomat suggested this sentence should simply end on \u201clasting shame\u201d: \u201cThe decision to restrict the freedom of Japanese-Americans in the United States and foreign nationals who wanted to travel to or settle in the United States during the 1940s has been a source of lasting shame for many in our country.\u201dSome officials who were trying to sign the document on Tuesday said it was not clear who was in charge or who was collecting signatures. The letter was passed through official State Department email accounts and on government time \u2014 several diplomats said union rules allowed them to work on dissent memos on the clock.The letter, which harshly took apart the executive order, said the visa ban would \u201calienate allies\u201d and \u201churt America economically.\u201d Foreign travelers inject nearly $250 billion into the American economy, the letter said, supporting more than one million jobs.Some diplomats said they joined the dissent by sending an email saying \u201cI\u2019m in\u201d or \u201cPlease add my name as a signer\u201d along with their full name, title, position and post.The letter was apparently circulated through informal networks of diplomats and not through any State Department-wide email list. One diplomat on vacation in the United States said he received the letter from a colleague in another part of the world who was not connected to the drafters and was simply passing it along.The diplomat predicted that hundreds of other diplomats would be eager to sign it if they could, but because of the complications of figuring out where the dissent memo originally came from, he was not sure how many would actually sign it.Most people in the State Department have never seen anything like this, the diplomat said. He said dissent memos were reserved for major policy issues, not for little grumbles like bad food in the embassy cafeteria.That diplomat also requested anonymity, saying that Foreign Service officers were not supposed to criticize American policy publicly and that he did not want to open himself up to accusations that he had violated the rules. That could threaten his job, he said, especially in such a polarized environment.This is exactly what the dissent channel, as it is called, was intended for.Starting in 1971 during the Vietnam War, the channel encourages department officials to voice their criticisms internally through a process of sending a memo or a cable to the secretary of state expressing their concerns and suggesting solutions. The final part of the visa ban memo lays out detailed alternatives, including increased vetting for specific nationalities.But however officially tolerated, several veteran diplomats said dissent was still risky. When it comes to ambassadorships, the selection process is highly competitive \u2014 and highly subjective \u2014 and the diplomats said it would be impossible to prove why someone had been blocked from a coveted post. Previous dissent could easily be used against the person.Some State Department officials said on Tuesday that they would not sign the letter because of those risks. While one said he disagreed with the visa ban, he considered it his job to enforce American government policies whether or not he agreed with them.Other diplomats said the letter did not mean that dissenters would disobey the visa ban. The intent was to try to change the policy so the ban would be lifted, they said.The diplomat who said he would not use a dissent memo to complain about cafeteria food said that he had been torn when the United States invaded Iraq because he was strongly against the war, but that he did not know how to express his concern.He said he was just starting out at the time.The visa ban, he said, \u201cwas such obviously bad policy\u201d that he was trying to find a way to sign the dissent letter.He also said that many diplomats were using the letter as a vehicle to express broader concerns about the way the Trump administration has appeared to sideline the State Department.The diplomat spoke in defense of refugees, saying that the tiny percentage from, say, Somalia who had been approved for resettlement in the United States had been scrutinized by several agencies and were among the most vulnerable of very vulnerable people. Now, many are stuck in limbo in transit centers.He called that \u201cbullying at the highest levels.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Benjamin Netanyahu Sought Deal With Hostile Newspaper, TV Report Says", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long inserted himself into Israel\u2019s fierce newspaper wars to bolster his grip on power. But an Israeli television station reported on Sunday that the police are looking into his involvement as part of a possible corruption case that could undermine his political future.Mr. Netanyahu was recorded in a meeting negotiating mutual benefits with an old foe, the publisher of Yediot Aharonot, a popular newspaper that is sharply critical of the prime minister, reported Channel 2, a commercial television station.In return for more positive coverage, the station reported, Mr. Netanyahu proposed helping Yediot Aharonot financially by curtailing the circulation of its main competition, Israel Hayom, and limiting its weekend supplement.The meeting between Mr. Netanyahu and the publisher of Yediot Aharonot, Arnon Mozes, took place in 2014, according to Channel 2, but the discussion does not appear to have materialized into action.Still, the disclosure caused an uproar. Critics accused Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Mozes of plotting to upend the democratic principle of an independent, free and professional press.\u201cWe expect in a democratic country that the journalistic coverage will come from the editorial echelon, from the reporters, the editors \u2014 people who are driven by the public good and the supply of information,\u201d Prof. Rafi Mann, an expert in Israeli media history and communications at Ariel University in the West Bank, told Israel Radio.It would be improper, he said, for Yediot Aharonot to change its coverage not for the sake of balance or accuracy, but \u201cbecause the owner wants to save the paper or make things easier financially.\u201dYediot Aharonot has struggled financially in recent years, largely because of competition from Israel Hayom, a free daily backed financially by one of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s main patrons, the American billionaire and Republican Party donor Sheldon Adelson. Since Israel Hayom began publishing in 2007, it has cut deeply into Yediot Aharonot\u2019s advertising base and readership.Mr. Netanyahu has a combative relationship with much of the Israeli news media.In a Facebook post in 2015, Mr. Netanyahu accused Mr. Mozes of \u201can orchestrated and ridiculous campaign of slander\u201d against him, his Likud Party and Israel Hayom. The attack came a day after lawyers filed a petition to ban Israel Hayom during that year\u2019s election campaign, calling it a \u201cpropaganda platform\u201d that is \u201cmasquerading as a newspaper.\u201dThe election was called after Mr. Netanyahu broke up his government coalition, partly to prevent the advancement of a bill to outlaw free newspapers like Israel Hayom.The meeting between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Mozes in 2014 was recorded at Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s request by his former chief of staff, Ari Harow, according to Channel 2. It surfaced during a separate police investigation of Mr. Harow on suspicion of financial irregularities.Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyer, Jacob Weinroth, said there was \u201cno speck\u201d of criminality in receiving cigars as a present from a friend.The police provided no details about the second case, saying only that a second suspect had been questioned \u2014 presumably Mr. Mozes.Mr. Netanyahu told a meeting of his Likud Party ministers on Sunday that while he could not go into details, \u201cI know what this is about and I am telling you in full confidence: This will come to nothing because there is nothing.\u201d He has made a mantra of the phrase in recent weeks as he has denied any wrongdoing.There was no immediate response to the reports on Sunday from Mr. Mozes.Ron Yaron, the editor in chief of Yediot Aharonot, wrote in a letter to the newspaper\u2019s staff that the editors and reporters had been unaware of the meeting between the publisher and the prime minister.\u201cNaturally, since we knew nothing about it, we also could not \u2018act accordingly,\u2019\u201d Mr. Yaron wrote. \u201cEverything published in Yediot Aharonot stands up to the rules of journalism and stems from professional considerations.\u201dLiron Vardi Geler, a spokeswoman for Israel Hayom, declined to comment.Yediot Aharonot was once Israel\u2019s most widely circulated newspaper, but industry figures for the first half of 2016 show that Israel Hayom now circulates more copies on weekdays than any Israeli paper.Legal and political experts debated on Sunday whether the discussion between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Mozes constituted criminal behavior or just represented questionable conduct.Dan Margalit, a veteran Israeli journalist and a columnist at Israel Hayom, told Channel 2: \u201cLet the bosses fight it out. I\u2019m glad I am not involved.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zimbabwe Stands Still as President Vacations Off the Grid", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 It was an urgent matter for President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe: His approval was needed so that a loyal supporter who had just died could be buried at a cemetery for national heroes.But with Mr. Mugabe off on his extended annual holiday in Asia this month, it took the acting president a couple of days to track him down, en route from Beijing to his Asian base in Singapore.\u201cI phoned the president telling him about the death, and he told me that he had learned about it through the first lady, who had read about it on the internet,\u201d said the acting president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, one of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s two vice presidents.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays are one of the unusual aspects of the rhythms of political life in Harare, the capital of this southern African nation. Every year, from mid-December through the end of January, Mr. Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years with a tight grip, seemingly releases it. He vanishes in Asia, going off grid, becoming at times unreachable to his own deputies.A couple of years ago, one of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s sons posted photos on Instagram showing the family at a high-end Japanese restaurant in Singapore, apparently enjoying teppanyaki. But the Mugabes have otherwise remained discreet about their holiday activities, sensitive perhaps to criticism back home that they are wasting public money while government coffers are nearly empty.So committed has Mr. Mugabe been to staying away from Zimbabwe that even when he interrupts his long Asian holiday with an official trip to an African nation \u2014 as he did in mid-January by traveling to Mali \u2014 the presidential plane, Air Zimbabwe Flight 1, has made a beeline right back to Asia.In Harare, government decisions, big and small, are put off. It\u2019s a slow month and half for political journalists, even as rumors fill the vacuum. But even in Mr. Mugabe\u2019s absence, the grip of the only leader Zimbabwe has ever known never really loosens.\u201cWhen Mugabe goes on holiday, he goes on holiday with the state,\u201d said Pedzisai Ruhanya, a political analyst and the director of the Zimbabwe Democracy Institute, a research group. \u201cMugabe\u2019s behavior is inconsistent with practices in other countries, with general state practices. This is kind of strange.\u201dThis time, Mr. Mugabe left for Asia immediately after his party\u2019s annual conference in mid-December, which was dominated by his wife, Grace Mugabe, 51. Mr. Mugabe, the world\u2019s oldest head of state, who will be 93 in February, slept through most of the conference but was selected as his party\u2019s candidate in next year\u2019s presidential election.His party is increasingly divided by fighting over succession, and Mr. Mugabe has lost the support of longtime allies like veterans of the country\u2019s war of liberation. Zimbabwe\u2019s financial state remains so precarious that government workers were paid late in December, after Christmas, and have yet to receive their year-end bonuses.\u201cUnder normal circumstances, when things are not O.K. in your house, you wouldn\u2019t leave for such a long time,\u201d said John Masuku, a journalist who worked for 27 years at the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, including as a presidential correspondent.And yet, even in increasingly frail health, Mr. Mugabe has not cut short his annual holidays. The reality, allies and rivals alike say, is that he has secured the loyalty of the political class through patronage, eviscerated the opposition and installed relatives and close associates in important posts in the army and the police. Unlike less-secure strongmen who rarely venture abroad, Mr. Mugabe sticks to his annual routine, leaving Zimbabwe at the same time every year, and he has even lengthened his holidays in recent years.\u201cHe feels quite comfortable,\u201d said Rugare Gumbo, who was a longtime ally of Mr. Mugabe and is now in the opposition. \u201cNo one can take a chance by raising any controversial issue because he would be accused of trying to overthrow the old man.\u201dIndeed, when Mr. Mnangagwa, the acting president, was shown recently in Facebook photos holding a mug with the words, \u201cI Am the Boss,\u201d the attacks against him by party rivals were immediate and relentless. Accused of wanting to push Mr. Mugabe aside, Mr. Mnangagwa had to issue a statement to the contrary.Mr. Mugabe, a well-known Anglophile, used to spend his annual holidays in London or elsewhere in Europe. But sanctions imposed by Western governments after the seizure of white-owned farms in 2000 pushed the Mugabes to look elsewhere.The Mugabes have vacationed in Malaysia and Hong Kong as well as in the Middle East, mostly in Dubai. But Mr. Mugabe has settled in recent years on Singapore, which, in addition to having excellent Japanese food, has a leading medical tourism industry \u2014 and, perhaps most important, is a former British colony.\u201cHe finds it congenial to be in a former British colony than in any other country,\u201d Mr. Gumbo said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get pleasure in London, you might as well get it in its colonies.\u201dWith Mr. Mugabe gone, neither the government nor the ruling party bothers to hold high-level meetings.\u201cWe didn\u2019t hold cabinet meetings in Mugabe\u2019s absence because he is the one who chairs the meetings,\u201d said Didymus Mutasa, who served as a minister to Mr. Mugabe for many years and is now in the opposition. \u201cWhen Mugabe goes on leave, some of his ministers also go on leave.\u201dTendai Biti, an opposition leader who served as finance minister in a coalition government from 2009 to 2013, said that Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays have long been a drain on Zimbabwe\u2019s finances. In a system established before independence, government officials traveling overseas are given hard currency, usually American dollars, upon authorization from the Finance Ministry, Mr. Biti said.During Mr. Biti\u2019s tenure, Mr. Mugabe typically asked for $3 million for his annual holidays, and Mr. Biti said he authorized from $800,000 to $1.2 million.\u201cThe money comes as cash,\u201d Mr. Biti said. \u201cBut whether they put it in suitcases or whatever, I don\u2019t know. That was not my job.\u201dUnspent money \u2014 from Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays or his frequent trips outside Zimbabwe \u2014 is not returned to the state.\u201cIt has become a vehicle for looting,\u201d Mr. Biti said.Most high-ranking government and ruling party officials refused to comment on Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays.But Tshinga Dube, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s minister for war veterans, said that he carried out his duties the same way whether Mr. Mugabe was in or out of the country. Describing himself as an \u201cambassador\u201d serving under \u201ca Julius Caesar,\u201d Mr. Dube said, \u201cYou cannot do things differently just because he is not there.\u201dAsked about popular criticism that Mr. Mugabe is out of touch by taking such long and costly holidays while the country\u2019s economy teeters, Mr. Dube said that it was \u201ca matter of personal opinion.\u201d\u201cIt is very difficult,\u201d he added, \u201cto talk, to comment about your boss, especially on issues that relate to his health, his age, and things of that nature.\u201dJeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Norimitsu Onishi from Johannesburg.Advertisement"}

If Silicon Valley companies lose the battles, they could be forced to change how they operate not only in Europe, but also farther afield.Here is what awaits them in 2017.Google is facing three sets of antitrust charges in Europe related to some of its search services and Android, its popular smartphone operating system. Both appeals are expected to be heard by Europe\u2019s top courts in late 2017, at the earliest.The social media giant is becoming an increasing target for European officials because of its ever-expanding role in the region\u2019s economy.The ride-hailing company has been locked in a yearslong struggle to operate freely across Europe after some taxi associations and policy makers accused it of flouting local rules and promoting unfair competition.If Uber is deemed a transportation service, it will have to comply with Europe\u2019s tough taxi rules and not be able to offer some of its low-cost services. If the court rules Uber is a digital platform, the company will have greater ability to expand aggressively in the region, still one of its more important international markets.Advertisement"}

She was accused of illegally harboring a wild animal.The judge said that she knew of only one other pig that had been through the system, Ms. Matteo recalled. The judge named the pig. Ms. Matteo immediately named the pig\u2019s owner.\u201cThe judge was smiling at me,\u201d Ms. Matteo said. The judge asked if there was an underground pig network in New York. \u201cI said, \u2018More than you can imagine.\u2019\u201dAn untold number of pet pigs are scattered throughout the city, despite a ban. They can be found in all five boroughs, the veterinarians who treat them say. \u201cThere are so, so many of us,\u201d said a neighbor of Ms. Matteo\u2019s who has two pigs and gave her name only as Leslie W. Ms. Matteo said she knew of dozens.Wilbur, however, a placid 180-pounder with a fondness for orange peppers and daylong naps, is about to leave their ranks. Though the judge dismissed the violation last May, accepting Ms. Matteo\u2019s explanation that Wilbur was an emotional support animal for her and her father, the city\u2019s health department got the dismissal overturned.\u201cI\u2019m just praying that something gives between now and Jan. 31,\u201d she said on Monday as Wilbur grunted quietly beside her in her living room on Staten Island\u2019s South Shore.\u201cYou basically cannot walk her if you\u2019re in a bad mood or if you\u2019re in a hurry,\u201d said her owner, who gave her name only as Ann, citing the hostile legal climate.Ms. Matteo, who works for a tugboat company, got a piglet on a whim. \u201cI just woke up one morning and said, \u2018I\u2019m buying one,\u2019\u201d she said.That was five years \u2014 and 165 pounds \u2014 ago. Wilbur became close friends with Ms. Matteo\u2019s exuberant golden retriever mix, Milo. Wilbur was soon using a doggy door to go out into the yard to relieve himself, root around for leaves and occasionally roll in the mud. The neighbors\u2019 grandchildren fed him carrots, Ms. Matteo said.A summons followed. The inspector had observed \u201cone large black/pinkish pig lying on its bed in the living room area of the property.\u201dThe health department opposes it, for several reasons. \u201cPigs raised as house pets can become aggressive to humans,\u201d the agency said in a recent statement. Also, it noted, there is no federally approved rabies vaccine for pigs.Pig owners scoff at the notion that their pets pose a threat.At Queelin\u2019s apartment in Manhattan on Tuesday morning, the lawbreaker snoozed on her bed in the corner. Her owner\u2019s older daughter, a college student who asked to be identified only as Margret, eventually persuaded Queelin to get up. In return for treats, Queelin (an Anglicization of her real name, Caoilfhionn, which means \u201cfair and slender\u201d in Irish) sat like a dog and kissed Margret on the lips. Margret lay down on the couch, and Queelin climbed up and plopped on top of her.\u201cShe knows how to trap you because she puts her big head on you,\u201d Margret said as she stroked Queelin\u2019s black-and-white bristles. \u201cThen she\u2019s so happy.\u201d Queelin gave a soft snort of agreement.Email: petcity@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

Then you don\u2019t know the first thing about her.She\u2019s no mere mouthpiece, no measly surrogate. She\u2019s more like the David Blaine of political spin, intent on working feats of magic that few others would attempt and surviving situations that would cripple any ordinary mortal. He catches a bullet in his mouth; she makes Donald Trump sound like a humble servant of the common man. He lasts 44 days in a plexiglass case over the Thames; she lasts 40 minutes with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.As the cabinet nominees submit to their inquisitions and Trump holds his first news conference since the election, there\u2019s a surfeit of political spectacle this week.But for sheer, jaw-dropping wonder, I doubt that any of it will improve on a typical Conway television interview, which is a circus of euphemisms, a festival of distractions and a testament to the stamina of a willed smile. She looks cheery when attacking, even cheerier when attacked and absolutely radiant when descending into a bog of half-truths and fictions. It\u2019s always sunny on Conway\u2019s side of the street.She also questioned why Streep would go after Trump and not the \u201cfour young African-American adults in Chicago screaming racial anti-Trump expletives\u201d at a disabled young man in that chilling Facebook Live video. Is this the new bar for taking Trump to task? You can\u2019t do it until you\u2019ve completed a roll call of every bully in the news?That was the occasion of my favorite Conway-ism. She was asked if Trump\u2019s baseless insistence that he would have won the popular vote except for millions of illegal ballots constituted presidential behavior.\u201cHe\u2019s the president-elect, so that\u2019s presidential behavior,\u201d she said.Many journalists don\u2019t get Conway quite right, either, assigning her more power in Trump World than she has. When you\u2019re doing that much TV, you can be in only so many meetings.What she possesses is a showmanship that Trump can\u2019t help appreciating. I know dozens of people who despise her politics but are mesmerized by her performances. She\u2019s the Streep of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d (of \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d too) and a perfect emblem of these polarized times, when no claim is too laughable or denial too ludicrous if it counters the supposed insidiousness of the other side.She\u2019s also the gold-haired standard for a rising generation of unflappable partisans. I imagine that Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump apologist on CNN, studies her moves the way a backup quarterback watches the starter. Should Conway go down with a broken fibula, McEnany\u2019s ready to lead the drive.The Trump booster Anthony Scaramucci is perhaps another of the sorceress\u2019 apprentices. With MSNBC\u2019s Stephanie Ruhle last week, he was Conway-esque in pivoting from the questions he was asked to the answers he preferred to give.Advertisement"}

The problem Bloom appears to be addressing is not the exercise of empathy per se, but rather the restriction of empathy only to those whom we deem to be like us, as opposed to being \u201cother\u201d on the basis of ethnicity, gender or any other dichotomy that divides rather than unifies members of our species (or even members of other species who may be less articulate but no less sentient).The problem is not too much or too little empathy, but the failure to see some others as fundamentally like ourselves, despite differences that are ultimately superficial.BEN SUSSWEINORLEANS, MASS.*To the Editor:As an ordained clergyman of a religion whose core message is \u201cLove the stranger,\u201d I empathize with Simon Baron-Cohen\u2019s wish to expand the ethical contours of empathy.

Not only did Allen\u2019s catty description of Mary\u2019s affair with the much older John Barrymore when she was 17 make for very uncomfortable reading, the creepily outdated lens that Allen turns on Mary (in just one of many examples, as, say, one who subjected her boyfriends to a \u201ctrial by mattress that seems to trip up certain men\u201d in her life) was also cringeworthy.

{"Headline": "A Trial and a Twitterstorm: On Live-Tweeting From a Federal Courthouse", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byOr so I thought.As I walked into a federal court in Dallas last Tuesday, waiting to hear the Facebook founder\u2019s testimony, my pockets were filled with the items typical of a paranoid tech reporter on deadline: a laptop, my iPhone, spare batteries, charging cables, backup charging cables, a digital voice recorder, seven different ink pens and at least four of my favorite notebooks. I would broadcast his words to the world as quickly as I could, or watch my laptop die trying.Here is what I was not prepared for: A stern, six-foot tall retired United States Marshal, built like a brick house and with little time for pleasantries, telling me he\u2019d kick me out of the courthouse if I sent one more tweet about the trial.I should back up a bit.It\u2019s rare that a reporter covers a case whose star witness is the chief executive of a software company used daily by most of the people in the courtroom. This day was even more special, as Mr. Zuckerberg was being forced to defend his company against a $2 billion intellectual property lawsuit claiming theft of virtual reality technology.For my purposes, the case itself was almost an afterthought. I flew the 1,400 miles from my home in San Francisco to Dallas to hear what would come out of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s mouth when scrutinized outside of Silicon Valley, under oath, by hostile attorneys, in full view of the public. And what\u2019s more, only a handful of other reporters actually showed up to the trial, likely seeing little of interest coming out of it.It was a tech reporter\u2019s gold mine. Mr. Zuckerberg spent hours detailing his vision of the future, rattling off a ticktock of how some of Facebook\u2019s biggest deals went down \u2014 including the unexpected purchase price of Oculus, which disclosed for the first time an extra $1 billion in extended goal agreements \u2014 straight from the horse\u2019s mouth. While I typed up notes and worked on a broader story anchored by my colleague, Nick Wingfield, I knew I had to get the juicy details out much faster.What I did not know, as a tech reporter, is how tricky it is to actually live a connected life inside a federal courtroom.Typically, in the courtroom of the honorable Judge Ed Kinkeade in the Northern District of Texas, where I found myself sitting last Tuesday, only lawyers and those with special permission were allowed to bring any technology more modern than a pen and pad of paper into the courtroom. For Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance, Judge Kinkeade made a special allowance and let outside reporters like myself use electronics for the session.Perhaps it was because it was a fairly slow technology news day, or maybe because few Facebook reporters bothered to attend the trial, but my tweets, along with a handful of others in the courtroom, began to take off. Competing websites built entire articles based solely on the information in our tweets. CNBC referenced the information coming out of our Twitter feeds live on television.I knew that if I were to take any photos of Mr. Zuckerberg, I would be kicked out of court immediately \u2014 a fact that David Travis, the retired U.S. Marshal and current courtroom security officer I previously mentioned, made clear on Tuesday morning. I didn\u2019t think live-tweeting the courtroom proceedings amounted to much more than me producing a running, up-to-the-minute story of what was going on inside. (In tech land, for instance, live-blogs are commonplace in something as rote as the introduction of a new cellphone, much less the founder of Facebook testifying in a lawsuit.)But after we came back from a lunch break, Mr. Travis made a new announcement: \u201cNo live-streaming or live-tweeting the case proceedings.\u201d I stopped, aside from some tweets sent outside of the courtroom when we were on midafternoon breaks.Bright and early the next day, Mr. Travis greeted me \u2014 by name \u2014 with an even clearer warning: \u201cIf I see you tweeting in there today, I will eject you from the courtroom.\u201dMr. Travis, though stern and not exactly full of smiles, was nothing but polite in delivering his orders, a request of the court after someone had figured out that my tweets had been picked up by local, national and international media. I mulled breaking the rules as an act of First Amendment principle, but I also weighed that against missing out on any further testimony from Mr. Zuckerberg or other high profile witnesses. In the end, I agreed to what the court ordered, and was not kicked out.The trial \u2014 and its tribulations \u2014 was far from the troubles some of my colleagues deal with in the field. But it reminded me of how thorny issues remain in public speech and broadcasting, even to this day, as technology outpaces courtroom rules and precedent, and lawmakers struggle to define even in broad terms what should and should not be permissible. At best, the rules are fluid and flexible; at worst, they\u2019re ignorant to the demands of the present.While I\u2019m not sounding a \u201ctweet free or die\u201d battle cry, I do hope some more of that flexibility granted in Judge Kinkeade\u2019s court continues, as other tweet-happy members of the press and public attend trials in the future.Officer Travis and I shook hands before I walked out of the courtroom and flew back to San Francisco, the land of tweets and snaps, a landscape much more familiar to me. He was cordial and wished me well, though he still did not smile much.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Seem Invincible. That Worries Lawmakers.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech \u2014 from IBM to Hewlett-Packard to Cisco to Yahoo \u2014 were eventually outmaneuvered by start-ups that came out of nowhere.The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place.Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable.In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world\u2019s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will.The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump\u2019s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds.This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year.Let\u2019s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends \u2014 mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs.Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech \u2014 on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance.The Five aren\u2019t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple\u2019s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet\u2019s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren\u2019t entirely safe from competition from start-ups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot.Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from start-ups; today\u2019s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five.But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you\u2019re supposed to in America \u2014 by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren\u2019t considered that bad. They weren\u2019t causing environmental disasters. They weren\u2019t selling cigarettes. They weren\u2019t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five\u2019s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn\u2019t I called them the Fabulous Five?Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with.During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos\u2019s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry\u2019s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public.For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised \u2014 entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others.\u201cDuring the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U.S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,\u201d said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them.During Mr. Genachowski\u2019s term at the F.C.C., and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201d which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies.But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. \u201cThe next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things \u2014 battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,\u201d he said.That\u2019s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger \u2014 their benefits to society as well as their potential costs \u2014 when deciding how to police them.But there\u2019s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today\u2019s start-ups. The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining, voice-activated assistants, self-driving cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five.That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more; and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful.Advertisement"}

And by the way, the barbecue stations during cocktail hour were provided courtesy of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7.Finally, for the business executives in the room who are wondering if this free meal violates your conflict-of-interest policy, don\u2019t worry; see what your legal department says when you tell it, \u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for the president, it\u2019s good enough for me.\u201dNow, on to the toasts \u2014 and some predictions for the new year.Let\u2019s start with predictions, given that everyone, myself included, seemed to be so wrong about everything in 2016 \u2014 Trump, Brexit, the way the stock market would go. Instead of offering conventional predictions, I\u2019m going to offer up some Black Swans \u2014 things that were considered unthinkable but may now be thinkable, in a blue-sky, the-world-is-upside-down kind of way. Consider some of these thought experiments, if nothing else.This one may be slightly more plausible: Masayoshi Son, the billionaire controlling shareholder of Sprint \u2014 and a newfound friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who pledged to invest $100 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs \u2014 makes a bid to merge Sprint with T-Mobile. Under most antitrust analysis, such a deal would be dead on arrival. But perhaps under a new business-friendly administration \u2014 and given Mr. Son\u2019s public support for the president-elect \u2014 the transaction gets the green light?Here\u2019s another: With the possibility that the Trump\u2019s administration will undo net-neutrality laws that allow content companies to transmit unlimited data over cable company pipes, Netflix will finally accept a takeover bid \u2014 from Disney, which has been looking for a way to create an even stronger direct relationship with its customers. It would be Robert A. Iger\u2019s final megadeal before his contract expires in 2018. It would also pave the way for Mr. Iger to hire digitally savvy Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, a Disney board member, to take over for him.John G. Stumpf, the chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo, wasn\u2019t supposed to end his career this way. He is a reasonable and \u2014 dare I say \u2014 decent man, yet he led a bank engaged in one of the most blatant financial scandals in recent memory. Wells opened up millions of accounts without the permission of its customers, just to goose internal numbers. In truth, customers lost only $1.5 million, which, if we\u2019re being honest, is minuscule for a bank the size of Wells Fargo. The problem is that Mr. Stumpf treated it as a blip on the radar screen and ignored the significant damage his bank was doing to real people. And when he was called to account, he didn\u2019t have the right answers. Ultimately, he resigned, which was the right decision. But it could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 all been avoided.President and Michelle Obama couldn\u2019t make it to dinner (the venue might have been a turnoff). But whatever you think of his stewardship of the nation, he deserves our thanks. For those of us who pay attention to economic statistics, Mr. Obama walked into the worst economic crisis in recent history. We are now in the longest economic expansion and monthly job creation in history. Was he alone responsible? No, but it happened on his watch. Could we have gone faster with different policies? Very possibly. We will see just how much faster we can grow and if there is a cost to doing so under the next administration. Was he perfect? Of course not. But in a town that\u2019s filled with scandals and red flags about conflicts of interest \u2014 which are often skewered in this annual column \u2014 the Obamas stand out for avoiding those questions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel, Russia\u2019s Next Target", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 It\u2019s no surprise that Russia met President Obama\u2019s expulsion of its diplomats, which he announced Thursday in response to the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to manipulate the 2016 election, with a collective shrug. Moscow seems content to let the clock run out, knowing that on Jan. 20 Mr. Obama will be replaced by an admirer in the White House and an old friend in the State Department.But the changeover is bittersweet; President Vladimir V. Putin has also lost a beloved boogeyman. For the foreseeable future, the United States can hardly serve as Russia\u2019s preferred enemy of the state. So guess who qualifies best as a new, well, boogeywoman? Angela Merkel.The German chancellor is a perfect target. Germany is holding general elections next autumn, and with politicians sympathetic to Moscow on the rise, she may well be running for her fourth term as the sole European leader willing to stand up to a newly assertive Russia.Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ms. Merkel has been the most consequential voice for punishing Russia. The next year, she welcomed a million refugees into Germany, and pushed the rest of Europe to do the same \u2014 thus, in the view of Russian ethno-nationalists, diluting European culture. And she still believes in a united, integrated European Union, a bastion of liberal values and, at least implicitly, a political and economic bulwark against Russia.It seems that Russia may be planning to do to Ms. Merkel and her allies in 2017 what it did to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats in the United States in 2016.After all, last year the same hackers who broke into the Democratic Party\u2019s computers, known online as Fancy Bear or Sofacy Group, attacked the German Parliament\u2019s network; they are also accused of stealing documents from individual members of Parliament. Every revelation about how Russia interfered in the American elections gives Germany a foretaste of what is already looking to be the nastiest, toughest, most exhausting election campaign in modern German history.That foretaste, though, is also Germany\u2019s one advantage. We know something about Russians\u2019 technical abilities and methods, and, even more important, we have a developing sense of where they\u2019re coming from ideologically \u2014 and how that will guide their attacks.Here, we can draw valuable lessons from the Cold War. What Russia does today is very much the digital version of what we Germans, before 1989, termed \u201cZersetzung.\u201d The term is hard to translate, but it\u2019s best described as the political equivalent of what happens when you pour acid on organic material: dissolution and disintegration.The methods of Zersetzung are to cast doubt on the basic norms of the Western liberal order and its institutions; to distort and thereby discredit the purposes of the European Union, NATO and the free-market economy; to erode the credibility of the free press and free elections. The means of Zersetzung include character assassination and, through the spreading of lies and fake news, the creation of a gray zone of doubt in which facts struggle to survive.We have seen all of this before, employed by the K.G.B. and the East German Stasi: psychological warfare, rumor-mongering, schemes to bribe politicians and then expose them as criminals. They used it both internally, against dissidents, and externally, against Western enemies. Mr. Putin and his former K.G.B. colleagues should know that, this time, we have a better sense of their dirty tricks, and how they have updated Zersetzung for the internet.The government has its role to play, but so do journalists and civil-society groups. We journalists will put pressure on companies like Facebook and Twitter to be vigilant against fake news; we will expose the patterns of Russian agitprop where we see them.But it is just as important to be clear about the ideology driving these attacks. In September, my newspaper, Die Zeit, joined with the broadcaster ZDF to reveal details of Moscow\u2019s highly sophisticated disinformation campaign. We had gained access to roughly 10,000 emails that showed how ideologues close to the Putin administration advised the pro-Russian rebel government in Eastern Ukraine.No doubt similar marching orders have been given to the armies of hackers who were sent to attack the Democrats, and who are now plotting attacks on Germany.It is quite clear who will lose. Mr. Putin and his reckless fakers should be aware that the only thing they will harvest from this mendacity is another lost generation of Russians who could serve their country better by being given the opportunity for honest and constructive intellectual challenges. A government that maligns the outside world to make feel Russia great again is doomed to fail \u2014 as it failed before.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

He lay collapsed on his mother\u2019s chest while everyone else danced; he died on Nov. 6.The remission had felt like a miracle; even the members of Andrew\u2019s medical team used the word. We think of miracles \u2014 in their nature \u2014 as enduring. But because the remission proved temporary, did his family feel that it had been a mirage, a cruel reprieve that tortured them with hope?His parents told me that the reprieve had granted Andrew one more candle on his cake: the chance to live out the life of a 2-year-old. \u201cIf Andrew had died back then, he would have died as a baby,\u201d Esther said. \u201cWe never would have had a chance to know him as a little boy.\u201d He had become the little boy with the giant toothy grin that his sister, Lea, said was like the shape of an apple slice and soft black fuzzy hair, perfect for patting; the little boy who would belt out Pharrell Williams\u2019s \u201cHappy\u201d at all times of the day and knew the lyrics to the songs on the Billboard Top 50.The Levys rejected a religious justification for Andrew\u2019s death (\u201cThe \u2018God needs another angel\u2019 theory?\u201d Dan said. \u201cI have trouble with that.\u201d) But they tried to think of Andrew\u2019s life as complete and to celebrate that life, in all its fullness, rather than dwelling on how it should have been different.\u201cCruel, unfair, gone too soon \u2014 that was not us or our focus,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI think that\u2019s because we had that miracle time, so we didn\u2019t have to be angry at the end.\u201d On the eighth night of Hanukkah, they reflected how the eight months Andrew was restored to health was like the Hanukkah candle that burned an extra eight days. Dan wrote on Facebook: \u201cTonight we commemorate all of our miracles. Even those that didn\u2019t last.\u201dEsther said: \u201cWe had people tell us that if only they had their relative back for a single hour, they would be happy. We got that hour. We got a year.\u201dThe Bing yard also contained a particular hole, often filled with water, that Andrew would run to every day, gleefully stomping with his red boots, soaking his entire body. Peters recounted that one day, Andrew was dismayed to discover his hole was dry, and Lea took a bucket and filled it up for him. After that, other children recognized it as Andrew\u2019s hole and made sure that it was always filled with water for him to splash.At the memorial service, Esther spoke about her time with Andrew in the isolation unit at the hospital after the bone-marrow transplant in the winter of 2015. She and Andrew would put on gold paper crowns and hold dance parties, jigging the chains of his IV. \u201cHe did not know what life looked like outside of the hospital and had no idea what he was missing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was him, and it was me, and as long as we were together, we had no reason not to be happy.\u201d She focused on how rarely parents have the opportunity to spend such lengths of time with a child, especially a third one: to be alone together, best friends, their bodies touching most of the time.Dan addressed Andrew directly at the service, the beginning of a monologue that he hoped they would continue for the rest of their lives. \u201cDear Andrew,\u201d he said, \u201cI wish that you could see what I see now. I\u2019m looking out at a room filled with hundreds of people who love you.\u201d He recalled how Andrew hated it when his mother would cry, telling her: \u201cNo tears. Get a tissue.\u201d \u201cWhen your mom\u2019s voice would tremble, talking to a nurse or friend, despite Sugar or another Maroon 5 hit blasting from your iPad \u2014 you knew,\u201d Dan said. \u201c\u2018Feel better!\u2019 you\u2019d shout without turning to look.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sensing that their bug was in fact a feature, the two dropped the chess project immediately and hurled themselves at the light trails, hoping to develop a tool for drawing in three dimensions.This is hardly the kind of reception the two inventors were expecting when they started working on it in Mr. Skillman\u2019s apartment, a 400-square-foot studio in South Park, the little neighborhood that has been a hub for San Francisco\u2019s digerati since the 1990s. \u201cNot in our wildest dreams,\u201d said Mr. Skillman, a slightly built 36-year-old with a neatly trimmed beard and a modest, unassuming manner.Tilt Brush got its name because in its earliest versions, you would draw or paint on a two-dimensional surface that could be tilted in any direction in virtual space. But because the HTC Vive includes not just a virtual reality headset but also a pair of hand-held controllers and two tracking sensors that map your movement in space, the program was revamped to enable you to paint or draw anywhere within a room-sized area \u2014 no surface required.One controller serves as a palette, with dozens of colors and effects; the other acts as a brush or pen. To watch someone use it is a bit unnerving, since the person appears to be making marks in midair, but you can\u2019t actually see those. But put on a Vive headset and step between the sensors yourself \u2014 as I did in a windowless room in Google\u2019s New York offices \u2014 and the illusion of delusion disappears. Instead, you suddenly see what has been produced: a phantom creation in three dimensions, something you can walk around, walk through, poke your head inside, do everything except touch.\u201cWhen I left Disney in 2012,\u201d Mr. Keane said recently in his studio, a vintage bungalow on a quiet residential street in West Hollywood, Calif., \u201cI told them it was because I know there\u2019s something new coming \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it is, but I need to leave to find it.\u201dSo, what are people going to use it for?

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban Draws Deep Anger and Muted Praise", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byA group of Nobel Prize winners said it would damage American leadership in higher education and research. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and some relatives of Americans killed in terrorist attacks said it was right on target. An evangelical Christian group called it an affront to human dignity.The reaction on Saturday to President Trump\u2019s ban on refugees entering the United States, with particular focus on certain Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa, was swift, certain \u2014 and sharply divided.And around the world, allies and critics alike voiced concern about what the new American policy could mean.St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for the United Nations, said, \u201cWe hope that these measures are temporary, as refugee protection needs have never been greater.\u201d And Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada used his Twitter feed to reiterate his government\u2019s open policy toward refugees, particularly those from Syria.International reaction, though, was far from uniform. Politicians who have called for restricting Muslim immigration have gained support in a number of European countries, and one of them, Geert Wilders of the Netherlands, praised Mr. Trump on Twitter: \u201cI would do the same. Hope you\u2019ll add more Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia soon.\u201dStill, some immigration policy experts in the United States questioned the logic behind the action. They noted that terrorists who had carried out attacks in the United States had not entered as refugees, and that Muslim attackers had been born here or came from countries like Pakistan or Saudi Arabia \u2014 which were not on the list of seven mostly Muslim countries that the administration has singled out for a halt to entry.The president\u2019s executive order, issued on Friday, brought a positive, if muted, reaction from some Republicans, and could prove popular politically.Michael Banerian, 22, who was a Trump elector in the Electoral College, and is the youth vice chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, said he saw the president\u2019s more narrowly tailored order as common sense. \u201cI feel that it\u2019s a necessary step for us to take for the security of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s un-American. I think it\u2019s very reasonable.\u201dKathleen Ganci, 67, whose husband, Peter J. Ganci Jr., the highest-ranking uniformed officer of the New York Fire Department, was killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, said she supported the order, too.\u201cI don\u2019t care how difficult it makes it for these people to come over,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want other Americans to go through what I did \u2014 because we have to care for our own first, before we care for others.\u201dAnd Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that seeks to restrict immigration, said it makes sense to suspend the refugee program temporarily, examine it, \u201cand at least begin to initiate some changes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what form those changes will take, and I\u2019m not sure the administration knows yet,\u201d he said.The executive order put an indefinite halt to citizens of Syria, a country racked by civil war and an immense refugee crisis, entering the United States. It suspended immigration for 90 days from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also suspended the nation\u2019s program for admitting refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days, while the government comes up with a stricter process for vetting them, but allowed for exceptions for persecuted religious minorities, like Christians in Muslim countries.Many other leading congressional Republicans did not make statements on the matter, including Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader.By Saturday afternoon, members of Congress were hearing from constituents whose friends or relatives were detained at airports.Mr. Dent said he was awakened by his college-aged son, whose Syrian-American friend had six family members being held at Philadelphia\u2019s airport on Saturday morning, though they had valid documents to enter the country. The congressman said that despite his attempts to intervene with government officials, the family was placed on a flight bound for Qatar.\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThe order was rushed through without any nuances toward immigration policy, and this can be life or death for some people.\u201dGoogle\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in India, sent a memo to the company\u2019s workers saying that as many as 187 of its employees were affected.The A.C.L.U. and other legal organizations filed a lawsuit on Saturday on behalf of individuals subject to President Trump's executive order. The lead plaintiffs were detained by the U.S. government and threatened with deportation.In a note to his employees, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, said, \u201cApple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s order, he said, \u201cis not a policy we support.\u201dSome colleges and universities had urged students who might be affected by Mr. Trump\u2019s policies to return to the United States before Inauguration Day if they were abroad, or to remain in the country if they were already here.The seven countries covered by the temporary ban have about 13,000 citizens who are college or graduate students in the United States, said the American Council on Education. The group said it was unclear how many were stuck abroad. \u201cIt is clearly up to the federal government to decide how to safeguard our nation, but at the same time, it is in America\u2019s interest to remain the destination of choice for the world\u2019s students and scholars,\u201d said Terry W. Hartle, the group\u2019s executive vice president.The president\u2019s action poses a particular challenge to Christian leaders whose followers have largely supported Mr. Trump, but whose organizations are among the most active on behalf of refugees.Jen Smyers, director of policy and advocacy for the immigration and refugee program of Church World Service, said that the executive order was \u201cakin to President Trump taking a wrecking ball to the Statue of Liberty.\u201dAs reports circulated about travelers being stopped upon arrival, protests broke out at several airports, including San Francisco International, O\u2019Hare in Chicago, Dulles outside Washington and Kennedy in New York.By sundown the boisterous crowd shouting \u201cLet them in!\u201d at Kennedy\u2019s Terminal 4 had spread along the parking apron, the ramp to the elevator and on three floors of the adjoining parking deck. Airport officials briefly closed the shuttle train to Kennedy before Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, in a show of solidarity with protesters, ordered it reopened.One of the protesters, Jacki Esposito, an immigration lawyer from Brooklyn, said of the officials deciding the refugees\u2019 fate: \u201cWe want to let them know we are watching.\u201dReporting was contributed by Laurie Goodstein, Liz Robbins, Andy Newman, Sean Piccoli and Somini Sengupta from New York; Mitch Smith from Chicago; Michael D.

{"Headline": "The President Who Buried Humility", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The word popped up in the opening sentence of Barack Obama\u2019s first Inaugural Address and in the opening paragraphs of George W. Bush\u2019s.\u201cHumbled,\u201d each man said of himself, and while it was pure clich\u00e9, it was also what we wanted and needed: a sign, no matter how rote, that even someone self-assured enough to pursue the presidency was taking the measure of that responsibility and asking if he was worthy of it.Does that question cross Donald Trump\u2019s mind?I don\u2019t think so. I certainly didn\u2019t get that sense from his inaugural remarks, and not just because \u201chumbled\u201d went missing. As he stood just feet from four of the last six presidents, he trashed them, talking about a Washington establishment blind and deaf to the struggles of less fortunate Americans.He characterized his election as part of \u201ca historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen.\u201d Forget about his loss of the popular vote. Or his 40 percent favorability rating. Or the puny crowd at his inauguration in comparison with the throngs at Obama\u2019s eight years ago. Trump remained a singular man on a singular mission \u2014 a legend in his own mind.We\u2019ve already become so accustomed to his egomania that we sometimes forget how remarkable it is. He\u2019s a braggart beyond his predecessors in the Oval Office, and that says something sad and scary about the country that elected him and the kind of leader he\u2019s likely to be. With Trump we enter a new age of arrogance. He\u2019s the cock crowing at its dawn.His first stop after arriving here on Thursday afternoon for the inaugural festivities was his recently opened hotel, a transformation of the Old Post Office. He pronounced its principal ballroom \u201cgorgeous\u201d and declared that \u201ca total genius must have built this place.\u201d He was referring to himself.Then, talking about his nominees for top administration jobs, he said: \u201cWe have, by far, the highest I.Q. of any cabinet ever assembled.\u201d That\u2019s obviously unknowable. But it\u2019s entirely in keeping with his nonstop insistence that everything about him is magical, epochal, amazing.As he went through the traditional inaugural paces, he toggled between the dignified bearing expected of a man in his role and the coarse bravado that he prefers.His remarks to his supporters at the Lincoln Memorial early Thursday evening included the assertion that his victory was really theirs. \u201cYou had much more to do with it than I did,\u201d he told them. \u201cI\u2019m just the messenger.\u201dAnd while he kept his remarks at the inauguration brief and said \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d much more often than \u201cI,\u201d that\u2019s exactly why they were so flaccid. To find his full voice, he must be singing his own praises.It was a dark speech, bemoaning \u201cthis American carnage\u201d of gangs and drugs. It was a mean speech, insulting every one of his new colleagues by describing politicians as \u201call talk and no action \u2014 constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.\u201dBut mostly it was a flat speech, bereft of the poetry that this tense juncture called for. He used pared-down language, simple sentences and a sluggish delivery, as if he were reading to children. Call it the \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d of Inaugural Addresses.He does as he pleases, expectations be damned, and indeed the most striking aspect of Trump\u2019s transition was an absence of humility. Although he owed his Electoral College win to just 77,000 votes in three states, and it was clouded by questions about James Comey and the Russians, he didn\u2019t bother much with outreach to adversaries or appeals for unity.He put together that high-I.Q. team of his with few of the usual courtesies and considerations. None of his cabinet nominees are Democrats. None is Latino. Only one, Ben Carson, his choice for housing secretary, is black.Every president in my lifetime has been conceited. It\u2019s more or less a job requirement. Bush had a bloated faith in his gut and his charm, while Obama fancied himself the smartest, most soulful person in almost any room.But they were nothing like Trump, who\u2019s a preening cartoon. He brags like he breathes. It\u2019s autonomic. And he gloats the way our parents and teachers always told us not to.But that admonition predated Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. Social media have blurred the line between sharing and showing off, and they\u2019ve turned self-promotion into a tic. In our private and our professional lives, we\u2019re prodded to burnish our images, to advertise our assets, to sell, sell, sell. Is it any wonder, then, that we looked up on Friday to see, in front of the Capitol, taking the oath of office, a gaudy confidence man who\u2019s all about the sale? Is it any accident?His campaign was an unprecedented orgy of self-congratulation. At the start of almost every rally, he trumpeted his poll numbers, and I don\u2019t mean a few quick bleats \u2014 I mean a vulgar music that could go on for minutes. At the conclusion of almost every debate, he announced how brilliantly he\u2019d done.At the Republican National Convention, warning of national decline, he thundered, \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d And in the months before and after, he complimented himself out loud and lavishly on everything from the magnitude of his wealth to the majesty of his phallus. That might have disqualified him in another era, but Americans stomached it. More than that, they rewarded it, proving that ours is a different moment, with different mores.Presidential? Hah! But neither was the tweet that wished a \u201cHappy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don\u2019t know what to do. Love!\u201dIt\u2019s staggering, and it\u2019s endless. During his only real news conference as president-elect, he mused that he could master the management of the country and of his business simultaneously, noting that while the law bars other government officials from such double duty, there\u2019s no such formal restriction on the president.\u201cI would be the only one that would be able to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI could run the Trump Organization \u2014 great, great company \u2014 and I could run the country. I\u2019d do a very good job.\u201d It was like a Russian nesting doll of self-infatuation: boast within boast within boast.Still, he\u2019s no Trump. Who is? Maybe Howard Roark, the protagonist of \u201cThe Fountainhead,\u201d by Ayn Rand. Roark must defend his creative genius against the meddling of lesser mortals. Trump once described the novel as profound.A humbler man would doubt himself, extend an olive branch to his enemies, contemplate a middle ground. But then a humbler man wouldn\u2019t have come down that escalator at Trump Tower and proceed to say what Trump said and do what he did. As I watched him flourish, I watched humility die. On Friday, our 45th president said its last rites.Advertisement"}

Hopping on his motorbike with his camera, Mr. Akinleye, a Reuters staff photographer based in Nigeria, swerved through miles of thick traffic and arrived on site in less than 30 minutes.Mr. Akinleye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sudden thrust into news media prominence is rare for even the most experienced photojournalists, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an even rarer occurrence for an African one. Of the most covered news events in sub-Saharan Africa over the past several years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including antigovernment protests in South Africa and Ethiopia, the Boko Haram kidnapping in northern Nigeria and West Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ebola crisis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 only a handful of stories were assigned to African photographers by major international publications. Looking at the previously published work from Akintunde Akinleye, Andrew Esiebo, LagosPhoto and more.Since World Press Photo released its initial report in 2015, Lars Boering, the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s managing director, said accessing data about their contest applicants as well as surveying the photojournalism industry were critical first steps in closing this gap. The organization recently held its first Joop Swart Master Class in Kenya, working with photographers across East Africa, and plans to host another one, in Accra, Ghana, this March. Other organizations, including the Magnum Foundation and the Prince Claus fund, have also invested in supporting photojournalists on the continent.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe needed to flip it open. It will make us vulnerable, but it was important to start talking about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Boering, who is based in Amsterdam. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a billion people living in Africa. We should make sure the visuals we get reflect our worldview.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Akinleye, who has spent the past decade covering West Africa for Reuters, said as digital cameras have become more accessible, he has seen a surge in the number of local photographers in the field. But better equipment hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily equated to more opportunities for aspiring photojournalists, he said. With the absence of formal photojournalism programs at universities, young photographers are not learning the fundamentals of storytelling and editing, Mr. Akinleye said. Independent newspapers in his country have also struggled to navigate hostile relations with government leaders known for threatening the local news media, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung people are asking, how do we get work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Akinleye, who noted that the majority of working photographers he knew in Africa were stringers for wire services.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have told them to look for opportunities abroad to gain exposure and to learn the ethical standards of the industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t working with Reuters, I probably would just be part of the crowd.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had taxi drivers and former studio photographers and we gave them cameras,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said two-time Pulitzer prize winning photojournalist, Muhammed Muheisen, who is currently the chief photographer for the Middle East, Pakistan and Afghanistan for the AP. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe region was getting a lot of attention, so it became a place where Iraqi photographers could develop and show their talent.\u00e2\u0080\u009dKhalid Mohammed, AP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief photographer in Iraq, was one of those emerging talents. Mr. Mohammed, who worked for an Iraqi newspaper before the war, gained the reputation of beating foreign photojournalists to deadly scenes and was one of six Iraqis on the AP team that won the Pulitzer Prize for photography in 2005. Many of his most striking images, including one showing the charred bodies of U.S. contractors hanging from a bridge in Fallujah in 2004, appeared  in publications around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI choose to cover the war to expose the crimes and violations against my people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Mohammed, who is currently in Mosul, wrote in an email interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had to be ready to accept the sacrifice and know that this picture may be the last image,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Mr. Muheisen, a Jordanian national born in Israel, said that until news organizations begin investing in more extensive coverage of African news, African photographers might have to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfind and broadcast their own stories\u00e2\u0080\u009d on various social media platforms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll you need to do is pay some attention to that region and give the photographers a chance to appear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Muheisen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no better way to tell a story then when you are in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a big believer in looking at images globally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Muluneh, who was born in Ethiopia and raised in Yemen and England. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to look beyond our borders to see what other photographers are producing in order for us to compete in the industry as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During the year, Ms. Muluneh, who worked as a freelance photographer at The Washington Post before returning to Ethiopia in 2007, puts on a series of monthly photography workshops for developing photographers with her company Desta for Africa Creative Consulting. Using social media and e-mail blasts to promote coming events, Ms. Muluneh also organizes photo walks, where she can reach younger photographers who may use only cellphone cameras. She said she organized her biennial photo festival in 2010 for an international market with hopes that editors at top news organizations would travel to Ethiopia and meet new talent.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to send somebody here to photograph,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Muluneh said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are folks here that are doing the work that just haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been given the opportunity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interested in photojournalism, but Africa has become a playground for photographers coming to tell the \u00e2\u0080\u0098truth\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about the continent and they get stuck on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098hopeless\u00e2\u0080\u0099 narrative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in the Lens post. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can sculpt so much more than this.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs budget cuts hit newsrooms across the country, Alice Gabriner, Time magazine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s international photo editor, said there was less money to assign long-term photo stories. To offset costs, Ms. Gabriner said she had to look for photographers with completed bodies of work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something she hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consistently found with African photographers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not seeing African photographers who are coming to me with their work saying this is work I can pick up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Gabriner, who previously worked as a national photo editor for Time, as well as a senior photo editor at National Geographic. To find new work, Ms. Gabriner travels to photo festivals and meets with photographers in her New York office, though she has not yet attended a photo festival in Africa. Like many editors, she said, she also prefers to work with photographers whom she knows and whose judgments she understands.Marco Longari, the chief African photographer for Agence France-Presse, has also been responsible for coordinating staffing and coverage of sub-Saharan Africa since 2015. His approach for recruiting photographers differs depending on the location, he said, as local talent in news media hubs like Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria are typically easier to recruit than in smaller regions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I am on location in different countries, I try to meet with new photographers and look at their work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Italian-born Mr. Longari, who is based in Johannesburg. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe set guidelines and manage expectations early on, so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any misunderstandings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn certain areas of the continent, the idea of photography is not yet developed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, noting that many photojournalists he meets are also working wedding photographers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe equipment is there. The focus should now be on visual literacy training.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs these programs continue to sprout in the region, Mr. Esiebo says he hopes African photographers will depend less on being published in international publications, but instead raise the standards of publications in their home countries.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do we raise the standards of our papers to be like The New York Times?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Esiebo asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should start from home and tell our stories better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

Who\u2019d have thunk it?And what was this tipping point?After all, there are no stoplights in cyberspace, no police officers walking the beat, no courts, no judges, no God who smites evil and rewards good, and certainly no \u201c1-800-Call-If-Putin-Hacks-Your-Election.\u201d If someone slimes you on Twitter or Facebook, well, unless it is a death threat, good luck getting it removed, especially if it is done anonymously, which in cyberspace is quite common.And yet this realm is where we now spend increasing hours of our day. Cyberspace is now where we do more of our shopping, more of our dating, more of our friendship-making and sustaining, more of our learning, more of our commerce, more of our teaching, more of our communicating, more of our news-broadcasting and news-seeking and more of our selling of goods, services and ideas.It\u2019s where both our president-elect and the leader of ISIS can communicate with equal ease with tens of millions of their respective followers through Twitter \u2014 without editors, fact-checkers, libel lawyers or other filters.And, I would argue, 2016 will be remembered as the year when we fully grasped just how scary that can be \u2014 how easy it was for a presidential candidate to tweet out untruths and half-truths faster than anyone could correct them, how cheap it was for Russia to intervene on Trump\u2019s behalf with hacks of Democratic operatives\u2019 computers and how unnerving it was to hear Yahoo\u2019s chief information security officer, Bob Lord, say that his company still had \u201cnot been able to identify\u201d how one billion Yahoo accounts and their sensitive user information were hacked in 2013.Even President Obama was taken aback by the speed at which this tipping point tipped. \u201cI think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation, for cyberhacking and so forth, to have an impact on our open societies,\u201d he told ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201dAt first Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, insisted that fake news stories carried by Facebook \u201csurely had no impact\u201d on the election and that saying so was \u201ca pretty crazy idea.\u201d But in a very close election it was not crazy at all.Facebook \u2014 which wants all the readers and advertisers of the mainstream media but not to be saddled with its human editors and fact-checkers \u2014 is now taking more seriously its responsibilities as a news purveyor in cyberspace.Ten years ago, said Cohen, bad guys did not have the capabilities to get at all this data and extract it, but \u201cnow they do,\u201d and as more creative tools like big data and artificial intelligence get \u201cweaponized,\u201d this will become an even bigger problem. It\u2019s a huge legal, moral and strategic problem, and it will require, said Cohen, \u201ca new social compact\u201d to defuse.Work on that compact has to start with every school teaching children digital civics. And that begins with teaching them that the internet is an open sewer of untreated, unfiltered information, where they need to bring skepticism and critical thinking to everything they read and basic civic decency to everything they write.Prof. Sam Wineburg, the lead author of the report, said: \u201cMany people assume that because young people are fluent in social media they are equally perceptive about what they find there.

{"Headline": "Can a Law Stop Distracted Driving? California Hopes to Find Out", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byThousands of people die in distracted-driving accidents every year, including more than 3,400 in 2015, according to federal data released last week. California is hoping to do something about it.A law went into effect in the state last week with an aim toward cutting down on the number of drivers using smartphones.With its new law, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in September and effective Jan. 1, California has gone further than most states in prohibiting the use of cellphones: It is barring drivers from even holding mobile devices.The law builds on earlier legislation that prevented drivers from talking and texting but did not prohibit them from streaming video, for instance, or using apps like Facebook and Twitter.Jennifer Ryan, the director of state relations for the travel organization AAA, said the California measure matched a larger trend in which states were bringing legislation up to date with contemporary phones. Many of the existing laws were passed before smartphones offered the number of interactive features that they do today, she said.\u201cWe certainly anticipate there to be many bills introduced this year,\u201d she added.Ms. Ryan said that California\u2019s provisions were particularly broad and that although it was \u201cdefinitely a bellwether state,\u201d states tended to evaluate policy solutions to distracted driving independently. AAA expects to see legislation introduced to address distracted driving in about 10 states, including Iowa, Massachusetts, Missouri, Virginia and Wisconsin.According to new statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 272 teenagers were killed in 2015 in what the agency described as distraction-affected crashes. The data also showed that 3,263 of the 3,477 people killed in such crashes that year had been distracted while driving.California\u2019s law goes beyond even what the federal agency recommends to prevent distracted driving, said Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for the agency.\u201cWe certainly have encouraged states to adopt \u2018no texting and driving\u2019 laws. That\u2019s been a big focus,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cThe most recent action has been on what can be done on manufacturers of both cars and devices on how to minimize distraction.\u201dBut even given California\u2019s comparatively extensive law, some experts are unconvinced that legislation alone can significantly reduce the threat of distracted driving.Steve Finnegan, the government affairs manager of the Automobile Club of Southern California, said that although the new legislation was \u201ca step in the right direction,\u201d it did not address \u201cthe complete issue of distracted driving.\u201d\u201cOne of the bigger issues is cognitive distraction,\u201d Mr. Finnegan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what your hands are doing; it\u2019s what your brain is doing.\u201dDavid G. Kidd, a senior researcher at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent research organization that focuses on reducing injuries and fatalities from crashes, agreed and said that research on public policy that banned smartphone use had returned mixed results.\u201cThere is evidence that if you do pass a law and have strong enforcement, it can change behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t see a reduction in crashes that is consistent with that change in behavior.\u201dThe institute is more focused on encouraging automakers to adapt crash avoidance technologies such as forward-collision warnings and automatic emergency braking \u2014 technological measures that are intended to help prevent front-to-rear crashes.Those systems \u201care not going to reduce driver distraction, but they will help cope with some of the consequences that come with drivers not paying attention,\u201d Mr. Kidd said.Ms. Ryan, of AAA, said drivers\u2019 safety ultimately rested in their hands and those of their fellow motorists.\u201cWe really want to emphasize to motorists that driving is a very demanding task,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople really need to pay attention to the task at hand and not drive distracted.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Decides Who Counts as Native American?", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "FeatureFour years ago, the Nooksack in Washington State announced that they were expelling hundreds of members, setting off a bitter debate over tribal identity.Supported byHe\u2019d enrolled his two older daughters, from a previous relationship, when they were babies, but hadn\u2019t yet filed the paperwork to make his younger children \u2014 all of whom, including a set of twins, were under 7 \u2014 official members. He saw no reason to worry about a bureaucratic endorsement of what he knew to be true. \u201cMy kids, they love being Native,\u201d he told me.St. Germain was a teenager when he enrolled in the tribe. For decades, he used tribal fishing rights to harvest salmon and sea urchin and Dungeness crab alongside his cousins. He had dozens of family members who were also Nooksack. His mother, according to family lore, was directly descended from a 19th-century Nooksack chief known as Matsqui George. His brother, Rudy, was the secretary of the Nooksack tribal council, which oversaw membership decisions. The process, he figured, would be so straightforward that his kids would be certified Nooksacks in time for Christmas, when the tribe gives parents a small stipend for buying gifts: \u201cI thought it was a cut-and-dried situation.\u201dBut after a few months, the applications had still not gone through. When Rudy asked why, at a tribal council meeting, the chairman, Bob Kelly, called in the enrollment department. They told Rudy that they had found a problem with the paperwork. There were missing documents; ancestors seemed to be incorrectly identified. They didn\u2019t think Terry\u2019s children\u2019s claims to tribal membership could be substantiated.At the time, Rudy and Kelly were friends, allies on the council. At the long oval table where they met to discuss Nooksack business, Rudy always sat at Kelly\u2019s right. But the debate over whether Rudy\u2019s family qualified as Nooksack tore them apart. Today, more than four years later, they no longer speak. Rudy and his extended family refer to Kelly as a monster and a dictator; he calls them pond scum and con artists. They agree on almost nothing, but both remember the day when things fell apart the same way. \u201cIf my nephew isn\u2019t Nooksack,\u201d Rudy said in the council chambers, \u201cthen neither am I.\u201dTo Rudy, the words were an expression of shock. \u201cIt\u2019s fighting words,\u201d he said, to tell someone they\u2019re not really part of their tribe. At stake were not just his family\u2019s jobs and homes and treaty rights but also who they were and where they belonged. \u201cI\u2019ll still be who I am, but I won\u2019t have proof,\u201d Rudy said. \u201cI\u2019ll be labeled a non-Indian. So yeah, I take this very personally.\u201dTo Kelly, the words were an admission of guilt, implicating not just the St. Germains but also hundreds of tribal members to whom they were related. As chairman, he felt that he had a sacred duty: to protect the tribe from invasion by a group of people that, he would eventually argue, weren\u2019t even Native Americans. \u201cI\u2019m in a war,\u201d he told me later, sketching family trees on the back of a copy of the tribe\u2019s constitution. \u201cThis is our culture, not a game.\u201dThe St. Germains\u2019 rejected application proved to be a turning point for the Nooksack. Separately, the family and the council began combing through Nooksack history, which, like that of many tribes in the United States, is complicated by government efforts to extinguish, assimilate and relocate the tribe, and by a dearth of historical documents. An international border drawn across historically Nooksack lands only adds to the confusion. There were some records and even some living memories of the ancestors whose Nooksack heritage was being called into doubt. But no one could agree on what the records meant.In January 2013, Kelly announced that, after searching through files at the Bureau of Indian Affairs office in nearby Everett, he had reason to doubt the legitimacy of more than 300 enrolled Nooksacks related to the St. Germains, all of whom claimed to descend from a woman named Annie George, born in 1875. In February, he canceled the constitutionally required council meeting, saying it would be \u201cimproper\u201d to convene when Rudy St. Germain and another council member, Rudy\u2019s cousin Michelle Roberts, were not eligible to be part of the tribe they\u2019d been elected to lead. A week later, he called an executive session of the council but demanded that St. Germain and Roberts remain outside while the rest of the council voted on whether to \u201cinitiate involuntary disenrollment\u201d for them and 304 other Nooksacks, including 37 elders. The resolution passed unanimously. \u201cIt hurt me,\u201d Terry St. Germain said later. Even harder was watching the effect on his brother, Rudy. \u201cIt took the wind right out of him.\u201dTwo days after the meeting, the tribal council began sending out letters notifying affected members that unless they could provide proof of their legitimacy, they would be disenrolled in 30 days. Word and shock spread quickly through the small, tight-knit reservation. The disenrollees, now calling themselves \u201cthe Nooksack 306,\u201d hired a lawyer and vowed to contest their expulsion. \u201cI told \u2019em, \u2018I know where I belong no matter what you say,\u2019\u2009\u201d an 80-year-old woman who, in her youth, had been punished for \u201cspeaking Indian\u201d at school, said. \u201c\u2009\u2018You can\u2019t make me believe that I\u2019m not.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe Nooksacks who want the 306 out of the tribe say they are standing up for their very identity, fighting for the integrity of a tribe taken over by outsiders. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to die for this,\u201d Kelly would later say. \u201cAnd I think we will, before this is over.\u201dEfforts to define Native American identity date from the earliest days of the colonies. Before the arrival of white settlers, tribal boundaries were generally fluid; intermarriages and alliances were common. But as the new government\u2019s desire to expand into Indian Territory grew, so, too, did the interest in defining who was and who wasn\u2019t a \u201creal Indian.\u201d Those definitions shifted as the colonial government\u2019s goals did. \u201cMixed blood\u201d Indians, for example, were added to rolls in hopes that assimilated Indians would be more likely to cede their land; later, after land claims were established, more restrictive definitions were adopted. In the 19th century, the government began relying heavily on blood quantum, or \u201cdegree of Indian blood,\u201d wagering that, over generations of intermarriage, tribes would be diluted to the point that earlier treaties would not have to be honored. \u201c\u2009\u2018As long as grass grows or water runs\u2019 \u2014 a phrase that was often used in treaties with American Indians \u2014 is a relatively permanent term for a contract,\u201d the Ojibwe author David Treuer wrote in a 2011 Op-Ed for The Times. \u201c\u2009\u2018As long as the blood flows\u2019 seemed measurably shorter.\u201dEven for those early rolls, though, determining blood quantum was tricky; it was not a measure that tribal people used or something they kept track of. Government agents compiling base rolls in the 1800s sometimes simply guessed at the percentage of Indian blood; at the time, anthropologists used feet and hair width as a \u201cscientific\u201d test of blood degree in indigenous tribes. Many traditionalist Indians, known as \u201cirreconcilables\u201d or \u201cblanket Indians,\u201d were so suspicious of the government that they refused to be enrolled at all, making all their descendants unenrollable as well. In 1988 the historian Kent Carter coined a half-joking term for the millions who claim Indian ancestry but who, for a variety of reasons, don\u2019t sort neatly into today\u2019s official boxes: people with mixed tribal heritage; people whose ancestors were denied recognition by early government agents or died before registration was complete; people whose tribes, in the face of the federal government\u2019s attempts to extinguish them, didn\u2019t maintain the cohesion that same government would later require for recognition. Carter called them the \u201coutalucks.\u201dContemporary Indian identity is refracted through a tangled accumulation of 18th- and 19th-century understandings of biology and race, as well as several centuries\u2019 worth of conflicting federal policies. The Constitution uses the word \u201cIndian\u201d twice but never bothers to define it. A congressional survey in 1978 found that, in addition to the different requirements used by tribes and individual states, federal legislation defined Native Americans in at least 33 ways. In 2005, one frustrated judge, quoting an earlier decision, described the legal definitions of Indian-ness as \u201c\u2009\u2018a complex patchwork of federal, state and tribal law,\u2019 which is better explained by history than by logic.\u201d Given the web of criteria, courts are sometimes called upon to decide whether individuals, or even tribes, are \u201cauthentically\u201d Indian. This has led to weighing things like whether twenty-nine 128ths constitutes a \u201csignificant degree\u201d of Indian blood (a federal court ruled in 2009 that it did); whether someone who was \u201cIndian in an anthropological or ethno-historical sense\u201d was also Indian for the purposes of criminal jurisdiction if his tribe isn\u2019t federally recognized (the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decided he was not); and whether behaviors like eating fast food and driving cars show that a tribe\u2019s culture had been abandoned and its land rights \u201cextinguished\u201d (in 1991, a Canadian court said that they did; the ruling was later overturned).Modern Native Americans \u2014 who in 2017 are still issued cards by the federal government certifying their \u201cDegree of Indian Blood\u201d \u2014 are used to, if not necessarily comfortable with, the need to \u201cprove\u201d their identities in ways that may seem strange to people of other ethnicities. Tribes set their own membership requirements, but in order to be recognized by the federal government, they must also prove their historical continuity and have generally hewed to the methods it has established. Tribes have on occasion been warned that federal recognition, and thus their treaty-guaranteed rights, can disappear if their membership becomes unclear. When, in 1994, the Blackfeet Nation considered doing away with its blood-quantum requirement, a Bureau of Indian Affairs official warned that a tribe that \u201cdiluted\u201d its relationship with its members might find that \u201cit has \u2018self-determined\u2019 its sovereignty away.\u201d Today, most tribes use direct descent from tribal members listed on historical rolls and blood quantum. For a 2003 book, \u201cReal Indians: Identity and the Survival of Native America,\u201d the Cherokee scholar Eva Marie Garroutte interviewed Native people about what it felt like to be defined in this way. Many said they saw blood quantum as a helpful guidepost and a guard against fraud or against people who identify as Indian without cultural understanding. Others regarded it as odd, even offensive. An Ojibwe man joked that he is also \u201cpart white, but I don\u2019t have the papers to prove it.\u201d A Cree-and-Anishinabe woman replied, \u201cI don\u2019t like being talked about in a vocabulary usually reserved for dogs and horses.\u201dLately, though, old debates about identity have taken a harsh new direction. Loss of tribal acceptance, which was once rare and seldom permanent, has become increasingly common over the last two decades. David Wilkins, a professor of American Indian studies at the University of Minnesota who has followed the phenomenon since the mid-1990s, says there has been a surge in disenrollment that involves between 5,000 and 9,000 people in 79 tribes across 20 states. Even the dead have been disenrolled and, in some cases, exhumed from their graves, against tradition and taboo, to have their DNA tested.The ejection of tribal members is most prevalent in small tribes with casinos on their land; \u201cper capita\u201d profit shares go further when split fewer ways. Many of the most famous cases have been in California: Following the opening of a new tribal casino in 2003, the Chukchansi, in Coarsegold, disenrolled more than half of approximately 1,600 tribal members, and battles among factions eventually led to an armed takeover of the casino. But disenrollment also happens where casino money isn\u2019t a major factor (the Nooksack have one casino and another recently closed, but don\u2019t make enough money from gaming to issue per capita payments) or isn\u2019t a factor at all, as in tribes where factions hope to consolidate political power or settle grudges or simply believe that people were mistakenly let in. Robert Williams, chairman of the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy Program at the University of Arizona, told me that some tribes have recently begun to hire membership consultants to help trim their rolls. \u201cIt\u2019s almost become an industry in some parts of Indian Country,\u201d he said.The National Native American Bar Association issued a resolution in 2015 denouncing loss of membership without due process, while the Association of American Indian Physicians warned that such loss of identity could cause serious grief and depression. In general, though, the voices against disenrollment have been few. A 1978 Supreme Court decision, Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, held that, due to its sovereignty, a tribe cannot be sued for discrimination for accepting the children of male members who married outside the tribe but not those of female members who did. It has been widely interpreted as giving tribes the right to determine their membership requirements, even if individual rights are compromised. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, out of respect for sovereignty, has repeatedly declined to intervene in internal membership disputes.Native leaders, leery of inviting scrutiny that could undermine tribal sovereignty, have been reluctant to speak out. \u201cThey tend to view any interference in such matters as an intrusion of the thin end of an infinitely expandable wedge against which they must exercise constant vigilance,\u201d writes Garroutte. Ron Allen, the chairman of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam \u2014 a Western Washington tribe that disenrolled six members for insufficient blood quantum \u2014 says that \u201cthe topic is rising\u201d and eliciting strong emotions, but it\u2019s not appropriate to tell other tribes what to do: \u201cIt would be like Oregon saying to Washington, \u2018You\u2019re not managing your affairs properly.\u2019\u2009\u201dAdelina Narte-Parker, 64, lives across the Sound, closer to the Olympic Mountains. A great-granddaughter of Annie George, the common ancestor who unites the Nooksack disenrollees, and a cousin of Rudy and Terry St. Germain\u2019s mother, she was among the first of the 306 accepted as Nooksack decades ago. One afternoon as we sat on her porch watching ships come and go from Seattle, she showed me the letter the tribe sent her in 1983, announcing her new membership. Overhead, a bald eagle wheeled; inside, her husband, a painter, made sketches for a portrait of Annie George. He was working from an old, grainy photograph that he wasn\u2019t sure depicted George. A relative found it in a shed, and the features were indistinct. \u201cOnce you title something,\u201d he said, laughing, \u201cit is what you say it is.\u201dAfter she got her letter of acceptance, Narte-Parker recalled, she was quick to tell her family, and then to write back to the enrollment director: \u201cWe were all jubilant, laughing, full of joy, jumping, screaming, crying, and the greatest overwhelming feeling of belonging somewhere.\u201d She was proud, she wrote, to finally know where she came from, \u201cand prouder still to be a Nooksack Indian.\u201dNarte-Parker didn\u2019t set out to be a member of the Nooksack tribe. She grew up well south of Nooksack lands, following her parents as they sought work in the fields, orchards and canneries of Washington State. Her father was Filipino and her mother was Indian, raised on a Shxway reserve in British Columbia. Her mother always said she was part Shxway, a Canadian band within the Stolo nation, through her grandfather, and part Nooksack, through her grandmother Annie George. Annie George\u2019s three daughters \u2014 Narte-Parker\u2019s grandmother and her two aunts \u2014 all married Filipino farmworkers. The family spoke Halkomelem, a native language that was widely spoken in what is now British Columbia but also in the Nooksack River valley until the mid-20th century; it eventually largely replaced the original Nooksack language, Lhechalosem. As a child, Narte-Parker would sometimes drive north with her mother to visit family, and they would stop off in Nooksack territory to visit a man they called Uncle Louis.In 1983, Narte-Parker, her mother and one of her great-aunts decided they wanted to learn more about their heritage. They went to the Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Everett, Wash., and then to the Nooksack enrollment office in Deming, to work on a family tree. Narte-Parker\u2019s mother told the enrollment director that her grandmother\u2019s name was Annie George, and that her grandmother\u2019s siblings had been named Louis, Amanda, Frank and William. Annie George wasn\u2019t on the family trees the tribe had, and she wasn\u2019t listed on any of the censuses it used, but Louis George was on a Nooksack tribal census from 1942. In a probate document, they found Annie\u2019s name: Four interviewees described her as Louis\u2019s half sister. The enrollment director encouraged the women to apply for membership, and they did. Within a month, the council sent them word that they had been accepted.Narte-Parker was the 777th enrolled member of the Nooksack tribe. Many of her relatives quickly followed. (Some also enrolled, separately, as Shxway.) As more houses became available, more members of the three families moved to reservation lands. Before long, the descendants of Annie George became an influential voting bloc, and their members were being elected to council seats and hired to run tribal offices.While some elders welcomed them, others were skeptical. The sisters had never lived on Nooksack land. Some elders had no memory of them; others remembered them visiting but thought of them as Shxway. Kelly heard, indirectly, that elders in British Columbia didn\u2019t remember the sisters\u2019 being born there, but rather, showing up suddenly as young children \u2014 the beginning of his suspicions that, though they \u201chad teachings,\u201d the sisters weren\u2019t Annie\u2019s real daughters at all but non-Indian children she had taken in. Roberts showed me copies of two of the sisters\u2019 birth certificates, reissued later in their lives, listing Annie and her husband as their parents. Other members of the tribe remembered knowing some of the 306 further south in the 1950s, when their families were doing agricultural work; at the time, they said, the families identified as Filipino. They certainly hadn\u2019t been around in the 1960s or \u201970s, when the tribe was writing its constitution \u2014 when, as Kelly put it, the council \u201ctook a look around at who was here when they passed it, and they wrote their criteria for that, based on who was here \u2014 this is who Nooksack\u2019s going to be.\u201dThe debate continued into the 1990s, when the tribe did an enrollment audit of one of the three families descended from Annie\u2019s daughters, the Rabangs. They were ultimately found to be enrollable, but not before an ugly confrontation. In 2000, after a number of Rabangs were arrested for smuggling marijuana into the United States from Canada, some elders told The Associated Press that \u201ca clan of outsiders masquerading as Nooksacks\u201d was \u201ccontrolling tribal government.\u201d Bob Kelly now calls Narte-Parker and the other first enrollees from her extended family \u201cTrojan horses.\u201dThat\u2019s a fair description of Nooksack history, especially in the last few hundred years. For centuries, the people fished their own river valley but also traveled regularly, including to what is now Canada\u2019s Fraser River, to fish for salmon or gather shellfish. They intermarried and formed alliances with their neighbors on both sides of what is now an international border. When white settlers arrived and introduced new diseases, many of the Nooksack died. By some counts their numbers plummeted to 450 from perhaps 1,200. In the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliot, in which Coast Salish tribes ceded their lands to the federal government in exchange for small reservations and the right to continue fishing, hunting and gathering, the Nooksack received no reservation. Instead, as settlers moved onto their lands, they were told to go live with the Lummi, in their new reservation by the coast. Most refused. Of those who remained, some filed homestead claims on their own lands; others scattered in search of a livelihood. For the next hundred years, as far as the federal government was concerned, the tribe essentially ceased to exist.This is not an unusual story. The federal government used the law as \u201ca mighty, pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass,\u201d as Teddy Roosevelt said to Congress in 1901. He was referring to the General Allotment Act, under which tribally owned land was carved into small parcels and handed out to individuals. It was a huge blow to the stability and sovereignty of tribes: Within 20 years, Native people lost ownership of 90 million acres. It was also the beginning of the government\u2019s reliance on blood quantum to determine Indian status. Those deemed \u201chalf-bloods\u201d or less were regarded as more responsible and given more freedom to handle their land. Even many \u201cprogressive\u201d reformers saw assimilation into white society as the best way to transform tribal members into citizens. \u201cKill the Indian in the student so we can save the man!\u201d went the famous slogan of a superintendent at one of the 500 boarding schools that Native children, forcibly separated from their families, were made to attend.Some Nooksack people, unrecognized by the federal government, stayed on their lands and continued to operate as a tribe. In the 1920s, they joined other Northwest tribes to sue the federal government for lands lost; in the 1930s, even though they weren\u2019t considered eligible to participate, they voted to accept the Indian Reorganization Act, in which the government backed away from its assimilationist policies and instead encouraged tribes to be self-governing and self-sufficient. (A decade later the United States ended its government-to-government relationships with tribes and returned to promoting assimilation, before changing its policies and pushing self-government again.) In the 1960s, a committee of Nooksacks opened a bid for federal recognition. They gained title to one acre of land in Deming, the first Nooksack Reservation, in 1970, and full federal recognition in 1973. Like many tribes, they adopted a constitution based on a model that the Bureau of Indian Affairs developed during the reorganization period in the 1930s. The new constitution restricted Nooksack membership to recipients of early land allotments, recipients of a 1965 government settlement or people who appeared on a 1942 tribal census. Their direct descendants could also be enrolled, provided they had \u201cat least one-fourth (1/4) degree Indian blood.\u201dThe Nooksack weren\u2019t alone in seeing long-lost applicants turn up after the tribe was officially recognized. Ron Allen, the tribal chairman of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam, told me it was common, in the last decades of the 20th century, for the \u201cinner-circle communities\u201d of northwestern tribes to be surprised by a \u201cwave\u201d of people who started coming back to places their families once left. He credits the political advancement of tribes, which made members of the broader society feel that it was \u201cO.K. to be Indian.\u201d Tribes generally welcomed the new arrivals, he said, but still, \u201cit was like, \u2018Where are all these Indians coming from?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe first person to reply to Alexie\u2019s tweet \u2014 thanking him for speaking out when others were silent \u2014 was Gabe Galanda, a member of the Round Valley Indian tribes in California and the lawyer whom the Nooksack 306 hired to represent them. The next replies came from some of Galanda\u2019s other clients: former members of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, who were disenrolled in 2014. Grand Ronde was formed in 1857 when the federal government forced at least 27 tribes and bands to leave their homelands, which ranged from California to Washington, and move to a reservation in Oregon. The 86 Grand Ronde disenrollees descend from a man known as Chief Tumulth, who signed one of the treaties that created the reservation. Decades after they enrolled, tribal officials noted that Chief Tumulth failed to appear on the official base roll, made the year it was founded. It was true: He was hanged the year before, by a lieutenant of the U.S. Army.I thought of this last spring as I watched Narte-Parker leaf through old letters and family trees, newspaper clippings and documents. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make the laws,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just got stuck in the middle.\u201dAfter the first disenrollment letters went out to Nooksack members, Galanda appealed to tribal courts and the Department of the Interior and managed to delay the disenrollment hearings. Meanwhile, the 306 tried to make sense of what documents they could find to illuminate their past. They had no birth certificate for Annie, so they turned to old censuses and to 19th-century church records kept by the Archdiocese of Vancouver, marking the sacraments of birth, marriage and death. They found that Annie\u2019s birth mother, Marie Siamat, was buried in December 1875, two days after giving birth to Annie, and that her father (variously recorded as Chief Matsqui, George Kot kro itmentwh, George Roelkwemeldon, George Tekwomclko, George Matsqui and so on) remarried a woman named Madeline Jobe.Indian censuses taken during Annie\u2019s childhood repeatedly recorded her living with George and Madeline. Michelle Robert\u2019s grandmother remembers her mother, Annie, referring to Madeline as the woman who raised her and as \u201cMother.\u201d The 306 think this is compelling evidence Madeline adopted Annie. The council remains unconvinced. Kelly says that citing Madeline as an ancestor \u2014 their only tie to recognized base rolls \u2014 was a blatant lie.If Madeline didn\u2019t count, the family responded, they should still qualify for membership under Section H of the Nooksack constitution, which allows the enrollment of \u201cpersons who possess at least \u00bc Indian blood and who can prove Nooksack ancestry to any degree.\u201d Records indicate that Matsqui was considered a Nooksack village even after the Canadian border was established to the south, and Matsqui George was a chief of the village. In a U.S. census from 1910, Louis George indicated that both his parents, Madeline and Matsqui George, were Nooksacks from Washington, and that he was a full-blooded Nooksack. Besides, the 306 like to point out, Kelly\u2019s own family was adopted by the Nooksacks; it is originally from a different Canadian tribe.Kelly suggested that the 306 disenroll themselves and reapply under Section H. But he soon called for a referendum to remove Section H from the Nooksack constitution. He said later that this change was unrelated to the 306 and was instead a much-needed tightening of loose enrollment laws that could have let \u201calmost anybody\u201d in. The amendment passed with 61 percent support.As part of their defense, the 306 produced letters from anthropologists. One cited not just the requirements for Nooksack membership provided in tribal code but \u201chistorical documents, family oral history and well-established concepts of identity, affiliation and membership within anthropology regarding the social organization of the Coast Salish peoples.\u201d But for some tribal members, this only served to undermine his case. \u201cIt\u2019s not a club,\u201d a woman named Mary Brewer, who recently gave up her membership in the Lummi tribe to enroll as a Nooksack, told me. \u201cMy mom has about 10 different tribes in her ancestry, and she meets the requirements for only two.\u201d Their family lost title to 80 acres on the Yakima reservation because they didn\u2019t have high enough blood quantum to be enrolled there; they were sorry to lose the land, she said, but respected the rules by which modern tribes operate. Brewer\u2019s mother, Diane, said she had two grandchildren whose blood quantum is one-quarter. \u201cWe\u2019ve been telling them, better marry Native or else it\u2019ll die out,\u201d she said.\u201cThe 306 say, \u2018Disenrollment isn\u2019t traditional,\u2019\u2009\u201d Mary said. \u201cWell, enrollment was never traditional!\u201d It is, however, the way things work now. \u201cIt\u2019s not, \u2018this guy took care of me, and that\u2019s how we did it in the olden days,\u2019\u2009\u201d Brewer continued. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have documentation, then you\u2019re not Indian.\u201dWith the hearings repeatedly delayed as lawsuits made their way through the tribal court system, both sides formed Facebook groups to argue their cases and regularly debated or taunted each other online. (Their competing slogans were \u201cWe Belong\u201d and \u201cWe Are Nooksack.\u201d) \u201cWhile some people challenge the idea of tribal enrollment, referring to it as \u2018Western thinking\u2019 and an imposed system on American Indians,\u201d posted Katrice Romero, the tribe\u2019s housing director, \u201cthat tribal enrollment number is what holds the United States government accountable to the American Indian people and its trust responsibility to tribes; a responsibility that my ancestors fought, struggled and sacrificed for.\u201dOn the reservation, Michelle Roberts found that people who babysat for her as a child or attended her wedding would no longer make eye contact with her. \u201cThe most important thing isn\u2019t friendship,\u201d says Diane Brewer, who no longer speaks to her former best friend, one of the 306. \u201cThe most important thing is the tribe.\u201dIn the summer of 2013, Roberts was fired from her job as the human-resources manager at the Nooksack River Casino. Later, when she tried to count the number of disenrollees and their allies who lost tribal jobs, she got to 58. At first, Kelly told me he wouldn\u2019t comment on personnel decisions but later said, \u201cWe got rid of all them a long time ago.\u201d Rudy St. Germain was fired from his job as the casino\u2019s landscaping manager and had to move his two boys into a relative\u2019s house when he couldn\u2019t make rent. \u201cThose were dark days,\u201d he told me. Today he works in a pork-processing plant.Roberts and St. Germain couldn\u2019t find resolution in the council. Kelly began insisting that meetings be held over the phone. He\u2019d received threats, he said, and it wasn\u2019t safe to meet in person. When St. Germain and Roberts spoke, no one seemed to be able to hear them. I asked Kelly whether he muted them. He shrugged and said: \u201cProbably. I muted a lot of people.\u201d (He says they weren\u2019t supposed to be on the call in the first place.) The following winter, Kelly scheduled the first in-person council meetings in months on the Friday, Saturday and Monday of Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend; the Nooksack constitution allows for council members to be removed from office if they miss three monthly council meetings in a row. St. Germain and Roberts, who were out of town, tried to reach the council by phone or email. At the third meeting, the council declared their seats empty and appointed two new members to replace them. \u201cIt was the only way we could get them off council,\u201d Kelly told me later. Rudy said, \u201cI was lost for words.\u201dBy that time, Kelly was calling the 306 scam artists. \u201cNobody stepped forward and claimed them!\u201d he told me repeatedly. \u201cYou don\u2019t show up and just insert yourself into someone else\u2019s family tree.\u201dWith an election looming and four of eight council seats expiring, the council asked the tribal court judge to keep pending disenrollees from voting. After the judge refused, the council declined to schedule the elections. The incumbents remained in office, but some argued that, without an elected quorum, the tribe had no viable government.Several lawsuits, including one called Kelly v. Kelly, brought by a group that included the chairman\u2019s sons, were filed to force elections, but amid litigation, the council abruptly fired the tribe\u2019s judge. The council also barred Galanda from practicing in the tribe\u2019s courts, saying he\u2019d behaved unethically by citing an opinion he wrote while serving as a judge for another tribe; the court began to return all of his filings unopened. An appellate court directed the chief of police to arrest and imprison the court clerk if she continued to reject filings; when the chief of police refused, the appellate court held him in contempt, began levying a fine of $1,000 a day and wondered, in its ruling, if \u201cat Nooksack, the rule of law is dead.\u201d (The council contends that, because the courts are under the jurisdiction of the council, these fines and rulings are meaningless.) Two of the remaining council members whose seats did not expire and who have resisted disenrollment (one is the mother of Kelly\u2019s sons and is now married to one of the 306) were targeted with petitions calling for their recall. One of the recalls succeeded. The charge was treason.In July, some of the disenrollees and their allies scheduled what they called a general council meeting. To avoid the tribal police, they met on the grounds of an old logging show. Several people showed me text messages they received from tribal employees who said they\u2019d been warned that they would be fired if they attended. Later, thinking Kelly might consider the meeting a kind of coup, I asked him what he thought of it. He shrugged. \u201cIt was meaningless,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not real. It\u2019s make-believe.\u201dGeorge Adams, who taught Lhechalosem language classes for the tribe until he was fired early last year (he\u2019s such a fervent supporter of the 306 that he likes to call himself \u201c307\u201d), called the meeting to order; he spoke in Lhechalosem, though he is considered the only remaining fluent speaker. (He learned the language by studying old recordings a quarter century after the last native speaker died.) Adams charged four witnesses with committing the proceedings to memory in order to later share what happened. \u201cRemember these names,\u201d he told the crowd, \u201cbecause this is how we survived for thousands of years.\u201dPeople rose to speak. \u201cMy enrollment number is six, so there you go,\u201d said one man, by way of introduction. Another said, \u201cI\u2019m 71 years old, and I\u2019m kind of ashamed to call myself a Nooksack right now. Years ago, our people never asked, \u2018Where you from?\u2019 They welcomed you to their table.\u201d A woman asked how the decisions of this council could be considered valid when there were so few people, around 200, present. People began to speak of shutting down the tribe altogether, to force the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which had consistently declined to intervene, to call new elections.Adams asked for a vote. The crowd decided that the four expired seats on the tribal council were vacant, that everything the government had done since the canceled elections was invalid and that they should vote in four new officers \u2014 none of them disenrollees \u2014 from their own ranks. \u201cThis has to do with 10 generations from now,\u201d one of the newly elected officers said. He described the worst-case scenario: for lots of people to be cut off from the tribal community, \u201cto be just a person roaming around, trying to figure it out for themselves.\u201dThe new treasurer, Bernadine Roberts, a short, dark-haired woman (\u201cStand up please,\u201d Adams told her. \u201cOh! You are standing!\u201d) who enrolled three years after the tribe was officially recognized, told me that until she moved to the reservation from Seattle, she \u201cwas one of those urban Indians that didn\u2019t know much.\u201d She gave a brief acceptance speech about what it meant to her to reconnect to her family\u2019s past. \u201cMy grandmother said we were going home, and I didn\u2019t know what she was talking about,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I know now.\u201dThe following month, the 306 celebrated what they saw as a hopeful precedent when the Grand Ronde Tribal Court of Appeals overturned the disenrollment of Chief Tumulth\u2019s descendants, holding that it was unfair to subject tribal members to \u201csuch an extreme sanction\u201d after accepting them for nearly three decades. Elsewhere, a few tribes have rejected disenrollment altogether. The Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria in California amended their constitution to ban disenrollment in 2013. The Spokane tribe of Washington did the same in 2015, as part of more than two dozen constitutional changes meant to better reflect the historical complexity of the tribe.But the Nooksack dispute dragged on. In October, the Bureau of Indian Affairs informed Kelly that it would not recognize any actions of the tribal council because it failed to hold elections in March 2016, stressing that it wasn\u2019t telling the tribe who counted as a member but simply responding to the \u201cexceedingly rare situation\u201d of a council\u2019s lacking a quorum. The tribe scheduled new elections and certified the results of a referendum to disenroll the 306. But the bureau would not recognize the results: by excluding pending disenrollees from voting, the tribe had violated its constitution and the rulings of its court of appeals.So when the 306 received letters informing them that their 10-minute disenrollment hearings had finally been scheduled to take place on the phone in November, they weren\u2019t sure what to do. Some, including Rudy St. Germain, refused to participate on the grounds that the hearings were illegitimate. Others scheduled their appointments, then called in to tell the council they didn\u2019t recognize its authority.Michelle Roberts called from Canada, where she was staying with Shxway friends. \u201cAnnie George was Nooksack because her father was Matsqui George, and he was Nooksack,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all Nooksack.

{"Headline": "F.B.I. Arrests Wife of Killer in Orlando Mass Shooting", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. arrested the wife of the man who carried out a deadly terrorist attack in Orlando, Fla., and charged her with obstructing the investigation of the mass shooting, law enforcement officials said on Monday.Noor Salman, whose husband, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded dozens in an Orlando nightclub that was popular with gays, was also charged with aiding and abetting by providing material support, the officials said.Investigators interviewed Ms. Salman for hours after the attack and came to believe she was not telling the truth about her husband\u2019s plans to carry out the rampage.A Justice Department spokesman said Ms. Salman would make her initial appearance on Tuesday morning in federal court in Oakland, Calif.\u201cNoor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night,\u201d said her lawyer, Linda Moreno. \u201cNoor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.\u201dAccounts of what happened from officials and witnesses.The aiding and abetting, a terrorism charge, suggests that prosecutors believe that Ms. Salman helped him in some way \u2014 either before or after the terrorist attack.The decision to charge her is not without risks for prosecutors. If the case goes to trial, prosecutors will have to contend with a jury that could be sympathetic to Ms. Salman, who said she was in an abusive relationship and living in fear.Ms. Salman said she had accompanied her husband to Orlando with their child once when he scouted the club but did not know the purpose of the trip. On the day her husband drove to Orlando, she claimed he said he was going to visit a friend, named Nemo, who lived in Florida. But Nemo was not living in Florida at the time, a fact Ms. Salman said she did not know.She also said she had no reason to suspect that ammunition he bought in the days leading up to the attack was to be used in the shooting, given that her husband was a security guard who frequently purchased ammunition. On the day of the shooting, she bought her husband a Father\u2019s Day card, expecting him to return that evening. Her lawyers believe that supports her story that she did not know about the attack.During his rampage, Mr. Mateen used Facebook to pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State. President Obama has said that Mr. Mateen \u201ctook in extremist information and propaganda over the internet and became radicalized.\u201dFederal investigators do not believe that Mr. Mateen, who was 29 and who was killed by the police after the shooting, received any specific training or support from the Islamic State. Part of their inquiry has focused on whether anyone in the United States assisted in his plans for the attack.There has perhaps been no figure more central to those questions than Ms. Salman, who grew up in an avocado-colored home in Rodeo, Calif., near San Francisco. In Rodeo, on a diverse block populated by Chinese, Indian, Korean and Mexican families, neighbors recalled a younger Ms. Salman as warm and kind.Ms. Salman married Mr. Mateen in a ceremony near her childhood home in Northern California, a second marriage for both. After the wedding, Ms. Salman moved to Fort Pierce, Fla., where she and Mr. Mateen lived in a condominium complex.Their marriage in 2011 caused consternation among some of Ms. Salman\u2019s relatives, mostly because of her Palestinian heritage and Mr. Mateen\u2019s ancestral ties to Afghanistan. Ms. Salman said in the interview with The Times that her husband beat her repeatedly and verbally abused her.Members of Mr. Mateen\u2019s family, who have tried to shield Ms. Salman from public scrutiny, have said they believe she did nothing improper.\u201cShe is shocked, that poor lady,\u201d Seddique Mateen, Mr. Mateen\u2019s father, said in June 2016. \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201dThe Orlando police chief, John W. Mina, said in a statement that he was \u201cglad to see\u201d that Ms. Salman had been arrested.\u201cNothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,\u201d the chief said. \u201cBut today, there is some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime.\u201dIn two recent mass shootings, prosecutors have brought charges against people with ties to the attackers.However, federal prosecutors in the summer of 2014 declined to prosecute Katherine Russell, the wife of one of the assailants in the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013. F.B.I. agents believed she had made false statements to investigators and concealed knowledge of a crime.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside a Killer Drug Epidemic: A Look at America\u2019s Opioid Crisis", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "The opioid epidemic killed more than 33,000 people in 2015. What follows are stories of a national affliction that has swept the country, from cities on the West Coast to bedroom communities in the Northeast.Supported byOpioid addiction is America\u2019s 50-state epidemic. It courses along Interstate highways in the form of cheap smuggled heroin, and flows out of \u201cpill mill\u201d clinics where pain medicine is handed out like candy. It has ripped through New England towns, where people overdose in the aisles of dollar stores, and it has ravaged coal country, where addicts speed-dial the sole doctor in town licensed to prescribe a medication.Marblehead, Mass.Katie Harvey walked out of the house where she lived with friends, shoved her duffel bag into her mother\u2019s car and burst into tears.\u201cI need to go to detox,\u201d she told her mother, Maureen Cavanagh. \u201cI\u2019m just tired of everything.\u201dMs. Harvey, 24, had been shooting heroin for three years. She had been in and out of detox \u2014 eight times altogether. But it had always been someone else\u2019s idea.This time, Ms. Harvey made the arrangements herself. She had come to loathe her life. \u201cI haven\u2019t even been doing enough to get really high,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just maintaining myself so I don\u2019t get sick.\u201dBefore she left for detox, Ms. Harvey curled up on the couch in her mother\u2019s living room in this well-to-do suburb north of Boston and reflected on her life: her low self-esteem despite model-worthy good looks; her many lies to her family; how she had pawned her mother\u2019s jewelry and had sex with strange men for money to pay for drugs.As she spoke, tears spilled from her eyes. She wiped them with the cuff of her sweater, which covered track marks and a tattoo that said \u201cfreedom\u201d \u2014 her goal, to be unshackled from the prison of addiction.Ms. Harvey had been a popular honors student. But she developed anorexia. Alcohol was next. By 21, she was hooked on heroin.Still, she plunged in deeper. She estimated that at her worst, she was shooting up a staggering number of times a day, perhaps as many as 15 \u2014 heroin, cocaine, fentanyl. She overdosed five times. In Massachusetts, almost five residents die every day from overdoses.\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m alive, honestly,\u201d Ms. Harvey said.That night in October, she went into detox. Four days later, she checked out. She went back to her friends and drugs, developing an abscess on her arm, probably from dirty needles.Two weeks later, she was back in detox. This time, she stayed, then entered a 30-day treatment program.Marshalltown, IowaAndrea Steen is one of the fortunate ones. For people in this rural community of 28,000, getting medication to help overcome opioid addiction used to require long drives to treatment centers.That changed about a year ago when two doctors here were licensed to prescribe Suboxone, a drug that eases withdrawal symptoms and helps keep opioid cravings at bay. Now Ms. Steen is one of their patients, coming once a month to check in and renew her prescription.This epidemic is different from those of the past in significant ways. One is that it has spawned a growing demand for medications that can help modify addiction\u2019s impact.One of them is naloxone, known as Narcan, a powerful antidote that has jolted hundreds of overdosed users back to life. Another is buprenorphine, typically sold as Suboxone.By keeping users from experiencing cravings and withdrawal, Suboxone can make it easier for addicts to stay off heroin and other opioids. The number of doctors certified to prescribe buprenorphine has more than doubled since 2011, to about 36,000 from about 16,000, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Yet the drug remains out of reach for many rural Americans.Ms. Steen, 46, is among 20 patients who get Suboxone from the two doctors authorized to prescribe it here. Until last summer, she said, she abused Vicodin and morphine relentlessly. She would steal them from her disabled husband, who would try in vain to hide them. But sometimes she couldn\u2019t root out the pills fast enough, and she would experience what every addict dreads most: withdrawal.She heard about Suboxone from a friend in Tennessee whom she met through Facebook.\u201cShe could tell when I was high,\u201d Ms. Steen said. \u201cHer husband was on Suboxone. She was trying to help me.\u201dMs. Steen started on Suboxone in July, initially making weekly visits to Dr. Nicole Gastala and Dr. Timothy Swinton, the family practitioners here who prescribe the drug. Then it was every other week.Unlike methadone, which also helps treat opioid addiction but must be taken under supervision at special clinics, Suboxone can be taken at home. Some doctors fail to follow Suboxone patients closely, or to test their urine to make sure they are not abusing or selling the medication or using other drugs. But the protocol here is strict.Besides her doctor visits, Ms. Steen must attend group therapy and have regular urine tests.Los AngelesThey enter through an unmarked turquoise storefront, nestled between fashion boutiques on Melrose Avenue. They gather in a circle, ready for the tough-love approach they have come to expect from Howard C. Samuels, a clinical psychologist who runs the Hills, a drug rehabilitation center whose location is central to its marketing.A spot in the room is hard to come by, as are most drug rehabilitation services, especially for the poor and anyone without the proper insurance. The Hills, which can cost around $50,000, serves a more privileged population, yet its mission is no less daunting.Dr. Samuels began with what he called a reality check. \u201cHow many of you have been to at least five treatment centers?\u201d he asked. Nearly every one of the 19 clients in the room raised a hand.\u201cHow about 10?\u201d Still half of the clients raised their hands.One of them, Jordan, who agreed to tell his story only if his last name was not disclosed, knows he is one of the lucky ones. This is only his third time in rehab, a relative rookie at 33 years old. This was his 118th day sober.He had smoked pot, taken ecstasy and occasionally snorted cocaine. But heroin seemed off-limits to him, a college-educated son of two therapists, until a friend offered him some to smoke. Four years later, he blew through a $20,000 inheritance in a month to get what he called the best heroin in the city.After his first days of detox were over at the Hills, Jordan began what would be months of therapy. He confronted what Dr. Samuels calls \u201ccharacter defects,\u201d and rattles his off easily: lust, anger, lack of discipline.On this day, he knows he will draw the wrath of Dr. Samuels: Subverting the rules, he recently went out for his seventh tattoo. \u201cMy addiction has been replaced with addiction to other things: going to the gym, smoking, girls, getting tattoos.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you owe me an apology?\u201d Dr. Samuels said to him, almost shouting.Jordan answered quietly: \u201cYeah, I guess I owe you and some people an apology.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re apologizing to me. That\u2019s good, but what\u2019s bad is, it came so naturally,\u201d Dr. Samuels said.\u201cAll of us have some real impulse control problems,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re drug addicts.\u201dSeattleThe girl looked to be barely out of her teens, and was teetering on the brink of consciousness.\u201cShe couldn\u2019t even form a sentence,\u201d said Dan Manus, a soft-spoken 61-year-old in a Seattle Seahawks cap. His jaw tightened as he recalled the night in October when he and his partner on the King County Emergency Service Patrol found the girl and, he thinks, saved her life.A former addict, he knows the terrain too well. He\u2019s been clean for 22 years now, and working for the county for the last nine.\u201cI can relate to everybody I work with down there, because for the grace of God, there go I,\u201d Mr. Manus said, standing in the patrol parking lot between runs. \u201cSo, yeah, I feel like this kind of was my calling.\u201dThe Emergency Service Patrol was established in the 1980s by a private charity (later taken over by King County) to rescue street alcoholics by bringing them to a safe \u201csobering center\u201d to sleep it off.In October, though, in an acknowledgment of heroin\u2019s new ravages \u2014 treatment admissions for heroin in King County surpassed alcohol for the first time in 2015 \u2014 Mr. Manus and other patrol crew members were trained and equipped with naloxone.\u201cHarm reduction\u201d is an approach that was to some degree pioneered here. One of the nation\u2019s first clean-needle exchanges started in nearby Tacoma in 1988.King County is now considering opening what could be the country\u2019s first safe-injection site. There, addicts could use drugs under supervision by a health worker who may, crucially, also open the door to recovery programs, all under one roof.For Mr. Manus, the crisis is personal. In 1992, he was saved from death by someone who found him in mid-overdose and called paramedics.Seattle was a different, harder-edged city back then. Grunge music, and the heroin that swirled like a slipstream through the lives and song lyrics of some of its stars, was spilling out of the clubs.More people lately seem to be on complex combinations of drugs, Mr. Manus said \u2014 like the girl who, at his direction, was treated by paramedics.Nogales, Ariz.A tipster warned: Look out for a silver Nissan Sentra approaching the busy Dennis DeConcini Port of Entry in Nogales, Ariz., a crucial gateway for cheap heroin made in Mexico.Early one morning, the Nissan rolled into passport control. A Customs and Border Protection officer caught the telltale signs of a driver who had something to hide: the darting eyes, the tight grip on the steering wheel.The driver carried a border-crossing card, an entry permission given only to Mexican citizens. He also carried his wife and two small children and a load of heavy drugs: four pounds of methamphetamine in the passenger\u2019s backrest, and seven and a half pounds of heroin between the engine and the dashboard.Last year, Customs and Border Protection agents seized more than 930 pounds of heroin in Arizona, which is almost one-third of all heroin seized along the entire southern border. Agents acknowledge that they catch only a small fraction of what goes through.Much of the heroin that enters this country comes hidden in cars, concealed in suitcases, squeezed inside hollowed fire extinguishers, or strapped to the thighs, crotches and chests of Mexicans and Americans who cross between the two countries.To the special agents assigned to Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, mules are the first link of a knotted chain that may or may not lead to the agents\u2019 ultimate prize: a top drug trafficker.\u201cIt\u2019s about preventing the narcotics from entering the community,\u201d said Jesus Lozania, the agent in charge in Nogales. \u201cIt\u2019s taking down the organization from the bottom all the way to the top: the mules, the people who coordinate the logistics, the persons who handle the money after the narcotics are sold in the United States. That cash has to make its way back to Mexico.\u201dIt is about building conspiracy cases bit by bit.That morning at the border, three special agents noticed the black letters stamped on the bricks of heroin: LEY. \u201cThat\u2019s probably from the Chino Leys, probably Sinaloa,\u201d said one of the agents, who declined to provide his name because he works undercover.The Chino Leys, he said, are one of the drug distribution organizations in the Sinaloa cartel, which controls the routes that slice through Arizona, aimed for the Northeast. Cleveland, New York and New Jersey are main destinations for Sinaloa\u2019s heroin these days.The driver said he had borrowed his cousin\u2019s car to come to Nogales to buy sweaters. The disbelieving agent pressed on. The driver crossed his arms.Huntington, UtahAs she drives to work each morning, past horse ranches and nodding oil pumps, Marsha World stops to give her son, Kolton, a pale yellow pill to help keep him off heroin for another day.There are few options for drug treatment in the high desert of central Utah, a remote expanse of struggling coal mines, white-steepled Mormon towns and some of the country\u2019s highest opiate death rates.The lone doctor licensed to prescribe one addiction-treating drug has a waiting list. The main detox center is the county jail. So mothers like Ms. World occupy the lonely front lines of a heroin crisis that has reached deep into the remotest corners of rural America.The sun was just skimming over the sagebrush hills when Ms. World climbed out of her car and palmed that day\u2019s naltrexone pill for her 30-year-old son. Unlike other medications Mr. World has taken over 11 years of addiction and rehab, jail and relapse, this one seemed to help.Mr. World was in a treatment program ordered by the local drug court, and Ms. World had promised the judge she would keep the pills at her house and bring one to him. Every day.The rate of prescription overdose deaths among the 32,000 people sprinkled across two neighboring counties in this corner of Utah is nearly four times the state average. Addiction has rippled through ranks of miners who relied on pain pills after years of digging coal and working in the power plants.\u201cPeople call every day and say, \u2018Do you have an opening?\u2019\u201d Ms. Dolan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any money to pay for medication-assisted treatment, and we don\u2019t have prescribers to provide treatment.\u201dAfter years struggling with heroin addiction in Salt Lake City, Mr. World moved back in 2013, to the community where he had grown up in a loving family that went to Mormon services on weekends. (He is no longer a part of the church.)But it was no sanctuary. When Mr. World found a stray Chihuahua on the road a few months ago, it turned out the dog\u2019s young owner was in jail because of an opiate addiction. And getting drugs here proved just as easy as in the city: One Facebook message to an acquaintance did it.But it has been more than 300 days since he last used. His days now are work, therapy, random drug tests at the sheriff\u2019s office and morning visits from Mom.MilwaukeeSometimes they call themselves \u201cthe last responders.\u201dThey work in the county medical examiner\u2019s office, in a low-slung brick building downtown in the shadow of an old Pabst factory. Here is where they take over after a drug addiction has been more powerful than pleas from family, 12-step programs or even Narcan.\u201cWe\u2019re the end of the line,\u201d said Sara Schreiber, the forensic technical director, walking through the autopsy rooms to talk about the office\u2019s part in the opioid addiction epidemic \u2014 a crisis that has hit especially hard here.Last year, 299 people in Milwaukee County died of drug-related overdoses. One of them was the medical examiner\u2019s own son.Adam Peterson died in September at the age of 29, found unresponsive in a friend\u2019s apartment. \u201cAt this time I am not speaking publicly about Adam\u2019s death, and I appreciate your forbearance as my wife and I work through this issue,\u201d his father, Brian L. Peterson, the medical examiner, wrote in an email.Dr. Peterson has continued his work despite his grief. He oversees a staff of nearly 30 people \u2014 administrators, toxicologists and laboratory employees \u2014 who have perhaps never been more overwhelmed. They are confronting a surge of drug-related deaths in Milwaukee County, the most populous county in Wisconsin, with nearly one million people in the city and suburbs.They have witnessed an alarming rise in drug-related deaths for years now: 251 deaths in 2014, 255 in 2015, and they surpassed those figures in 2016. Dr. Peterson\u2019s son was among those who died last summer in a surge of overdoses that in seven weeks took more than 70 lives.Ms. Schreiber has witnessed much of the epidemic. The victims have been mostly middle-aged; more male than female; more white than black.As she walked through the laboratory, she pointed out the epidemic\u2019s effects. Now, the machines that analyze blood to help determine the ever-more-toxic blends of drugs are running far more often. They\u2019re juggling more cases and analyzing more specimens than before.Ms. Schreiber and her colleagues struggle with questions that they cannot answer. What can they do to stem the epidemic? How can they influence people while they are still alive?It\u2019s hard to know where to begin, she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t outrun it.\u201d JULIE BOSMANAdvertisement"}

Maybe there\u2019s a special message for someone in the puzzle, who knows?My point is, timing is very, very important. Let\u2019s take a look at Jacob Stulberg\u2019s puzzle.The reason there are unchecked squares today is that we are supposed to look at those four small sectors as mini checkerboards, but you have to read what they contain to get the whole theme. Fortunately, Mr. Stulberg stretches a revealer right across the center at 36A: the clue \u201cLiability for a political candidate ... as depicted four times in this puzzle?\u201d and, because they are checkerboards and because they contain the letters PAST, the answer is CHECKERED PAST.Like I said, timing is everything.\u25a0 7A: There is definitely SEX in some R-rated movies, but would you consider them SMUTTY? I suppose it depends on what happens onscreen.\u25a0 13A: Wordplay alert!

With a clue like \u201cTitle that anagrams to another title,\u201d how are you supposed to know what the answer is if they don\u2019t give you at least one of the titles? The answer is that you only have three squares, so it has to be a short title. Although I don\u2019t watch \u201cHeroes,\u201d I guessed that the ability of some of the heroes stated in the clue was E.S.P., so that gave me an S at the starting position. From there, it was fairly easy to figure out the answer was either SRI or SIR, and I got the correct one from the crossings.A tip of the hat to Will for lending a current-events angle to MICHAEL and ROBBY, which were originally clued as \u201c\u2018Peter Pan\u2019 character\u201d and \u201cSteinhardt of Kansas.\u201d Had I constructed this puzzle slightly later, my clue for HBO might well have been \u201c\u2018The Young 24-Across\u2019 airer.\u201dWant to join the biggest and Liveliest crossword solve on the internet?

Maybe that comes from her personality as a networker.\u201cI try to encourage people not to yell,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a little meeting with women who are part of the volunteer team. I said, \u2018If our goal is getting people to go toward Trump, criticizing them isn\u2019t the right way. It makes you look bad, too.\u2019 \u201d\u201cI don\u2019t attack people personally,\u201d she adds. \u201cExcept if I\u2019m by myself and the TV is on.\u201dShe pops an Abba album into the truck\u2019s CD player.Miles driven: 126.

She was good at leading people, but the world was also changing.In 2015, she sold her house in Cambridge and quit nursing to focus on an invention that involves beverages.\u201cI was living in my camper in Framingham in my friend\u2019s yard,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were liberal. Stuff was happening \u2014 San Bernardino, Paris. I\u2019d think: I don\u2019t know if I agree with them.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, she felt no sudden spark, she says. But his message steadily seeped in, like a slow-motion realization about herself and her beliefs: one she had always had, but had never really considered.\u201cPeople were lying down everywhere,\u201d she says, recalling protests about police violence. \u201cThey were lying down in Harvard Square. They were lying down on Route 93. They blocked traffic for three hours. Ninety-three is a really congested road; you want to pull your hair out anyway. To shut it down? What the hell is going on? What are these people doing?\u201dAt some point, she registered as a Republican.\u201cI was trying to find out who I am in this whole crazy mess,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I had to take a stand.

I grew up, I went to Catholic school. We did the Pledge of Allegiance every day. That was important.\u201d\u201cI started to pay attention not to what he was saying, but to the effect that he had. The freedom of speech things. He said outrageous things but so what. People would get so worked up over outrageous things.\u201d\u201cHe was the tough guy. I like that he stood up for himself.

Part of that is because of policing.\u201cThen he said, \u2018Trayvon Martin could have been my son.\u2019 Maybe that\u2019s what he\u2019s thinking, but when he says something like that as a leader, people listen. I had this like, \u2018What?\u2019 I was confused by that. What are you doing?\u201dShe added: \u201cThings have changed in terms of the criminality. People will do anything. They are going up to cops and executing them. People are blowing themselves up. They are ramming trucks into things. If you alienate the police, then we are going to have no law and order.\u201dOn Mr. Obama, she said: \u201cWhen you are the leader, there are times when you have to bite your tongue.\u201dShe added: \u201cI feel the irony in that, because people will say Donald Trump doesn\u2019t bite his tongue.

Two friends used to give him a lot of landscaping work 10 or 15 years ago, but have since stopped; they have Latin American employees now. Another client, who recently sold a company for millions, said he wanted to cut Scott\u2019s rate to $20 an hour from $30 and asked him if he could learn Spanish to manage a work crew.\u201cFundamentally, it\u2019s not fair,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m working seven days a week now so I can carry myself through the winter. They say Republicans want the cheaper labor and Democrats want the votes. But I think they both want cheaper labor. People with money just want cheaper labor.\u201dHe says he does not blame the laborers, but is angry with politicians who talk as if it were not a problem.\u201cIf I was a poor person south of the border, I\u2019d probably do the same thing,\u201d he says.Scott, 58, who lives in Beverly, Mass., has led rafting trips in Texas on the Rio Grande for years. In 2010, he says, he was at the end of a rafting trip when he saw five people trying to cross the river. They appeared to be asking him to help them across. He kept going.Several months later, Janet Napolitano \u2014 then the secretary of homeland security \u2014 was nearby, in Laredo, Tex., and said the border had never been more secure. Scott says he did not believe her.\u201cYou lose your language, border and your culture, you\u2019re going to lose your country,\u201d he says, sounding one of the president-elect\u2019s campaign themes. \u201cYour country is done.\u201dMiles driven: 240.

That\u2019s huge for me. I bought a house five years ago and the taxes have gone up $200 every single year.\u201dScott doesn\u2019t trusts the elites \u2014 entrenched politicians with money.\u201cI don\u2019t trust McCain, I don\u2019t trust Rubio, I don\u2019t trust Paul Ryan,\u201d he says. \u201cI love Trump for calling out the elites and the ruling class for who they are. Because they have forgotten about the working man and working woman.\u201dHe is also suspicious of the term \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\u201dDianna says: \u201cAnytime a politician uses the word comprehensive, it makes you think they are lying. It\u2019s just an empty word. Smoke and mirrors. They throw big words around, make it look like they are actually doing something. Makes people feel like, almost like they are not smart enough to understand what they are doing.\u201dShe added, \u201cI think Trump will deliver.\u201dOur dinner comes.

Then I ask about health care.\u201cI spent probably $20,000 on health care last year,\u201d Dianna says. She was paying about $850 a month through a private plan she bought herself. But her deductible for out-of-network care jumped to $4,500 from $3,000. In-network, she says, jumped to $3,000 from $2,000.Dianna, who has been living off the proceeds from the sale of her house in Cambridge, says she could have gotten insured through Obamacare last year, because she was not working. But she chose not to.\u201cI said, Dianna, how can you go on food stamps and get free health care if you are volunteering for Trump? I thought it would be the wrong thing to do.\u201dBut now she has Obamacare. She is helping to support her father, she explains, and her budget has gotten tight.\u201cI don\u2019t feel good that I had to do that,\u201d she says. \u201cI have more control over my life when I have better health insurance. It\u2019s also about pride.\u201dMiles driven: 381. Miles to go: 89._____Whatever happens with Mr. Trump, Scott Hayes has already won something important: a deep network of people who think like him. He has a flip phone. He is not on Facebook. But he believes he will hold on to those new connections. They have revived him. Made him feel more alive.\u201cI always felt so alone, like nobody wanted to hear what I was saying,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019d go to these rallies just to see if there were other people who thought like I did. Now I\u2019m meeting all kinds of people. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201dDianna wants to keep up the momentum with all the people she has met, too. Like the woman named May who owns a Chinese restaurant in Newton, Mass., and who went up to New Hampshire on Tuesdays with some of her staff to volunteer.Dianna organized a Christmas party for Trump supporters in Massachusetts in December. There was Champagne on every table. The cardboard cutout of Trump was there, too.\u201cI\u2019m relieved,\u201d she says. \u201cHe won.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Most Dangerous Place on Earth,\u2019 Just Seconds Away", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesFor an exploration of one of the great themes of adolescence \u2014 oh, Lord, please don\u2019t let me be misunderstood \u2014 it\u2019s always fun to revisit \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d John Hughes\u2019s 1985 film about five teenagers trapped, \u201cNo Exit\u201d-style, in Saturday morning detention.By the end of the day, 80 percent of them are making out, Ally Sheedy has learned that you can\u2019t make friends if you wear too much mascara, and the group has produced a collective manifesto on the evils of stereotyping.\u201cYou see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms, the most convenient definitions,\u201d they declare. \u201cBut what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess and a criminal.\u201dClearly no one has learned anything in the last 30-plus years. The characters in \u201cThe Most Dangerous Place on Earth,\u201d Lindsey Lee Johnson\u2019s alarming, compelling and coolly funny debut novel about the goings-on in and out of a high school in Marin County, Calif., spend most of their time spectacularly failing to see beneath one another\u2019s surfaces.Take the deluded mother of Ryan Harbinger, who monitors his movements, oversees his homework, compulsively checks in with his teachers, gossips with his friends\u2019 mothers and generally hovers with increasing panic. \u201cFor all these efforts, she knew nothing,\u201d Ms. Johnson writes. \u201cKnew nothing of the whirrings of his brain, the anger in his heart, the desire for he knew not what, or the knot at the floor of his stomach that had been there as long as he could remember, telling him that something was not right.\u201dMs. Johnson\u2019s characters are unpredictable, contradictory and many things at once, which make them particularly satisfying. As it happens, the sensitive, lonely Ryan was also responsible for the shocking incident of bullying that begins the novel and whose repercussions echo throughout. In this first section, the kids are in eighth grade. A boy named Tristan Bloch \u2014 slow, fat, pale, one of nature\u2019s victims in stained, oversize sweatpants \u2014 makes the grave mistake of writing a nakedly honest love letter to a classmate, Cally Broderick.\u201cYou might not think that anyone in this School sees you but I do,\u201d Tristan writes. (Like many of the students, he seems unfamiliar with basic rules of grammar, capitalization and punctuation.) \u201cI mean sees you really.\u201dCally shows the note to her mean-girl friend Abigail Cress, who gives it to Ryan, who posts excerpts on Facebook, which becomes the forum for a vicious anti-Tristan campaign with disastrous consequences.Having seized our attention with this arresting event, Ms. Johnson then does something very clever: She jumps ahead to the first day of 11th grade, when what happened before is mostly a distressing memory, and follows various characters through the fresh hell of the new school year.Here\u2019s Molly Nicoll, a 23-year-old novice teacher who starts the first day of class \u201cwaving her arm in the manner of a desperate hitchhiker\u201d and then resolves to make a difference in her students\u2019 lives. (Good luck with that.) In her efforts to be down with the kids, she totally misses the subtext in nearly every encounter she has with everyone in the school.Here\u2019s high school life in all its madness. Abigail, now an anxious hyperachiever, is lured into an affair with a predatory English teacher that involves meeting at the Dumpsters behind Starbucks. Elisabeth Evarine, so beautiful that she is \u201ctrailed down Miller Avenue by grown men in Lexus sedans,\u201d is friendless, unfairly shunned as conceited and unattainable.Nick Brickston makes money dealing drugs and illegally taking the SAT on behalf of other students. Cally has become Calista, racked with guilt and hanging out with the hippie-stoner girls. Dave Chu nearly collapses under the weight of parental expectation.For its compassion, its ability to see the humanity inside even the most apparently hopeless person and the shimmering intelligence of its prose, \u201cThe Most Dangerous Place on Earth\u201d reminded me a bit of Rick Moody\u2019s great 1994 novel, \u201cThe Ice Storm.\u201d You end up sympathizing with and aching for even characters who appear to be irredeemable. It is heartbreaking at the end of the novel to find out what Ryan keeps in a shoe box in his closet and what he does with it when he cannot sleep.Ms. Johnson finds delightful new ways to address the perennial topic of how teenagers welded to laptops and smartphones can become very stupid indeed. \u201cCouldn\u2019t they at least bother to change the font?\u201d Miss Nicoll wonders crossly, when a bunch of students turn in essays on \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d that are, basically, copied from Wikipedia.Hospitalized with serious injuries after a car accident, Emma Fleed turns on her phone to find a barrage of semiliterate inanity from her so-called friends. \u201comfg em r u ok I cant beleive this happened!!\u201d says one text message, in its entirety. Another says, \u201cYo ima try to get there to see you asap.\u201dAs is so often the case, Facebook \u2014 where the campaign is waged against poor Tristan, where a progression of lurid postings about Emma goes viral and turns her into a social pariah, where people stumble on to all kinds of things that only make them feel terrible about themselves \u2014 is the absolute worst. The kids should stop using it immediately, and so should we. In the end, the most dangerous place on earth may not be on earth at all but in cyberspace.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Backlash Spawns Another for Oklahoma Paper That Backed Clinton", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byThe backlash to the backlash has been just as swift and sizable but far from local: slightly more than 200 new subscriptions and donations, a majority of which appear to come from out-of-state Democrats.The subscription battle that has broken out in Enid, Okla., a city of 52,000 whose biggest claim to fame is having one of the largest grain storage capacities in the world, caught The Enid News & Eagle by surprise. The daily newspaper, which has a circulation of 10,000 and has a history of endorsing Republicans, lost nearly 2 percent of its subscribers and 11 advertisers after its editorial board backed Mrs. Clinton and called Donald J. Trump \u201cunfit to be president\u201d in an editorial on Oct. 9.\u201cI\u2019ve done quite a bit of work in Oklahoma, so I know how conservative the state is, and that just reinforced my feeling that these folks were pretty gutsy,\u201d said Ben L. Harding, 68, a new subscriber who is an engineer in Boulder, Colo.Some of those who contacted The News & Eagle donated subscriptions to the paper\u2019s Newspapers in Education program, which provides newspapers for classroom use.The publisher of The News & Eagle, Jeff L. Funk, who has stood by the endorsement and who is a member of the editorial board, said the paper received 195 new digital or mail subscriptions as a result of the article in The Times, which was first published online on Dec. 26. An additional 13 people donated subscriptions.It is unclear what the new out-of-state subscribers will make of The News & Eagle and the city it covers. One recent front page had a breaking news story \u2014 two schools went on lockdown after a man was spotted with a military-style rifle nearby \u2014 and a detailed play-by-play of the city commission\u2019s debate over the confidentiality of executive sessions. \u201cNever Assume\u201d reads the newsroom\u2019s framed credo posted outside the executive editor\u2019s office.Residents who canceled subscriptions said they were outraged that their hometown paper could be so out of touch with its readership and said they had been frustrated with what they viewed as the liberal slant of the news media.\u201cAll the media is liberal leaning, and I\u2019m tired of it,\u201d said Larry Spaeth, 58, who had been a subscriber since 1990 but canceled the day the editorial was published. \u201cYou kind of miss it, you know, getting it thrown in your driveway every morning, and you get to keep up with what\u2019s going on in the town. But you got to take a stand sometime.\u201dDwight Olson, 62, an Enid veterinarian and former city commissioner who voted for Mr. Trump, said he thought about canceling his subscription \u201cfor five minutes,\u201d but decided against it. He welcomed the attention, and the new readers.\u201cIf the Enid paper can get publicity nationally and that ups their subscription, that is great,\u201d Mr. Olson said. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s about time the Democrats are doing something positive in this postelection thing. It seems like they\u2019re crying and bellyaching over everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Alt-Majority: How Social Networks Empowered Mass Protests Against Trump", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut it\u2019s not just the politician who is moving fast. It\u2019s the population, too.Mr. Trump feeds off media attention. Throughout the campaign, the bigger a spectacle he created, the larger he loomed in the public consciousness. What has been remarkable during the last two weekends is how thoroughly Mr. Trump\u2019s own media personage was blotted out by scenes of protesters.In a brief appearance on Saturday, the president assured the nation that his immigrant ban was \u201cworking out very nicely \u2014 you see it in the airports.\u201d But the pictures and videos flooding across our social streams put the lie to Mr. Trump\u2019s breezy pronouncements. Things at the airports weren\u2019t working out very nicely; you could see it right there on Instagram.A similar story unfolded the weekend before. In his inaugural address Mr. Trump claimed the mantle of popular will. The next day, a far larger illustration of popular will was on display at marches across the country. The people who gathered for the women\u2019s march hijacked the media narrative.Something sure is. We\u2019re witnessing the stirrings of a national popular movement aimed at defeating the policies of Mr. Trump. It is a movement without official leaders. In fact, to a noteworthy degree, the formal apparatus of the Democratic Party has been nearly absent from the uprisings. Unlike the Tea Party and the white-supremacist \u201calt-right,\u201d the new movement has no name. Call it the alt-left, or, if you want to really drive Mr. Trump up the wall, the alt-majority.Or call it nothing. Though nameless and decentralized, the movement isn\u2019t chaotic. Because it was hatched on social networks and is dispatched by mobile phones, it appears to be organizationally sophisticated and ferociously savvy about conquering the media.Over two weekends, the protests have accomplished something just about unprecedented in the nearly two years since Mr. Trump first declared his White House run: They have nudged him from the media spotlight he depends on. They are the only force we\u2019ve seen that has been capable of untangling his singular hold on the media ecosystem.The movement is new and possibly fragile; it could dissipate, like so much else that has come up against Mr. Trump.The movement has other skills. It\u2019s capable of coming up with catchy slogans, funny signs and even branding efforts to rival Mr. Trump\u2019s own. The president has his Make America Great Again hats. Protesters at the women\u2019s march had pink woolen hats with cat ears \u2014 \u201cpussy hats,\u201d a reference to the president\u2019s confessed penchant for grabbing things.But unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s hats, the pink caps came from the crowd. Thousands of knitters created them in the weeks between the election and the inauguration, then mailed them off to strangers who shared their views.Most important, though, the movement can command the media narrative. The president has promised a lot of bold change. His boldness will involve lots of real-world consequences. Millions might lose health care coverage if he repeals the Affordable Care Act. Many might be deported if he achieves his immigration proposals.If the last two weeks are any indication, though, none of this will happen quietly. There will be pictures and viral videos of real people facing hardship, and those pictures are sure to inspire hordes. When people are left with crippling medical bills in the absence of health insurance, or when people are deported to Mexico, you will see large gatherings on Facebook, and then on TV.Already, a group of scientists are planning to march on Washington in opposition to what they say is Mr. Trump\u2019s disdain for science. There are other protests planned for Tax Day in April to remind the nation that the president once promised to release his tax returns, then reneged.You might wonder if the protests will achieve much. Americans have protested before (the war in Iraq comes to mind) and the protests did not, in themselves, alter national policy.But if Mr. Trump has proved anything, it\u2019s that everything is different now. We live in a culture ruled by social media streams, one in which most people are skeptical of what they see and read in the \u201cmainstream media.\u201dUnlike the news media, though, protesters produce an undeniable reality. Protesters can\u2019t easily be dismissed as \u201cfake news.\u201d They come to you unmediated \u2014 not from The New York Times, but from your friends and friends of friends on Facebook.They are, in other words, just another version of your social network \u2014 the physical manifestation of an outraged News Feed. Because they\u2019re people you know, they can\u2019t easily be maligned as biased or unfair.When politicians take on political crowds rather than other politicians, it usually ends badly. Hillary Clinton had to apologize for calling Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters \u201cdeplorables.\u201d After first bashing the women\u2019s march on Twitter, even Mr. Trump had to praise the demonstrators.Now Mr. Trump faces the same dynamic, in reverse. The crowds at his inauguration were supposed to certify his popularity. When they fizzled, and were then outmatched by opposition protests, he couldn\u2019t help relitigating the matter for days.Things haven\u2019t gotten better. Now there are crowds on every screen and every feed. The people aren\u2019t saying nice things about him. And there\u2019s something worse than that, too: They\u2019ve stolen the limelight for themselves.Advertisement"}

He was hearing \u201cmore and more\u201d about evidence of rigging, he added, leaving the details to his supporters\u2019 imagination.A few weeks later, Cameron Harris, a new college graduate with a fervent interest in Maryland Republican politics and a need for cash, sat down at the kitchen table in his apartment to fill in the details Mr. Trump had left out. In a dubious art just coming into its prime, this bogus story would be his masterpiece.Mr. Harris started by crafting the headline: \u201cBREAKING: \u2018Tens of thousands\u2019 of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse.\u201d It made sense, he figured, to locate this shocking discovery in the very city and state where Mr. Trump had highlighted his \u201crigged\u201d meme.\u201cI had a theory when I sat down to write it,\u201d recalled Mr. Harris, a 23-year-old former college quarterback and fraternity leader. \u201cGiven the severe distrust of the media among Trump supporters, anything that parroted Trump\u2019s talking points people would click. Trump was saying \u2018rigged election, rigged election.\u2019 People were predisposed to believe Hillary Clinton could not win except by cheating.\u201dIn a raucous election year defined by made-up stories, Mr. Harris was a home-grown, self-taught practitioner, a boutique operator with no ties to Russian spy agencies or Macedonian fabrication factories. As Mr. Trump takes office this week, the beneficiary of at least a modest electoral boost from a flood of fakery, Mr. Harris and his ersatz-news website, ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, make for an illuminating tale.Contacted by a reporter who had discovered an electronic clue that revealed his secret authorship of ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, he was wary at first, chagrined to be unmasked.\u201cThis topic is rather sensitive,\u201d Mr. Harris said, noting that he was trying to build a political consulting business and needed to protect his reputation. But eventually he agreed to tell the story of his foray into fake news, a very part-time gig that he calculated paid him about $1,000 an hour in web advertising revenue. He seemed to regard his experience with a combination of guilt about having spread falsehoods and pride at doing it so skillfully.\u201cNo one really goes in this building. It\u2019s mainly used for short-term storage by a commercial plumber,\u201d Prince said.In case anyone missed the significance of the find, Mr. Harris made it plain: \u201cWhat he found could allegedly be evidence of a massive operation designed to deliver Clinton the crucial swing state.\u201dA photograph, he thought, would help erase doubts about his yarn. With a quick Google image search for \u201cballot boxes,\u201d he landed on a shot of a balding fellow standing behind black plastic boxes that helpfully had \u201cBallot Box\u201d labels.He was correct. The ballot box story, promoted by a half-dozen Facebook pages Mr. Harris had created for the purpose, flew around the web, fueled by indignant comments from people who were certain that Mrs. Clinton was going to cheat Mr. Trump of victory and who welcomed the proof. It was eventually shared with six million people, according to CrowdTangle, which tracks web audiences.\u201cA Christian myself, I take offense to reading such unbelievable lies from a publication alleging Christian ties,\u201d Mr. Husted said.He had put in perhaps half an hour a week on the fake news site, he said, for a total of about 20 hours. He would come close to a far bigger payday, one that might have turned the $5 he had spent on the Christian Times domain into more than $100,000.The money, not the politics, was the point, he insisted. He had graduated from Davidson College in North Carolina in May, and he needed to pay his living expenses. \u201cI spent the money on student loans, car payments and rent,\u201d he said.By the time he launched his fraudulent story on ballot fraud, he had found minimal success with \u201cHillary Clinton Blames Racism for Cincinnati Gorilla\u2019s Death,\u201d a reference to the sad tale of Harambe, the gorilla shot after he grabbed a little boy visiting the zoo. He had done better with \u201cEarly Morning Explosion in DC Allegedly Leaves Yet Another DNC Staffer Dead,\u201d spinning off conspiracy theories around the earlier shooting death of a Democratic National Committee staff member.President Obama thought the fake news phenomenon significant enough to mention it as a threat to democracy in his farewell speech in Chicago last week. \u201cIncreasingly,\u201d he said, \u201cwe become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it\u2019s true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.\u201dDonald J. Trump has used false claims to attack political opponents, question the legitimacy of the Obama administration and undermine the news media. The practice has paralleled his rise from reality TV star to holder of the nation\u2019s highest elected office.That was exactly the insight on which Mr. Harris said he built his transient business: that people wanted to be fed evidence, however implausible, to support their beliefs. \u201cAt first it kind of shocked me \u2014 the response I was getting,\u201d he said. \u201cHow easily people would believe it. It was almost like a sociological experiment,\u201d added Mr. Harris, who majored in political science and economics.By his account, though he voted for Mr. Trump, his early preference had been for Senator Marco Rubio. Mr. Harris said he would have been willing to promote Mrs. Clinton and smear Mr. Trump had those tactics been lucrative. But as other seekers of clicks discovered, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters were far more fervent than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s.In late October, with the inevitable end of his venture approaching, Mr. Harris sought an appraisal for the web domain that by then had vaulted into the web\u2019s top 20,000 sites. An appraiser said that given the traffic, he could probably sell it for between $115,000 and $125,000.A few days later, when Mr. Harris checked his site, the ads were gone. He checked with the appraiser and was told that the domain was now essentially worthless.All was not lost, however. He had put a pop-up on the site inviting visitors to \u201cjoin the \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 team to find out HOW Hillary plans to steal the election and what YOU can do to stop her!\u201d and collected 24,000 email addresses. He has not yet decided what to do with them, he said.Asked whether he felt any guilt at having spread lies about a presidential candidate, Mr. Harris grew thoughtful. But he took refuge in the notion that politics is by its nature replete with exaggerations, half-truths and outright whoppers, so he was hardly adding much to the sum total.\u201cHardly anything a campaign or a candidate says is completely true,\u201d he said.Lately he has picked up Mr. Trump\u2019s refrain that mainstream news organizations are themselves regular purveyors of fake news. Last week, when BuzzFeed released what it called an \u201cexplosive but unverified\u201d dossier suggesting that Russia had planned to bribe and blackmail Mr. Trump, Mr. Harris wrote on Twitter:He did not mention his own expertise in the field.Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the origin of a widely shared fake news story misstated a Twitter post by Cameron Harris, a 23-year-old Maryland man who created the article and the website on which it originated. Mr. Harris, quoting BuzzFeed\u2019s description of a dossier on alleged Russian attempts to win influence over Donald J. Trump, wrote: \u201c \u2018Explosive but unverified\u2019 \u2014 That could describe every fake news headline ever.\u201d His Twitter post did not say, \u201cHe did not mention his own expertise in the field.\u201d (That was the last sentence of the Times article, referring to Mr. Harris.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberal Lawyers Plan Wave of Resistance to Trump Policies", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The calls and emails went out a little past 10 p.m. Friday, rippling through an informal network of current and former Yale Law School students who had worked at the school\u2019s immigrant rights advocacy clinic. The news told of an Iraqi man being detained at Kennedy International Airport because of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, putting him at imminent risk of deportation.Around 5:30 a.m. \u2014 shortly before the first Europe-bound flights were scheduled to depart \u2014 they filed the lawsuit on the electronic docket system for the Eastern District of New York. Then they began converting their files into templates for lawyers in districts across the country to use, as well.So began the opening salvos of the legal pushback to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order banning entry to refugees and others from seven predominantly Muslim countries.The effort illustrates that a broad mobilization of rights-oriented lawyers is emerging.Determined to make legal resistance one of the defining attributes of the Trump era, lawyers at liberal advocacy groups have been putting aside institutional rivalries and organizing to work together on litigation.Several leaders of the effort said their hope is that the judiciary may serve as a strong check to a government controlled by Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress across a broad range of anticipated fights.\u201cWe are clearly in a moment in which civil rights organizations face unprecedented challenges and will need to mount new and more aggressive strategies,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee.Now, with the lawsuit filed in Brooklyn \u2014 which was quickly echoed elsewhere, including one filed in Virginia by two other veterans of the Yale immigration clinic \u2014 the leading edge of that wave is arriving. (The litigation joins a lawsuit filed last week arguing that Mr. Trump\u2019s ownership of businesses that take payments from foreign governments violates the Constitution.)Propelling the effort is an outpouring of financial support and volunteers that legal rights group leaders say dwarfs the campaign that gradually emerged to counter the George W. Bush administration\u2019s post-Sept. 11 national security policies, including detention without trial at the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.The A.C.L.U.\u2019s membership rolls and fund-raising provide a measure of those energies. Mr. Romero said his group last year had about 400,000 members \u2014 to be active, people must give at least $20 each year \u2014 down from its peak of about 550,000 during the Bush administration. In each of the past three years, its website took in about $5 million in donations, he said.But just since Election Day, he said, the A.C.L.U. has surged to more than a million members and \u2014 as of 5 p.m. Monday \u2014 it had taken in $71.3 million from 921,304 online donations; $31.5 million of that came from 456,714 since Friday, when Mr. Trump signed the travel ban. The money will fund many more lawyers at both the federal and state level, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary \u2014 we\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Mr. Romero said. \u201cIt means that people expect us to do a lot more of this work.\u201dOther organizations also reported a surge in fund-raising and interest. Caroline Fredrickson, the executive director of the American Constitution Society, said that when her organization sponsors a conference call to discuss an issue, it typically gets 80 to 100 R.S.V.P.s. On Monday, it announced a call about the travel ban and got 500, she said.\u201cThe bar has been galvanized in a way I have not seen since the 1960s,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are just showering us with offers of legal assistance.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to supplant other organizations \u2014 we\u2019re looking to complement them,\u201d Ms. Love said.Many immigrant legal advocacy groups were also steering volunteer lawyers to airports, and over the weekend at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, the number of volunteer lawyers at times exceeded the number of protesters. By Sunday, the volunteers had set up a makeshift legal clinic on a folding table under a bank of escalators and began to organize themselves, starting a WhatsApp group to share information and a Google spreadsheet to track potential cases.The man had a special visa that is given to those who have worked for the United States military or government, and was arriving with his wife and children.\u201cIf you get pulled aside, give them my name, give them my phone number and tell them I\u2019m your lawyer,\u201d Ms. Murray told him.Then the waiting began. After hours to clear customs, her clients made it out.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rare Corner of Finance Where Women Dominate", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byOnce a year, a small group of executives who control trillions of dollars in American companies meet for lunch in Manhattan. Among the things they discuss: pushing for greater say in how companies are run.It is an elite gathering, but you will not see a single man in a suit in the room. The event, called the Women in Governance lunch, underscores a rare corner in finance where women dominate.Women hold the top positions in corporate governance at many of the biggest mutual funds and pension funds \u2014 deciding which way to vote on the directors of a company board. They make decisions on behalf of teachers, government workers, doctors and most people in the United States who have a 401(k). The corporate governance heads at seven of the 10 largest institutional investors in stocks are now women, according to data compiled by The New York Times. Those investors oversee $14 trillion in assets.Corporate governance is playing a growing role within the broader ecosystem of corporate America. Each spring, publicly traded companies hold shareholder meetings and outline business strategy for the coming year. Shareholders like BlackRock, T. Rowe Price and State Street vote on corporate strategy and issues including company board appointments and compensation.Their votes can go a long way, given the huge stakes these institutions control in United States companies. BlackRock holds a stake greater than 5 percent in 75 of the 100 largest companies, according to data compiled by Jerry Davis, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. State Street has more than than 5 percent of 23 of the largest companies, while Capital Group owns more than 5 percent of 20 of the biggest companies.That power, however, is rarely wielded to confront companies. Most of the time, these huge institutional investors choose to vote with management.And their approach contrasts sharply with that of brash activist billionaires like William A. Ackman and Daniel S. Loeb, who have made a name for themselves as corporate agitators. These investors bring about change by theatrically pounding on the front doors of companies and using the public court of opinion to bully companies into changing their strategies.Still, the heads of corporate governance at institutional giants say they are working quietly behind the scenes to advocate for greater shareholder rights.Now, Ms. Anderson\u2019s team is weighing whether to create a similar policy for gender diversity on corporate boards.\u201cWe have an interest in seeing more women on boards because there is data that a more diverse board makes better decisions,\u201d said Ms. Anderson, who was at Invesco before T. Rowe Price and has been working in the field of corporate governance for two decades.Efforts by mutual funds to change the behavior of a company by using the power of a proxy vote is a fairly recent phenomenon. For decades, powerful institutional investors automatically rubber-stamped the decisions of corporate management and boards. At the same, many top executives paid little attention to the concerns of their shareholders.\u201cMany years ago, for every 10 letters we wrote, we generally heard back from half,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cNow it\u2019s 100 percent.\u201d Today, companies in which T. Rowe Price holds a large stake will even reach out to the firm unprompted.The 2008 financial crisis was a turning point for shareholders, said Anne Sheehan, the director of corporate governance at California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the public pension fund.Ms. Sheehan joined the pension fund, Calstrs, in October 2008, in the depths of the financial crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. \u201cTalk about hitting the ground running and seeing what the impact of that crisis was doing to our portfolio,\u201d she said.The experience was an eye-opener. \u201cI saw it as an opportunity to make our voices known in the debate,\u201d Ms. Sheehan said. \u201cWhat were these directors doing on our behalf? How could shareholders speak up?\u201dThe crisis, she added, \u201creally brought home the prevalence of the \u2018Old Boys Network\u2019 inside the board rooms of these financial firms which resulted in too much group think.\u201dThe corporate governance team at Calstrs regularly questions companies on a range of issues including gender diversity and the pay gap between the top executives at a company and the most junior employees. Having women in positions of governance has helped bring these issues to the forefront of the discussion at companies, Ms. Sheehan said.\u201cIt reminded me of the old adage: If you want to get something done, put a woman in charge,\u201d she added.At BlackRock, Michelle Edkins and her team of 30 analyze whether certain corporate directors are being paid too much and whether they have overstayed their terms. If there is a problem, they begin by opening a dialogue with the company.Ms. Edkins, who trained as an economist in New Zealand and took her first position in corporate governance in 1997 by answering an ad in The Financial Times, said women tended to be less confrontational than men, making it easier to address a problem and try to fix it in this way.\u201cWe don\u2019t meet with C.E.O.s and tell them how to remedy the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a stylistic difference and my observation is that this constructive challenge comes more naturally to women.\u201dBut to some critics, this approach is not yielding change fast enough.BlackRock\u2019s track record on voting against corporate management reveals that it is taking a slower approach to pushing for change. For example, on the issue of executive pay, during the most recent reporting period ending on June 30, BlackRock voted 96.3 percent of the time to support compensation policies across the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, according to Proxy Insight.It also voted against every shareholder proposal relating to diversity, environment, governance and social concerns over the last year, according to Proxy Insight.The record is not much better at other top institutional investors.Nick Dawson, a co-founder of Proxy Insight, said that while investors treat issues related to environmental, social and governance policies, known in industry parlance as E.S.G., very seriously, \u201cthere is a clear preference for behind-the-scenes engagement on these issues.\u201d \u201cAsset managers prefer to ensure that management teams are capable of dealing with E.S.G. issues in-house, rather than by applying external pressure,\u201d he said.Still, BlackRock said that it voted against pay practices or compensation committee members at 10 of the 50 companies where executives were paid the most during the most recent reporting period.And other investors like the activist hedge fund Elliott Management said that it had become much easier to engage with companies.\u201cWhen an activist shows up to a situation, having these engaged, thoughtful leaders involved in the discussion helps the company and the activist get to a collaborative solution,\u201d said Jesse Cohn, the head of United States equity activism at Elliott. This, he added, happens \u201cwell in advance of a proxy contest.\u201dThere is concern that on the subject of gender, women are less likely to push for greater diversity. Some women in high-power corporate governance positions said that they preferred not to bring up gender as an issue in discussions with management on concern they will be perceived to have an agenda.But some experts say there is tremendous potential for the network of women in corporate governance to make a bigger difference.\u201cIf there is an old girls\u2019 network so to speak with so much authority in corporate governance, this is an opportunity to create an agenda for greater diversity through a formalized means,\u201d said Mr. Davis, at the University of Michigan.While women like Ms. Edkins are fighting behind the scenes to bring more women onto the boards of America\u2019s biggest companies, they are struggling with an entirely different diversity challenge of their own: the lack of men in the field of corporate governance.\u201cIt\u2019s counterintuitive in finance,\u201d Ms. Edkins said. \u201cBut when we are hiring, we need to really push that diversity to make sure we have men on the slate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Animals are not for our pleasure. Kids usually have a very empathic view on animals, something you are trying to break down.\u201dA German woman, Sandra Zumbrock, wrote, \u201cThis is just sick.\u201dOthers, like Jonas Gulstad Opsal, an actor from Steinkjer, said there was nothing to fuss over.\u201cIt is food, Mrs. Dybdahl-Ihlen,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cMany of the kids in that kindergarten will become food producers, so this is something they have to learn to relate to.\u201d\u201cWe are overwhelmed by the attention,\u201d Dag Olav Stolan, the director of the school, said by phone Friday evening. \u201cWe are just a small kindergarten in a small countryside village in Norway.\u201dBy the middle of the week, Mr. Stolan felt obligated to post English and German translations of the school\u2019s post on Facebook, and Mr. Stolan was fielding calls from journalists around the world.Parents came to the school\u2019s defense. Anette Knutsen said her daughter came home from the excursion beaming. \u201cSo much to tell about,\u201d Ms. Knutsen said. \u201cGreat idea, from a great kindergarten.\u201dAnother parent, Kristin Dahlo, said she was glad her daughter attended the school. Too many people do not know the origins of the food they are eating, she said.Mr. Stolan said that deleting the post was out of the question. \u201cThis is what we stand for,\u201d he said.\u201cBringing the kids to see how meat is produced is part of the upbringing,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many people think food is produced at the shop window. I\u2019d say this is pretty ingrained in Norwegian culture, since the old days. Kids on the farm were always brought to see the slaughter from their early years off, and still today, many go with their parents to see how animals are slaughtered after the hunt.\u201dReindeer herds graze in the mountains around Henning, and many of the animals are slaughtered every year when they come down from the mountain.Eliinor Marita, the leader of a regional group of Sami raindeer herders and a member of the Sami Parliament of Norway, wrote in an online post that she was grateful to the school for having brought the children.This week was not the first time students had been brought to observe the slaughter, Mr. Stolan said.\u201cNone of the kids actually get to see the moment the animal is killed, and we asked all the parents for their consent before we went,\u201d Mr. Stolan said. The class had 15 students. One parent asked that her child not visit the slaughterhouse, he said.Mr. Stolan said it was not the first time the school\u2019s approach to animals had made the news. \u201cA couple of years ago we caused a media stir when we raised a pig in the school \u2014 just so we could show the kids an age-old Norwegian tradition, slaughtering the pig for Christmas,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd so we did, even if some of the kids had of course come to like the pig.\u201dHe said he could not recall the name the children had given the pig.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Other Kushner Brother\u2019s Big Bet", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byJust days after the 2016 presidential election, a young venture capitalist called an emergency staff meeting.Prepare for a storm of publicity, he told one of the start-ups that he had helped found. There would be questions about his political affiliations and loyalties, he said. There would be questions about the survivability of the start-up, a health insurance company named Oscar Health. The world was about to change, he said.At the same time, Joshua Kushner has had to deal with queries from investors in his venture capital funds who have asked him how Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension would affect his work. Some wondered whether he would join the White House. Others worried that the presidential circus would be a distraction, especially since ties with his brother might make it difficult to maintain a distance.\u201cJosh doesn\u2019t want a public profile,\u201d said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, which is an investor in Thrive. \u201cHe assured us that he would remain focused on Thrive.\u201dTo date, money from Mr. Kushner\u2019s immediate family members represents less than $5 million of his venture funds. Jared is now divesting his shares in Thrive because of his move into the White House. The Trump family has not invested.While the brothers are known by friends and colleagues as ambitious workaholics with ties to power brokers on both coasts, in many ways their paths have diverged. Jared Kushner has emerged as an increasingly public figure since becoming the face of the family\u2019s real estate firm, Kushner Companies, and buying the publisher Observer Media. That company\u2019s newspaper, The New York Observer, has mythologized the city\u2019s media, real estate and political power brokers for a generation of New Yorkers. Jared is also often photographed at society events with Ms. Trump, and is now frequently seen in the background of meetings with the president-elect.\u201cMost moguls love to name-drop and tell you about their vacations and appeal to you with how celestial their orbit is, but that\u2019s not Josh,\u201d said Patrick Collison, the chief executive of Stripe, a mobile payments start-up in San Francisco that Mr. Kushner has invested in.Mr. Kushner declined to speak on the record for this article, and a spokesman for Mr. Trump declined to comment. In an interview, Ms. Trump said that \u201cJared and Josh have a very special relationship defined by tremendous love, admiration and mutual respect.\u201d She declined to talk about politics.Mr. Kushner and his siblings grew up spending nights and weekends at work with their father, visiting properties, looking at financial data and sometimes skipping school to attend business meetings. In 2004, Mr. Kushner was accepted to Harvard, which Jared had also attended.During the summers, Mr. Kushner interned at Goldman\u2019s real estate banking division and at the real estate giants Vornado and SL Green with an eye toward working in the industry. But in his junior year of college, he started a company, Vostu, that made video games for social media networks like Facebook. He founded Vostu with two classmates, including Mario Schlosser, who is now the chief executive of Oscar Health.\u201cJosh stepped away from the family business,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a Harvard classmate who now runs Cadre, a real estate start-up that lets wealthy individuals buy pieces of commercial property developments. The company was started in the offices of Thrive.Neither Vostu nor Unithrive was a runaway success. Vostu has since laid off most of its employees, and Unithrive is defunct. So, using money generated from Vostu, Mr. Kushner turned away from founding businesses and began investing in them instead, beginning with small investments in companies like the crowdfunding site Kickstarter.His investments caught the attention of others in the tech industry, including Joel Cutler, a venture capitalist at General Catalyst. \u201cJosh had been able to get into investment pools with the best and smartest in the industry,\u201d Mr. Cutler said. \u201cI encouraged him to start a firm.\u201dIn 2010, while at Harvard Business School, Mr. Kushner started Thrive. He was 25.In an interview in 2011, while juggling business school with working at Vostu and meeting with start-ups, Mr. Kushner said his job as an investor was to look for new ideas that could change industries through technology. \u201cAny market yet to be disrupted by modern technology will be at some point in time,\u201d he said.Mr. Kushner said that he would not be content to simply invest in companies, and that he wanted to nurture some from scratch himself. \u201cBeing satisfied is not a good thing,\u201d he said.Mr. Kushner set about building Thrive in a methodical way, drawing on his constellation of connections.Aryeh Bourkoff, the founder of LionTree, a merchant bank that specializes in tech and media deals, said he was impressed by Mr. Kushner\u2019s focus when the young investor spoke at an event Mr. Bourkoff held in 2011. Mr. Kushner argued before a roomful of media executives that online video would create more upheaval than the cable industry anticipated. Many in the room disagreed with that idea at the time but said he made a compelling case.By the spring of 2012, Mr. Kushner had scored his first investment hit. He had become friends with a Silicon Valley entrepreneur named Kevin Systrom, who had started Instagram. Mr. Systrom said he had met Mr. Kushner long before he was thinking about raising large sums of money for the app, and the two had stayed in touch.Mr. Kushner has developed a reputation among entrepreneurs for an eye for detail. When he was considering investing in Zola, a wedding registry company founded by Shan-Lyn Ma and Kevin Ryan, Mr. Kushner and his team put together their own study of the wedding registry market and what was missing.\u201cMost other investors I met with said that they\u2019d asked their wives or girlfriends about whether they\u2019d use Zola,\u201d Ms. Ma said. \u201cThat was generally their only data point.\u201dThrive led a $5.85 million investment in Zola in 2013. Since then, the company has raised more than $40 million.Thrive\u2019s other investment successes include Twitch, a live-streaming video site for gamers that Amazon.com bought for $970 million, and the e-commerce site Jet.com, which Walmart agreed to acquire for $3 billion. Thrive also owns stakes in hot start-ups like the workplace messaging company Slack and the streaming music service Spotify, each of which are valued at billions of dollars.Not all of Mr. Kushner\u2019s investments have worked out. It can take a decade or more to determine whether a private company becomes the next Facebook, a failure or something in between. While Instagram was a rare overnight success story for investors, Mr. Kushner has also invested in flops such as Fab.com, a high-profile online retail company that went bust and was later purchased by a manufacturing company in a fire sale.It is unclear if Joshua and Jared Kushner have discussed how a health care overhaul could affect Oscar Health. Representatives of the brothers declined to comment on any conversations they have had about the company.Mr. Kushner\u2019s work is not totally separate from his family\u2019s.

{"Headline": "For Non-Tech Companies, if You Can\u2019t Build It, Buy a Start-Up", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byFor years, mergers and acquisitions in technology were fairly straightforward: Every investment bank kept a list of a dozen or so companies like Google and IBM that had a track record of acquisitions and cash to deploy. When the time and price were right, bankers would seek to match the tech giants with a start-up, and a deal would be hatched.Now the technology deal-making club has had its doors blown wide open.All kinds of companies, including century-old industrial stalwarts like General Motors and General Electric, are among the corporate giants acquiring tech start-ups of late.This trend, of course, reflects how new technology is radically changing many traditional businesses. Developments like connected homes and driverless cars are upending old models. Many companies have come to the realization that building technology in-house was a painstaking process that often meant getting leapfrogged by start-ups.So companies not usually thought of as being in the tech sector have become more aggressive, making more than $125 billion worth of acquisitions in 2016, the most ever. Five years ago, that figure was $20 billion.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that many non-tech companies have tried to build and have made the determination that it\u2019s enormously challenging,\u201d said Anthony Armstrong, co-head of technology mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley. \u201cIt\u2019s better to acquire disruptive technology than to be disrupted by that technology.\u201dLast year, the number of technology companies sold to non-tech companies surpassed those acquired by tech companies for the first time since the internet era began, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding private equity buyers, 682 tech companies were purchased by a company in an industry other than technology, while 655 were acquired by tech companies, Bloomberg\u2019s data showed.More broadly, merger activity was down in 2016. Companies around the world announced $3.6 trillion worth of deals last year, a decline of 16.6 percent from 2015, which was a record year, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. The number of deals signed rose slightly from 2015, the data showed.Of the 45,416 transactions announced last year, 6,657, or 15 percent, were acquisitions of technology companies, more than any other sector, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters on Thursday. That was in line with the proportion of technology deals in 2015.Still, many of tech\u2019s big traditional buyers were quiet last year. Four of the five largest tech companies by market capitalization did not announce any giant deals in 2016.Investment bankers expect this trend to continue this year as well. They have been fielding many calls from companies outside the tech sector wondering what shareholders might think about a potential tech acquisition.Non-tech chief executives have been found mingling at technology conferences, trying to spot their next potential target. And the assortment of so-called unicorns, or private companies valued at $1 billion or more, may be more inclined to sell this year after very few went public or sold in 2016.Only 20 technology companies went public last year, the fewest since 2009, according to Thomson Reuters. With almost 200 unicorns, there could be more exits this year if the markets hold up.One major shift as to why non-tech executives are becoming more active in tech deal making is that they have become more comfortable with the technology itself.\u201cVery rarely are management teams willing to get into businesses that they absolutely don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Scott Adelson, co-president and global co-head of corporate finance at Houlihan Lokey. \u201cSoftware and internet are so pervasive that it\u2019s no longer something that the average management team can\u2019t wrap their head around.\u201dSome companies are also trying to recast themselves as tech companies.General Electric has moved its headquarters to Boston, more of a hub for tech and start-ups than its previous home in Fairfield, Conn. The company\u2019s recent commercials feature the tagline: \u201cThe digital company. That\u2019s also an industrial company.\u201dHoneywell\u2019s incoming chief executive, Darius Adamczyk, was formerly the head of a technology company that Honeywell acquired eight years ago. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering, and a master\u2019s degree in computer engineering.Historically, non-tech companies have largely not felt comfortable paying the high prices that many tech companies can fetch. Older, mature companies tend to trade at lower valuations relative to measures like revenue and earnings, compared with young technology companies \u2014 which sometimes do not even have earnings.\u201cWhen it comes to M.&A., boards and C.E.O.s of non-tech companies have become much more fluent in the language of tech company valuations,\u201d Mr. Armstrong of Morgan Stanley said.The next challenge for many of these companies might be in integrating their tech start-ups with the main business.When traditional companies acquired small technology companies, they typically would place them in a \u201cdigital division\u201d separate from the rest of the company.That too needs to change, according to Aryeh Bourkoff, the founder and chief executive of the investment bank LionTree.\u201cTechnology should not be a division of a company. It should be integrated into every division,\u201d he said.For now, investors in traditional companies seem willing to let these companies make bets and take risks because they too know the stakes of disruption are high.\u201cShareholders are judging management teams on their ability to be bold and not just make short-term moves,\u201d Mr. Bourkoff said. \u201cThe bold C.E.O.s are the ones that play to the future.\u201dGraphic by The New York TimesAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Casualty of Syria\u2019s War: Drinking Water in Damascus", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 For millions of Damascus residents, long-term concerns about the direction of the war in Syria have been replaced by worries about where to get enough water to do the dishes, wash clothes or take a shower.For nearly two weeks, the Syrian capital and its vicinity have been afflicted by a water crisis that has left taps dry, caused long lines at wells and forced people to stretch whatever thin resources they can find.Historically, most of the water for the capital, which is controlled by the government of President Bashar al-Assad, has come from the Barada Valley north of the city, which is controlled by rebels who want to oust Mr. Assad.The crisis began on Dec. 22, when the water stopped flowing. Each side has accused the other of damaging infrastructure near the spring, halting the flow.The government first accused the rebels of polluting the water, then of damaging the infrastructure.Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian office in Geneva, said by email Tuesday that the \u201cdeliberate targeting of the water infrastructure\u201d had caused the shut-off.\u201cBut we are not in a position to say by whom,\u201d he said. \u201cThe area has been the scene of much fighting, so we have not been able to access it.\u201dNow, 5.5 million people in Damascus and the vicinity lack water, which has raised the risk of waterborne disease, especially among children, he said.Fighting near the Barada Valley has continued despite the cease-fire.Antigovernment activists say that government forces, and fighters from Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah organization, have continued to attack the area in an apparent attempt to take it over. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict from Britain through a network of contacts in Syria, said the government launched 15 airstrikes on the area Monday amid clashes between rebels and pro-government forces.Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, accused the Syrian government and its allies on Wednesday of violating the cease-fire, saying that the new violence could derail peace talks meant to be held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, on Jan. 23. Rebel groups have threatened to boycott the talks if government attacks do not stop.Few Damascus residents expect much from the talks or have time to think about them. While generally safe from the violence that had reduced other parts of the country to rubble, they were struggling through a cold winter of high prices and scarce commodities before the water crisis, making things worse.The Syrian government has sought to ease the crisis by trucking water from wells around the city, and the United Nations has rehabilitated 120 wells to cover about one-third of the city\u2019s daily needs, Mr. Laerke, the spokesman, said.But many residents said they had received nothing. Some were buying water from men with private tankers, while others took advantage of whatever they could get.A 50-year-old shopkeeper said he had not had a shower in 10 days but that he and his sons went to the mosque every day to wash their hands, feet and faces, an option not available to the women of the house.At home, he said, they used plastic utensils because they could not wash dishes.One 60-year-old woman said she had not had running water in her home for 10 days. Her two sons have spent hours each day lining up to fill jugs from the well at their mosque. They use that to drink and to wash dishes, collecting the runoff to flush the toilet.\u201cMy family\u2019s dream is to get a warm shower,\u201d she said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions for communicating with a foreign news outlet without government permission. \u201cIt has become our ultimate hope in Damascus to have enough water to take showers and wash clothes in the automatic washing machine.\u201dShe expressed anger that Syria\u2019s state-run news media had said little about the water crisis, instead focusing on the military\u2019s battles with rebels.\u201cWe are fed up with the news of military operations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want news about water and water supply schedules.\u201dDespite the water crisis, conditions in Damascus are far better than those in Aleppo, the northern city and former commercial epicenter of the country, where Syrian and Russian forces prevailed last month after prolonged bombardments of its eastern side. While the cease-fire appears to be holding there, the formerly rebel-held eastern quarters are abandoned wastelands, United Nations relief officials said.\u201cNothing prepared us for what we saw,\u201d Sajjad Malik, the United Nations acting humanitarian coordinator for Syria, told reporters Wednesday in a telephone briefing from Aleppo. \u201cThe infrastructure was destroyed in almost every neighborhood.\u201dMr. Malik said more than 100 United Nations relief workers from several agencies were helping civil defense teams remove debris and provide emergency food, water, shelter and medical care in the city, where four million people once lived.He estimated that 1.5 million people remain in Aleppo, mostly on the western side, including roughly 400,000 Syrians displaced from other areas. He also said thousands of displaced residents from the eastern side were starting to return, even if their homes and businesses were badly damaged or destroyed.\u201cThey\u2019re beginning to talk about rebuilding their lives and livelihoods,\u201d Mr. Malik said. But he cautioned that \u201cAleppo\u2019s reconstruction is going to take a much longer time and way more resources than we have right now.\u201dReporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Beirut; Maher Samaan from Paris; an employee of The New York Times from Damascus; and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}

But what really happened is more complicated. And while it\u2019s easy to feel sorry for the frozen fish and worry that something has gone terribly wrong, you can take comfort in the fact that their deaths were part of an ecological reboot for the lake where they died.\u201cSometimes nature seems harsh, but it is all a part of the life cycle of a wetland,\u201d Kelly Preheim, a kindergarten teacher and birder who shot the photo, wrote in an email.In 2015, at the time the photo was taken, she said, the area around the lake had been suffering from a drought, and water levels were low. Thick ice formed on the lake\u2019s surface that, along with snow cover, blocked sunlight and prevented algae and other aquatic plants from conducting photosynthesis. Without this process to produce oxygen,, the oxygen levels dropped. Plants died and decomposed, depleting even more oxygen. And then the fish suffocated and died under the icy surface before floating to the top by the thousands.The fish did not die by freezing midair.There are two possible explanations for the wall of fish ice in the photo. One is that as the weather got colder, the ice expanded. It reached the shore, cracked, crumpled and shot upward, fish included. Or, it\u2019s possible that strong winds alone pushed the frozen water and its fishy contents upward into an ice wall.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to oxygen created through the process of photosynthesis. While carbon dioxide and water are turned into carbohydrates and oxygen, the oxygen comes from two water molecules; it is not the case that plants convert carbon dioxide into oxygen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Immigration Order Could Have a Big Impact on Sports", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump\u2019s ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim nations could have a wide impact on international sports, including jeopardizing a warm relationship between the United States and Iran in wrestling competitions and threatening the chances of Los Angeles hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics and of the United States securing soccer\u2019s 2026 World Cup.On Saturday, sports officials struggled to understand the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, including the question of whether athletes from the targeted nations could enter the United States to compete, especially in the initial 90-day period of the ban.\u201cWe are working closely with the administration to understand the new rules and how we best navigate them as it pertains to visiting athletes,\u201d Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee, said in an email. \u201cWe know they are supportive of the Olympic movement and our bid and believe we will have a good working relationship with them to ensure our success in hosting and attending events.\u201dAt least one International Olympic Committee delegate criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. The delegate, Richard Peterkin of St. Lucia, said Saturday that he considered the executive order \u201cvery, very disappointing.\u201dHe also called the United States a \u201chaven\u201d for many athletes hoping to train outside their home countries.\u201cMost of our athletes from St. Lucia train in the States,\u201d Mr. Peterkin said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an issue because we\u2019re not on that list of seven, but if we were \u2014 there go hopes and dreams.\u201dThe most immediate effect may come in wrestling, given that one of the nations affected by Mr. Trump\u2019s ban is Iran, which has long had a congenial relationship with the United States in that sport. Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump\u2019s order.The United States freestyle wrestling team is scheduled to participate in a World Cup competition in Iran on Feb. 8. Steve Fraser, the chief fund-raiser for U.S.A. Wrestling and a 1984 Greco-Roman Olympic champion, said on Saturday that the president of Iran\u2019s wrestling federation was scheduled to meet this weekend with government officials there in an attempt to make sure the Americans would still be invited to the meet.\u201cThere\u2019s some nervousness by us that the Iranian government might say, \u2018We can\u2019t get visas to go there, so no Americans can come here, either,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fraser said.While Olympic boycotts have resulted from tense political differences between nations, opposing countries have also long found common ground on playing fields, on the track and in sports arenas. One of the most celebrated examples is the so-called Ping-Pong diplomacy that helped foster the relationship between the United States and China in the 1970s.In wrestling, the United States, Iran, Cuba and Russia banded together in 2013 to persuade the I.O.C. to keep the sport in the Summer Games. American wrestlers and officials are warmly welcomed in Iran, and Iranian wrestlers compete regularly in the United States. They may be invited to meets in May in New York and in June in Los Angeles, Mr. Fraser said. There is uncertainty now, however, about whether they would be granted P1 visas, commonly known as sports visas, to compete.In 2014, Christina Kelley, the chief international ambassador for U.S.A. Wrestling, became one of the few women allowed into a wrestling arena in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. She said on Saturday that she was frustrated by Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.\u201cI don\u2019t think our current president has any clue what the State Department and what sports diplomats and cultural exchanges do for our country and for the safety of our people around the world,\u201d Ms. Kelley said.The ban on visitors from the seven nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 comes at a delicate time for the U.S.O.C. Los Angeles is seeking to host the 2024 Summer Games, and it will learn in September whether it, Paris or Budapest will get the Games.(There is some speculation that the I.O.C. will award the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles, but the U.S.O.C. remains committed to the bid for the 2024 Games.)David Wallechinsky, an American member of the I.O.C.\u2019s cultural and heritage commission and the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, said the election of Mr. Trump in November had hurt Los Angeles\u2019s bid with I.O.C. delegates because Mr. Trump was perceived as being \u201canti-Muslim, anti-woman and anti-Latino.\u201d\u201cThis is worse,\u201d Mr. Wallechinsky said of the Muslim ban, adding, \u201cI would consider it a blow to the Los Angeles bid \u2014 not fatal but a blow.\u201dAt a meeting at the I.O.C.\u2019s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, several days after the American presidential election, Mr. Wallechinsky was asked repeatedly, \u201cWhat is wrong with your country?\u201d he said.He said he sought to assure I.O.C. officials by explaining that three-quarters of the voters in Los Angeles had voted against Mr. Trump, describing the city to them as a \u201ca multicultural, Trump-free zone.\u201dThe United States is expected to bid to host the world\u2019s other major sporting event, the World Cup, in 2026. In June, Sunil Gulati, president of the United States Soccer Federation, told reporters that a Trump presidency could complicate an American bid, especially if it were a joint bid with Mexico, given Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall across America\u2019s southern border.\u201cI think a co-hosted World Cup with Mexico would be trickier if Secretary Clinton isn\u2019t in the White House,\u201d Mr. Gulati said at the time, in a reference to Hillary Clinton, who lost the election to Mr. Trump.After Mr. Trump won the election, Mr. Gulati modified his remarks, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to dissuade us or persuade us to bid.\u201d International perceptions of the Trump administration \u201cmatter, for sure,\u201d Mr. Gulati said, \u201cbut I think those will be developed in the months to come.\u201dU.S. Soccer said Saturday it would have no immediate comment as it examined Mr. Trump\u2019s order.Many questions remained unanswered about the ability of a number of athletes to travel. Two N.B.A. players, Thon Maker and Luol Deng, were born in Sudan, one of the seven countries listed in Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. (Both, however, were born in Wau, now part of South Sudan, which gained its independence from Sudan in 2011.)Mr. Maker\u2019s family fled Sudan when he was 5 and eventually settled in Australia. Mr. Maker, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, moved to the United States to play high school basketball in Louisiana, eventually moved to Canada and is an Australian citizen who holds a passport from that country. It was unclear how people with dual citizenship would be treated under the order.Mr. Deng, a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, has lived in the United States for 17 years. His family fled to Egypt when he was 5 to escape the Sudanese civil war. Mr. Deng came to the United States when he was 14 and attended high school in New Jersey, and he later became a British citizen.The N.B.A. also holds an annual Basketball Without Borders camp, and it is expected to be held in New Orleans during the league\u2019s All-Star weekend in February. While rosters have not been released, last year\u2019s camp involved players from 25 countries, including Amir Reza Shah-Ravesh from Iran.Major League Soccer has two American-born players with familial ties to two of the nations facing bans. Steve Beitashour of Toronto has played for Iran\u2019s national team, and Justin Meram of Columbus has played for Iraq. League officials were looking into the matter on Saturday.Mo Farah of Britain, who was born in Somalia and has won four Olympic gold medals on the track at 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, is a Nike-sponsored athlete coached by Alberto Salazar.Abdi Abdirahman, a four-time Olympian for the United States who finished third in the 2016 New York City Marathon, was also born in Somalia, and the race regularly attracts runners from around the globe. The 2016 race featured three runners from Iran, nine from Syria and one from Sudan in the field of about 50,000 runners.\u201cOur goal is always to recruit the world\u2019s best and cleanest athletes, regardless of where they\u2019re from,\u201d Chris Weiller, a spokesman for New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon, said in an email.Jackie Brock-Doyle, a spokeswoman for track and field\u2019s world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, said, \u201cWe clearly need to understand the implications of this new U.S. immigration policy and will be seeking assurances that it will not adversely affect\u201d the sport\u2019s world championships, scheduled to be held in Eugene, Ore., in 2021.Phil Andrews, the chief executive of U.S.A. Weightlifting, said officials were trying to figure out the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s ban on the world weight-lifting championships, scheduled for November in Anaheim, Calif., and on the American team\u2019s participation at a competition in Iran.\u201cOur view is that politics and sport should be separate,\u201d Mr. Andrews said, stressing sports diplomacy among nations. \u201cWe sincerely hope to peacefully welcome these seven nations to Anaheim this November.

Pshaw.\u201cBut Haggler,\u201d you say, \u201caren\u2019t you just making excuses? Isn\u2019t the real problem your famously disagreeable personality, not to mention that if you were a corporeal being, you would have very poor grooming habits?\u201dO.K., the Haggler just counted to 10, in order to regain his composure. Now he is taking deep breaths.The monastic life isn\u2019t for everyone, of course, and the Haggler is happy that millions of others take the bold leap into matrimony. The Haggler is there in spirit, tossing confetti, welling up with tears and hovering near the ice mound of all-you-can-eat shrimp. Most important, he is there whenever there is a problem with a wedding-related contractor. Like this one:Q. Two years ago, I hired Brian Kelly Multimedia LLC in Greenville S.C., to videotape my daughter\u2019s wedding. We paid half the cost up front, and paid the rest on Oct. 11, 2015, a total of $1,700.Brian filmed both the wedding and the reception. He told us we would have a copy of the video in six months or less. We have never seen a frame of it. I\u2019ve called him a number of times and written emails. He replied to one of those emails, in April of last year, telling me that he would send the tape in three weeks. That was the last time I heard from him.This wedding was very special to us. My daughter, Kellie, is my only child. If you can help us resolve this issue we would really appreciate it.Jeannine Heath Hendersonville, N.C.\u201cI am much more comfortable telling other people\u2019s stories rather than my own,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd maybe that is my story. Quite simply, I enjoy capturing the things that only happen once, and telling the story of the couple through video.\u201dNext to this testimonial there is a photograph of a middle-aged guy with dark hair, grinning the way a teddy bear would if teddy bears could grin. Everything about the image says, \u201cYou can definitely trust me because I\u2019m very sensitive and friendly.\u201dIn addition, records show that Mr. Kelly has filed for bankruptcy on several occasions.And that is about all we know. Because the Haggler\u2019s attempts to reach Mr. Kelly, whose website suggests that the company is still booking new business, failed to produce any response. A call to his home number was answered by a woman who said that Mr. Kelly was busy but would return the call.He never did.It has been a while since a company/business owner has cold-shouldered the Haggler, and it will come as no surprise that he disapproves of this tactic. There is something especially terrible about this case because no one other than Mr. Kelly was on hand to videotape the wedding of Ms. Heath\u2019s daughter. All she wants, at this point, is the raw footage of the event. Even if Mr. Kelly is having financial troubles, surely he could mail a disc or two of uncut video.The Haggler hoped to propose a very simple plan to Mr. Kelly: Send Ms. Heath the tape of her daughter\u2019s wedding, and \u2014 if it really is the tape of the wedding \u2014 she\u2019ll drop any claims to the polished and carefully edited production that was promised.But it\u2019s hard to suggest a plan to a person who won\u2019t return your calls. So the Haggler will keep trying. (As noted before, he has nothing better to do.) Check this space in two weeks. With any luck, there will be some happy news to report.Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

Some are live-action adaptations of classic animated musicals, like \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d directed by Bill Condon and set for release by Disney in March. Others are films (among them, \u201cWicked\u201d) based on contemporary Broadway hits.\u201cThankfully, as much as Hollywood is interested in brands, I think people are still looking for originality and freshness,\u201d Mr. Platt said. \u201cMusicals can also be their own brand: They have an event status.

Over the past few months, three animated musicals \u2014 \u201cSing,\u201d \u201cMoana\u201d and \u201cTrolls\u201d \u2014 have taken in a combined $1 billion at the global box office. Disney will release a singalong version of \u201cMoana\u201d (with lyrics on the screen, karaoke style) on Jan. 27.Still, not everyone in Hollywood is convinced of a musical comeback. Kevin Goetz, chief executive of the film research company Screen Engine/ASI, said in an email that he had no research indicating increased demand. \u201cI think it\u2019s a long shot to think that animated movies with music, which have been around for years now, have a material effect in increasing the desire to see live-action musicals,\u201d he added.If \u201cLa La Land\u201d is an exception to the box office rules, it is becoming quite an exception. On social media sites like Instagram and Facebook, young people \u2014 no prompting from Lionsgate, it promises \u2014 have been uploading videos of themselves singing \u201cAudition,\u201d one of the film\u2019s showcase numbers. During the past week, the soundtrack has shot up the sales charts.The weekend\u2019s No. 1 film was the feel-good drama \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d which collected a strong $20 million. Produced by Chernin Entertainment and Levantine Films and released by Fox, \u201cHidden Figures\u201d has a domestic total after four weeks of about $54.8 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Women\u2019s March on Washington Opens Contentious Dialogues About Race", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byMs. Willis, a 50-year-old wedding minister from South Carolina, had looked forward to taking her daughters to the march. Then she read a post on the Facebook page for the march that made her feel unwelcome because she is white.The post, written by a black activist from Brooklyn who is a march volunteer, advised \u201cwhite allies\u201d to listen more and talk less. It also chided those who, it said, were only now waking up to racism because of the election.\u201cYou don\u2019t just get to join because now you\u2019re scared, too,\u201d read the post. \u201cI was born scared.\u201dStung by the tone, Ms. Willis canceled her trip.\u201cThis is a women\u2019s march,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be allies in equal pay, marriage, adoption. Why is it now about, \u2018White women don\u2019t understand black women\u2019?\u201dIn Tennessee, emotions ran high when organizers changed the name of the local march from \u201cWomen\u2019s March on Washington-Nashville\u201d to \u201cPower Together Tennessee, in solidarity with Women\u2019s March on Washington.\u201d While many applauded the name change, which was meant to signal the start of a new social justice movement in Nashville, some complained that the event had turned from a march for all women into a march for black women.In Louisiana, the first state coordinator gave up her volunteer role in part because there were no minority women in leadership positions at that time.\u201cI got a lot of flak locally when I stepped down, from white women who said that I\u2019m alienating a lot of white women,\u201d said Candice Huber, a bookstore owner in New Orleans, who is white. \u201cThey said, \u2018Why do you have to be so divisive?\u2019\u201dIn some ways, the discord is by design. Even as they are working to ensure a smooth and unified march next week, the national organizers said they made a deliberate decision to highlight the plight of minority and undocumented immigrant women and provoke uncomfortable discussions about race.The post that offended Ms. Willis was part of that effort. So was the quotation posted on the march\u2019s Facebook page from Bell Hooks, the black feminist, about forging a stronger sisterhood by \u201cconfronting the ways women \u2014 through sex, class and race \u2014 dominated and exploited other women.\u201dIn response, a New Jersey woman wrote: \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel not very welcome in this endeavor.\u201dA debate then ensued about whether white women were just now experiencing what minority women experience daily, or were having a hard time yielding control. A young white woman from Baltimore wrote with bitterness that white women who might have been victims of rape and abuse were being \u201casked to check their privilege,\u201d a catchphrase that refers to people acknowledging their advantages, but which even some liberal women find unduly confrontational.No one involved with the march fears that the rancor will dampen turnout; even many of those who expressed dismay at the tone of the discussion said they still intended to join what is sure to be the largest demonstration yet against the Trump presidency.\u201cI will march,\u201d one wrote on the march\u2019s Facebook page, \u201cHoping that someday soon a sense of unity will occur before it\u2019s too late.\u201dBut these debates over race also reflect deeper questions about the future of progressivism in the age of Trump. Should the march highlight what divides women, or what unites them? Is there room for women who have never heard of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d?And at a time when a presidential candidate ran against political correctness and won \u2014 with half of white female voters supporting him \u2014 is this the time to tone down talk about race or to double down?Many thousands of people are expected to march in protest of the new president on Jan. 21, his first full day in office.\u201cIf your short-term goal is to get as many people as possible at the march, maybe you don\u2019t want to alienate people,\u201d said Anne Valk, the author of \u201cRadical Sisters,\u201d a book about racial and class differences in the women\u2019s movement. \u201cBut if your longer-term goal is to use the march as a catalyst for progressive social and political change, then that has to include thinking about race and class privilege.\u201dThe discord also reflects the variety of women\u2019s rights and liberal causes being represented at the march, as well as a generational divide.Many older white women spent their lives fighting for rights like workplace protections that younger women now take for granted. Many young activists have spent years protesting police tactics and criminal justice policies \u2014 issues they feel too many white liberals have ignored.\u201cYes, equal pay is an issue,\u201d Ms. Sarsour said. \u201cBut look at the ratio of what white women get paid versus black women and Latina women.\u201dFor too long, the march organizers said, the women\u2019s rights movement focused on issues that were important to well-off white women, such as the ability to work outside the home and attain the same high-powered positions that men do. But minority women, they said, have had different priorities. Black women who have worked their whole lives as maids might care more about the minimum wage or police brutality than about seeing a woman in the White House. Undocumented immigrant women might care about abortion rights, they said, but not nearly as much as they worry about being deported.\u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, let\u2019s merge,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bland recalled.As the effort grew, a number of comments on Facebook implored Ms. Bland, who is white, to include minority women on the leadership team. Ms. Bland felt strongly that it was the right thing to do. Within three days of the election, Carmen Perez, a Hispanic activist working on juvenile justice, and Tamika D. Mallory, a gun control activist who is black, joined Ms. Bland.Ms. Steinem, who plans to participate in a town hall meeting during the march with Alicia Garza, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, said even contentious conversations about race were a \u201cgood thing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about knowing each other,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhich is what movements and marches are for.\u201dBut the tone of the discussion, particularly online, can become so raw that some would-be marchers feel they are no longer welcome.Ms. Willis, the South Carolina wedding minister, had been looking forward to the salve of rallying with people who share her values, a rarity in her home state, where she said she had been insulted and shouted at for marrying gay couples.But then she read a post by ShiShi Rose, a 27-year-old blogger from Brooklyn.\u201cNow is the time for you to be listening more, talking less,\u201d Ms. Rose wrote. \u201cYou should be reading our books and understanding the roots of racism and white supremacy. Listening to our speeches. You should be drowning yourselves in our poetry.\u201dIt rubbed Ms. Willis the wrong way.\u201cHow do you know that I\u2019m not reading black poetry?\u201d she asked in an interview. Ms. Willis says that she understands being born white gives her advantages, and that she is always open to learning more about the struggles of others.But, she said, \u201cThe last thing that is going to make me endeared to you, to know you and love you more, is if you are sitting there wagging your finger at me.\u201dMs. Rose said in an interview that the intention of the post was not to weed people out but rather to make them understand that they had a lot of learning to do.\u201cI needed them to understand that they don\u2019t just get to join the march and not check their privilege constantly,\u201d she said.That phrase \u2014 check your privilege \u2014 exasperates Ms. Willis. She asked a reporter: \u201cCan you please tell me what that means?\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the planned Women\u2019s March on Washington referred imprecisely to Gloria Steinem\u2019s role in a town hall meeting planned during the march. She will be a participant, not the host, of the event. (The National Domestic Workers Alliance will host the meeting.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Text to Text: Comparing Jewish Refugees of the 1930s With Syrian Refugees Today", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byGlobal IssuesIntroduction________Background Even before the beginning of World War II in September 1939, Nazi Germany\u2019s open aggression toward both neighboring countries and people within its borders had sparked a refugee crisis. The German annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland in 1938 increased the number of people affected by Nazi restrictions, while at the same time those restrictions intensified to the point that Jews, political dissidents and others were effectively removed from German public life and denied rights, employment and education. Germany\u2019s aggressive steps to expand its borders touched off both an international political crisis, as world leaders scrambled to avoid war, and a humanitarian refugee crisis, as hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people, mostly Jews, sought safety from the Nazis in countries outside the grip of the Third Reich.In the aftermath of World War II, the newly formed United Nations moved to set up international bodies and laws to define the status and rights of refugees for the first time. The U.N. High Commission for Refugees was established in 1951 and given a three-year mandate to resolve postwar refugee problems. Sixty-five years later, it still exists, and there are more refugees around the world today than at any time since the end of World War II.Can the history of the refugee crisis of the 1930s help us think about how we respond to Syrian refugees today? The Times article by Daniel Victor\u2019 explores the parallels between today\u2019s Syrian refugees and Jewish refugees before World War II. We pair this news article with a 10-minute excerpt from \u201cDefying the Nazis: The Sharps\u2019 War\u201d that focuses on the Sharps\u2019s efforts to help refugees escape from occupied Czechoslovakia in 1939. Together, these sources complicate our thinking about how individuals and governments define their responsibility to refugees, in the past and the present.________Key Questions \u2022 What are similarities and differences between the refugee crises of the 1930s and today?\u2022 How might examining the history of refugees in the 1930s inform the choices that individuals and governments make in responding to refugees today?_________A tweet drawing a historical parallel to the current plight of Syrian refugees drew thousands of retweets this week.Some historians say that, while the two groups are not completely symmetrical, there are lessons to be drawn.It\u2019s true that Americans in 1939 were worried about refugees taking jobs. Those who lived through the Depression were overwhelmingly supportive of restricting immigration, Mr. Shulman said.That caused Jewish refugees to be \u201cextraordinarily, excruciatingly vetted,\u201d said Marion Kaplan, a professor in the Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University.One area where the two refugee groups do not neatly match, Ms. Kaplan said, is the racial animus they faced both home and abroad. Unlike modern Syrians, Jews in the 1930s \u201cwere singled out as the racial enemy, par excellence, in German society,\u201d she said.And the United States was not entirely welcoming. On top of wanting to preserve jobs, Americans were concerned about Jews \u201cweakening the Nordic or Anglo racial stock,\u201d Mr. Shulman said. \u201cThat was a very real concern.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou can\u2019t just reduce it to economics or politics. That sort of racial identity was very powerful.\u201d________________For Writing and Discussion1. How does Daniel Victor\u2019s article compare responses to Jewish refugees in the 1930s with responses to Syrian refugees today? What are some of the key similarities and differences? How do ideas about race and religion shape attitudes to refugees in each example? What other factors play a role?2. How does the film clip from \u201cDefying the Nazis\u201d connect to Mr. Victor\u2019s article? How does it extend your thinking about the lives of refugees and the fears, hopes and challenges they have experienced? How does it add to your understanding of United States\u2019 policies and attitudes toward refugees in the 1930s?3. The historian Peter Shulman, interviewed in the article, argued that there are \u201cenough similarities between Jewish refugees in the 1930s and Syrian refugees today to draw a \u2018moral connection\u2019 between the two situations.\u201d Do you agree with Mr. Shulman? Why or why not? If yes, how would you describe this \u201cmoral connection?\u201d4. What dilemmas did Martha and Waitstill Sharp face in their decision to leave home and help refugees in Europe? What risks did they take? What do you think motivated them to make a choice to help refugees when that was so at odds with American public opinion and national policy?5. Many who connect the refugee crisis of the 1930s to the plight of Syrian refugees today emphasize the failure of the United States and other countries to help. The Sharps\u2019s story, in contrast, is about a small group of private citizens banding together to aid refugees. Is their history relevant to the current refugee crisis? How might a story of people who chose to help then inform decision-making about the refugee crisis today?_________Going FurtherAs you read them, consider these questions: How do the articles portray the crisis and the options available to refugees? What was the range of responses and attitudes to refugees, and what arguments were offered in support of allowing or restricting immigration? What questions would you want to ask the individuals living at the time who are quoted in these articles? What would you want them to understand?The articles below highlight some of these efforts. As you read them, consider: How do these stories compare to that of the Sharps? What is the range of actions individuals have taken to help refugees in Europe today? How do these various efforts differ, and what do they have in common? What tools are these individuals and groups using to make a difference? How have people been able to help when they live in proximity to refugees? How have they helped when they are far away? What can an individual or a small group accomplish that a government may not be able to?________Additional ResourcesAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iranian Activist Ends Hunger Strike as Wife Is Released From Prison", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byThe showdown between the authorities and the activist, Arash Sadeghi, who was sentenced in 2015 to at least 15 years for acts deemed seditious, including spreading propaganda, appeared to be a rare instance of compromise by a government not known for leniency.The demonstration followed a campaign on social media to support the couple, which became a trending topic internationally despite the heavy restrictions on the use of Twitter and Facebook in Iran.Iranian news accounts quoted the Tehran prosecutor, Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi, as saying that Mr. Sadeghi had ended his hunger strike. The accounts also said his wife had been granted a temporary release that may be extended.Rights activists said the government\u2019s decision reflected official worries that the case had struck a nerve among a public that has been waiting impatiently for a promised relaxation on restrictions of political freedoms by President Hassan Rouhani, who is up for re-election this year.Activists said concern had intensified in recent weeks about the fragile health of Mr. Sadeghi, who began fasting on Oct. 24 when his wife was seized to begin serving a six-year term for an unpublished story found on her private computer about a woman stoned for adultery.The wife\u2019s arrest seemed to galvanize public anger about the couple\u2019s treatment.\u201cThe main reason it gained so much traction was the absurdity of the charges,\u201d said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based group that monitors imprisonments of journalists and rights activists. \u201cThe wife had fiction kept on her computer \u2014 she never published it.\u201dDespite the threat of arrest for participating in unauthorized demonstrations, Mr. Ghaemi said, the protest on Monday outside Evin Prison suggested that more Iranians are now willing to take such risks. \u201cIt tells you the demand for basic freedoms has not gone away,\u201d he said.Mr. Rouhani was elected in 2013 partly on promises of negotiating an end to international sanctions over Iran\u2019s nuclear activities and easing restrictions on individual rights that had been enforced by his more conservative predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Last month, Mr. Rouhani unveiled what he called a Citizens Rights Charter to guarantee civil liberties, including fair trials, uncoerced confessions and respect for privacy. The move was widely dismissed as an election-year tactic.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump says his high I.Q. cabinet will unify the nation.12 PhotosThe opening concert of the long inaugural week-to-weekend was the stuff of legend \u2014 acts came, followed by protests, followed by withdrawals. Names were floated, like Elton John and Charlotte Church, only to have the artists publicly rebuke the invitation.\u201cBut we\u2019re going to make America great for all of our people,\u201d the president-elect told the crowd. \u201cThat includes the inner cities, that includes everybody.\u201dJust hours before he was to be sworn in, Mr. Trump still recalled grievances from the campaign. \u201cThe polls started going up, up, up, but they didn\u2019t want to give us credit,\u201d he said. But he also turned his attention to the future, promising to work hard and saying he was looking forward to Friday.A tableau of Trumps \u2014 including the incoming first lady, Melania Trump, Mr. Trump\u2019s grown children and their spouses, and his grandchildren \u2014 then stood triumphantly at the top of the steps, framed by marble and under the gaze of the nation\u2019s 16th president.The next president of the United States has a way with words, so let\u2019s just let him talk. At Washington\u2019s Union Station on Thursday night, he greeted honored guests.To Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and adviser, he said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can.\u201dTo his White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, he commented, \u201cNobody knew how to pronounce his name. It\u2019s a crazy name.\u201d The president-elect added, \u201cReince was taking tremendous abuse because he went through hell.\u201dThen it was on to his re-election campaign, in 2020:\u201cThe next time, four years from now, the next time we\u2019re going to win the old-fashioned way, we\u2019re going to win because we did so well, because it was so overwhelming, the thing that we did, because it was so beautiful.\u201dOn that last point, it was not clear how he was implying he won in 2016: Russian interference? Losing the popular tally by nearly three million votes?As for Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump saw a silver lining in the forecast rain.\u201cIf it really pours tomorrow, that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause people will realize it\u2019s my real hair.\u201dThe inaugural kickoff celebration on the National Mall had been a subdued affair without protests, but at least one of the inaugural balls organized by Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters has drawn protesters.Sarko Sarkodie, a 26-year-old Washington resident, was part of the crowd.\u201cI\u2019m just part of the resistance efforts that have been happening this week,\u201d Ms. Sarkodie said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll be happening over the next four years.\u201dTrump supporters seemed to be staying away from the event, but several people watched the scene from inside a nearby bar, where a man wearing a Trump flag and Trump sweatpants could be seen embracing friends.\u201dThat\u2019s a brave dude, right there,\u201d a bystander said of the man.Several people wandered through the area in gowns, seemingly dismayed when they turned the corner to encounter the protests.But perennial presidential candidate and kid favorite Vermin Supreme made it to the show.At the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture, a throng of people in floor-length ball gowns, dashikis, tuxedos and silk headscarves flocked to the sold-out Peace Ball: Voices of Hope and Resistance.\u201cI guess I was just looking for something to put my energy into and to give Obama a really good send-off,\u201d said Pavy Bacon, a 34-year-old Maryland resident, about why she bought a ticket to the ball. \u201cIf you really appreciate what Obama has done, you can\u2019t help but be fearful of the next administration.\u201dThe event, which was in the works before Election Day, was not envisioned as an anti-Trump affair. Anas \u201cAndy\u201d Shallal, an Iraqi-American artist and activist who owns the popular D.C.-based bookstore cafe chain Busboys and Poets, dreamed up the party as the ultimate celebration of the progress made under President Obama.But as inauguration day drew closer, Peace Ball became a place for liberals to converge and comfort themselves.John Osborne, a 55-year-old lawyer from Washington, D.C., perused the fourth-floor exhibits with his wife and said he came because \u2014 on the eve of the inauguration \u2014 he wanted to surround himself with people from all races, religions and backgrounds.\u201cI wanted to be in a place that reflects the America that I see and live everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that our country will remain that way.\u201dExpected guests included the actor Danny Glover, the Grammy-nominated artist Solange Knowles, four-time Grammy winning jazz musician Esperanza Spalding, the award-winning author Alice Walker and CNN pundit Van Jones.Before the official festivities began, Mr. Trump appeared at a luncheon with supporters at the Trump International Hotel, where he praised the collective I.Q. of his cabinet members.\u201cWe have by far the highest I.Q. of any cabinet ever assembled,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the remarks, which reporters heard only the first several minutes of before being escorted out.Of course, he put himself into the high I.Q. category when he boasted, \u201cThis is a gorgeous room. A total genius must have built this place.\u201d(As an aside, it is impossible to do the math, but President Obama\u2019s starters did include a Nobel laureate in physics at the Energy Department, a former president of Harvard heading the National Economic Council and the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank as Treasury secretary.)Mr. Trump also faulted senators for not being \u201cnice\u201d to Representative Tom Price of Georgia, his pick to be the health and human services secretary.And speaking of Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner is expected to get one of the plum jobs in diplomacy, the United States ambassador to Britain, or as the Brits call it, ambassador of the United States to the Court of St. James\u2019s.Mr. Johnson is only the fourth ambassador to be announced by Mr. Trump, after Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations; David Friedman, his longtime attorney, as ambassador to Israel; and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as ambassador to China. Given that both Mr. Trump and his British counterpart, Prime Minister Theresa May, are relatively new in their roles, Mr. Johnson\u2019s ability to get Mr. Trump on the phone quickly could be helpful.At 5-11 this year, the Jets weren\u2019t the best.The president-elect and vice president-elect laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery.Then it was on to the Lincoln Memorial for the concert that opens the Inaugural festivities.Eric Huppert, the leader of Defenders of Liberty Motorcycle Club and local organizer of Bikers for Trump, stood beside a row of hulking V-twin Harley Davidsons and said he was not looking for violence.Sure, Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers for Trump, had pledged that his members would act as a \u201cwall of meat\u201d to block anti-Trump protesters, but Mr. Huppert downplayed all that.\u201cI don\u2019t anticipate any skirmishes \u2014 at least I hope not,\u201d he said. But if the safety of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters \u2014 or even the president-elect himself \u2014 is jeopardized, he added, \u201cI think these folks will be willing to jump in if necessary.\u201dA security force beholden to no one with no rules of engagement and no real marching orders is, well, not a great idea. But Bikers for Trump stand by their man.David Nichols traveled from Texarkana, Tex., with seven others to attend the Bikers for Trump rally on Inauguration Day. The group drove for 22 hours straight, towing eight bikes on a 20-foot trailer.A day before Mr. Trump is to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, he took to Twitter to assert that he is not responsible for the nation\u2019s divisions. His champion? The Rev. Franklin Graham.Scott Rodd contributed reporting from Dale City, Va.Advertisement"}

Average attendance fell to 43,814, the lowest since 2002, and the final home game drew the smallest crowd (38,162) since TCF Bank Stadium opened in 2009.\u201cNine wins is a good season, and the Holiday Bowl is good,\u201d Coyle said. \u201cWhen we made the change, I made the comment to my wife, \u2018We needed to shake the tree.\u2019\u201dHe added: \u201cP. J., you just heard him talk. The thing that jumps out to me is his authentic energy and his passion. I think that attracts people. Obviously, we want to attract fans back.\u201dThe introduction of Fleck, who agreed to a five-year deal worth $18.5 million, was an uplifting moment for an athletic department still reeling from 18 months of well-publicized problems.Norwood Teague resigned as athletic director in August 2015 when a university investigation determined he sexually harassed two female university employees. Coyle, his successor, fired the wrestling coach J Robinson \u2014 who led Minnesota to three national championships \u2014 in September 2016 for allegedly interfering with police and university investigations into whether his wrestlers had sold Xanax, a prescription sedative.Last month, after an inquiry by the university\u2019s Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, 10 Gophers football players were suspended in connection with a sexual-assault investigation. The rest of the team, claiming a lack of due process, boycotted practices and demanded the players be reinstated. The boycott was called off two days later, shortly after the equal opportunity office\u2019s 80-page report was leaked to a Minneapolis television station.The suspended players, who were not criminally charged, await appeal hearings.A tweet by Claeys supporting the boycott put him at odds with the administration. Coyle said Tuesday at a news conference that multiple factors contributed to the decision to fire Claeys, including the team\u2019s eight targeting penalties and blown halftime leads in losses to Penn State, Nebraska and Wisconsin. Claeys, a longtime defensive coordinator under the former Gophers coach Jerry Kill, was in his first full season after Kill stepped down for health reasons in October 2015.The task awaiting Fleck is a little easier because Minnesota plays in the Big Ten\u2019s West Division, which was formed before the 2014 season. Without annual games against Ohio State, Penn State and Michigan, it offers a less onerous path to the conference title game.The Gophers\u2019 inability to win the division this year, with the Buckeyes and Wolverines off the schedule, was viewed as a disappointment inside and outside the program. Minnesota last won a Big Ten championship outright in 1941 (it shared titles in 1960 and 1967) and has not been to the Rose Bowl since 1961, when Ohio State declined an invitation.Several times Friday, Fleck referred to his slogan, \u201cRow the Boat,\u201d a hook for getting players to work toward a common goal. Fleck said he met with about 25 players earlier in the day and more via a live Facebook chat.\u201cI am not here to change tradition,\u201d Fleck said. \u201cWhat I am here to do is change a culture, to change a movement, for us to create and experience things that the University of Minnesota has only dreamed of, and hasn\u2019t accomplished since the late \u201960s.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After weeks of festivities, January looks bleak.Why not pencil in an obscure holiday to celebrate?Aside from the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a major commemorative holiday, this month is also full of odd celebrations that are not popular enough to be highlighted in the average day planner.January is also National Bath Safety Month, National Hobby Month and National Slow Cooking Month.New this year: Learn Your Name in Morse Code Day (Jan. 11) and National Wingman\u2019s Day (Feb. 13).But not every holiday makes the cut.The requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. To be considered they must have been celebrated before, said Holly McGuire, the editor of Chase\u2019s calendar book.Whether they catch on depends on how much they resonate with people.\u201cIf the people who come up with silly or quirky holidays are passionate about it and celebrate it, there\u2019s a better chance that their fellow humans will as well,\u201d Ms. McGuire said.One of the more popular celebrations on Jan. 4, she said, is National Trivia Day, and naturally, it has ties to our city.

There\u2019s mainstreaming them into public schools, the Special Olympics, TV shows like \u201cSpeechless,\u201d Down syndrome children in clothing ads. There are group homes, not warehousing. There\u2019s awareness that words can wound. I flinched when someone yelled \u201cretard\u201d at my brother, Jimmy. For some comedians, it was a laugh line. You don\u2019t hear it much anymore.His being different may be the main reason they chose him. The developmentally challenged so crave kindness they make inviting prey. The victim, who knew one of his attackers, was taken to an apartment where he was tied up, punched and kicked. His mouth was taped shut, his scalp sliced open with a knife. For added humiliation, the assailants forced his head into a toilet and ordered him to drink.The heightened penalties for a hate crime may be some comfort to the victim\u2019s family, but if they are like mine, not much. His relatives look defeated as they describe their horror at what happened. His grandmother won\u2019t watch the video the four perpetrators proudly recorded for Facebook.All the progress that has been made saves parents today some of the sorrow my parents endured when they could get only so much help in the 1960s. Because there wasn\u2019t much institutional support and Jimmy didn\u2019t fit easily into the wider world, my parents created an inner one that brought the outside in. We were the only family on our block in Camp Hill, Pa., to churn our own ice cream and grow our own watermelons, so the neighborhood children loved coming over. My parents didn\u2019t trust babysitters, so parish dinners, poker games and Knights of Columbus meetings came to us. Bread was always setting, pie crust rolled out, jigsaw puzzles on the card table.I didn\u2019t love it, and could have done with less \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d and more alone time. But it was better than my navigating Jimmy\u2019s world on my own. What can\u2019t be programmed or legislated away \u2014 and requires constant \u201cif you see something, say something\u201d \u2014 is the hate in hate crime, the base instinct of some to pick on the weak, often because they\u2019re weak themselves. There will always be those grasping the chance to feel superior \u2014 witness all the abuse of old people in nursing homes and gay shaming.I saw cruelty firsthand \u2014 and was guilty myself \u2014 as a child. Despite my protection, Jimmy was the last to be picked for a team, although he could swing a bat as badly as just about any other 6-year-old. The pack would say they were running one way and go another. Hitting another kid was punishable, but sidling up to Jimmy and subtly pinching him was not. We\u2019d wonder where he got the bruises. But he knew enough to fear the brat pack more than my parents, so he never tattled. One kid loved bending the training wheels on his bike. I sometimes fell in with the crowd. I\u2019d hear the whispers about pretending to go home so that Jimmy would. Later, I\u2019d sneak back out hiding my Wiffle ball from my mother.That\u2019s not luring a vulnerable man to an empty apartment to be tortured, but it shows how much vigilance is needed. Tim Shriver, who runs the Special Olympics, said that there had been many advances but that \u201ctaunting and bullying remain an epidemic for children with intellectual disabilities\u201d and that violence against them \u201cis usually based on misunderstanding and ignorance and is all too often hidden.\u201dThe older the child, the more hidden and difficult to prevent. The 18-year-old victim in Chicago thought one of his tormentors was his friend, and his parents dropped him off to meet him at McDonald\u2019s. They reported him missing when he didn\u2019t come home, but not soon enough to keep him from being tortured for five hours.I became my brother\u2019s guardian in 1991. He took some time before he learned to cling to me the way he had to our parents. I couldn\u2019t be home with him all the time, so he came many places with me. My friends became his friends. But he was hurt when I least expected it. He didn\u2019t know elevator etiquette and made eye contact with people getting on. As he was stepping off one time, a lawyer who worked in my building turned and called him a \u201cweirdo.\u201d I tracked him down, as I did the kid who stole my brother\u2019s spanking-new Mickey Mantle baseball glove many years ago, and confronted him. He pleaded ignorance. The description fit.I thought I knew my parents\u2019 heartache but didn\u2019t have a glimmer. It\u2019s called politically correct and squishy liberal or nannyish to protect the weak among us \u2014 transgender children, minorities, the homeless, old people \u2014 but it\u2019s really just human.

{"Headline": "A Political Jolt at a Literary Festival, but Courtesy Wins Out", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byJaipur JournalJAIPUR, India \u2014 Every year at this time, India\u2019s beau monde rearranges itself in Jaipur for a spectacularly popular five-day literary festival.There are Punjabi princesses in Jackie Onassis sunglasses, book club aunties in top-shelf homespun, parboiled-looking Englishmen, men of letters with Oxbridge accents and the occasional well-buffed South Delhi influence peddler. At night, they gather for cocktails in floodlit palaces. To be liberal, if not leftist, is as proper as a quilted handbag.The R.S.S., which maintains that India is fundamentally a Hindu nation, has been barreling toward drawing-room respectability for some time. Left-leaning Congress governments banned it three times in the last century, saying its ideas risked inciting violence against minority groups. These days state television carries its leader\u2019s speeches live. But there are few invitations in Indian public life more coveted than one to appear at the festival in Jaipur, that Mount Olympus of panel discussions.The two R.S.S. men took their seats on a podium, where a minute before, an author had been asking rhetorical questions about the existence of beauty. How would the audience greet them: As India\u2019s version of the Tea Party, giving voice to ideas that have taken on extraordinary force in the electorate? Or as India\u2019s version of the Ku Klux Klan, propagating \u201cextremism and bigotry,\u201d as one author put it in a letter withdrawing from the event? In the end, arm\u2019s-length politeness reigned.\u201cWe are acknowledging that the intellectual nerve center has shifted, and the seat of cultural power has shifted, because no one was interested in inviting these guys before 2014,\u201d said Supriya Nair, a writer and editor who has attended the festival for the last six years. In any case, she said, the shift rightward had already taken place in the larger society. \u201cThis is a last bastion,\u201d she said.The R.S.S., for its part, savored its moment. \u201cR.S.S. was allowed entry into this space for the first time,\u201d said Prafulla Ketkar, who edits Organiser, the group\u2019s in-house magazine. \u201cFor whatever reason, now they are compelled to recognize the fact that R.S.S. is a force to reckon with, and one which cannot be ignored at panel discussions.\u201dEven by Bengali standards, Mr. Seth, the author of the self-help book \u201cGet to the Top,\u201d is skilled at drowning out other speakers, deflecting all contenders with sonorous repetitions of \u201cone minute, one minute, one minute\u201d until they retreat into dejected silence. On Monday, he appeared on the panel \u201cManelists, Misogyny and Mansplaining,\u201d next to a row of female writers who turned on him with gusto, asking why he kept interrupting.He tried, haltingly, to discourage them from viewing this phenomenon through the lens of gender. \u201cIn Calcutta, we didn\u2019t know misogyny or mansplaining,\u201d he said starchily at one point. \u201cAll that we knew was the idea of \u2018gentleman\u2019 and \u2018gentlemanly.\u2019 \u201d Pressed on these terms, he fluffed himself up. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cgentleman is what we use. I\u2019m sorry if it doesn\u2019t stand up to the rigors of today\u2019s understanding.\u201dAmong the great draws of the Jaipur festival, of course, is that it is possible to be excluded. At a party thrown by Penguin Random House India, in a palace once occupied by a maharajah, guests were led through a gate where dancing girls whirled giddily on the ramparts and over a red carpet across an expanse of gardens, dark except for thousands of tiny flickering candles and liveried servants offering Champagne.\u201cWe almost got run over by horses,\u201d one partygoer said blandly, drifting off toward the gin.JLF Insider observed a well-known journalist, young women in tow, frantically mining his contacts to get through the door. \u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d the blogger said. \u201cIf you make the right impression with the right person, you will perhaps be in a panel next year.\u201dIndeed, there is a category of Delhi writers who spend much of the year angling for an invitation to speak, through assiduous attendance at other writers\u2019 book launches.\u201cI never appease anybody,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t want to call someone I can be quite cussed.\u201dMr. Dalrymple, who selects non-Indian writers, said he felt fortunate that Ms. Gokhale handled this part. \u201cShe is constantly avoiding people at Delhi parties, people who have written self-published memoirs and think they should be there,\u201d he said.Mr. Dalrymple sounded genuinely sad at the mention of Mr. Karnad. He said the rise of right-wing politics had posed a dilemma for organizers of events like his, because India\u2019s elite universities and publishing houses are so overwhelmingly left-liberal.\u201cThis is an organization that controls the ruling party,\u201d he said. \u201cTo exclude this element would be to relegate us to a left-liberal bubble with ourselves.\u201dIn the end, most of those cramming into the festival were neither haughty leftists nor right-wing polemicists, but ordinary people afflicted with book love. At a discussion on Hindu scripture, a man in a plaid scarf rose to ask, after a moment of hesitation, \u201cWhat is the best way for an old man to try and learn Sanskrit, and enjoy it before he dies?\u201dAnd there were students, thousands of them, subsisting on 30-rupee cups of sweet tea. Some of them spent five days sleeping in the train station because they did not have enough money to rent a room, said Payal Rajawat, 20. For her part, she said, she craved the free-ranging discussion of art and literature, something not available at the Vivekananda Institute of Technology, which she attends.\u201cI am a totally freaky lover of language,\u201d she said.As for the inclusion of the R.S.S., Ms. Rajawat saw no problem. Like her friends, she celebrates the rise of Mr. Modi, saying he had elevated India\u2019s standing to the point that \u201ceven America is paying attention.\u201d One of her friends this year had rejected a Happy New Year greeting because he said it was a holiday imposed on India by Western colonizers. This line of thinking gave her an idea, which she suggested passing on to the organizers of next year\u2019s literary festival.\u201cMr. Modi is a mesmerizing speaker,\u201d she said. \u201cBelieve me, ma\u2019am, the whole world would come into this place.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated, using information from a festival organizer, the percentage of the national vote won by the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014.

{"Headline": "Defiant Voices Flood U.S. Cities as Women Rally for Rights", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The day after what many had assumed would be the inauguration of the first female president, hundreds of thousands of women flooded the streets of Washington, and many more marched in cities across the country, in defiant, jubilant rallies against the man who defeated her.Protesters jammed the streets near the Capitol for the main demonstration, packed so tightly at times that they could barely move. In Chicago, the size of a rally so quickly outgrew early estimates that the official march that was scheduled to follow was canceled for safety, though many paraded through downtown, anyway.In Manhattan, Fifth Avenue became a tide of signs and symbolic pink hats, while in downtown Los Angeles, shouts of \u201clove trumps hate\u201d echoed along a one-mile route leading to City Hall, with many demonstrators spilling over into adjacent streets in a huge, festival-like atmosphere.The marches were the kickoff for what their leaders hope will be a sustained campaign of protest in a polarized nation, riven by an election that raised unsettling questions about American values, out-of-touch elites and barriers to women\u2019s ambitions.Then on Saturday, in what amounted to a counterinauguration, the speakers, performers and marchers proclaimed allegiance to a profoundly different vision of the nation. They voiced determination to protect an array of rights that they believe Mr. Trump threatens, and that they thought only recently were secure.\u201cThank you for understanding that sometimes we must put our bodies where our beliefs are,\u201d Gloria Steinem, the feminist icon and an honorary chairwoman of the march, told those gathered in Washington. \u201cPressing \u2018send\u2019 is not enough.\u201dIn Washington, demonstrators old and young pushed strollers and hoisted children onto their shoulders or guided elderly parents through the milling crowds. They waved handmade signs: \u201cHate Does Not Make America Great,\u201d \u201cI Will Not Go Back Quietly to the 1950s\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m 17 \u2014 Fear Me!\u201d They chanted, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u2019\u201dEmma Wendt, 13, came with a large group of family members and schoolmates from Kensington, Md., for a simple reason: \u201cbeing part of history.\u201dCrowds in hundreds of cities around the world gathered in conjunction with the Women\u2019s March on Washington.The marchers were confronting a president who has appointed just a handful of women to his cabinet and inner circle, and who has pledged to nominate a Supreme Court justice who opposes abortion rights and to dismantle a health care act that covers contraception. His appointees have track records of voting to cut funding for anti-domestic violence programs, opposing increases in the minimum wage and restructuring Medicaid \u2014 moves that disproportionately affect women and minorities.Crowd estimates were not available in some locations, but a city official in Washington said that participation there likely surpassed half a million, according to The Associated Press. Added to the more than 400,000 that Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office said had marched in New York City, hundreds of thousands more in Chicago and Los Angeles, and those who showed up at many other marches nationwide, the total attendance easily surpassed one million in the United States. Marches also took place in a number of cities abroad, including Berlin, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam and Cape Town.In Boston, where the crowd swelled to 175,000, Senator Elizabeth Warren looked out at the admiring throngs and conjured up the image of Mr. Trump\u2019s being sworn in the day before.\u201cThe sight is now burned into my eyes forever,\u201d Ms. Warren said, adding, \u201cWe will use that vision to fight harder.\u201dEstimates by crowd scientists of attendance at events on Friday and Saturday and how they calculated it.Yet women did not protest \u2014 or vote \u2014 as a bloc. About 53 percent of white women voted for Mr. Trump, according to exit polls, and many said his demeaning comments about women mattered less to them than their belief that he had the independence and business experience to bring about change, restore well-paying jobs and protect America\u2019s borders.The marches came a day after confrontations between anti-Trump protesters and the police led to more than 200 arrests in Washington. But Saturday\u2019s demonstrations were peaceful, and counterprotests were few. In St. Paul, one man was arrested after marchers reported he had \u201csprayed irritants\u201d into the crowd, the police said.Among those celebrity performers, were some who had appeared at campaign events for Mrs. Clinton, including Madonna, who gave a speech, said toward the end of of the march. \u201cI have thought a lot about blowing up the White House. But I know that this will not change anything,\u201d she said. (The Secret Service declined to comment on the remark, though an investigation seemed unlikely.)After attending the inauguration on Friday, Mrs. Clinton herself was not seen at the march. She did, however, acknowledge the moment on Twitter.\u201cThanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch,\u201d she wrote.The marches captured the potential and the perils for the progressive movement \u2014 whether it can frame its message to appeal to new generations and whether it can translate protests into action locally and nationally.The march\u2019s initial struggles echoed broader debates in the movement about whether the courting of new demographic groups alienated the white working-class voters who had carried Mr. Trump to victory, or whether white women had betrayed gender solidarity by voting for him. Yet on Saturday, these tensions did not deter a multiracial, multigenerational turnout. Mothers marched with daughters and granddaughters; whole families, including husbands and sons, marched arm in arm.Mikhael Tara Garver, 37, of Brooklyn, who marched with her mother, recalled how her family had reacted after the election: \u201cWe were all calling my great-aunts because we all knew how important Hillary was to them and how important surviving to see that moment was for them.\u201dAnother family came from Baltimore. \u201cWe have to get away from fear,\u201d said Lureen Grace Wiggins, 49. Her daughter, Eden, 17, was exhilarated by the size of the crowd: \u201cWhen you\u2019re out here and people see you, they know you care.\u201dThe march was rich in historical allusions \u2014 most deliberately, the 1963 march led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But it echoed many other marches, including those in the 1970s that brought hundreds of thousands of women to the streets championing an Equal Rights Amendment that was ultimately defeated, and those from the late 1990s and on for abortion rights, culminating in a 2004 March for Women\u2019s Lives that organizers said drew more than one million to the capital.Saturday\u2019s march happened to come just six days before quite a different one: the annual March for Life by opponents of abortion.But perhaps the most apt analogy, said Ellen Fitzpatrick, the author of \u201cThe Highest Glass Ceiling,\u201d was to the 1913 suffragists\u2019 march on Washington, timed to coincide with the inauguration of President Woodrow Wilson. Led by the renowned suffragist Alice Paul, it featured a lawyer, Inez Milholland, riding a white horse down Pennsylvania Avenue, with 24 floats, nine marching bands and luminaries like Helen Keller. The women were hooted and jeered at and roughed up by the police, prompting congressional hearings and generating public sympathy. They won the vote seven years later.Faye Wattleton, the former president of Planned Parenthood, said that women have always had to regroup, even after they thought battles were won. \u201cThis is not new,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to go back to the battlefield and re-fight the wars against women.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the author of \u201cThe Highest Glass Ceiling.\u201d It is Fitzpatrick, not Fitzgerald.Reporting was contributed by Farah Stockman from Washington, Julie Turkewitz from Denver, Jess Bidgood from Boston, Emma G.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Takes a Right Turn", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byMost tech executives and employees remain supportive of Democrats, especially on social and cultural issues. The Republican tilt of the PACs at Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook suggests, however, that as these companies\u2019 domains grow larger, their bottom-line interests are becoming increasingly aligned with the policies of the Republican Party.In 2016, the Microsoft PAC gave $478,818 to Republican House candidates and $272,000 to Democratic House candidates. It gave $164,000 to Republican Senate candidates, and $75,000 to Democratic Senate candidates.This was not small change. In 2016 Microsoft employees gave a total of $6.47 million.The firm first became a noticeable player in the world of campaign finance in 2012 when employees and the company PAC together made contributions of $910,000. That year, Facebook employees backed Democrats over Republicans 64-35, while the company\u2019s PAC tilted Republican, 53-46.By 2016, when total Facebook contributions reached $3.8 million, the Democratic advantage in employee donations shrank to 51-47, while the PAC continued to favor Republicans, 56-44.While the employees of the three other most valuable tech companies, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and Apple, remained Democratic in their giving in 2016, at the corporate level of Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 that is, at the level of their PACs \u2014 they have not.Tech giants can no longer be described as insurgents challenging corporate America.American consumer technology companies are getting larger, more entrenched in their own sectors, more powerful in new sectors and better insulated against surprising competition from upstarts.Among Ferenstein\u2019s findings: a minority, 29 percent, of tech company founders described labor unions as \u201cgood,\u201d compared to 73 percent of Democrats. Asked \u201cis meritocracy naturally unequal?\u201d tech founders overwhelmingly agreed.Ferenstein went on:One hundred percent of the smaller sample of founders to whom I presented this question said they believe that a truly meritocratic economy would be \u201cmostly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unequal. This is a key distinction: Opportunity is about maximizing people\u2019s potential, which founders tend to believe is highly unequal. Founders may value citizen contributions to society, but they don\u2019t think all citizens have the potential to contribute equally. When asked what percent of national income the top 10% would hold in such a scenario, a majority (67%) of founders believed that the richest individuals would control 50% or more of total income, while only 31% of the public believes such an outcome would occur in a meritocratic society.One of the most interesting questions posed by Ferenstein speaks to middle and working class anxieties over global competition:In international trade policy, some people believe the U.S. government should create laws that favor American business with policies that protect it from global competition, such as fees on imported goods or making it costly to hire cheaper labor in other countries (\u201coutsourcing\u201d). Others believe it would be better if there were less regulations and businesses were free to trade and compete without each country favoring their own industries. Which of these statements come closest to your belief?There was a large difference between tech company officials, 73 percent of whom chose free trade and less regulation, while only 20 percent of Democrats supported those choices.Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University who writes about demographic, social and economic trends, sees these differences as the source of deep conflict within the Democratic Party.The disruptive force is largely Silicon Valley, a natural oligarchy that now funds a party teetering toward populism and even socialism. The fundamental contradictions, as Karl Marx would have noted, lie in the collision of interests between a group that has come to epitomize self-consciously progressive mega-wealth and a mass base which is increasingly concerned about downward mobility.The tech elite, Kotkin writes, \u201cfar from deserting the Democratic Party, more likely will aim take to take it over.\u201d Until very recently, theconflict between populists and tech oligarchs has been muted, in large part due to common views on social issues like gay marriage and, to some extent, environmental protection. But as the social issues fade, having been \u201cwon\u201d by progressives, the focus necessarily moves to economics, where the gap between these two factions is greatest.Kotkin sees future partisan machination in cynical terms:One can expect the oligarchs to seek out a modus vivendi with the populists. They could exchange a regime of higher taxes and regulation for ever-expanding crony capitalist opportunities and political protection. As the hegemons of today, Facebook and Google, not to mention Apple and Amazon, have an intense interest in protecting themselves, for example, from antitrust legislation. History is pretty clear: Heroic entrepreneurs of one decade often turn into the insider capitalists of the next.In 2016, Donald Trump has produced an upheaval within the Republican Party that shifted attention away from the less explosive turmoil in Democratic ranks.Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed bid to finesse the inherent conflict between her dependence on corporate contributions and her need for a strong turnout by union workers, minorities and idealistic millennials embodies the Democratic Party\u2019s long term struggle.The public, at least for the moment, is not willing to support the continued compromise of principle that has been a hallmark of both parties. Trump has provided a temporary solution for the Republican Party; the Democrats need to find a legitimate and more lasting one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women\u2019s March Gives Boost to Start-Up for Bus Sharing", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported byA few days after Donald J. Trump won the presidential election, the founders of Skedaddle, a bus start-up, began seeing some unusual activity.Their tiny company, which makes an app that lets individuals collectively commission private bus rides, was suddenly hit by a surge in bookings. Some of the bookings originated from places where Skedaddle has done little business before, including Wichita, Kan.; Madison, Wis.; and Macon, Ga. All of the reservations were for travelers to arrive the same day, Jan. 21, at the same destination, Washington.There was another twist. Many of those booking the bus trips were women.\u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation event in terms of numbers, and no single organization can move them all,\u201d said Numaan Akram, a founder and the chief executive of Rally.Unrecognized tech start-ups have been lifted by presidential inaugurations before. In 2009, for President Obama\u2019s first inauguration, Airbnb was largely unknown and the practice of paying to sleep in a stranger\u2019s home was relatively uncommon. But most Washington hotels were sold out, and word of Airbnb spread quickly among people desperate for a place to stay. Airbnb now operates in more than 34,000 cities worldwide and is valued at $30 billion.Skedaddle may see some similar inauguration benefits. The company was founded in 2015 by Mr. Nestler, his brother Craig, Brad Werntz and Louis Harwood, who had met through a combination of school and previous work at start-ups. None of the founders are over 29, and this is the first company any of them have started.The four founded Skedaddle to allow people to create bus routes to wherever they please, with a mission of letting users \u201cride to amazing destinations with inspiring people.\u201d Once a route has at least 10 people, Skedaddle works with a local transportation company to provide the appropriate van or bus. The company works with higher-end, luxury transportation companies.Skedaddle makes money by securing a discounted rate from the transportation providers for bringing in a higher volume of customers. The average price of a ride on Skedaddle is $45 to $50. As a route fills with more people, the company\u2019s margins grow. Skedaddle has raised more than $3 million from investors.Riders can book, track and rate their transportation providers on Skedaddle, just as they can with Uber or Lyft. But in contrast with Uber and Lyft, all of the vehicles and drivers that Skedaddle contracts with are licensed and insured for commercial operations.While Skedaddle aims to someday replace established bus services like Greyhound and Peter Pan, much of its early business has focused on getting people out of cities for trips like weekend getaways. It has partnerships with 17 ski resorts and with music festivals like Bonnaroo, and it has been moving an average of 50,000 riders a month.\u201cToday Skedaddle appeals to self-selecting groups, like music lovers and skiers,\u201d said Paige Craig, an investor in Skedaddle who was also an early investor in Lyft. \u201cThat inherently social aspect of the company is a big advantage.\u201d\u201cWhen we were trying to hire charter buses, there were big questions about insurance and upfront payments,\u201d said Lauren North, an organizer of the march who is based in Louisville, Ky. \u201cWe were having a hard time moving all of these people to D.C.\u201dMs. North had not heard of Skedaddle until someone mentioned the app during an organizing meeting. She said about 800 people from Kentucky are now going to the march and nearly half of those will use Skedaddle.\u201cSkedaddle has been a huge help,\u201d Ms. North said. \u201cIt means something to us that they share our values and are proud to support the cause.\u201dSkedaddle is politically agnostic and would have transported Trump supporters to the inauguration, but none of the company\u2019s employees voted for Mr. Trump and Mr. Nestler said his company is proud to support the marchers.As more people booked seats to the march, Skedaddle employees scrambled to keep up, working longer hours and on weekends. Everyone took on additional roles, with many pulled in to help with customer service. Women\u2019s March organizers and bus riders have been punctuating their emails to Skedaddle with expressions of relief and heart emojis.So huge was the bookings surge for Skedaddle \u2014 the company had interest from thousands more riders than are currently booked \u2014 that in early January, it cut off the number of new routes to Washington. The company said it did not want to run the risk of signing up so many people that it could not serve them all well.\u201cThe march has opened doors for us in new places,\u201d said Lindsay Dougherty, Skedaddle\u2019s marketing director.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He started taking pictures of the closed gates, straight-ahead compositions featuring repetitive lines and shapes, sometimes slathered with graffiti or weathered signs, all rendered in black and white. They are graceful, melancholy and almost reverent, in some cases reminiscent of Walker Evans (whose work Mr. de Zuvir\u00c3\u00ada did not know when he started seriously taking pictures).\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe city of Buenos Aires is his protagonist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gabriela Rangel, who curated the show along with Alexis Fabry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe city he knew, he anticipated its disappearance. This is the Buenos Aires of someone who is not a tourist, who lives there and goes to the cafe in the barrio that has been run by the same family for years. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not very different from what the Bowery was in the \u00e2\u0080\u009970s or what Walker Evans did in Havana in the 1930s.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIndeed, as Ms. Rangel pointed out, his work follows in the tradition of Evans, as well as that of Zoe Leonard and Martha Rosler, some of whose images are in dialog with Mr. de Zuvir\u00c3\u00ada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photos.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier for me to understand Rosler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work looking at Facundo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Rangel, who is the director of visual arts and chief curator at the Americas Society. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an exhibit about the importance of the local and how the local could be universal. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we included Leonard and Rosler, so we can see the similarities.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. de Zuvir\u00c3\u00ada, 62, says his storefronts were an obsession of his from 2001 until 2003, when he published a book of them. So, too, was photography, which he first took up as a 6-year-old when his godmother gave him a box camera. He loved it, though his parents had other plans: He came from a family of lawyers and was expected to enter the profession. He went to law school, but after graduating in 1979, he eventually took up photography full time, working for several newspapers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo my family, being a photographer was to be crazy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey asked, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why be a photographer when you can be a lawyer?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But I was in love with another.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe left newspapers in the mid-1980s, jumping at the chance to work at a cultural program that was active in various neighborhoods. Not only did it appeal to him in terms of culture, it also spoke to his political leanings.\u00e2\u0080\u009cArgentina had returned to democratic rule after the dictatorship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all felt part of this democratic awakening, and to work in the cultural project was to participate in something I always supported.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHis work in the cultural program helped him discover the parts of the city that were off the beaten path. Each neighborhood had its own traditions, businesses and customs. He stayed for several years, until a new government came in, one that he felt he could not support. One of the photos in the exhibit reflects the moment he knew he was going to leave: It shows a row of idle typewriters against his office window, the city stretching out in the background.The 2001 crisis drove him to document the closing stores. But as things began picking up again in 2003, he felt he needed to create a book of those images. When he published \u00e2\u0080\u009cSiesta Argentina,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he did so as a fold-out, with one side showing closed storefronts and the other featuring open businesses. That reopening was what inspired his title, \u00e2\u0080\u009csiesta,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or nap.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was an optimistic look \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not death or disappearance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re asleep but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to awaken. It reflects the crisis, but I was convinced we were going to get ahead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The streetscapes in San Telmo, the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oldest neighborhood, in which he lived for a while in the 1980s, have changed. Stores have reopened, but with new owners and catering to new customers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have nothing to do with barrio life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Yet he said he would continue to explore, as he always has.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like leaving Buenos Aires,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the place where you belong, you find your own definition.

Yet even The Decider himself, George W. Bush, proved willing to rethink his views as contrary facts came to light \u2014 like the failure of Iraqis to garland American occupiers with flowers. Mr. Trump is not merely uninterested in facts; he repels them. In their place, he confects his own reality to feed his bottomless emotional and psychological needs. It is not America First, it is Donald Trump First, and always.This is the essence of Mr. Trump: selling himself or his plans by massaging and embellishing facts, or simply making them up and hoping everyone plays along. It is a strategy he developed, quite purposefully, during his days as a brash New York City real estate tycoon, and later relied on as a TV personality. He even has his own term for it: \u201ctruthful hyperbole,\u201d which Mr. Trump described in his 1987 book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d as \u201can innocent form of exaggeration \u2014 and a very effective form of promotion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Berates News Media, a New Strategy Is Needed to Cover Him", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byMediatorThere were two big lessons in the Wednesday morning melee.1. Mr. Trump remains a master media manipulator who used his first news briefing since July to expertly delegitimize the news media and make it the story rather than the chaotic swirl of ethical questions that engulf his transition.2. The news media remains an unwitting accomplice in its own diminishment as it fails to get a handle on how to cover this new and wholly unprecedented president.It better figure things out, fast, because it has found itself at the edge of the cliff. And our still-functioning (fingers crossed) democracy needs it to stay on the right side of the drop.Journalists should know this by now: Trump\u2019s gonna Trump. But it\u2019s time for them to take a page from the 12-step playbook \u2014 accept the things they cannot change and then find the courage to change the things they can, in the right ways, not the wrong ways.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s past behavior, there was hardly any doubt that he was going to kneecap his inquisitors on Wednesday. It\u2019s a passion, after all, if not a strategic imperative.But BuzzFeed handed him the steel rod hours before, with its decision to publish an unvarnished dossier filled with unsubstantiated, compromising reports about Mr. Trump allegedly collected by Russian agents, presumably for blackmail purposes.Mr. Smith\u2019s stated rationale highlights the extent to which WikiLeaks and Gawker, which is now defunct, have changed the nature of journalism. Both have at times taken a \u201cpublish first, fill in the answers \u2014 or don\u2019t \u2014 later\u201d approach, but they held particular, outsider roles in the journalistic firmament. And both have run into great trouble because of their guns-blazing styles, in Gawker\u2019s case, fatally (if wrongfully).BuzzFeed, under Mr. Smith, has built up a fine traditional news team that has won journalism awards precisely because it succeeded in the ultimate purposes of its craft: to establish fact from fiction and enhance its readers\u2019 understanding of reality. That\u2019s the opposite of pumping out a bunch of unsubstantiated allegations and then leaving it to readers to \u201cmake up their own minds\u201d about them with no reportorial guidance.You can argue that the dossier was going to get out there anyway. But it hadn\u2019t until BuzzFeed published it, even though many news organizations, including this one, had the dossier for months. And had they leaked by some other means, it would be up to journalists to establish their veracity; ignore them if possible, debunk them if necessary.That\u2019s what Mr. Trump did Wednesday morning.In calling BuzzFeed a \u201cfailing piece of garbage,\u201d Mr. Trump gave it a cri de coeur. But there was collateral damage: Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d charge against CNN, in front of many millions of Americans, went directly at the network\u2019s core purpose as a global news provider.CNN drew Mr. Trump\u2019s hostility by breaking the news on Tuesday that a former British spy had compiled the Russia dossier and that intelligence officials included a synopsis of it in briefing materials for the president-elect. Once CNN opened the door, BuzzFeed followed by publishing the document itself.And so, Mr. Trump won again, by succeeding in doing just that. It was all part of a show in which he used news organizations as props in their own lampooning while he played them off each other with labels of good and bad and selectively answered their policy questions.A united front would have given the reporters stronger footing. But that was woefully lacking when Mr. Trump shouted down Jim Acosta of CNN, who said Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, threatened to eject him.The other reporters in the room readily took Mr. Acosta\u2019s place, happy to have their own questions answered. But they could be next. They\u2019re going to have to decide how much they want to abide by Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to selectively quarantine colleagues whose coverage he does not like.So it was fitting that, later on Wednesday, Shepard Smith of Fox News got behind CNN. \u201cIt is our observation that its correspondents followed journalistic standards and that neither they nor any other journalists should be subjected to belittling and delegitimizing by the president-elect of the United States,\u201d he said on his program.(The same couldn\u2019t be said for his colleague, the opinion host Sean Hannity \u2014 proudly \u201cnot a journalist\u201d \u2014 who on Wednesday night celebrated the news briefing as \u201cthe single greatest beatdown of the alt-left abusively biased mainstream media in the history of the country.\u201d)Mr. Acosta, interestingly, made history last spring by becoming the first American journalist to ask a question of a Cuban leader, Ra\u00fal Castro, since the earliest days of the Castro regime.

{"Headline": "Lech Walesa Denounces Report Labeling Him a Communist Informer", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byAndrzej Pozorski, who leads a commission that investigates Communist-era crimes, said that Mr. Walesa could be prosecuted for giving false testimony, though it seems unlikely that the authorities will want to pursue criminal charges.Mr. Walesa, 73, said he believed the handwriting experts and officials from the government-run institute were under political pressure from Poland\u2019s right-wing governing party, Law and Justice, to declare the uncovered files authentic.The party has long tried to undermine Mr. Walesa\u2019s legacy. Its leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is effectively the most powerful man in Poland, has been estranged from Mr. Walesa for over 25 years, after a falling out soon after the collapse of the Iron Curtain.The files in question include a handwritten agreement, signed \u201cLech Walesa, Bolek,\u201d to cooperate with the state security service, as well as 17 receipts and 29 denouncements, all handwritten and signed by Mr. Walesa either as \u201cBolek\u201d or himself, the report says.Jan Widacki, a representative of Mr. Walesa, said the matter was by no means settled. \u201cThis is just an opinion, and we have the right to respond to it,\u201d he said at a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cWe would like the prosecution to gather expert witnesses from various institutions, not just one that is subordinate to the government.\u201dIn a Facebook post, Mr. Walesa, who was traveling outside Poland on Tuesday, repeated his denial that he had ever been a Communist. \u201cKiszczak could not recruit me, he could not buy me or even kill me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo he decided to write those quasi-denunciations to convince you. You can either believe me or Kiszczak.\u201dJan Skorzynski, a historian at Collegium Civitas in Warsaw who studied Mr. Walesa\u2019s dossier, said that he believed the documents were authentic \u2014 but that the political context behind them was much more complicated than the institute\u2019s analysis suggested.Mr. Walesa was just 27 when he found himself one of the leaders of a major strike at the Gdansk shipyard. He was arrested \u2014 like many other dissenters \u2014 and faced grave pressure to collaborate, Mr. Skorzynski said.\u201cAfter the police arrived at his house to arrest him, he left his wedding ring and watch with his wife so that she could exchange them for money in case he didn\u2019t come back,\u201d Mr. Skorzynski said. \u201cThose were the times when police tortured their prisoners. Walesa signed the agreement to collaborate in an general atmosphere of terror.\u201dOver the next several years, Mr. Skorzynski said, Mr. Walesa was transformed from reluctant informant into genuine rebel.Andrzej Celinski, a Solidarity leader in the 1980s who later became a critic of Mr. Walesa, said that whatever might have transpired between Mr. Walesa and the Communists in those early days, \u201cit only made him tougher, stronger and smarter when it came to playing them in the 1980s.\u201dMr. Walesa\u2019s critics say he was wrong to sit down with Communists in 1989 to negotiate a peaceful transition of power, which resulted in many Communists\u2019 remaining in public life.On Tuesday, Mr. Szarek even wondered aloud how cooperation with the Communists might have influenced Mr. Walesa during the Solidarity years and as Poland\u2019s president, implying that he could have continued to function as a Communist agent.But Mr. Celinski called that charge \u201cinsulting.\u201d \u201cSince 1976, Walesa was constantly under surveillance, fired from one job after another,\u201d he said. \u201cHe and his family lived in constant fear.\u201dMr. Skorzynski, the historian, said he hoped that this single episode in Mr. Walesa\u2019s life would not define his legacy. \u201cBecause he went on to redeem himself,\u201d he said. \u201cHe redeemed himself many times over.\u201dAdvertisement"}

An Iraqi refugee in Lebanon, he thought he was so close to getting to the United States that he had gone out and bought a new shirt for his trip.\u201cWe left because we were discriminated against in Darfur,\u201d she said. \u201cSo to be discriminated against by a U.S. president, by a nation we see our future in, is so disheartening. How do you live with that?\u201dThe order, Mr. Trump said, is a way to \u201ckeep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d he said at the Pentagon. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.\u201dThe executive order calls for the United States\u2019 annual refugee quota to be cut to a maximum of 50,000, compared with 85,000 allowed in during the fiscal year ending in September 2016.Mr. Trump\u2019s order also suspends the entry of all Syrian refugees indefinitely, calling their arrival \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d Beyond that, it suspends visas to people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for 90 days.Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s refugee ban, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesman, said he hoped \u201cit\u2019s a temporary one.\u201d He noted that more people were displaced around the world than ever before.\u201cThe U.S. resettlement program is one of the most important resettlement programs the U.N. works with,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s action was the latest closed door in a world that has become increasingly unwelcome to refugees, amid rising concerns and hostility in many resettlement countries in Europe, and in countries of first refuge like Turkey and Lebanon.For those refugees, in particular, who thought that their asylum process was over and that they would be accepted in the United States, the dismay was overwhelming this past week.Ms. Diab and her husband said she fled to Turkey and applied for asylum in the United States in summer 2015, along with close friends who applied at the same time. They said the friends had received a final decision just over a week ago and had flown to America. The Diabs had reason to hope that their own number would come up any day.Now, that may never happen. Reached by telephone in their tiny apartment in Turkey, Ms. Diab sounded distraught, as the couple\u2019s 2-year-old daughter could be heard playing in the background.\u201cWe are so, so, so sad,\u201d Ms. Diab said, complaining that Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that terrorists were slipping in as refugees was overblown. \u201cThe process of resettlement is long and difficult. You can say he is wrong. Because he didn\u2019t live the application steps in all its difficulties.\u201dBut in other countries, like Iraq, citizens who worked for the American military, government and companies were promised preferential treatment for resettlement. Many thought that the risks they took on behalf of the United States would be repaid one day with a safe haven when they needed it. Now Iraqis are also on Mr. Trump\u2019s proscribed list.Laith al-Samari, 37, was one of many who could not believe it. A former interpreter for the United States military, he was wounded twice in battle, in the leg and stomach, and now lives in fear of retaliation from anti-American militants in his Baghdad community. He was not ashamed to beg.\u201cPlease Mr. President, you are the president of one of the biggest states in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty in taking this decision. Be fair with us.\u201dMustafa, the 28-year-old Iraqi, is a Shiite Muslim who worked on construction crews on American bases, mostly on fortifications. As he put it: \u201cI made homes for them that kept them safe. I felt I was doing something good for humanity.\u201dBut anti-Shiite militias in his neighborhood discovered what his job had been and accused him of treason. \u201cI was beaten and shot and knifed and eventually came to Lebanon two years ago,\u201d he said, during an interview arranged in Beirut by the International Refugee Assistance Project, a New York-based legal aid group.After years of interviews and investigation, Mustafa said he was finally told to take his medical examination and now only needed to be given the date for his flight, to California. To get ready, Mustafa splurged at a high-end Beirut store to buy the clothes he would wear into his new life: dark green pants, a vest, a checked shirt in four colors. \u201cI would wear the best clothes I have, and I wouldn\u2019t take anything else with me, not even my memories,\u201d he said.Mustafa still has some hope that somehow exceptions will be made, which is why \u2014 like most of the refugees interviewed for this article \u2014 he did not want his full name published.\u201cIf I do get rejected,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d regret ever having shaken hands with an American.\u201d He struggled not to weep.The order cuts the number of refugees to the U.S. in half and bars those from Syria.Sardar Hussain, 16, an ethnic Hazara boy from central Afghanistan, was rocked by disbelief.He said that when he was 13, his father, mother and younger sister were killed when a bomb blew up a taxi that was taking his mother to a hospital. After paying a smuggling network $7,000 to get him to Australia, he was marooned en route, on the Indonesian island of Java, when Australia cracked down on boats bringing refugees there. For seven weeks, he slept on the sidewalk behind the United Nations offices in Jakarta, Indonesia. Now, after more than two years, he said, his flight to America was scheduled for Monday.\u201cWe were given a commitment to go there,\u201d he said, speaking softly in English at a coffee house in Jakarta, just after completing his final medical exam.Firas al-Swiha, 23, a Syrian refugee in Turkey, went out with friends on Wednesday night to drink away his disappointment. He was a university student and opposition activist in Syria before fleeing his hometown, Raqqa, now the Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital.He was still looking for answers.\u201cIs Trump trying to fight the terrorists by giving up on the victims of the very same terrorists?\u201d he asked. \u201cISIS wants to destroy our lives, and now Trump declined to give us one.\u201dSara, 31, a former television presenter who fled to Indonesia from Afghanistan after death threats \u2014 the Taliban and other cultural conservatives despise seeing Afghan women in public at all, let alone on television \u2014 was trying to arrive at answers of her own.\u201cYou just wait,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see how the years pass. You get older, you cannot make any plans. You watch your dreams die with every second you spend waiting.\u201dAfter three years and four months, she thought that the waiting was finally over, and that she would soon have a date when she was allowed to fly.Now her life has been suspended for at least four more months, with no guarantee that she will still be included in the Trump administration\u2019s much-reduced refugee quota once the visa moratorium is lifted.\u201cThe bitter truth,\u201d she said, \u201cis that your whole life is dependent on a single decision of someone who doesn\u2019t have even the slightest idea what it\u2019s like to live as a refugee.\u201dRod Nordland reported from Beirut, Joe Cochrane from Jakarta, and Patrick Kingsley from New York.

Trump is not the only person to announce plans to shut down a personal philanthropy, just the best known.This is the story of a man who made and kept that same promise.It was a race: Mr. Feeney was then 81, and Atlantic Philanthropies, a collection of private foundations he had started and funded, still had about $1.5 billion left. Flinging money out the window or writing checks willy-nilly was not Mr. Feeney\u2019s way.He had officially emptied his pockets, meeting his aspiration of \u201cgiving while living.\u201d Altogether, he had contributed $8 billion to his philanthropies, which have supported higher education, public health, human rights and scientific research.\u201cYou\u2019re always nervous handling so much money, but we seem to have worked it pretty well,\u201d Mr. Feeney, now 85, said last week in a phone interview.His remaining personal net worth is slightly more than $2 million. That\u2019s not quite broke, by any standard, but it is a modest amount for a man who controlled thousands of times as much wealth. He and his wife, Helga, now live in a rented apartment in San Francisco.\u201cYou can only wear one pair of pants at a time,\u201d Mr. Feeney has said.Beyond Mr. Feeney\u2019s reticence about blowing his own horn, \u201cit was also a way to leverage more donations \u2014 some other individual might contribute to get the naming rights,\u201d said Christopher G. Oechsli, the president and chief executive officer of Atlantic.Raised in Elizabeth, N.J., Mr. Feeney served as a radio operator in the Air Force and attended Cornell University on the G.I. Bill. In 1960, he and a partner set up a company that sold items like brandy and cigars to travelers in duty-free shops at airports. It became a booming success. Mr. Feeney has also been a shrewd investor in technology start-ups.In 1984, he secretly transferred all of his assets, including his 38.75 percent ownership of the duty-free business, to Atlantic Philanthropies. He grew the Atlantic pot with early investments in companies like Facebook, Priceline, E-Trade, Alibaba and Legent.A business dispute in 1997 forced disclosure of Mr. Feeney\u2019s funding for Atlantic.The two men are mirror images. For years, Mr. Trump lobbied hard to get onto lists of the wealthy, like the Forbes 400; Mr. Feeney has tried to stay off them. The Atlantic endowment came entirely from Mr. Feeney\u2019s money; much of the money that went into the Trump foundation in recent years was from others.One of Atlantic\u2019s projects was to propose reforms to the American health care system, which helped lay groundwork for the Affordable Care Act; another was advocacy for the end of the death penalty for juveniles. Mr. Trump has been on the other side of both of those issues, vowing to \u201cdismantle Obamacare on Day 1,\u201d and calling, in 1989, for the restoration of the death penalty after five teenagers were arrested in the rape of a jogger in Central Park. (They were convicted but later cleared of the charges.)Just as Mr. Trump was opening Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in the early 1980s, Mr. Feeney was a few blocks away in Makem\u2019s pub, thinking about the first big checks he would write for charity, on the condition that his identity not be disclosed. \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever meeting Trump,\u201d Mr. Feeney said last week.Advertisement"}

Yet the same sentiment that leads Israeli Jews to treat soldiers as \u201ceverybody\u2019s children\u201d has also led many to call for a pardon for Sergeant Azaria, creating tension between the people and the commanders of their army.\u201cThe motherly protection of soldiers sometimes overcomes your basic value system,\u201d Mr. Ben Meir said, adding that the instinct to protect soldiers was not particular to Israel.The soldiers targeted by the Palestinian truck driver on Sunday were in officer training programs, and most were not preparing for combat roles. Many were in the educational corps or training for administrative jobs on the home front. On a routine educational tour of Jerusalem, they were caught off-guard as they disembarked from buses at a popular observation spot with panoramic views of Old City.The truck driver plowed into one group, then reversed and came back to claim more victims. A tour guide who shot at the truck with his pistol complained on television that the soldiers were better equipped with M-16s but had hesitated to shoot.Noam Kedar, one of the soldiers at the scene, denounced those who passed instant judgment.The military\u2019s preliminary findings were that two soldiers had fired at the driver; it remained unclear on Monday whether he had been killed by them or by civilians who opened fire. The defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said that any attempt to link Sunday\u2019s events to the Azaria verdict had no basis.One squad commander at the scene said she had instructed her forces to run for cover after determining that enough soldiers were already running toward the truck. There were also concerns, according to officers in the field, that too many people shooting could cause a \u201cfriendly fire\u201d accident.The four soldiers who were killed, all promoted posthumously, were identified as Lt. Yael Yekutiel, 20, from Givatayim, near Tel Aviv; Second Lt. Erez Orbach, 20, from Alon Shvut, in the West Bank; Lt. Shir Hajaj, 22, from Ma\u2019ale Adumim in the West Bank; and Second Lt. Shira Tzur, 20, from Haifa.\u201cThese are our children,\u201d Herzl Hajaj, Shir Hajaj\u2019s father, told the Israeli news media Sunday after hearing of his daughter\u2019s death. \u201cWe send them to the army; we know they might not return.\u201dThe Azaria case, regarding a shooting in the West Bank city of Hebron last March that was caught on video, unleashed its own kind of friendly fire and fury.General Eisenkot had drawn criticism for saying in a speech a day before the Azaria verdict that an 18-year-old in the army was not \u201ceverybody\u2019s child,\u201d but a soldier and a fighter with a mission.\u201cGadi, Gadi, beware, Rabin is looking for a friend,\u201d the protesters sang, referring to Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister of Israel who was assassinated in 1995 by a right-wing Jewish extremist.The three judges who formed the military tribunal were placed under guard.The backlash was not long in coming, and was equally charged. The popular Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper gathered half a dozen former chiefs of staff and photographed them for Sunday\u2019s front page, with the headline: \u201cBehind you, Gadi.\u201dDays earlier, an army reservist who is well known to Israelis \u2014 as are many war heroes \u2014 captured national attention with a plea for unity after the Azaria verdict.\u201cI cried,\u201d he wrote, \u201cover the hands that I left in Gaza and I asked myself perhaps for the first time in my life, was it worth fighting for a nation that hates itself?\u201dMr. Shilon announced plans to sit in Tel Aviv\u2019s Rabin Square \u2014 named for the prime minister who was slain there in 1995 \u2014 on Saturday night with a huge placard calling to bring back solidarity and mutual respect, even if he had to sit there alone. Instead, he was joined by thousands.Micah Goodman, an American-Israeli Jewish philosopher, said that the Israelis\u2019 \u201cautomatic identification\u201d with soldiers sometimes led to \u201cirrational\u201d results.\u201cHaving that soft spot for soldiers is part of the Israeli solidarity, and it is part of what is really unique about Israel,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. \u201cThe weakness of Israel is also part of the power of Israel.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But lately its wireless speaker has lost ground to an unexpected competitor, Amazon\u2019s Echo.Now it faces another challenge: a change in the corner office. After 14 years leading the company he helped found, John MacFarlane has resigned as chief executive of Sonos and has been replaced by one of his deputies, Patrick Spence.Mr. MacFarlane, 50, has also left the company\u2019s board of directors, though he will remain an employee to help mentor colleagues and work on other projects. He said he left the board so Mr. Spence would not feel like he was always looking over his shoulder.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be that founder who\u2019s always second-guessing,\u201d Mr. MacFarlane said.Sonos is a rarity among technology companies, started in 2002 at a time when independent hardware companies in consumer electronics, an industry dominated by much bigger players, were hard to find. Mr. MacFarlane did not take venture capital money for several years and kept the company private, shunning the usual routine of selling shares to the public or being acquired by a bigger company.Sonos \u2014 based hundreds of miles away from the glare of Silicon Valley in the seaside town of Santa Barbara, Calif. \u2014 does not have the visibility of an Apple, Facebook or Uber. But it has amassed a loyal following with its family of wireless speakers, which allow people to play music streamed from internet services like Spotify or stored on a local computer.One of the secrets to Sonos\u2019s business is that once listeners become hooked on the sound from one of the company\u2019s speakers, they tend to buy more of them so they can simultaneously play music in multiple rooms in their homes.Mr. MacFarlane said he had planned to resign as chief executive earlier, citing his wife\u2019s bout with breast cancer and his aging parents as factors. But last year he delayed his plans when Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker unexpectedly began to eat into sales of Sonos speakers.While Echo has received mixed reviews for its sound quality, its Alexa voice assistant \u2014 which allows people to quickly play music with verbal commands \u2014 has captivated the tech industry and the public. More recently, Google introduced its own Echo competitor, Google Home, with a voice assistant.\u201cI fell into that trap where I\u2019ve been watching voice recognition for years,\u201d Mr. MacFarlane said. \u201cI tried Echo in the beginning and wrote it off. I had too many distractions at that time. I wasn\u2019t playing at the level I should have been playing at in all frankness.\u201dMr. MacFarlane said the company is in a better place than it was last year. The growth of streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, both of which work with its speakers, has helped stoke demand for Sonos products. The company said the number of households with Sonos speakers grew 20 percent this past holiday quarter from the same period the previous year.Mr. Spence, 42, said Sonos understands that its competition is no longer strictly the audio companies that it faced before. \u201cWith what Amazon and Google are doing, the world has changed completely,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re part of that new world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Race Against Fake News, Google and Facebook Stroll to the Starting Line", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google and Facebook have been taking steps to curb the number of false news articles propagated across their sites. On Wednesday, the Silicon Valley companies showed that they were still in the early stages of their battle to limit misinformation online.Yet taken together, the efforts showed how the fight against fake news remains a work in progress. Google\u2019s bans were a drop in the bucket compared with the almost two million publishers that use AdSense. Facebook\u2019s new measures were part of a continuing series of small experiments by the company to find out what worked best in displaying news to its users.\u201cWe genuinely asked Google and Facebook for \u2018moonshots,\u2019\u201d said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. \u201cWe appreciate the work, but based on the numbers, that\u2019s hardly even running in place.\u201dGoogle and Facebook have been in something of a no-win situation in recent months when it comes to fake news. Both companies have been grappling with a widespread backlash over how their sites may have spread rumors on a vast scale, and how little responsibility they take for any of the content that appears on their platforms. The issue came to a head after the American presidential election, when commentators accused Facebook in particular of swaying voters to President Trump through misleading and untrue news articles.Google\u2019s blog post on Wednesday was the first time the company explained the results of its moves against publishers that spread misinformation. The search giant said it reviewed 550 sites \u201csuspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations\u201d in November and December. It took action against 340 of those sites and kicked nearly 200 publishers off its network permanently.Before taking steps to thwart fake news publishers, Google had an existing policy that outlawed publishers of \u201cmisrepresentative content,\u201d such as websites peddling weight-loss schemes or counterfeit goods. It expanded this policy to include sites impersonating news organizations.Google said that its search algorithms fell short but that the company would continue to work to improve its results.The AdSense system is a major revenue driver for independent web publishers who rely on the network to deliver display advertising on their sites. The publishers are paid when a reader views or clicks on those ads, with a portion of the proceeds going to Google. AdSense is one of the largest advertising networks on the web with nearly two million publishers using the system.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the number of sites it has banned since November.Trending Topics is a feature on the social network that tells people what popular topics are being discussed on the site. Apart from more transparency around headlines, the changes to the feature on Wednesday included identifying popular topics through the number of publishers posting articles on Facebook about a piece of news, rather than engagement around a single article.\u201cToday\u2019s update may also help prevent hoaxes and fake news from appearing in Trending because the updated system identifies groups of articles shared on Facebook instead of relying solely on mentions of a topic,\u201d the company said in a blog post.Still, industry watchers remain skeptical about the efficacy of these moves.\u201cNothing drives clicks better than when the headline is exactly what people want to hear or believe,\u201d Ian Schafer, the chief executive and founder of Deep Focus, a digital advertising agency, referring specifically to Google. Mr. Schafer said that without significant changes to the economics and technology of online ads, banning individual sites would not produce change in the long run.An article on Thursday about steps by Google and Facebook to curb the number of false news articles on their sites misspelled the surname of the chief executive and founder of the digital advertising agency Deep Focus.

Her observations helped dispel the popular belief that insects spontaneously emerged from mud. The knowledge she collected over decades didn\u2019t just satisfy those curious about nature, but also provided valuable insights into medicine and science. She was the first to bring together insects and their habitats, including food they ate, into a single ecological composition.After years of pleasing a captivated audience across Europe with books of detailed descriptions and life-size\u00a0paintings of familiar insects, in 1699 she sailed with her daughter nearly 5,000 miles from\u00a0the Netherlands to South America to study insects in the jungles of what is now known as Suriname.

Shoddy reproductions of her work along with setbacks to women\u2019s roles in 18th-\u00a0and 19th-century Europe\u00a0resulted in her\u00a0efforts\u00a0being\u00a0largely\u00a0forgotten.\u201cIt was kind of stunning when she sort of dropped off into oblivion,\u201d said Dr. Etheridge.\u00a0\u201cVictorians started putting women in a box, and they\u2019re still trying to crawl out of it.\u201dThe results of her decades worth of careful observations were detailed paintings and descriptions of European insects, followed by\u00a0unconventional\u00a0visuals and stories of insects, amphibians and reptiles from a land\u00a0that\u00a0most at the time could only imagine.It\u2019s possible\u00a0Merian\u00a0used a magnifying glass to capture the detail of the split tongues of sphinx moths depicted in this painting. She wrote that the two tongues combine to form one tube for drinking nectar. Some criticized this detail later, saying there was just one tongue, but\u00a0Merian\u00a0wasn\u2019t wrong. She may have observed the adult moth just as it emerged from its pupa. For a brief moment during that stage of its life\u00a0cycle, the tongue consists of two half-tubules before merging into one.\u201cAll of these things shook up their nice, neat little view,\u201d\u00a0Dr. Etheridge\u00a0said.In this same plate,\u00a0Merian depicted and described leaf-cutter ants for the first time.\u201cIn America there are large ants which can eat whole trees bare as a broom handle in a single night,\u201d she wrote in the description.Merian\u00a0noted how the ants took the leaves below ground to their young. And she wouldn\u2019t have known this at the time, but the ants use the leaves to farm fungi underground to feed their developing larvae.Merian was correct about the bird-eating tarantula, ants building bridges with their bodies and other details. But in the same drawing, she incorrectly lumped together army and leaf-cutter ants. And instead of showing just the typical pair of eggs in a hummingbird nest, she painted four. She made other mistakes in\u00a0\u201cMetamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium\u201d\u00a0as well: not every caterpillar and butterfly matched.Perhaps one explanation for her mistakes is that she cut\u00a0short\u00a0her Suriname\u00a0trip\u00a0after getting sick, and completed the book at home in Amsterdam. And errors are common among some of history\u2019s most-celebrated scientific minds, too.Merian also made note of the help she received from the natives of Suriname, as well\u00a0as\u00a0slaves or servants that assisted her (she was not a slave\u00a0owner). In some instances she wrote moving passages that included her helpers in descriptions. As she wrote in her description of the peacock flower:The Indians, who are not treated well by their Dutch masters, use the seeds to abort their children, so that they will not become slaves like themselves. The black slaves from Guinea and Angola have demanded to be well treated, threatening to refuse to have children. In fact, they sometimes take their own lives because they are treated so badly, and because they believe they will be born again, free and living in their own land. They told me this themselves.\u201cShe was ahead of her time,\u201d\u00a0Dr. Etheridge\u00a0said.________An illustration of the metamorphosis of the tiger moth with an earlier version of this article carried an incorrect credit.

{"Headline": "A Turntable Reborn Turns Its Back on Its Hip-Hop Legacy", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported byUTSUNOMIYA, Japan \u2014 In the sofa-appointed listening room of a factory north of Tokyo, hi-fi fans can listen to vintage vinyl records on a sound system costing $45,000, including a sleek silver turntable. Musical choices include rock \u2014 the Eagles\u2019 \u201cHotel California,\u201d sounding warm and vivid through four-foot-tall speakers \u2014 jazz and classical.Not on the menu: hip-hop.Or disco. Or the thumping, floor-convulsing sounds of modern techno or house music, which helped make the record player at the center of this audiophile\u2019s paradise famous.The turntable, the Technics SL-1200, may not enjoy the name recognition of, say, Fender electric guitars or Steinway pianos. But if you have watched a D.J. scratching furiously behind a rapper in the last few decades, you have almost certainly seen one, or, more likely, a deftly manipulated pair.\u201cAt the after-party for \u2018Hip-Hop Evolution,\u2019 the club had another brand,\u201d Mr. Wheeler recalled during a phone interview, in a tone that suggested both mystification and embarrassment. \u201cThe D.J. looked at me and said, \u2018What the hell, Darby, no 1200s?\u2019\u201dThat legacy seems like an easy sales hook for the Panasonic Corporation of Japan, which has reintroduced the turntable to great fanfare.Panasonic has chosen mostly to ignore it.\u201cOur concept is analog records for hi-fi listening,\u201d said Hiro Morishita, a creative director at Technics. \u201cD.J.s are fine, too, but as a marketing target it\u2019s problematic. We don\u2019t want to sell the 1200 as the best tool for D.J.ing. The 1200 is the 1200.\u201dIt is a dilemma most marketers would long for: a product with a built-in fan base and perhaps too much cultural cachet. For all their passion, Panasonic calculated, the SL-1200\u2019s core customers were not numerous enough, or rich enough, to make reviving the Technics brand financially worthwhile. It needed to reach wealthy, older audiophiles who would spend extravagantly on gear \u2014 not only the turntable, but also the amplifier, speakers and other equipment that the company markets alongside it.And too few such people, it figured, appreciate the finer points of hip-hop.Panasonic admits it struggled with how to acknowledge the SL-1200\u2019s history and fans.\u201cThere was a lot of debate,\u201d Mr. Morishita said. \u201cWould we keep the name? Would we change the design?\u201d In the end, he said, the company decided the turntable was too iconic to change drastically. The latest version, the SL-1200G, has an upgraded motor and a few other touches, but is otherwise the same as the players that Technics made in decades past.The main difference is in the marketing. Instead of sponsoring D.J. contests, Technics has hired a German classical pianist, Alice Sara Ott, to be its \u201cglobal brand ambassador\u201d and provided an SL-1200G to Abbey Road Studios, of Beatles fame. Serene connoisseurship, not sweaty nightclubs, is the theme.\u201cListening to records is like tea ceremony, or flower arranging,\u201d said Michiko Ogawa, director of the Technics division. She added that music recorded by live musicians showed off Technics\u2019s hi-fi qualities best.\u201cIt\u2019s unusual in that you\u2019ve had relatively positive associations and decided to disown that,\u201d said Ravi Dhar, a professor of marketing at Yale.\u201cWhen the brand already has an image that is associated with certain groups, if you try to move away from it, it\u2019s risky,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for them, the associations weren\u2019t positive for the market they\u2019re targeting.\u201dSome famous users have been harsher. \u201cThey never really gave support to the D.J. community,\u201d Jeffrey Allen Townes, better known as DJ Jazzy Jeff, said in a Facebook post after the revival announcement, criticizing Panasonic for high prices and for ignoring the consumers who stuck by the SL-1200 during vinyl\u2019s lean years.The SL-1200 was first made in the 1970s, and while plenty of other record players have come and gone, none are as central to the global culture of hip-hop and dance music.In 2008, Panasonic said it was closing its Technics audio division and would discontinue most of the division\u2019s products. Turntables seemed like a particular extravagance, since hardly anyone listened to records anymore. Panasonic dismantled the SL-1200 assembly line and converted the factory to other uses, including an experimental vegetable farm.For die-hard fans, the decision was a blow. Prices of used SL-1200s jumped. Devotees urged Panasonic to bring the machine back, starting an online petition that eventually collected more than 27,000 names.\u201cThe D.J.s of the world almost unanimously recognized that here was the perfect record player,\u201d said Tony Prince, director of DMC World, which organizes the long-running D.J. competition that Mr. Oakley won. The turntable\u2019s stability, ruggedness and responsiveness to coaxing fingers are hard to replicate on newer gear like CD players or iPads \u2014 as is the look of spinning on authentic old-school decks. Many pros kept using older SL-1200 models, often with specially designed adapters so they could play digital music files alongside their records.\u201cThere\u2019s just something about the look and feel of 1200s,\u201d said Richard Quitevis, a.k.a. D.J. Qbert, an American former world champ who estimates he owns 20 older models, mostly received through sponsorships. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s bought the new one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s mostly for collectors.\u201dPanasonic emphasizes the effort that goes into making the turntables, which are now produced at a different factory about two hours from Tokyo. Only 20 are assembled a day, with most of the work done by hand. Each unit\u2019s record platter is checked by lasers and human workers to ensure perfect balance. A specially developed machine drills tiny holes at strategic points in the undersides until they spin just right. These days, such deliberately crafted products are simply too costly to compete for a mass market.\u201cWe brought the 1200 back just in time,\u201d Mr. Morishita said. \u201cWe\u2019re very familiar with digital products now, but the know-how for this kind of precision mechanical work is disappearing.\u201dThe company does not disclose sales numbers, but said an initial set of 300 special-edition SL-1200Gs, made available online when sales restarted this year, sold out in 30 minutes. Even at nearly $3,000, the turntable may not make any money for Panasonic, instead serving as a loss leader for other Technics products.\u201cI understand why they\u2019ve done it, even if it\u2019s disappointing,\u201d Mr. Oakley said of Technics\u2019s marketing strategy. \u201cAt least I\u2019ve learned how to repair my old ones.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was struck by a thought: Why not spend time getting to know the river? \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all know how it looks inside the city,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Markowski. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOutside the city, it was a mystery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He used Google Maps to virtually explore terrain and structures. Then he spent hours reading small publications from each town and village to identify interesting people and events he might photograph. When he was ready to shoot, he began with one agenda: Make images that were \u00e2\u0080\u009cas weird as visually possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And weird they are. In one (slide 8), a man wades in a clumpy swamp created by the Brda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waters. The man told Mr. Markowski that after he accidentally cut off the tip of his finger, regular dips helped it grow back \u00e2\u0080\u0094 much to his doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprise.

Today, the turret is lodged in an empty field not far from the water.As a second layer to these oddities, Mr. Markowski provides offbeat captions that are longer and more humorous than your typical who, what, when, where and why. One of his photos (slide 16) shows a grinning man reclining in a lawn chair while dressed in mock-Napoleonic garb. Behind him is an RV and wet underwear hanging from a line. In the caption, Mr. Markowski tells us of a local rumor that has it that Napoleon and his men once crossed the Brda near Drzewicz in 1810. The man pictured is a tourist, and often travels to the river\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge to take part in re-enactments.

{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Extreme Right Challenges Guilt Over Nazi Past ", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byDRESDEN, Germany \u2014 At a chandelier-lit beer hall on Tuesday evening, the lean blond man\u2019s voice boomed out over a crowd of hundreds \u2014 some middle-aged and working-class, but with a contingent of polished young professionals.\u201cThe AfD is the last revolutionary, the last peaceful chance for our fatherland,\u201d declared the man, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, referring to the political party Alternative for Germany, and employing a reverential term for Germany, one of several nationalist buzzwords usually shunned in the country\u2019s politics.\u201cJawohl!\u201d a few shouted. \u201cYes!\u201dWhen Mr. H\u00f6cke (pronounced HOOK-ay) lamented that \u201cGerman history is handled as rotten and made to look ridiculous\u201d \u2014 a subtle but clear reference to guilt for the Holocaust and other Nazi war crimes \u2014 the crowd responded by chanting, \u201cDeutschland, Deutschland.\u201dHis speech at the rally in Dresden on Tuesday touched off a wave of national alarm by challenging Germany\u2019s national atonement for the Holocaust and for its Nazi crimes. His comments drew broad criticism for their venom and because Mr. H\u00f6cke, a rising star in the AfD, has found growing success with his messages of extreme nationalism.Shouting to be heard over cheering supporters, many of whom stood, Mr. H\u00f6cke challenged the collective national guilt over the war that has restrained German politics for three generations. At times he used language that seemed to hint at lamenting Nazi Germany\u2019s defeat.Germans were \u201cthe only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital,\u201d he said, referring to a memorial to murdered Jews in Berlin. He added that Germans had the \u201cmentality of a totally vanquished people.\u201dMr. H\u00f6cke, who began his speech by triumphantly raising his arms over his head, represents the rightward flank of Alternative for Germany, an already far-right party.The chairman of the Green Party for the state of Saxony, J\u00fcrgen Kasek, on Twitter called for the speech to be checked for possible violations of anti-incitement laws. He accused Mr. H\u00f6cke of saying things that violated the spirit of the Constitution \u201cin the style of national socialism.\u201dThe Central Council of Jews in Germany, in a statement, called the comments \u201cdeeply deplorable and fully unacceptable.\u201d Charlotte Knobloch, a former president of the council, told the newspaper Stimme Heilbronner that Mr. H\u00f6cke\u2019s speech was \u201cunbearable agitation,\u201d and she warned that \u201cthe AfD is poisoning the political culture and social debate in Germany.\u201dMr. H\u00f6cke\u2019s comments even drew a rebuke from the chairwoman of Alternative for Germany, Frauke Petry, who said they were out of line and \u201cstraining\u201d the party. Ms. Petry and Mr. H\u00f6cke have been locked in a power struggle for months over how far to the right to position the party, which was originally founded on an anti-euro platform.Those 20-somethings, many in coat and tie, looked clean-cut and primly trendy. Most of the men wore their hair buzzed close on the sides and long and floppy on top, separated by a severe side parting that seemed unmistakably evocative of Hitler\u2019s.Mainstream parties in Germany have long eschewed charisma-driven politics \u2014 in the style of personality-centered movements \u2014 and have avoided shows of overt nationalism. But that leaves an opening: A populist party like Alternative for Germany can indulge those ideas just enough to excite its supporters without scaring off larger groups of voters.The Alternative for Germany supporters who were gathered in Dresden, the capital of Saxony, seemed animated in a way that is unusual when it comes to modern politics in Germany. Most Germans rarely feel allowed to get excited about their political beliefs or, just as sensitive an issue, about their national identity.The atmosphere lent the evening a feeling of thrilling transgression, as if the act of cheering half-forbidden ideas was as important, or perhaps more so, than the ideas themselves.Julian M. W\u00e4lder, a 21-year-old law student, said he had initially joined the youth league of the Christian Democratic Union, the center-right party to which Chancellor Angela Merkel belongs. But the party did not feel like \u201creal politics,\u201d he said.Alternative for Germany, Mr. W\u00e4lder said, finally felt genuine. This is a core part of the party\u2019s message: While other parties are all the same, only Alternative for Germany really expresses the popular will.Mr. W\u00e4lder and other young attendees seemed tense \u2014 the location of the gathering was kept secret until that morning in a failed attempt to avoid the anti-fascist protesters who often gather outside the semiregular rallies \u2014 but they were jovial. The rally on Tuesday felt, if not like a watershed, then a glimpse of a wider, more gradual change.Calls for asserting a strong national identity are not pernicious on their own \u2014 all nations have identities, after all \u2014 but they remain somewhat taboo in Germany. And that taboo is precisely the point. Only the fringes would be brazen enough to champion a nationalist identity. But that risks letting those fringes define its contours.Mr. H\u00f6cke called Mr. Weizsacker\u2019s address \u201ca speech against his own people, and not for his own people.\u201dSince 2015, when Germany received nearly a million asylum seekers, Alternative for Germany has sought to portray national identity as under threat from migration and multiculturalism.Establishment parties and other enemies, Mr. H\u00f6cke told the crowd, \u201care liquidating our beloved German fatherland, like a piece of soap under warm running water. But we, we beloved friends, we patriots, we will close this open tap, and we will win back our Germany, piece by piece.\u201dAmid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.Politics in Germany usually play out in quiet, polite negotiations among members of the coalition, rather than in dramatic, public clashes between competing parties.The coalition blocks fringe parties like Alternative for Germany, which can then paint mainstream politics as an elite conspiracy to impose unpopular policies and to shut down real debate.The crowd, at one point, chanted a line Mr. W\u00e4lder has also used: \u201cWe are the outsiders.\u201d It was a jarring moment, as many of the \u201coutsiders\u201d were young, white and wore suits and ties \u2014 seemingly the definition of an insider in Germany.Because these young Germans say that the political establishment has denied them sufficient pride in their national identity, they feel as if they are being oppressed, even though they have every right and live in a country that has one of Europe\u2019s best-performing economies.But young and old supporters of Alternative for Germany seemed to find something at Tuesday\u2019s rally that is not common among far-right politics: a sense of impending victory. Not in the sense that they would oust Ms. Merkel\u2019s government this fall \u2014 she is likely to retain power \u2014 but in the belief that their movement would quickly shape and perhaps one day overcome a system that they see as denying them their German pride.Mr. Mounk said that the rise of extremist voices may have been inevitable, given the failure of mainstream parties to satisfy the desires for national self-esteem and for charismatic politics.That left an opening for Mr. H\u00f6cke to deliver a message \u201cbeyond the usual gripes about being too ashamed of being German,\u201d Mr. Mounk added, \u201cimplying, though never quite stating outright, that defeat in 1945 was a bad thing.\u201dMr. H\u00f6cke concluded his speech on Tuesday with a rallying call. \u201cBeloved friends, we must do little less than make history, so that there will be for us Germans, us Europeans, a future,\u201d he said, as the audience stood, cheered and chanted his name.He added, \u201cWe can make history, and we are doing it.\u201dShane Thomas McMillan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The books are a balancing act. Primarily written in a way so as not to insult the intelligence of literary self-help seekers, they also want to keep you from fearing that certain things in life might just permanently not be O.K. Concerned but cozy, they have titles like \u201cHow to Stay Sane\u201d and \u201cHow to Deal With Adversity.\u201dNow comes Eva Hoffman\u2019s \u201cHow to Be Bored,\u201d in keeping with the brand. Woolf is in here, as are Kierkegaard, Rousseau and Sartre, among other distinguished life coaches. But it\u2019s also one of the more confounding entries in the series.The book\u2019s title starts the trouble. Being bored is not something you do, it\u2019s something that happens to you, envelops you like unexpected weather. You can get out of it, but you can hardly get into it. The \u201cboredom\u201d part of the book\u2019s focus could be better labeled \u201cHow to Make the Most of Down Time.\u201d But Ms. Hoffman touches so many bases \u2014 how we should approach culture, talk therapy, human contact, creative work \u2014 that she could have chosen from a thousand titles.On the clock, we\u2019re overworked to the point that companies like Google are enforcing naps and other breaks to increase efficiency. \u201cI must admit,\u201d Ms. Hoffman writes, \u201cthat the idea of napping or meditating on cue in order to work better in the afternoon fills me with slight dread.\u201d Agreed.Speaking of meditation, she also expresses a healthy skepticism for the Western world\u2019s embrace of mindfulness. Meditation can be good for temporary relief, she argues, but it doesn\u2019t change the fundamental stresses that keep us feeling such a desperate need to meditate.The most philosophically vexing problem she recognizes is \u201cthe temptations of plenitude and the problems of freedom.\u201d We\u2019re led to believe that we have a paralyzingly large number of prospective romantic partners or career choices or recreation options. And we face these forking paths without a compass; the acceptance of increasingly diverse lifestyles and values leave us with \u201cfew common criteria for making important life choices.\u201dSo what about boredom, again?It\u2019s best to stop expecting the book to be about that. Ms. Hoffman does.She barrels ahead into solutions for our paradoxically harried ennui, including close listening to Mozart and keeping a diary. She also strongly suggests we get off the devices. Technology, a mixed blessing to be sure, is here a towering straw man, responsible for much of our unhappiness.\u201cOur coexistence with digital devices has affected our patience and shortened the span of our attention,\u201d runs a typical sentence. She bemoans \u201cthe segmentation of thought encouraged by digital technologies,\u201d \u201cthe constant barrage of external stimuli,\u201d and the \u201cvirtual knowledge\u201d we get from \u201cthe flat spaces of computer screens and via abbreviated communications.\u201dShe\u2019s a fan of \u201cauthentic human contact,\u201d but worries that by texting and Facebook messaging so often, \u201cwe may be losing track of what such contact is, or how we can achieve it.\u201dTechnology proselytizers could simply dismiss Ms. Hoffman as a \u201cget off my lawn\u201d type, and she might even embrace the label. But even this reader, a lip-service Luddite who\u2019s tired of interacting with his iPhone first thing each morning, thought Ms. Hoffman was making the case against technology sound too easy. There are dozens of unexamined assumptions in this book, about what humans are built for, how they best thrive.And though Ms. Hoffman is mostly a lucid writer, she can lapse into fogginess, repeating the importance, for instance, of knowing ourselves in \u201cthree dimensions.\u201d And there are a few low-calorie gnostic pronouncements: \u201cWe need to think inwards, and to think from within.\u201dMany of us would agree, vigorously, with Ms. Hoffman about the problems we share. But her analysis of those problems, and her proposed solutions for them, are a bit boring.Advertisement"}

She stepped out of line, breaking with the silent, smiling solidarity that defines the 92-year-old institution, to denounce the idea of celebrating a man with a well-established history of objectifying women.In a rare collision of presidential politics and a venerable arts organization, current and former Rockettes find themselves in a new kind of spotlight \u2014 a position both painful and empowering \u2014 as they take sides over the inauguration, a split illustrating the cultural divide that President-elect Trump has cleaved through the country.\u201cWe are a group of women that is encouraging young girls to be strong, independent women, to fulfill their dreams, to go for it,\u201d Ms. Pearl, 27, said in her first interview since the inaugural uproar began. \u201cIt\u2019s about women\u2019s rights.\u201dBut Patty DeCarlo Grantham, the president of the Rockette Alumnae Association, which has about 550 members, said that many of them are upset about the furor and support the Rockettes performing at the inauguration, as they did in 2001 and 2005.\u201cSo many people wrote to me and said, \u2018I feel so ashamed about what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Grantham, 76. \u201cWe feel like it\u2019s a great honor to be asked to dance.\u201dBest known as a Christmastime tourist attraction at Radio City Music Hall, the Rockettes are also regarded in artistic circles as some of the finest dancers in New York City. But the controversy has reignited sensitivities within the corps that they are seen as beauty pageant contestants more than skilled performers and that they are easy to lampoon. On last weekend\u2019s episode of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Alec Baldwin, portraying Mr. Trump, said of the inauguration lineup, \u201cBest of all, we\u2019ve got the one Rockette with the least money in her savings.\u201dDottie Earle-DeLuca, a 54-year-old former Rockette, said, \u201cHere you have the most sophisticated women that are so well respected in this country.\u201d She added, \u201cTo put them on the same stage as this man, to me, is reprehensible.\u201dThe individual Rockettes had no say in the inauguration booking: It was ultimately the decision of James L. Dolan, the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Company, which manages the Rockettes. Mr. Dolan is a longtime friend of Mr. Trump and donated to his campaign; he has supported both Democrats and Republicans in the past. A company spokesman, Barry Watkins, declined requests for interviews with Mr. Dolan and current leaders and members of the Rockettes.Mr. Watkins, in response to written questions about the Rockettes as well as the inauguration performance, wrote by email, \u201cThe New York Times has had an anti-Donald Trump agenda for quite some time and now the Rockettes are on the receiving end of their bias.\u201dThis article is based on interviews over the last three weeks with Ms. Pearl, who was a Rockette until this month, and nine former Rockettes, as well as others in the extended Rockette organization. Several people spoke anonymously for fear that if they were to speak publicly, the Madison Square Garden Company would take legal action against them.That sort of attention came as a shock within the world of the Rockettes, which is devoted to a particular kind of team-driven synchronicity, where no one person dominates the stage.A Radio City Rockette is a specialist in precision dance technique, a rare, regimented and intricate style that requires both athleticism and artistry. Rockettes must stand between 5-foot-6 and 5-foot-10-and-a-half and uphold a standard of elegance, along with an expertise in tap, modern dance, jazz and ballet. They must hit positions with military exactitude. It\u2019s a style that requires a dancer to step into a line \u2014 not to take over and not to be left behind. It takes fortitude and humility.\u201cYou don\u2019t realize how much individuality you have as a dancer until you\u2019re asked to dance like 35 other women,\u201d said Jessica McRoberts, 39, a former Rockette. \u201cThings down to your pinkie finger.\u201dUnder the leadership of Linda Haberman, who began directing and choreographing touring productions of the \u201cChristmas Spectacular\u201d in 1993, the Rockettes gained artistic respect and became modernized with more challenging choreography. Ms. Haberman left the organization in 2014 and declined a request for comment. Despite requests, the Madison Square Garden Company did not make the troupe\u2019s current director, Karen Keeler, available for interviews.The rigors of performing and traveling as a company often allow dancers to form close and lasting bonds, according to Ms. Grantham, the alumnae president, who was a Rockette from 1959 until 1970.Ms. Grantham said that the Rockettes have a long history of performing for presidents and at events in New York City hosted by both Republicans and Democrats.\u201cOne time we did benefits for both parties in one night,\u201d she said. \u201cOne was at the Sheraton, and the other was at the Hilton.\u201dThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time the Rockettes performed for a controversial president, but the volatile media climate surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration is unusual. Rhonda Malkin, a former Rockette who worked as a personal trainer to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner for two years, said that the Trump and Kushner families were supportive of her career as a Rockette. Once, they attended a performance to see her dance.\u201cI think they would like to see the Rockettes perform at the inauguration,\u201d she said of the Trump family. \u201cWhether or not that causes a rift throughout the brand is yet to be seen.\u201dMs. Malkin, 38, said that several of the current Rockettes she knows are upset that a crew of 13 full-time Rockettes were initially told by their union, the American Guild of Variety Artists, that they would be forced to perform.\u201cThere are some career Rockettes who are very upset about this,\u201d Ms. Malkin said of the inauguration plans. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard the women of color are very upset. From what I have heard, it has just caused a real rift in the company.\u201dMs. Malkin, who was a Rockette for 12 years, said Ms. Pearl \u201ctook a real risk\u201d for speaking out, but she doubts that the controversy surrounding the inauguration has caused any lasting damage to the brand.\u201cI would honestly say that the majority of our audience members are white Christian conservative people,\u201d Ms. Malkin said. \u201cAnd those folks probably supported Trump.\u201dOf Mr. Dolan, the Madison Square Garden chairman, she added, \u201cHe knows those are the people who buy tickets to those shows.\u201dWhile the Rockettes are an American symbol \u2014 as much as Radio City Music Hall or Mr. Trump and his branded buildings \u2014 the group\u2019s individual dancers remain fairly anonymous. They don\u2019t speak unless deemed interview-appropriate by the Madison Square Garden Company, which has fiercely protected them against criticism surrounding the inauguration.\u201cFor a while we weren\u2019t allowed to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be on the \u2018Today\u2019 show with the Rockettes tomorrow morning,\u2019\u201d said Naomi Kakuk, 40, a former Rockette. \u201cYou\u2019d say: \u2018Watch the \u2018Today\u2019 show tomorrow \u2014 you might see a familiar face.\u2019 We couldn\u2019t even say we were on a show that was promoting the show.\u201dMr. Dolan has been criticized for making the inauguration deal and guarding the Rockettes from media requests, but several former dancers praised his management style, which include generous benefits. Being a Rockette is among the most lucrative jobs a dancer can get in New York, complete with year-round health insurance even though the company performs on a seasonal basis.Ms. Kakuk, who loved her time as a Rockette, said, \u201cYou get six months of pay for three months of work, and it is six months\u2019 worth of work in three months because it\u2019s so incredibly intense.\u201dShe added that some of the dancers live in New York during the Christmas show and then go home to Wisconsin or Florida to teach. \u201cYou have insurance for the year, you have a great paycheck, you do all these fun gigs and side things, and you\u2019re doing the show and dancing on the great stage,\u201d Ms. Kakuk said. \u201cYou\u2019re skinny as hell when you get out. You\u2019re bikini ready in January. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dCheryl Cutlip, who danced as a Rockette for 15 years and left the company in 2008, said that benefits were ushered in quickly after the TV company Cablevision bought Radio City Music Hall in 1997.Ms. Cutlip, 45, remembered Mr. Dolan meeting with the Rockettes to go over their basic needs. She said he gave them his personal email address. Soon, Rockettes no longer had to rush out of the door to find coffee and a bagel in the 20-minute space between performance preparations. \u201cHe started bringing food in,\u201d Ms. Cutlip said of Mr. Dolan. \u201cOnce he saw the practical needs of the Rockettes, he started meeting them.\u201dFor other former Rockettes, the current controversy reminded them of clashes between the dancers, their union and their corporate employer. Lora Pavilack, a former Rockette, said she had been locked out of the building twice, once for talking to the news media and, another time, during contentious negotiations over a union contract.\u201cThat\u2019s the culture,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s why they\u2019ve lined up with the president-elect.\u201dMs. Malkin said that she was also locked out with Ms. Pavilack during contract negotiations in 2005.Madison Square Garden officials declined to comment for this article, but they have said in the past that no one had been locked out during contract negotiations.More than enough Rockettes wanted to perform at the inaugural, but Ms. Kakuk also knows some who are not participating. \u201cI think some of them are done anyway,\u201d she said, \u201cand they were like, \u2018This is the last straw, I\u2019m out.\u2019\u201dMs. Pearl is one of them. On a recent evening, she ended weeks of silence by taking part in a toast to the First Amendment presented by the Bessies, or the New York Dance and Performance Awards.\u201cPeople have been calling me courageous,\u201d Ms. Pearl said at the toast, her voice cracking. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see it that way. I\u2019m just standing up for human rights.\u201dMany in the dance world, including Yvonne Rainer, the postmodern giant who was part of the toast, and several former Rockettes, including Ms. Kakuk, have voiced enthusiasm for Ms. Pearl\u2019s action and her talent as a dancer.\u201cWhen you see her onstage as a Rockette, you watch her,\u201d Ms. Kakuk said. \u201cShe\u2019s outspoken but less so than others. It was a bit of a surprise.\u201dWith the latest holiday season behind her, Ms. Pearl has decided to leave the organization and forge a path in film and television. She found inspiration in the actress Meryl Streep, who spoke out against Mr. Trump at the Golden Globes.\u201cShe can speak freely,\u201d Ms. Pearl said. \u201cI wish to have the opportunity to speak as freely as I can, without any repercussion.\u201dBut stepping out of the line is just not the Rockettes\u2019 way.\u201cUsually artists are more outspoken,\u201d Ms. Kakuk said, \u201cbut Rockettes as a brand is not very outspoken. You work for a giant corporation, and a lot of girls don\u2019t realize that. They just think they\u2019re dancing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Inauguration: A Day of Ceremony, Protests and Celebration", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byInauguration Briefing\u25a0 President Trump\u2019s era on the government web began almost immediately with the wiping out of Obama-era initiatives and a new brand of policy pronouncement. But two sides can play that game.\u25a0 As Mr. Trump dined with dignitaries and members of Congress in the Capitol, the police skirmished with protesters, hurling flash-bang grenades to drive them from the inauguration parade route.\u25a0 Hillary Clinton, who won the popular vote by nearly three million but lost the presidency, was on hand for her former rival\u2019s swearing-in at the Capitol.Mr. Obama clarified last year that he wanted the King bust in the Oval Office \u201cto remind me of all the hard work of a lot of people who would somehow allow me to have the privilege of holding this office.\u201d But he said he also kept the Churchill bust nearby, just outside his private office in the second-floor White House residence.Hours after the Senate confirmed James. N. Mattis as secretary of defense and John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security, President Trump signed their commissions in the Oval Office. Vice President Mike Pence swore in both generals in his ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, across from the West Wing.Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general, issued a statement to the Defense Department casting the United States as a bulwark of the international order and the guardian of important alliances. He vowed the Pentagon would work \u201cfor an America that remains a steady beacon of hope for all mankind.\u201d\u201cRecognizing that no nation is secure without friends, we will work with the State Department to strengthen our alliances,\u201d Mr. Mattis added.In tone and substance, Mr. Mattis\u2019s short statement, like his congressional testimony last week, seemed intended to reassure partners abroad. It also appeared at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s populist vision of putting America first at the expense of longtime allies.29 PhotosIt didn\u2019t take long.\u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve been held back by burdensome regulations on our energy industry. President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years.\u201d\u201cPeace through strength will be at the center of that foreign policy. This principle will make possible a stable, more peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.\u201dFor some of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, hope for that @POTUS handle is high. They want him to stop using the handle he\u2019s had since he joined Twitter, @realDonaldTrump, and accept staff management of the official account.But Mr. Trump relishes the freedom and direct-contact he has over Twitter, and he has continued using his personal account, with a staff member tweeting from it even as he was signing the official nominations of his Cabinet appointees after the swearing-in.Many supporters and protesters scrambled to find a spot along the parade route to get a glimpse of President Trump. Near the White House on 15th and G, a small group of people wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats gathered behind tall metal barricades and layers of security.\u201cWell, we didn\u2019t realize we needed tickets,\u201d Lisa Ross, a new Washington resident, said. \u201cWe still wanted to come and see what the inauguration is all about.\u201dMadeline Valentine, arriving at the barricade after running into multiple roadblocks, said it was pretty clear \u201cthey don\u2019t want us here.\u201dShe traveled to Washington from Detroit for the Women\u2019s March on Washington on Saturday, but said she wanted to witness inaugural festivities, too.\u201cI wanted to be here today to express my concerns for the nation,\u201d she said.As Mr. Trump grew closer, the apparent split in the crowd became evident: a pocket of pink pussycat hats and a pocket of red Trump hats.Protesters and police officers faced off in downtown Washington just hours after Mr. Trump was sworn into office, with the sound of flash-bang grenades echoing through cordoned-off streets and the smell of tear gas wafting through the air.As some protesters chanted, some in black face masks threw rocks and bricks at officers who responded with tear gas and flash grenades, trying to clear the streets. The police formed a line blocking off parts of K Street, the heart of Washington\u2019s lobbying district. But hundreds of people remained, and some started a small fire in the street.The protesters had struck first, hurling rocks at the police and hauling newspaper racks into the street.During his one and only news conference as president-elect, Mr. Trump said no one cared about his refusal to release his tax returns but reporters.President Trump\u2019s first official act as commander in chief was to pave the way for his defense secretary to be confirmed by the Senate.Then he had some fun passing out pens.Minutes after being sworn in at the Capitol, Mr. Trump went to the President\u2019s Room just off the Senate floor to sign a series of papers, including legislation cleared by Congress last week that provides a waiver for Gen. James N. Mattis from a legal requirement that military officers wait seven years before serving as defense secretary.Seated at a large table and surrounded by lawmakers from both parties, the newly minted president also signed nominations for the rest of his cabinet, joking with members of Congress as he cycled through a series of pens, one for each nominee, and asked them which ones they would like to keep.\u201cI\u2019ll give you Elaine \u2014 you want Elaine?\u201d Mr. Trump asked Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, apparently referring to Elaine Chao, his nominee for secretary of transportation. \u201cAre we getting some more pens back there?\u201d he asked moments later. \u201cThis is fun.\u201dMr. Trump also signed a proclamation for a national day of patriotism.There was no word from Mr. Trump\u2019s aides about whether he would issue any executive orders on his first day in office, although they have hinted that he would move immediately to roll back Obama administration policies on health care and immigration, among others.The Trump administration on Friday afternoon suspended a plan to reduce the fees that borrowers must pay on some federally backed mortgage loans.The Obama administration announced the cut last week in an effort to make homeownership more accessible to lower-income borrowers. A family that borrowed $200,000 would have saved $500 in annual fees. But Republicans had decried the change as risky.The fees cover the cost of defaults, so the change would have reduced the money available to cover such losses.Ajit Pai, a senior Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission, is expected to be named chairman of the agency, in what is expected to be the beginning of a period of regulatory unwinding, according to two sources familiar with the transition team\u2019s thinking.The main target will be net neutrality regulations that treat broadband providers like utilities and that forbid internet service providers from blocking or slowing websites.Mr. Pai is a veteran telecommunications lawyer, who has shifted in and out of government. He worked for Verizon from 2001 to 2003 and served as deputy general counselor at the F.C.C. from 2007 to 2011. In 2013, President Obama appointed him as a minority Republican commissioner.Mr. Pai has a drastically different view on competition in telecommunications than Mr. Wheeler. Mr. Pai has said web firms such as Google and Facebook are competitors to wireless, cable and broadcast companies in voice calls, messaging and streaming video. The F.C.C. under Mr. Wheeler, Mr. Pai said, strapped too many rules on internet service providers without providing real evidence that consumers were harmed without regulations.Although Mr. Pai is well liked by other Republicans in government, his impending appointment was greeted with much consternation by consumer groups.\u201cI\u2019m proud to attend with my husband and parents, all immigrants.\u201d \u201cWe will simply attend to witness the historic and peaceful transition of power that is the backbone of our republic.\u201d\u2014 Jennifer Lindrud, 54, North Oaks, Minn.\u201cBeing a member of the L.G.B.T.Q. community who supports Trump means that I\u2019m not just a single-issue voter. Trump represents a new era of the Republican Party.\u201d\u2014 Mark Meunier, 32, Springboro, OhioHillary Clinton, who amassed nearly three million votes more than Mr. Trump on Election Day but lost in the Electoral College, was on hand with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to watch the man who called her a \u201cnasty woman\u201d take the oath of office. She shook Mr. Trump\u2019s hand at the post-inauguration luncheon in the Capitol.As she was shown on a large screen on the National Mall, some in the crowd shouted, \u201cLock her up.\u201d They chanted, \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump.\u201dWhile crowd-size estimates were not immediately available, Washington\u2019s transit system released ridership numbers.As of 11 a.m., Metro logged 193,000. Four years ago, there were 317,000 at the same point on Inauguration Day. At Mr. Obama\u2019s first inauguration, the number was 513,000.On George W. Bush\u2019s second inauguration, 197,000 had taken the subway by 11 a.m.As Mr. Trump gave his inaugural address, one of the biggest cheers from the crowd came when he spoke about eradicating \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\u201cFinally, someone said it,\u201d a supporter shouted. That man was Mark Constantine, a lawyer from Yonkers.\u201cI\u2019ve never been to an inauguration before,\u201d Mr. Constantine said. \u201cBut I made a point about coming.\u201dNearby, Eric Metaxas, an evangelical writer and radio host from Manhattan who voted for Mr. Trump, said he was bothered by people who have protested the new president\u2019s administration.\u201cThe level of anger frightens me,\u201d Mr. Metaxas said. \u201cIt\u2019s not coming from the Trump side.\u201dOn Friday morning, just minutes before Mr. Trump was sworn in, news publications reflected the country\u2019s great division.\u201cWinter Comes,\u201d blared The Huffington Post, the left-leaning site founded by Arianna Huffington, in all capital letters.\u201cYes, this is really happening,\u201d BuzzFeed said briefly on its home page, in the lower right corner of its live video of the inauguration.By contrast, The Drudge Report, the conservative website known for its flashy headlines, struck a more optimistic tone with the headline, \u201cIt All Begins Today.\u201dBreitbart, the right-wing website that embraced Mr. Trump during the election campaign, was, perhaps surprisingly, the most subdued, going with the blandly factual \u201cThe Inauguration of President Donald Trump.\u201dFox News announced that Nigel Farage, the right-wing populist British leader who helped lead last year\u2019s Brexit campaign, would join the network as a regular contributor. The move grants Mr. Farage, who is friendly with Mr. Trump, a foothold on the country\u2019s most watched cable-news network, in a year of critical elections in Europe where right-wing groups are on the rise.As Mr. Trump gave his inaugural address, Madea Benjamin, a founder of the left-wing stunt protester group Code Pink, strode toward the dais in a section reserved for honored guests and journalists, pausing just below the president as she shouted that he was not a \u201clegitimate president.\u201dTwo Capitol Police officers quickly grabbed her and escorted her out.How she got that ticket, now that\u2019s a story.As Mr. Trump assumes the presidency, he and his senior aides have settled on a strategy to begin slowly unwinding regulations and policies from the Obama era, opting against the more sudden approach that some inside his team had recommended.The plan, as described by one senior Trump official, is \u201cmore rolling thunder than shock and awe.\u201dSome aides to Mr. Trump, including his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, had advised the president-elect to make a more dramatic show of his first few days in office, by signing a flurry of executive orders and making new policy pronouncements that would undo many of Mr. Obama\u2019s actions on immigration, wages, banking and the environment.But Mr. Trump has opted instead to let his plans trickle out over the next 30 days, this official said.He was encouraged to elaborate.It seems word had traveled to Catholic University, where he was a student, that the inaugural parade of 1953 needed bodies. My future father-in-law soon found himself standing alone, in cap and gown, on a long float crawling down Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 a nervous representation of Eisenhower\u2019s tenure as president of Columbia University.Intrigued, Nora searched online for a photograph of this odd moment, but only came up with that year\u2019s inaugural program. She then contacted Kathy Struss, the audio/visual archivist at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, Kan., to explain the situation: guy in cap and gown, on an inaugural float.The library has more than 330,000 photographs. Still, Ms. Struss, who has been with the library since 1977, faintly recalled the image, and began her cross-reference hunt. And there it was, a National Park Service photograph, preserved in a red-covered album that Eisenhower had given to his mother-in-law, Elivera M. Doud, as a birthday gift.And yes, that is Joe Trinity in cap and gown, aboard a float adorned with an inspirational banner (\u201cYouth is the Future of America \u2013 Eisenhower\u201d) and being pulled by a jeep bearing the name of the Young Republicans National Federation.This is particularly delicious, since my father-in-law, a retired public-school teacher, is a lifelong Democrat. His excuse: It paid a few bucks.DAN BARRY12 PhotosAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Ambivalence Toward Trump Turns to Anger", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Friday morning, Silicon Valley was largely ambivalent about President Trump. The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration.By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination.In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades.Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the 10th-richest man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He good-naturedly obliged.The tech companies\u2019 reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did.That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump\u2019s order proclaimed that \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d and would be suspended indefinitely.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said that his great-grandparents had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam.Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was \u201cnot the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201d Mr. Musk was born in South Africa.Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, \u201cthere was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is.\u201dBeyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world.\u201cAlmost every company\u2019s products \u2014 Google, Apple, Airbnb \u2014 has a global customer base,\u201d Mr. Levie said. \u201cThese policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors.\u201dBy early last week, the companies sensed trouble.Murtadha al-Tameemi, 24, an Iraqi-born software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out.\u201cIt may be my na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how politics and industries interact, but I don\u2019t interpret the tech community\u2019s opposition to the president as a political stance,\u201d Mr. Tameemi said. \u201cIt seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them.\u201dThe larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones.

But there is one capability for which I venerate this problematic rectangle. My iPhone has alerted me to a fuller range of human weirdness than I could ever have imagined.When I lie awake in bed at night, I do what many people do and let the Explore tab of Instagram whisk me away into a wonderland of bizarre self-expression and painstaking narcissism. I explore fascistic dietary regimens and admire women who have squatted or implanted their butts into a condition that would give R. Crumb a heart attack. I encounter the possibility of owning a pet squirrel. I observe Indonesian death rituals, 3-D latte \u201cart\u201d and garden hedges that people have groomed into the shape of elephants.In this way, a smartphone becomes the modern substitute for having an imagination. Most of us are seeking a specific feeling when we go on these idle internet journeys. The feeling varies from person to person and mood to mood. Sometimes we want to feel amazed (butts). Sometimes we want to feel amused (squirrels). Sometimes we want to feel contemptuous (fascistic diets). Sometimes we want to feel horny (butts again). But occasionally we discover something that transcends momentary satisfaction. Something compelling in its mystery. Something that provokes the investigative impulse to confirm whether or not the phenomenon is, as it were, \u201ca thing.\u201dThe Explore tab is your gateway to such oddities. To access this digital Narnia, you open up Instagram and tap the icon of a magnifying glass in your account. That leads you to an overwhelming grid of pictures and videos that renews endlessly by way of an algorithm that none of us will ever comprehend. \u201cPosts are selected automatically based on things like the people you follow or the posts you like,\u201d says the Instagram help page, which does not explain how my Explore page became cluttered with hedges and ritually desiccated corpses.But I\u2019m not complaining! Unlike the algorithms used by Amazon (which are sneaky) or Facebook (which abetted the spread of fake news), Instagram\u2019s Explore feature strikes me as refreshingly non-sinister. It provides curated randomness \u2014 a category that can exist only in an era of algorithms. The distance between what I like and what Instagram thinks I might like is oceanic, preposterous, deranged. And yet the algorithm is not wrong. I press the \u201clike\u201d button on a picture of my friend, and the Explore page shows me albino crocodiles. I comment on a cute dog, and the Explore page offers circus contortionists. Suddenly I like those things, too. Lurking inside my bland device is a fire hose of peculiarity that I can blast open whenever I choose.Using the same tools and creams I keep in my medicine cabinet, Bosco had retrofitted her face into an object with 180-degree rotational symmetry, which meant that it looked the same right side up as it did upside down. (Other items with this form of symmetry include parallelograms, the letter Z, and the New York Times crossword puzzle.) Her makeup was elaborate, and her features were expressionless; the face staring into the camera was as neutral as an Advil tablet. Bosco amazed me.The algorithm sensed my excitement. When I went back to the Explore page, it was populated with images of other young makeup artists who had executed the two-face look on themselves. (The look, it turns out, is a thing.) It wasn\u2019t merely the technical chops of the makeup artists that thrilled me, but the intensity and idiosyncrasy of their self-expression. Broadcasting the weird and obscure parts of your character has not historically been a favorite pastime of teenagers, but the internet has rendered that version of adolescence obsolete. In Bosco\u2019s world, trying too hard is not a sign of loserdom but a testament to focus. In this world, a person can spend seven hours alone in her room applying liquid latex over her eyebrows to a reception of 2,700 comments saying \u201cAwesome!\u201d in a variety of languages.If I hadn\u2019t landed on Bosco\u2019s account, I would have never experienced the reality of a rotationally symmetrical teenage face. I\u2019m aware that this is not a huge deal, or even a deal of any size. But Bosco is symbolic. D.I.Y. broadcast mediums like Instagram have ushered in a golden age of personal eccentricity. In the history of humanity, the vast spectrum of private weirdness has never been so public. People use (and in many cases, waste) their time in astonishing ways. It\u2019s inspiring. If it didn\u2019t exist, a science-fiction novelist would have to invent it: a magic button that grants access to a globe-size playpen of oddballs and misfits.Molly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine.

The company, a $12 billion athletic-wear maker, reported its slowest top-line growth in eight years and signaled more challenges ahead. Its chief financial officer is also bailing. The news wiped a quarter off the company\u2019s market value. And the chief executive\u2019s strategy of maintaining power is underperforming badly.Nearly two years ago, the chief executive, Kevin Plank, set out a plan worthy of Silicon Valley to ensure that he remained at the helm of the company he started in 1996. Under Armour changed its capital structure in a move not unlike Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, and Facebook, issuing nonvoting stock to offset sunset provisions that would have diluted Mr. Plank\u2019s control. He has 65 percent of the vote but only 15 percent of the economic stake, according to Under Armour\u2019s latest proxy.Investors did well in the first decade after the company\u2019s 2005 initial public offering as the split-adjusted stock soared more than sevenfold. But the shares have plummeted nearly 60 percent over the last 18 months, a period that closely overlaps with the new share scheme.During the fourth quarter, Under Armour\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth slowed drastically to 12 percent because of deep discounting caused by slower foot traffic. The company\u2019s signature compression shirts, which emphasize athletic performance, face growing competition from a slew of competitors. Nike, Adidas, Lululemon, Macy\u2019s, The Gap and J. Crew are just a few brands that are pushing their own athletic wear, as well as hoodies, yoga pants and the like. The absence of stores like the bankrupt Sports Authority that once carried the brand has also taken a toll.The forecast for 2017 doesn\u2019t inspire confidence. Under Armour said top-line growth was projected to increase about 12 percent, well below prior expectations of about 20 percent. Operating income and gross margins will slip this year too. Mr. Plank mentioned on a Tuesday call with investors that he now keeps whiteboards in his office with the operational mantra \u201cmake UA simple.\u201d Putting the focus back on performance rather than share classes would be a good way to start.Advertisement"}

Definitely the heartland. The South Side of Chicago? Not so clear. Philadelphia? Too close to the coast. But coal country, 120 miles inland, may be. Cumberland County, Tenn., is in the South, not the Midwest. But is it also in the heartland? What about Detroit, with its demographics and politics that little resemble rural Iowa? Or the Standing Rock Indian Reservation straddling the Dakotas?\u201cIt\u2019s much more a state of mind than an actual place,\u201d suggests the historian William Cronon (who teaches in Madison, Wis., which is surely the heartland, unless your heartland omits liberal college towns). \u201cIt describes a deep set of beliefs about places that somehow authentically stand for America.\u201dIn that sense, the word is not purely about geography. It\u2019s a value judgment. \u201cWho\u2019s authentically from the middle? Who\u2019s from implicitly the heart? Who represents the core?\u201d Mr. Cronon said. Any of those questions could have a dual meaning. Who\u2019s mainstream? Whose traditions are \u201ctraditional\u201d? Who claims the political center? \u201cThere\u2019s a slippage here,\u201d Mr. Cronon said.To pin down this elusive place, we used data from the presidential election, the census, the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2013 even data about television preferences from Facebook \u2013 to map the many meanings of the word, if we\u2019re really being honest about what we mean. This map is our point of departure:It\u2019s where the grain was grown and the cars were built. The region has since lost some of that might, with deindustrialization and the depopulation of family farms. But Mr. Lauck argues that the heartland and the Midwest remain synonymous, in large part because of this history.The heartland can also be defined by what it\u2019s not \u2014 the coasts. And in many ways its cultural values have been framed in opposition to that Other America. \u201cThe suspicion persists,\u201d wrote the English professor and critic Barry Gross in 1977, \u201cthat what goes on at either coast is the extreme, the perverse and bizarre, the grotesque and the Gothic, unreal and worse, unAmerican.\u201dBut where the interior lies has shifted historically, and it has long been the hardest part of the country to map precisely because it lacks the clear natural boundaries of the coasts. \u201cThe West\u201d was once west of the Appalachian Mountains. Today\u2019s Illinois once sat in the \u201cNorthwest Territory.\u201d The \u201cmiddle\u201d moved as white settlers and cartographers did. And this process of revision still hasn\u2019t halted.\u201cThese things aren\u2019t absolute,\u201d said James Akerman, the curator of maps at the Newberry Library in Chicago,  describing how we conceive of \u201cregion\u201d in America. \u201cAnd the electorate is showing these things change constantly.\u201d\u201cTo me, the very ideological or cultural formulation that people are using \u2013 whether they\u2019re aware of it or not \u2013 comes out of that moment of confronting globalization,\u201d Mr. Higbie said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a reaction to that, to sort of say: \u2018We are the authentic, quintessential American location. And we want to reinvest in that.\u2019 \u201dAdd in Manufacturing America, and you pull in more of the Great Lakes states, farther east into Pennsylvania and across much more of the rural South:It\u2019s notable, though, Mr. Higbie adds, that stock images of heartland America tend to turn up few faces of color, whether on the farm or in nostalgic manufacturing. When people use the term, he suspects, they\u2019re often envisioning a white version of the Midwest without its most diverse pockets, circumscribing Detroit, Chicago and St. Louis, and its Native American reservations.Map America by at least part of its European heritage (German Americans are the nation\u2019s largest ethnic group, at about 46 million), and you get a patchy Midwest that looks more like this:Expand the heritage map to include what are today the whitest parts of the country, and you get this:In that context, the word heartland was used to suggest that Mr. Trump won the popular vote in authentic America \u2014 or, put another way, the true American vote. Taken to this extreme, the word loses all geographic meaning; it no longer even describes the interior. This is what the heartland looks like as Trump\u2019s America:\u201cHis heartland strategy only works if you close your eyes and imagine any urban space or place with significant people of color as not part of the heartland,\u201d Mr. Higbie said. Geographically, that definition falls apart. Politically, Mr. Higbie says, it was genius, tying to the Republican Party deeply rooted ideas about \u201creal\u201d America. \u201cYou take a regional name, detach it from the actual physical region,\u201d Mr. Higbie said, \u201cand move it around the country selectively to the places that match your electoral strategy.\u201dThat is essentially what Breitbart did.These maps highlight how the heartland is usually about more than geography \u2014 whether it\u2019s also about demographics, economics, ideology or history. And so we close with a couple of maps that seek, in the end, to define this place through cultural ties. The first brings us most closely back to Mr. Lauck\u2019s Midwest:That picture neatly reflects much of the Midwest without need for state borders and creeps over the state lines, as with Pennsylvania, where the Midwest grows hazy. It offers the cleanest, most compact idea of the heartland of any map shown here. As with the others, it reveals a place that is whiter and more Republican than the country as a whole.Additional work by Jasmine C. LeeAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Women Who Voted for Donald Trump: How I Reported on Their Thoughts", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byWhy did so many women vote for Donald J. Trump, even after he was caught on tape boasting about sexual assault? Many pollsters and pundits assumed his demeaning behavior toward women would hurt him, as Rick Lazio discovered when he ran against Hillary Clinton for a Senate seat. That assumption, like so many during the topsy-turvy campaign, proved wrong \u2014 in the end, exit polls suggest that 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, and many independents and suburban moderates swung his way in the closing days of the campaign.To find out why, I wanted to talk to a wide range of women, to have long conversations that would allow them to discuss not only what attracted them to Mr. Trump but also their own views about women\u2019s rights, roles and standing in society today.I consulted with our social media team, experts in devising call-outs that help us both cast a wide net and focus in on specific targets such as geography or political affiliation. I started with Facebook because women are among the site\u2019s most passionate users. We posted several call-outs that helped expand the range of women I was seeking.The first call-out, a general appeal asking women who voted for Mr. Trump if they\u2019d be willing to speak to a Times reporter, prompted responses from around the country, although the responses from the first round skewed toward the South. In culling responses, I decided to focus on white women since a majority of this group had voted for Mr. Trump.I wanted time to talk about why Mr. Trump had appealed to them, and to ask specifically what they thought about his attitudes and behavior toward women. My aim was to present a rounded portrait of the women \u2014 and to encourage digressions and discussions that would provide a more nuanced profile than the kind of caricatures pundits and social media often supply.I turned toward our superb data team, which had compiled a list of \u201cflipper\u201d counties \u2014 counties that voted for President Obama in 2012 but for Mr. Trump in this election. I wanted to supplement the Facebook responses with input from the white and working-class voters who had given Mr. Trump his Electoral College victory in key states.I focused on Macomb County, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit that has tended to split between a Democratic vote in the southern part of the county and a Republican vote in the northern affluent suburbs. I contacted the head of the Macomb County Republican Party, and she reached out to several people who agreed to in-person interviews.In an ideal world, I would have interviewed the Michigan women in their homes, but a blizzard struck Macomb County the day before I arrived, some roads were impassable, and I was grateful that many of the women kindly came to meet me at a centrally located shopping mall. The shopping mall office was so cold I kept my coat on, as did many of the women I talked to, but they were very open and voluble.As I assumed, many of those contacts were longtime committed Republicans, so to make sure I included the voters who had flipped from Democrat to Republican, I asked the social team if we could do a second, geographically specific call-out. This one invited Macomb County Trump voters \u2014 particularly those who had previously voted Democratic \u2014 to contact me directly if they were willing to give an interview. This second call-out yielded some of my best interviews, including several women who had voted for President Obama in the last election.In the end, I had many more responses than I could even answer, and a thick transcript of interviews from which to choose. I decided that a standard article format would not do justice to the range of women and their reasons for voting for Mr. Trump, so I proposed to my editors that we use a format of block quotes, much longer than The Times uses in standard articles, for the women. We shot portraits of as many women as possible, thanks to our indefatigable photo editor, and our editors devised an appealing digital presentation.The overwhelming response showed me how much more we have to learn about each other in this divided America \u2014 and how important it is not to reduce people to stereotypes.Advertisement"}

Two minutes later, when a call was placed to Ms. Feinstein\u2019s San Francisco office, a recording said the voice mail box was full. The mailbox was still full at 1:17 p.m.But someone did pick up the phone at her office in San Diego, referring a reporter to a spokesman, said they were aware of the heavy call volume and were working on it.\u201cAll office lines in California and Washington are being answered, and voicemails are being taken down as quickly as possible,\u201d the spokesman, Tom Mentzer, said in an email on Friday. \u201cWhen phone lines are overwhelmed, we also encourage constituents to use the senator\u2019s website to contact her online.\u201dIt published on Twitter a register of phone numbers for key legislators whose votes could be pivotal, along with advice on who was picking up the phone and who was not.\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why Cory Gardner is not responding to the people he\u2019s supposed to represent,\u201d said Gail Harriss, a Durango resident who was one of about 50 protesters who converged on the senator\u2019s office. \u201cEspecially when time is of the essence with Trump\u2019s nominees,\u201d the newspaper quoted her as saying.Alex Siciliano, a spokesman for Senator Gardner, said in a telephone interview on Friday that in the past week or two, the senator\u2019s office had switched over to a system that has a \u201cvirtually unlimited\u201d capacity that sends voice mail messages digitally to an email inbox that make it easier for staff members to work through the calls.Mr. Siciliano said later in an email: \u201cNothing is more important to Senator Gardner than providing the best constituent service possible to all Coloradans. Since January 1st, our office has received a large volume of emails and phone calls, and we have responded to more than 25,000 letters and fielded thousands of phone calls.\u201dThe Twitter timeline of Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, was littered with messages on Friday saying her phone lines were jammed. Ms Murray replied with an announcement telling people to send emails, instead.Taylor Haulsee, a spokesman for Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Friday that the office was busy fielding a high volume of calls from constituents with opinions about the nominees.Bryan Watt, a spokesman for Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington State, said in a telephone interview that the office has received about 6,000 calls this week and 5,000 more voice mail messages, between the Washington, D.C., offices and the Seattle office.\u201cMost of them are coming in about the nominees,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seven phone lines.

America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion \u2014 this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria. My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as President I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.Even so, Mr. Priebus said that border agents had \u201cdiscretionary authority\u201d to detain and question suspicious travelers from certain countries.\u201cSadly weak on immigration,\u201d the president said of Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who had written that they feared the ban \u201cwill become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201dThe senators expressed concern that the executive order \u201cmay do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d The president countered that they should focus on fighting ISIS \u201cinstead of always looking to start World War III.\u201dDemocratic members of the House and the Senate will gather on the steps of the Supreme Court on Monday evening to protest the travel ban, Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, said.\u201cThe president\u2019s action is not only unconstitutional but immoral,\u201d she said in a statement.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said that his office would offer legal help to those detained at airports in New York.\u201cWe have directed the Port Authority and my counsel\u2019s office to make sure we are protecting the legal rights of any person detained at any of our airports, period,\u201d the governor, a Democrat, said at a news conference. \u201cWe will serve as counsel for any detainee who needs legal assistance.\u201dThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey operates Kennedy and La Guardia Airports.Travelers being held at airports around the country continued to be released on Sunday, while some had already been sent back and others were not allowed onto their flights to the United States.The number of people still in custody at Kennedy Airport was a floating target on Sunday night. Rep. Joe Crowley, a Queens Democrat, said that based on his meeting with a Customs and Border Protection agent that concluded at around 8 p.m., six people were still being held at the airport\u2019s Terminal 1.All six have green cards, he said, and will be processed and released under terms of the judicial stay within a few hours. Five of the six are from a single flight from Turkey. Crowley said he did not know the flight on which the sixth arrived.Crowley called the executive order \u201chorrible and immoral.\u201dDetainees at Kennedy Airport were handcuffed as they were moved from one terminal to another and were essentially denied sustenance, a lawyer said.The lawyer, Justin Orr, said the detainees were given only chocolate and caffeine on Saturday. Some groups supporting the detainees tried to send sandwiches and water, but the authorities refused to take them, Mr. Orr said.But Ms. Rasekhi, the graduate student at Stony Brook University, said that food and water were provided. \u201cEven someone wanted lemon, just lemon water,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went and grabbed lemon. I don\u2019t know where they got the lemon from but they got it in like in two minutes.\u201dWitnesses described seeing detainees handcuffed at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. Seifollah Moradi, 34, an Iranian-American student from Columbia, Md., who has a green card and was held for six hours, said that he saw another Iranian man who had won a lottery visa handcuffed and taken away by customs officers who were moving people to an off-site detention center.Notwithstanding the protests across the country, many Americans strongly support the president\u2019s travel ban.Billy Bearden, who works in an auto-part factory in Carrollton, Ga., said he was \u201cglad and thankful\u201d that President Trump was making a \u201cserious effort to vet these individuals.\u201dMr. Bearden, 52, said on Sunday that he was sympathetic to the circumstances of people living in war-torn countries, but that he couldn\u2019t shake the fear of another terrorist attack, like those in Boston, Orlando and San Bernardino, Calif..\u201cSadly, for whatever reason, it seems that the majority of terrorists worldwide seem to be of the Muslim faith,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe mad rush to bring them in at all costs actually is not a good thing. If it turns out that they are decent, peace loving individuals, then certainly I got no problem with them, even living on my street.\u201dOn Long Island, Kathleen Ganci, the widow of the highest ranking New York City Fire Department official killed on Sept. 11, held a similar view.\u201cDo I want them banned forever? Of course not,\u201d said Ms. Ganci, whose husband, Chief of Department Peter J. Ganci Jr., was crushed in the collapse of 1 World Trade Center. \u201cThere\u2019s many, many fine Muslim people in this world, but there\u2019s many many people who want to kill us, and we need to vet them, and we need to find out.\u201dDallas\u2019s Democratic mayor, Mike Rawlings, apologized \u201con behalf of the citizens of Dallas\u201d to the dozens detained at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.\u201cThe tide is turning, the sun is rising and these important visitors to our city are here,\u201d Mr. Rawlings said at a news conference at the airport on Sunday alongside four released detainees. \u201cWe have wished them welcome and we have apologized from the depths of our heart.\u201dMo Farah, the Olympic gold medal runner who was born in Somalia, grew up in Britain and has lived in the United States for six years, took to Facebook to criticize the president\u2019s ban:Mr. Farah, who won gold medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters, and who lives in Oregon, continued:I am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years \u2014 working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home. Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome. It\u2019s deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home \u2014 to explain why the President has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice.I was welcomed into Britain from Somalia at eight years old and given the chance to succeed and realise my dreams. I have been proud to represent my country, win medals for the British people and receive the greatest honour of a knighthood. My story is an example of what can happen when you follow policies of compassion and understanding, not hate and isolation.The president\u2019s executive order bars visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Somalia. It is unclear whether the travel ban applies to Mr. Farah.Using the hashtag #deleteuber, Twitter users posted screenshots of their phones as they deleted their apps. By Sunday, Uber\u2019s competitor Lyft, perhaps sensing an opportunity, announced in a letter to customers that it had donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union.And even as Uber said it was not responding to the move by taxi drivers, some came to the company\u2019s defense. Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative and a political adviser to Mr. Trump, posted on Twitter in support of Uber, calling the protests \u201cmanufactured outrage.\u201d\u2014 JONAH ENGEL BROMWICHWhile several members of New York\u2019s congressional delegation have been involved in helping travelers detained at Kennedy Airport, one Republican representative, Lee Zeldin, said he supported Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order.\u201cEvery American has sympathy for the innocent person who is looking to come to America for a better life, but the process must without exception prioritize America\u2019s national security first,\u201d Mr. Zeldin, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who represents parts of Long Island, said in a statement.Advertisement"}

Jason and Rachel were middle school sweethearts in Northern Colorado \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but her father did not approve. He only saw a boy from a troubled family who lived in a trailer park and wanted to run away with his daughter, so the young couple broke up and went their separate ways. Eight years later, Jason reached out to her on Facebook, she responded, and even though they lived hundreds of miles apart, they fell in love during long chats. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where their story becomes anything but typical.Jason joined the Marine Corps after high school and was sent to Afghanistan, where he was a minesweeper. In 2010, he lost both his legs above the knee, his right arm above the elbow and two fingers of his left hand. Shrapnel also lodged into his testicles.  During his recovery, Rachel fell in love with him again through their chats. Still, she was unsure that it could work out, and worried about whether she would be physically attracted to him. Yet when she traveled to San Diego, where he was recovering, Rachel realized that she \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas totally attracted, and he was like way better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, than any \u00e2\u0080\u009cof the stupid guys\u00e2\u0080\u009d she had been dating. They were only 21, but Jason and Rachel clicked: Rachel advocated strenuously for his medical care at the VA hospital, and Jason was a calming, steady influence on her. In the hospital, he had to relearn how to do basic tasks, while still feeling \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe fingers, the toes, everything, but it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich is nice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite his injuries, he can drive, cook, shower and dress himself, although he struggles with his prosthetic legs because of his unusually rapid bone growth.

He initially had problems adapting and was drinking a lot, but anger counseling \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both individually and with Rachel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has helped him adjust.  Shortly after getting married, they decided that they wanted to have children. They banked Jason\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sperm right away, because the testosterone treatment he was receiving often reduces sperm count to near zero. A year later, they started in vitro fertilization treatments.At the same time, Kirsten Bitzer had decided to pursue a long-term photo essay on a couple undergoing the process. Her mother, an I.V.F. nurse, often told her stories about her work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was hearing these fascinating accounts of modern medicine and also of the heartache of the couples going through rounds of I.V.F. again and again, sometimes without ever getting pregnant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kirsten said.Kirsten enlisted another nurse for help in finding a couple who would agree to be photographed as they went through the process. In a bit of photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortune, the nurse asked Rachel and Jason. They immediately agreed. At that time, the Veterans Affairs Department would not cover any of the costs of I.V.F., so the couple had to shoulder the financial burden, which can rise above $25,000. With the help of one of their nurses, they found local pharmacies willing to defray the cost of the drugs with the assistance of the Compassionate Corps program. Ultimately, the couple paid around $8,000. (A bill temporarily authorizing the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover I.V.F. and adoptions for veterans whose combat wounds cause infertility was passed by congress in September. In two years, Congress will have to revisit the issue.) Though the couple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first attempt at I.V.F. was successful, resulting in twins, the pregnancy was difficult for Rachel. Jason had started working as a financial adviser, but stayed home with Rachel to help her through a challenging first trimester. Rachel had a cesarean section after 18 hours of labor, and gave birth to twins on Oct. 13. Jason Jr. came out first, followed a few minutes later by his sister, Marina, named after the United States Marine Corps. Jason bottle feeds the twins but has trouble changing a diaper. Rachel is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural-born mom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kirsten said. She continues to follow the couple as they raise their new babies. Despite the physical and bureaucratic obstacles, they are in some ways a storybook couple, she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cRachel always holds Jason\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand, regardless of what kind of hand it is \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a prosthetic with a claw at the end,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kirsten added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe needs him just as much as he needs her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Facebook, Nodding to Its Role in Media, Starts a Journalism Project", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook is increasingly owning up to its role as one of the world\u2019s largest distributors of information by taking more responsibility for the millions of stories that flow through its site.On Wednesday, the social network made its latest move to acknowledge that role by announcing the Facebook Journalism Project.The effort calls for the company to forge deeper ties with publishers by collaborating on publishing tools and features before they are released. Facebook will also develop training programs and tools for journalists to teach them how to better search its site to report on news and events. And Facebook wants to help train members of the public to find news sources they trust, while fighting the spread of fake news across its site.The project will begin in coming weeks in partnership with publishers including The Washington Post and Vox Media. (The New York Times is not among the initial partners for some parts of the test, but it has been invited and plans to participate in the project.)In an interview about the Facebook Journalism Project, Fidji Simo, a director of product at the company, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard loud and clear over the last year that there are questions about our role in this ecosystem. It has added an extra motivation for us to be involved even earlier on.\u201dThe new initiative is something of a peace offering from Facebook to publishers who share news content on the network.Publishers have long considered Facebook a kind of frenemy \u2014 increasingly relying on the social network to spread their stories but often wary of depending too much on one medium to reach an audience. Facebook also regularly changes its algorithms, which can make or break a publisher\u2019s traffic and revenue. Because of such changes, sites like Elite Daily and Upworthy have experienced wide swings in traffic.\u201cThere would be times when Facebook would come to us with a new product or function, but by the time we were invited to participate, product development was already kind of a done deal,\u201d said Shailesh Prakash, the chief intelligence officer and vice president for digital product development for The Washington Post. \u201cYou had to fix your content and design into their parameters.\u201d\u201cNow we\u2019re finally coming to a more formal positioning of a model where we can begin working together much earlier in the process,\u201d Mr. Prakash said.Facebook and Mr. Prakash said that earlier collaboration could improve relationships and perhaps help overcome some of the challenges that publishers face, such as how to increase subscriptions or newsletter sign-ups from inside Facebook. The company has also expressed interest in working with publishers to build products for local news and in promoting small, independent news media.Facebook also plans to make CrowdTangle, an analytics tool it acquired in November, free to use. CrowdTangle is popular with publishers and journalists searching for Facebook data.Other components of the project may help repair Facebook\u2019s status as a place to discover news, after it attracted criticism over the amount of fake stories appearing on the site. Facebook said it hoped to train audiences with \u201cnews literacy\u201d programs to better spot false news, as well as by producing public-service announcements about how to determine which news sources to trust. Facebook may dole out financial assistance grants for such projects.Facebook cautioned that its journalism project was in the early stages, and would evolve as the needs of publishers, readers and journalists changed. But the company said it would not shy from questions about its role in news media.\u201cAs an industry, we have a lot to learn collaboratively,\u201d said Ms. Simo, the Facebook director of product. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is an increased commitment to that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Destroy the Business Model of Breitbart and Fake News", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byOne day in late November, an earth and environmental science professor named Nathan Phillips visited Breitbart News for the first time. Mr. Phillips had heard about the hateful headlines on the site \u2014 like \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy\u201d \u2014 and wondered what kind of companies would support such messages with their ad dollars. When he clicked on the site, he was shocked to discover ads for universities, including one for the graduate school where he\u2019d received his own degree \u2014 Duke University\u2019s Nicholas School of the Environment. \u201cThat was a punch in the stomach,\u201d he said.Why would an environmental science program want to be promoted on a site that denies the existence of climate change? Mr. Phillips figured \u2014 correctly \u2014 that Duke officials did not know where their ads were appearing, so he sent a tweet to Duke about its association with the \u201csexist racist\u201d site. Eventually, after a flurry of communication with the environment department, he received a satisfying resolution \u2014 an assurance that its ads would no longer show up on Breitbart.Mr. Phillips had just engaged in a new form of consumer activism, one that is rewriting the rules of online advertising. In the past month and a half, thousands of activists have started to push companies to take a stand on what you might call \u201chate news\u201d \u2014 a toxic mix of lies, white-supremacist content and bullying that can inspire attacks on Muslims, gay people, women, African-Americans and others.In mid-November, a Twitter group called Sleeping Giants became the hub of the new movement. The Giants and their followers have communicated with more than 1,000 companies and nonprofit groups whose ads appeared on Breitbart, and about 400 of those organizations have promised to remove the site from future ad buys.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on Breitbart News right now because they\u2019re the biggest fish,\u201d a founder of Sleeping Giants told me. (He requested anonymity because some members of the group work in the digital-media industry.) Eventually, Sleeping Giants would like to broaden its campaign to take on a menagerie of bad actors, but that would require a much bigger army of Giants, and \u201cit has only been a month since we started doing this,\u201d he told me when I talked to him in December. Then he added, \u201cThis has been the longest month of my life.\u201dHe said that he noticed something had gone wrong with internet ads in November when, just out of curiosity, he visited Breitbart News. Like Mr. Phillips, he was gobsmacked by what he found there. His version of Breitbart was plastered with the logos of Silicon Valley brands that courted tech-savvy, pro-diversity millennials. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that these progressive companies were paying Breitbart News,\u201d he said.So he created a Twitter account called Sleeping Giants that would allow him and his fellow activists to anonymously interact with advertisers. Then they sent screenshots to companies like Chase, SoFi and Audi to prove that their ads appeared next to offensive content. Within hours, they received their first response, and they realized that they had stumbled across a potentially powerful tactic.\u201cWe are trying to stop racist websites by stopping their ad dollars,\u201d reads the Sleeping Giants profile. \u201cMany companies don\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s time to tell them.\u201d They say it\u2019s not about taking away Breitbart\u2019s right to free speech, but about giving consumers and advertisers control over where their money goes. The group\u2019s Twitter page offers a simple set of instructions to anyone who wants to follow suit. Step 1: \u201cGo to Breitbart and take a screenshot of an ad next to some of their content.\u201d Step 2: \u201cTweet the screenshot to the company with a polite, nonoffensive note.\u201dThe activists\u2019 back-and-forth with companies reveals a fog of confusion surrounding online advertising. Many organizations have no idea that their ads may end up next to content they find abhorrent.You might blame this \u2014 in part \u2014 on robots. According to the research firm eMarketer, American companies are now spending more than $22 billion a year on \u201cprogrammatic ads,\u201d the kind of advertising that is bought with little human oversight. Joshua Zeitz, vice president of corporate communications at the ad-tech company AppNexus, explained to me how this automated ad buying works. When you click on a link, \u201cin less than a second, a call goes out, and algorithms and automated software bid in an auction to put their advertisement up on your page,\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe the Nabisco algorithm wants to put an ad up there; so does Macy\u2019s and so does Honda.\u201d The algorithm that places the highest bid wins the chance to appear on your screen.Programmatic ads can also follow individuals around the internet, based on their browsing history, as happened with Mr. Philips. A single targeted ad could cost just a fraction of a penny, but the pennies add up to a billion-dollar industry.Even when ad placements are automated, companies still have the power to control whether neo-Nazis or fake news hucksters profit. In fact, it\u2019s actually rather simple for companies to impose ethical policies, according to Mr. Zeitz. Indeed, his own company (which handles programmatic advertising for other organizations) recently decided to get out ahead of the issue by removing Breitbart News from its advertising marketplace. \u201cWe\u2019re not banning them because they\u2019re alt-right or conservative. We banned them from our marketplace because they violate our hate speech policy, which prohibits ad serving on sites that incite violence and discrimination against minority groups.\u201d (Breitbart has said that it condemns racism and bigotry \u201cin any form.\u201d)He pointed out that brand-name companies had already figured out how to keep their ads from flowing onto porn sites, because \u201cyou really don\u2019t want your ad for a breakfast cereal next to a hard-core pornographic video,\u201d and so \u201cthere are tools in place that allow companies to control where their ads go.\u201d A company can block a specific site like Breitbart News from its ad buy. Or it might pick a \u201cwhite list\u201d of sites that align with its values.But to do that, companies would have to forgo the sites designed to deliver exactly what they want \u2014 a big audience for little cost. In November, NPR reporters interviewed Jestin Coler about his fake-news empire. Mr. Coler and his team stage-crafted their sites to look like local newspapers and then planted fantastical headlines and fictional stories that attracted more than a million views. Though the news was fake, the ads were real. Mr. Coler wouldn\u2019t tell the reporters exactly how much he made off advertising, but he intimated that his revenues ranged between $10,000 and $30,000 a month.Such \u201centrepreneurs\u201d have an outsize influence on our political sphere. BuzzFeed News reported that, during the last three months of the election, hoax stories outperformed real ones on social media. Thanks to people enthusiastically sharing pro-Trump headlines cooked up by clickbait farms, in the bizarro-world of online advertising, the fake can be more profitable than the real.Ezra Englebardt, an advertising strategist, joined the Sleeping Giants campaign because he believes it creates much-needed transparency in the online advertising world. When lots of people share photos of the ads that they\u2019re seeing on their own screens, it becomes possible to get some sense of where the ad dollars go, he said.Still, the post-truth reality makes it difficult to measure the scope of the problem. Breitbart\u2019s editor in chief told Bloomberg that despite these bans, his company \u201ccontinues to experience exceptional growth.\u201d However, public Twitter communications and news accounts prove that advertisers are indeed fleeing the site.More important, the screenshot activists are forcing companies to pick a side. After pressure from consumers, Kellogg\u2019s became one of the first big brands to announce that it would remove its ads from Breitbart News. In retaliation, Breitbart called for a boycott, and the cereal brand seems to have suffered from the uproar on social media. At the same time, it received lots of good press for taking its stand; in early December, many consumers announced that they would reward the company by making all-Kellogg\u2019s donations to soup kitchens.I expected that other companies would want to trumpet their own Breitbart departures. It seemed an easy win for corporate P.R. to distance itself from Klan-rally-like riffs like this one \u2014 \u201cevery tree, every rooftop, every picket fence, every telegraph pole in the South should be festooned with the Confederate battle flag.\u201d (Telegraph poles!?)But when I reached out to several organizations that seemed to have joined the ban, they didn\u2019t want to talk about it. A bank and a nonprofit group did not respond to my queries. Two companies \u2014 3M and Zappos \u2014 declined to talk about the matter. A Patagonia spokeswoman said that her company did not advertise on white-supremacist sites \u2014 but she would not comment on the screenshots that activists had sent to Patagonia in early December showing the company\u2019s logo on Breitbart\u2019s Facebook page. Warby Parker was the most forthcoming; a representative pointed me to a statement that thanked a Twitter activist for inspiring its own ban on Breitbart.In the behavior of some of these companies, you can detect the way our norms have already shifted. In the old normal, it would have cost little to stand up against neo-Nazi slogans. But in the new normal, doing so might involve angering key players in the White House, including the president-elect, Donald J. Trump, who has hired the former editor of Breitbart as his senior adviser. Mr. Trump recently proved the damage he could do to a company by criticizing Lockheed Martin on Twitter; soon after, its stocks prices tumbled.Still, a new consumer movement is rising, and activists believe that where votes failed, wallets may prevail. This struggle is about much more than ads on Breitbart News \u2014 it\u2019s about using corporations as shields to protect vulnerable people from bullying and hate crimes.Nicholas Reville, a board member of the Participatory Culture Foundation who has worked with the Sleeping Giants, pointed out that businesses benefited from embracing diversity: \u201cYou have to be inclusionary if you\u2019re going to try to sell to a very large audience.\u201d And he pointed out that consumer activism might be especially effective because so many people feel they have no other way to express their opposition to Trump-ian values.The founder of Sleeping Giants agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to say it, but maybe companies will have to be the standard-bearers for morals right now,\u201d he said. He added that most corporations embrace policies (on paper at least) that prohibit racist bullying and sexual intimidation. Even if President Trump flouts these rules, corporations may continue to uphold them. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen employee handbooks where they have codes of behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s all we have to fall back on now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even though this standard is used for civil trials, the burden of proof for regular criminal trials \u2014 which include sexual assault cases adjudicated in criminal courts \u2014 is much higher. Criminal convictions require establishing guilt \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201dProponents of using preponderance of evidence in campus Title IX tribunals argue that because colleges and universities don't have the power to incarcerate those found guilty, the lower burden of proof is justified.

They can\u2019t determine the guilt of those accused of criminal sex offenses, but they must address sexual violence \u2014 as a severe form of sexual harassment \u2014 when it affects their students.Criminal standards would require evidence of a quantity and type that is virtually impossible for schools to access, as they lack court powers such as the subpoena which would compel the production of evidence. But more important for the protection of students, the preponderance standard itself is designed to be equal \u2014 it expects the victim and the accused to carry virtually equal evidentiary burdens (with the victim\u2019s burden just slightly heavier than the accused\u2019s).Is a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d the right standard of proof for college panels judging sexual assault cases?\n"}

{"Headline": "Warm Welcome for Syrians in a Country About to Ban Them", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 On Friday afternoon, a group of suburban synagogue members clustered at O\u2019Hare International Airport, waiting to greet one of the last Syrian refugee families to be accepted in the United States, to give them the warmest possible welcome to a country that no longer wanted their kind.In Washington, the presidential limousine was already speeding toward the Pentagon, where President Trump would sign a paper officially slamming the door shut on Syrian refugees. But here the volunteers had yellow roses, more warm coats than the newcomers would need and, a few miles away, an apartment ready with a doormat that said \u201cwelcome\u201d in 17 languages.\u201cWelcome to chicag Hope you make your selfs at home\u201d said a sign made by one of the youngest members of the group.Whatever the new president said about the supposed dangers of Syrian refugees, the volunteers, who knew almost nothing about the family they were about to welcome, instantly identified with them anyway. They had already committed to helping guide and care for the newcomers for six months.Some of the volunteers were children or grandchildren of refugees. Their synagogue, Am Shalom (\u201cPeople of Peace\u201d) in Glencoe, Ill., displays a statue depicting members\u2019 families who perished at the Nazis\u2019 hands. The Syrian family, and the president\u2019s orders, were coming on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, some of the volunteers noted with tears in their eyes. A hundred synagogue members had contributed in some way to helping resettle the Syrians: renting an apartment steps from a playground, assembling a vacuum cleaner, lining up juice boxes in the refrigerator.Some of the synagogue members had signed on instinctually, so the Syrians would be helped the way their own parents or grandparents had been aided when they arrived in the United States. Others had joined as a way of countering Mr. Trump \u2014 just a few of the many Americans, of varied backgrounds, reacting with shock, outrage and concern to his curtailment of the country\u2019s long-established refugee resettlement system.\u201cThe Statue of Liberty has always been our symbol of welcome,\u201d Rabbi Steven Stark Lowenstein, the group\u2019s leader, said at the airport. \u201cIt feels like Trump turned off the light,\u201d he said.At the Pentagon on Friday, the preparations for the president\u2019s actions were orderly: High-level officials gathered in a room called the Hall of Heroes, and photographers assembled. But around the country, refugees, resettlement workers and volunteers expressed panic. Resettlement workers did not know if they would have jobs once Mr. Trump\u2019s refugee and immigration plans have been fully carried out. Volunteers wondered what they would do with furniture and money they had collected for refugees who were supposed to arrive soon.RefugeeOne, the resettlement agency responsible for the family coming into O\u2019Hare, had been expecting another Syrian family to arrive on Monday.\u201cThat\u2019s not happening,\u201d Kim Snoddy, the program\u2019s liaison to groups like the Am Shalom volunteers, said as she waited with them at the airport on Friday.A volunteer from another Chicago group posted a photograph on Facebook of an empty crib, made up with a pink sheet and a stuffed bunny, for the baby of a family that would no longer arrive.\u201cThe more I learned about what I felt to be the truth and the truth that Trump was telling,\u201d the more she wanted to get involved, she wrote in an email.Resettlement agencies said that volunteers had been swarming their offices and that even more had surfaced last week when Mr. Trump\u2019s specific plans became public. When the International Refugee Assistance Project put out a call for lawyers to help new arrivals in danger of being turned away, it received 3,000 volunteers in four hours, said Becca Heller, the organization\u2019s director.\u201cPeople are desperate to help refugees as a way to counter these discriminatory policies,\u201d she said.As the minutes passed at O\u2019Hare, the volunteers checked the time again, tense with the knowledge that Mr. Trump was about to commit pen to paper. The family they were awaiting had flown into Washington the night before, meaning they had cleared immigration with less than a day to spare. But the volunteers said they would not be able to exhale until the newcomers landed in Chicago. The flight was delayed, they heard. They glanced at the time on their phones again.As soon as the Syrian family of four stepped into the baggage claim area, the synagogue members surrounded them protectively, offering the flowers and signs, as a resettlement worker translated. Because they spoke no English, the newcomers wore tags around their necks, like Paddington Bear, so if they got lost, they could be identified.In a moment, the two Syrian children\u2019s arms were laden with gift bags of toys. The parents said they were too terrified to talk to a reporter, out of concern for family members \u2014 some still trapped in dangerous areas of Syria and others who had been cleared to travel to the United States but had not yet received plane tickets.After hugs and snapshots and many professions of welcome and thanks, the group at the airport dispersed. The refugees headed to their new home with a few escorts, the synagogue members back to their far more stable lives. Just before they parted, Rabbi Lowenstein gathered his congregants and gave them a charge.\u201cIf this is the last group of refugees to get in, we will show them the best of America,\u201d he said.The family was driven to its new home, where a meal and a Syrian-style semolina cake were waiting. The couple said they had not checked the news since landing in the United States, and no one from the volunteer group had told them what was about to happen. Moments before they arrived at the cozy, fully stocked apartment, Mr. Trump, wearing an American flag pin, signed the orders in front of an audience of his advisers and Pentagon officials. As he finished, the clapping in the room was loud.Behind him hung an oversize medal depicting the Statue of Liberty, a beacon of welcome.Advertisement"}

And most counties in the state also prohibit holding immigrants beyond their sentence if federal immigration agents do not have a judicial order.

Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, who has long shied away from the term sanctuary city, said the Police Department would continue its four-decades-old policy that prohibits officers from questioning people for the purpose of determining their immigration status and arresting them for illegal entry to the United States.\u201cWe all want a nation of laws, but we are also a nation of immigrants,\u201d Mayor Garcetti said in a brief interview.How the executive order will play out over the next several years remains murky.\u2022 What obstacles could the federal government face to cutting off funds to sanctuary cities?Trump will face massive political resistance and challenges in the courts. The Supreme Court has made clear it is the exclusive function of the federal government to enforce immigration laws. Coercing states and localities to perform these functions would also be constitutionally suspect under the 10th Amendment, which safeguards states\u2019 rights.\u2022 How painful could the cuts be?The president has not identified the source of funds at issue. Nor has an amount been specified. He has indicated that he plans to revive a program, commonly known as 287(g), that could provide additional funding to localities that partner with immigration authorities. But participation in the program is voluntary and known to divert resources from local law enforcement priorities.\u2022 How would sanctuary jurisdictions be defined?The president\u2019s order doesn\u2019t say. Trump has suggested he defines them as jurisdictions that fail to honor immigration detainers. However, federal courts have found that such detentions violate Fourth Amendment protections against unlawful search and seizure.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Each year from December through March, colonies of northern elephant seals gather on beaches to perform their birthing and mating rituals.Mr. Menke, 73, leads field trips at Piedras Blancas.

{"Headline": "SpaceX Says It\u2019s Ready to Launch Rockets Again", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byThe statement Monday added technical details about what went wrong, and the company said it had devised workarounds to prevent a recurrence.The cascade of explosions on Sept. 1 that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was perplexing and concerning, because it occurred during what is usually regarded as a safer portion of operations \u2014 the fueling of propellants \u2014 about eight minutes before the ignition of the engines for a planned test. (The launch had been scheduled for two days later.)The trouble appeared to start near the liquid oxygen tank on the second stage of the two-stage rocket, and in less than a tenth of a second, that section was in flames, followed by the destruction of the entire rocket and a $200 million communications satellite whose customers included Facebook, which had planned to use it to expand internet services in Africa.Under current federal laws, investigations into such explosions are led by the company that built the rocket, not by a government agency. The investigation panel included representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Air Force, NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board. Falcon 9 rockets are used to carry NASA cargo to the International Space Station and are to provide transportation for astronauts beginning in 2018. SpaceX is also competing to win contracts to launch Department of Defense spy satellites.With few obvious clues to the explosion, the company initially considered hypotheses like sabotage, that a sniper had fired a shot rupturing the oxygen tank from the roof of a competitor\u2019s building nearby.\u201cThe accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis,\u201d SpaceX said in its statement.In December 2015, SpaceX began using an upgraded Falcon 9 design that uses supercooled liquid oxygen at minus 340 degrees, 40 degrees colder than what is typically used. The lower temperature makes the oxygen denser, which improves engine thrust.But the helium was even colder. As the carbon and aluminum cool, they shrink at different rates, opening gaps into which liquid oxygen could flow. In addition, the helium may have been below the temperature at which oxygen freezes, and some of the trapped oxygen may have become solid.\u201cReally surprising problem that\u2019s never been encountered before in the history of rocketry,\u201d Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, said in an interview on CNBC in November.Both carbon and aluminum can burn, and with oxygen sandwiched in between, all of the ingredients for a conflagration were present. Friction or the breaking of fibers could have provided the energy for ignition, the company said.Tests at SpaceX\u2019s facilities in Hawthorne, Calif., and McGregor, Tex., supported that conclusion, the company said.The configuration of the helium containers has been shifted, and the fueling procedures will change so that the helium will be warmer, SpaceX said.The next SpaceX launch is to carry a 10-pack of satellites for Iridium Communications, which provides communications services including satellite telephones through a constellation of satellites. Iridium is looking to replace the surviving 65 original satellites with 70 new satellites, each about the size of a Mini Cooper car.The Iridium satellite is to be launched by SpaceX from a leased launchpad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Non-Politics of Disability", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byDisabilityMy partisan posture was clear, but still, the post elicited warm messages of encouragement from even strident Trump supporters. One response was revealing: A friend claimed that the president-elect would do wonders for the country, even as she wholeheartedly denounced him on this issue. (For the record, Kovaleski does not consider himself to be disabled.)That a statement on disability garnered sympathy from across the political spectrum was unsurprising, at least to me. I\u2019ve grown used to my wheelchair trumping (forgive me) other political and moral concerns. Rarely, if ever, do people contest my claims that we must do more for those with disabilities: Greater access? Better employment training? More flexible school curriculums?\u201cOf course!\u201d they invariably respond. \u201cWho could argue with that?\u201dDisability rights enjoy a seemingly ironclad moral consensus, an ostensible unanimity that is striking given America\u2019s entrenched polarization and the antagonism surrounding other identity movements. Many are wary of L.G.B.T. rights or the Black Lives Matter movement, but it seems beyond the pale \u2014 almost cruel \u2014 to oppose disability rights. Nobody wants to be anti-disability.I think part of the reason is the insulation of our pro-disabled political consensus. Its logic is rooted not in any deep belief in the equal worth of citizens with disabilities, but rather in a general aversion to disability. This is related to the charity impulse that has always surrounded disability \u2014 and has constrained liberation efforts by assuming that inequities are unfortunate but natural realities to be mitigated through compassion, rather than politically structured injustices. There is also a profound lack of disabled people in the public sphere, meaning any substantive discussion that does occur is extremely rare.Moreover, the apparent moral consensus may be mostly superficial. In trying to enact accessibility, disability advocates encounter increasing resistance as the effort and costs involved in proposals come closer to being realized. (Consider the neighborhood store that decides it\u2019s just too costly to install a ramp, or the community lecture that excludes deaf attendees by refusing to hire a sign-language interpreter.)Until we publicly recognize real disagreements surrounding disability and accessibility, Mouffe would insist, we are doomed to a vacuous, empty debate that is neither political nor productive.Recall the Kovaleski incident. I\u2019m not suggesting that the abhorrence of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions is open to legitimate questioning. But in their forcefully reassuring comments and messages, my friends prevented any serious discussion of disability at the level where reasonable disagreement does exist. Where will the money come from to fund disability employment schemes? How do we even define \u201cdisability\u201d? Despite \u2014 and, I would argue, partly because of \u2014 the broad condemnation of Mr. Trump for his insensitivity, there was no substantive public discussion of such issues.You may be thinking, haven\u2019t we had enough politics lately? Maybe it\u2019s a blessing that disability isn\u2019t as political as it might be; it avoids the drama and messiness that now seem to define our common life.Avoiding politics might be possible if disability were an exclusively private affair. But it is fundamentally a public concern, affecting everyone directly or indirectly and revealing our obligations to one another as members of a democratic society. Issues of accessibility can be fully addressed only through public institutions and collective effort. For the disability community, there is no answer but politics.But politics need not be repulsive. That\u2019s the beauty of Mouffe\u2019s agonism: By legitimating clashing arguments and welcoming them into the political fold, unproductive antagonism becomes constructive, and compromises emerge.And success here could yield broader insights. I believe there is great potential for a new disability politics to provide a positive blueprint for dealing with our partisan divide and other identity issues that goes beyond the unhelpful political correctness frame. Thinking seriously about precisely why disability maintains a moral consensus might allow us to harness any advantages (e.g. a common moral vocabulary) while discarding what\u2019s unhelpful. What if we could construct a model of politicization that doesn\u2019t entail bitter partisanship, and rescue authentic disagreement from stultifying consensus? The resulting practices and mentalities could be revolutionary for disability politics, and for democracy itself.I\u2019m still thinking through how this might work, and I recognize that any such efforts will require real trade-offs and difficult conversations. Politics \u2014 when put into action \u2014 always does.Advertisement"}

They have been edited and condensed.\u201cI thought I was impervious to scams since I had installed security software from a known, trusted company (\u2018ABC\u2019).\u201cTwo months ago ABC sent me an email saying that I didn\u2019t have adequate protection on my system. The email asked me to download a new module to update my security package. Not even thinking remotely about potential problems with this approach, I did as they asked. But the module wouldn\u2019t install, and it gave me an error code and a number to call. Not only that, but I was called several times from someone claiming to be their representative who would help me with this problem. So I called them back and was connected to \u2018Chris Coleman,\u2019 a fellow with a deep accent who spoke broken English. \u2018Chris\u2019 told me he needed to \u2018take control\u2019 of my system to search for viruses. Long story short, I finally tumbled to the truth when Chris asked me for my credit card to \u2018buy\u2019 some new, improved security software!\u201d\u201cMy 82-year-old mother, whose memory and judgment are fading, has been getting calls from \u2018Windows tech support\u2019 for a couple years. I keep telling her to just hang up, it\u2019s a scam, but she keeps talking to them. So far they only got $300, but last month there were a couple close calls. One guy took control of her computer and tried to have her sign up for online banking (she called me before they got any money). I am taking steps to limit her access to her money. This is the only way to protect someone like her from these awful scams.\u201d\u201cAshamed, for what the youth of my country has got themselves into. I hope such scammers are busted as early as possible. It\u2019s not just American citizens; international students are also targeted. My cousin was duped of 3,000 Australian dollars and another one of $4,000.\u201d\u201cMy 90-year-old father was tormented by these people for a year. He believed they were going to fix his computer, and he gave them his log in and password. And he paid them for lifetime service on his PC.\u201cThen they started calling and threatening him to send more money. Said they would destroy his PC. I had Montgomery County police (in Maryland) come to the house and provided them the contact info. They said they see this all the time and there was \u2018nothing they could do.\u2019\u201cI told them I had contacted the F.T.C. but there was no one to speak with \u2014 only a \u2018contact us\u2019 form \u2014 as if that would help.\u201cI begged Dad to stop answering the phone, but he didn\u2019t because he\u2019s lonely and that\u2019s what his generation does when the phone rings.\u201cReturned after a three-day trip to find receipts on the table for $300 worth of iTunes cards. Dad doesn\u2019t even know what iTunes is.\u201cSo a feeling of total helplessness. No legal authority in this country is able to protect our elderly from this kind of fraud.\u201d\u201cBeing the victim of financial fraud is often one of the first signs that someone is suffering from this disease [dementia]. Caller ID is of no use to someone who is beginning to lose their faculties.\u201cI watched my father deal with this on a daily basis for six years, screening phone calls, intercepting letters from fraudulent charities and contests (an average of about six per day), and doing other things to protect a relative with dementia.\u201cOne called back and told him to look out his front window; he was about to be killed by someone waiting outside.\u201d\u201cAs a young man I was trained as a collections agent by a major retailer. I was taught all manner of tactics to get people to pay their bills. We were paid a bonus and promoted if we got tough. There was no Fair Debt Collections Practices Act then, but still there were laws and our employer taught us to ignore them. I helped set up call centers in Madras, Bangalore and Bombay, so far back those places still had those old names.\u201cOver the years I\u2019ve also interviewed for jobs in the U.S. that involve scamming people over the phone. Never took the job, though. This kind of fraud doesn\u2019t just originate overseas. We need a stronger Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, yet the president-elect wants to gut the office.\u201d\u201cI do not ever, ever, ever answer a call from a number I don\u2019t recognize \u2014 ever, not at home, not on my cell, not at work. If it\u2019s important, and genuine, the caller usually leaves a message, and I return the call if I choose.\u201d\u201cOne time, with one of these I.R.S. Treasury calls, I was particularly incensed, knowing that these scammers were going to victimize more gullible people. So I called them back, and lectured the guy who answered. He hung up. So I called back again \u2014 and lucky me, the same guy answered the phone. Again, another lecture, and I worked to shame him as much as I could. He hung up.\u201cYeah, I called again \u2014 and, again, the same guy. This time I pointed out to him the sad futility of his life, pointing out how he clearly had some basic skills \u2014 good enunciation, good tone of voice \u2014 and how he could be working a legitimate job if he wanted to, yet he was pursuing life as a scam artist. He broke down crying, saying he had to pay his bills. But he got no sympathy from me.\u201d\u201cI was able to get the Microsoft scammers to stop by saying in a stern voice \u2018O.K., Detective \u2014 you\u2019re on the line? This is the fraudulent call I want you to trace,\u2019 and pressing any button on the keypad, which emits a tone that sounds like the start of a recording.\u201cI am convinced they target older people, thinking we are too stupid to realize these are phony calls.\u201d\u201cI get the \u2018Microsoft Support\u2019 calls fairly regularly. The usual pitch, \u2018We have detected that your PC is infected \u2026\u2019 My response is to play along: \u2018Oh, no! No, I am not in front of my PC right now \u2026,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going to put the phone down while my PC boots up \u2026\u2019\u201cThen I just put the phone down. I wait until I hear the scammer shouting themselves hoarse for me to come back to the phone.\u201cThen I ask them if their mother knows that they are working as a scammer. That\u2019s when they curse and hang up.\u201d\u201cThe approach I use when receiving such scamming phone calls is to say: Please give me your phone number and location, and I will have my attorney call you.\u201d\u201cIt happens in Canada, too. I was getting dozens of calls a day \u2014 really annoying as I work from home a lot. I let them go to voice mail except for once where I told the guy where to go. OMG! He really got mad. We\u2019re urged to report such incidents to the police. However, nothing stops it.\u201d\u201cGot a call from an Andrew McGowen, supposedly an F.B.I. agent informing me that my I.R.S. tax issues will cause me to be arrested in the next 24 hours if I did not send a gift card loaded with $2,500 immediately. His heavily accented English didn\u2019t seem right for someone of Irish heritage.\u201cHaving a little fun, I wasted as much of his time as I could, ending with a question: \u2018How is the weather in Mumbai today?\u2019 Silence.\u201d\u201cEvery week I get two or three early-morning scam calls from India, and I am sick of them. I get either the I.R.S. scam or the Microsoft computer virus scam. They have given me very negative feelings toward India.\u201d\u201cWhen I hear an Indian voice on the phone, I immediately distrust whoever it is. That is sad. These people are doing no service for their own country. They are giving India a bad reputation.\u201d\u201cI was the lucky recipient of probably 100 of these calls over several years, and I watched the scam evolve, with interest. At first, it was laughable: Guys with heavy accents, claiming to be \u2018Steve Martin\u2019 (seriously?), using language that was very British-influenced and awkward-sounding. After about three years, the caller became an educated sounding Indian woman, with the language and agency names considerably cleaned up. Then, the messages became computer generated so no accents and no names.\u201cI think we\u2019re unlikely to get smarter, but they can only get better at scamming.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed comments to one reader, Ellen D.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Every modern president makes a distinct mark on the look of the Oval Office, the most powerful room in the country. But the impact is temporary; it tends to fade shortly after the room\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next occupant arrives. As a result, every president since Gerald Ford has sought to preserve his decorative influence with a replica of the Oval Office at their presidential library.He turned his attention to the Oval Office in 2008, after coming across Umberto Eco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTravels in Hyperreality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which describes the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum in Austin and its replica of the Oval Office during Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration.Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s replica, like all those made for presidential libraries and museums, is as faithful as possible to the original, incorporating original items alongside exact copies. But in other environments, Oval Office interpretations are much looser, declining to refer to any one particular version of the space. In The Magic House, a children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s museum in St. Louis, the model features a lectern and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cName That President\u00e2\u0080\u009d display. Another reproduction, which Ron Wade built for $200,000 in his Longview, Texas home, serves as a showroom for his collection of presidential memorabilia. At Oregon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport, the office isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even oval (the back wall is, however, rounded).\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more recent ones are interactive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Grospierre said. \u201cYou can enter the space, you can pretend to be the president. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a continuum of illusion, which I think is very telling about the way we react to this phenomenon. We want so badly to believe it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Regardless of their accuracy, replicas are popular attractions. Part of the appeal, Mr. Grospierre speculated, may be the increasing visibility of the office in popular media. By his count, the office appeared in just 10 films between 1944 and 1982. That number ballooned in the 1990s and since the turn of the millennium it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appeared in dozens more. In that time, Mr. Grospierre estimated, more than 20 new replicas have been constructed.Mr. Grospierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compositions are nearly identical: a wide-angle view, with the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desk at the center of the frame. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an iconic perspective, Mr. Grospierre said, one viewers will easily recognize from movies and official White House photographs. The frames are, notably, unpopulated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with the exception of those made at Madame Tussauds wax museum in Hollywood, where a stiff semblance of the beaming president stands behind the desk, and in New York City, where the first lady joins him.Still, Mr. Grospierre pointed out that most of the office redesigns have been largely subtle. If anything, he said, the Oval Office has come to look less and less like a place of work and more like a cozy living room. That, he says, seems to suit a space whose principal feature \u00e2\u0080\u0094 its shape \u00e2\u0080\u0094 serves not only to project centrality and power, but also inclusion and democracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the Resolute Desk and the flags, you can easily imagine having a nice chat next to the fire there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of become more and more approachable in a way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
{"Headline": "In Graft Inquiry, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Worst Enemy May Be Himself", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 He has dominated the Israeli political scene for years, outmaneuvering or outlasting one opponent after another, the ultimate survivor in a system that has chewed up many of his predecessors.But after a nighttime visit by police investigators who read him his rights before asking him if he was corrupt, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now faces a new kind of challenge. The opponent who just might sink him is none other than Benjamin Netanyahu himself.Abraham Diskin, a political scientist at the Academic Center of Law and Science outside Tel Aviv who has advised Mr. Netanyahu, said on Tuesday that it was \u201cnot very clear that Netanyahu is going to escape some kind of indictment.\u201d And \u201conce there is an indictment,\u201d Professor Diskin added, \u201che will have to resign.\u201dDetails of the graft investigation remain murky \u2014 \u201cthe truth is that we don\u2019t know anything,\u201d Professor Diskin said \u2014 but the questions it raises are clear: Could an appetite for high living abetted by wealthy business executives ultimately undercut Mr. Netanyahu as it has so many other politicians in Israel and around the globe?Past inquiries stretching over Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s more than two decades in public life have examined his family trips and home expenses without resulting in charges. But allies and enemies alike were already saying on Tuesday that this case could be different.The three-hour police interrogation at his official residence on Monday night came at a high-profile moment for Mr. Netanyahu on the international stage.After years of grinding battle, he has engaged in a guns-blazing war with President Obama during the president\u2019s final weeks in office. At the same time, Mr. Netanyahu has been warmly embraced by President-elect Donald J. Trump, presenting a closer alignment than any other president-prime minister pairing in modern times.A conservative with a stable governing coalition, Mr. Netanyahu emerged from the police interrogation on Monday with a defiant blast at left-wing elites and the news media for prematurely counting him out. Appealing to supporters on the right, he dismissed the allegations against him, insisting they will all \u201ccome to nothing because there is nothing.\u201dBut the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, who was Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s choice for the post after a tour as his cabinet secretary, has been a paragon of caution, taking months to turn a preliminary inquiry into a criminal investigation, something that Israeli legal and political commentators said added weight to the suspicions.After the police investigators left Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s home late Monday, Mr. Mandelblit issued a statement close to midnight, vaguely outlining the contours of the case. It said Mr. Netanyahu was suspected of receiving gifts and benefits.By early Tuesday, Israelis were debating how all this might affect Mr. Netanyahu, whether sitting prime ministers should even be investigated, and if so, at what point they should resign.The months of multiple inquiries have centered on issues involving \u201cmoral integrity\u201d \u2014 a term that legal experts said could include suspicions of breach of trust, conflict of interest and bribery.\u201cBibi Tours \u2014 nothing! Claim of forbidden election funding \u2014 nothing!\u201d he wrote, describing reports in the Israeli news media over the years as \u201cdaily persecution of me and my family\u201d and \u201ccomplete gibberish.\u201dIsraeli law requires a prime minister to resign if convicted of serious crimes. But in a precedential ruling in 1993, the Israeli Supreme Court determined that a cabinet minister, Aryeh Deri, had to resign immediately after the attorney general submitted an indictment against him for corruption.\u201cIf everyone who faces an investigation would have to resign, this could turn into a tool used to politically destroy others,\u201d Ayelet Shaked, the justice minister, told Israel Radio. \u201cThis is why the idea that resigning should only be after an indictment is a correct one,\u201d she added.Monday was not the first time Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned as a criminal suspect while in office. During his first term, in the late 1990s, he was queried in a case that involved the appointment of an attorney general as part of what the police said was a political deal involving Mr. Deri. Mr. Netanyahu was never charged in that case, nor in several others for which he was investigated while out of office.Moshe Katsav, a former president, was recently released from prison after serving five years of a seven-year term for rape.Some of Mr. Olmert\u2019s supporters felt he was the victim of an overzealous state prosecutor, though many Israelis take pride in the fact that nobody is immune from the law.But with Netanyahu loyalists asserting that he is the victim of a political witch hunt, some right-wing legislators are now trying to advance a bill that would ban criminal investigations of incumbent prime ministers. (Any such legislation would likely come too late to spare Mr. Netanyahu.)Critics of the bill argue that such a ban would be problematic in a small country like Israel, and with a political system that has no term limit for prime ministers.\u201cIf prime ministers knew there would be an investigation only after their term was over, they would turn the prime minister\u2019s office into a safe haven and use the powers and resources of the state to extend their stay in office and avoid prosecution,\u201d said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research center in Jerusalem.Mr. Plesner, a former Parliament member, added that suspicions would still surface in the news media and if they were not formally investigated, public trust in political institutions could erode.When Mr. Olmert was under investigation, it was Mr. Barak, then his defense minister \u2014 though from a different political party \u2014 who pushed him to leave office. Israel\u2019s coalition governments have an inherent weakness, in that parties participating in the coalition are often also political rivals competing for votes in the next election.So far Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s party and coalition partners appear to be backing him, either voicing support or remaining silent.But the investigation could last for months, if not more, and that could create political strain.For now, Mr. Plesner said, \u201cwhoever is critical of Mr. Netanyahu will use this to continue to be critical, and his supporters will find their ways to interpret it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Should a Congregation Have Told a Betrayed Wife?", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byThe EthicistI was a member of a Christian congregation for many years. A married father of two children started helping a widow in the parish. Evidently, they later started seeing each other. His wife thought something was up, and she asked people in the congregation whom she considered friends if they knew anything. Everyone denied knowing anything. The father ended up divorcing his wife and marrying the widow. The wife subsequently found out that some of the people she had asked about the situation had lied to her face, even as she was breaking down in front of them. She says that for a long time she was suicidal \u2014 not because her husband had cheated on her but because she had been abandoned by everyone in the parish, which must have meant that God had abandoned her, too.Would those who lied to her have been culpable if she\u2019d killed herself? Although suicide isn\u2019t typically a rational response to difficult circumstances, we can be implicated when harm comes to others through our failure to act with appropriate care. So people who behaved in a way likely to upset a person they knew was suicidal might be partly culpable. But it\u2019s not, in general, reasonable to act on the assumption that people will commit suicide if they find out you have wronged them. This woman\u2019s line of thought \u2014 that abandonment by members of her church meant abandonment by God \u2014 is the sort of confused thinking that suicidal people often engage in. It\u2019s more a symptom of the problem than a cause of it. (Of course, you can feel bad because you were involved in a terrible outcome even though you can\u2019t be blamed for it: That\u2019s what philosophers call agent-regret.) Even putting aside this hypothetical tragedy, though, your fellow congregants have something to answer for.Are you obliged to do more? That depends mostly on two things. One is whether there\u2019s anything you can reasonably do that would change the norm. You have tried and failed here already, so you may think the answer is no. The second issue is what the costs to you would be. In your view, they might include a negative effect on your college admissions \u2014 a high cost, when the prospects of changing your friends\u2019 behavior are modest. (And getting into the right college will help you find a decent group of new friends!) So cut yourself some slack.At some point, though, you might try talking to people in your group one on one and in person. You\u2019d be doing a favor to your (perhaps soon to be ex-) friends and the people they\u2019ll interact with in the years ahead if you let them know, when you can, that what they\u2019re doing is shameful.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "In Florence, It\u2019s All About Pants. Big Pants.", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byCritic's Notebook\u201cOf course, we don\u2019t want pants,\u201d the straight-shooting designer said, as reported in Time magazine\u2019s Aug. 13 issue. \u201cMen are already ugly enough in them without having women wear them.\u201dSchiaparelli was correct. Trousers are ugly. Anyone who has visited places where a wrapped garment is the preferred covering for the lower half of the male anatomy can tell you that. Kilts, dhotis, lungi, sarongs, tunics and even the toga have obvious advantages over the two-legged garment that forfeits aesthetics to practicality in almost every case.Clearly, the incontinence crowd is not the Pitti Uomo demographic, where offerings for millennials far outstrip anything for the olds. Stylish young men with plenty of money will find more to suit them from Mr. Cucinelli than in previous seasons. One clear reason is that, while the proportions of his jackets and knitwear have altered little, the new forest-hued corduroy Cucinelli trousers are hemmed high, cuffed deep, worn low on the waist \u2014 and almost uniformly have a dropped crotch.\u201cTrousers must change,\u201d Mr. Cucinelli said at the fair, where his booth, decorated like the interior of a yacht, commanded a premium location in the main pavilion. \u201cYou can\u2019t wear last year\u2019s trousers.\u201dInstagram has something to do with that, Mr. Cucinelli added. Anyone prospecting for style information has only to dip into the visual slipstream. That is not necessarily a good thing, if you were hoping to get more than a season out of a pair of pants.Not long ago, Mr. Cucinelli attended a Facebook dinner in California, and to his surprise, found that the sneakers-and-hoodies stereotypes that attach to tech moguls no longer seemed to hold true.While, in some years, everything interesting about men\u2019s clothing took place above the waist, currently the lower half of the body is getting the attention.Mr. Bianchi was alluding to the tailored precision required to get the shape and proportions of trousers correct. \u201cThere are three people in the business who talk this language,\u201d he said, referring to the fine points of trouser tailoring. \u201cAnd hundreds who don\u2019t care.\u201dA split waistband with a narrow snake of rubber inside to grip a shirttail; a viscose face lining within the legs; a notch for a belt fastener; a coin compartment hidden within a pocket; and a cotton crotch guard to eliminate chafe are just a few of the 120 elements that go into properly producing a garment that costs $500 and requires three miles of thread to create.Regardless of the unusually various remix he came up with for a collection that was smart and stylistically taut \u2014 and that owed, as Mr. Hilfiger candidly said, a debt to Demna Gvasalia\u2019s work at the influential label Vetements \u2014 the silhouettes and proportions were slouchy and relaxed across the board.Trousers were higher in the waist and wider in the leg than they have been since the precocious hip-hop consumers who once constituted his base took his preppy gear and made it hip by wearing it supersize.Tokyo is leading the trend for this fuller proportion, and it is probably the Japanese we can also thank for the overall eastward tilt of this influential fair.If it was not notably original, the show was slickly styled. Perhaps the best combination was a quilted olive drab varsity jacket worn over a T-shirt and royal blue hoodie, with a white piped tunic that read as a dress.Sure, there were trousers \u2014 a pair of khakis. Yet so inessential were they to the effect of the outfit or the overall skew of the show \u2014 one in which gender blur was so much a through line that it occurred to this viewer Mr. Coppens has begun his transition to women\u2019s wear \u2014 they seemed like an afterthought.The temptation exists to carp about the designer dragging people to the outskirts of Florence and penning them behind gates in the bitter cold before admitting them to a space with all the singularity of a high school homeroom.Location experiments are an essential aspect of Pitti Uomo, though, and a few minutes of discomfort pale by comparison with the rich opportunities offered to fortunate fairgoers, one lavish event capping another all week. As if a cocktail party with L\u2019Uomo Vogue on the rooftop of the 15th-century Palazzo Strozzi amid installations by Ai Weiwei were not enough, there was a dinner at Mr. Cucinelli\u2019s invitation in the greenhouse of what was said to be the largest private garden in Europe.The Swedish shirt maker Eton held a dance party one evening to celebrate a collection the designer Sebastian Dollinger said had been inspired by happy, youthful days of druggie raves. As a sober counterpoint, the anniversary of Stefano Ricci \u2014 a staid tailoring house that, while it caters to the oligarch set, was begun 45 years ago by Mr. Ricci on a sewing table in his parents\u2019 dressmaking atelier \u2014 was commemorated with a seated dinner of beef cheeks and ravioli timbales cooked by the most starred chef in Florence and served in the refurbished Sala Bianca at the Pitti Palace. Dessert was a deceptively simple chocolate stick served with olive oil and salt flakes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Your Digital Life Ready for Your Death?", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byYou\u2019ve probably thought about what will happen to your finances, your possessions and maybe even your real estate when you die. But what about your Facebook account? Or your hard-drive backups?For the past two decades, most of us in the modern world have gradually shifted our central living space online. That\u2019s 20-ish years of documenting our real-life experiences while also creating entirely new versions of ourselves in countless places online.These digital lives are basically immortal, so you may as well figure out while you\u2019re still alive what will happen to them after you\u2019re gone.There are two main things to consider: What will happen to your accounts and what will happen to the data contained therein. For example, you can give someone authority to delete your Google account and to download all your photos stored there after you die.It\u2019s a grim thought, but like writing a last will and testament, this has become just another part of death preparation.Many online spaces offer some form of death planning. But this is still a relatively new concept, and some of the most popular destinations on the internet don\u2019t give users a way to plan for their death. In that case, it\u2019s best to establish a plan now with a trusted loved one.For the websites and services that do offer help, here\u2019s what to know.This person will be able to write a post that will remain at the top of your profile, update your profile photo and respond to friend requests. You can also allow that person to download an archive of your public activity (including posts, photos and \u201clikes\u201d), but he or she can\u2019t read your messages, so your most intimate secrets will be safe.Alternatively, you can set your account to delete everything once Facebook is notified of your death.To set this up, choose an amount of time between sign-ins for your account to be designated \u201cinactive.\u201d Once that threshold is met (for example, you don\u2019t sign into any Google service for a certain number of months), your chosen contact will get a prewritten email from you with, presumably, your wishes for your account.Unlike your legacy contact on Facebook, you can designate this person to have full access to your Google account, including email and chat histories, and he or she can download the data you specify. (You also have the option not to give that person access to any of it.)Google also allows you to delete your account and all its data.A similar protocol is in place in the event a user becomes incapacitated, though in that case someone will have to have proof of power of attorney.These three networks offer no type of death planning, though all offer some form of account management for the deceased.Snapchat said it can delete the account of a deceased person at the request of a next-of-kin (with a death certificate).And Tumblr will let a next-of-kin request that an account be deleted.Snapchat and Tumblr declined to say whether they\u2019ll eventually add a similar legacy-contact feature, and LinkedIn said it\u2019s \u201cconsidering\u201d some form of death planning or account memorialization.Beyond that, many sites (including Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL) have relatively standard protocols in place for immediate family members to request the deletion of a deceased person\u2019s account.Online data storage is an especially tricky part of death planning. The industrywide push for privacy and encryption, while great for personal protection, has created its own problems.\u201cThere\u2019s a very real security and privacy implication that can somewhat conflict\u201d with online death planning, said Ahin Thomas, the vice president of marketing for Backblaze, an online backup service. \u201cIf you set up a private encryption key \u2014 we\u2019re not joking \u2014 we don\u2019t have access.\u201dIn one recent case, a widow contacted the company for access to her late husband\u2019s backups, but the data was inaccessible because it had been encrypted.\u201cIt was heartbreaking and sad, and I wish we could\u2019ve done something,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cBut the stuff was encrypted.\u201dSo what can we do? The best advice, Mr. Thomas said, is to simply give the keys to your data to someone you trust. (Some backup services have protocols in place for this. Check with yours.)Advertisement"}

Even people who are here on green cards, legally. Citizens. They\u2019re scared.\u201dSome technology companies have started warning their investors of potential threats to their business from the changes. In a filing on Thursday with securities regulators related to its quarterly financial results, Microsoft included new language related to immigration.\u201cChanges to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts,\u201d the company said in the filing.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in a statement that the company believes \u201cin a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system and in broader immigration opportunities for talented and law-abiding young people like the Dreamers,\u201d a reference to young people who entered the country illegally as children but were allowed to remain by President Barack Obama.\u201cWe are a nation of immigrants, and we all benefit when the best and brightest from around the world can live, work and contribute here,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cI hope we find the courage and compassion to bring people together and make this world a better place for everyone.\u201dThe technology industry is open to changes that have been proposed by members of Congress to better enforce the skilled worker program and adjust limits on the number of visas. But the companies see skilled worker visas as a signature policy issue that they have fought to protect and expand.They fear Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, and others in the administration will take a more severe approach to immigration and sweep up H-1B visas into prohibitions on refugees and stronger border protection.\u201cThe effect would end up being exactly the opposite of what Trump wants. Companies would go offshore like Microsoft did with Vancouver, Canada\u201d to seek talent, said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research group sponsored by several tech firms.But Mr. Trump has made it increasingly clear that immigration policy may change drastically.Any changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, initiated under the Obama administration, could have significant effects on current tech employees who fear for their status.\u201cRight now, we are focused on making sure for protections for 750,000 Dreamers who have DACA stay in place,\u201d said Todd Schulte, president of Fwd.us, in an interview. \u201cIf the goal is to increase public safety and prevent future illegal immigration, the way to do that is to modernize the legal immigration process. That\u2019s radically different than a large-scale ramp-up of rapid deportation.\u201dThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Start-Up New York Gets a New Name, and a Focus on Start-Ups", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported bySome kind of revision appears to be at hand. Tucked among the policy prescriptions and infrastructure plans in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s state budget proposal this week were several changes to Start-Up that narrowed the program\u2019s focus to true start-ups and reduced the number of jobs companies were required to create to qualify for tax benefits.And the program had a new name: the Excelsior Business Program, a rebranding that carries some irony. Instead of allowing businesses of any size to apply, the program will now be open only to what most people would define as start-ups \u2014 small companies in their formative stages \u2014 in a move aimed at encouraging the next Google or Facebook to hatch in New York State.Currently, businesses are required to create at least one new job each year to remain in the program, which exempts companies operating in certain tax-free zones from all taxes for up to a decade; under the new proposal, the requirement would fall to creating one new job in the first five years the company is in the program.Empire State Development, the state agency that oversees the program as well as the governor\u2019s other economic development efforts, will be required to update the public on the initiative, as well as a related program known as Empire Jobs, once a year.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has not budged from his support for Start-Up, and the state insisted this week that the program would produce more than 4,000 new jobs over the next several years. State officials say the lower requirement for yearly job creation should allow companies to focus on growing rather than on hitting specific job targets, and argue that the companies will generate so little revenue at first that any taxes the state would pass up in exchange would be negligible.\u201dThis program remains in place and the proposed adjustments, which are based on feedback from businesses, will help it reach its full potential,\u201d Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Empire State Development, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain firmly committed to the model \u2014 innovative academia-business partnerships coupled with performance-based, tax-free incentives.\u201dThe program will still require young businesses to move to tax-free zones, most of them near universities, in the hope that academic centers, with their students, research and equipment, will help seed economic growth. Under the new proposal, companies that add enough jobs during the tax-free period can qualify for even more tax benefits in later years under a sibling program called Excelsior Jobs, which officials hope will induce successful companies to stay in New York as they grow.\u201cIt was never the scale to be a really transformative program,\u201d said E. J. McMahon, the president of the Empire Center. \u201cThe governor basically made it a lightning rod for attention and criticism.\u201dHe said he thought the state\u2019s faith that entrepreneurs would move to and stay in New York State seemed unrealistic. \u201cWhat if they get acquired by a company from California?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re still pretending that they\u2019re venture capitalists who can spot a unicorn, and unicorns will grow generally quite oblivious to whether they\u2019re offering financing in a tax-free zone.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information from a spokesman, misstated the time period over which the Excelsior Business Program intended to create more than 4,000 jobs. It is a period of three to five years, not five.An earlier version of this article misstated how often Empire State Development was required to provide the public with updates on Start-Up New York.

But I am grateful that M.T.A. is doing this, as I\u2019m sure it will improve safety, especially late at night,\u201d she said, referring to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Lily Jen, 25, of Sunnyside, Queens, was concerned about the security of the Wi-Fi network: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be doing any banking on the subway.\u201dFor now, cellphone service and Wi-Fi are mostly confined to subway stations and don\u2019t yet reach the tunnels \u2014 a problem that riders like Brandon Phillips, 29, of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, say they hope will be resolved.\u201cAny truly relevant Wi-Fi service should be available on the trains themselves,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re too busy getting around in the stations to benefit from just station Wi-Fi.\u201dPhone calls on trains?

{"Headline": "Transgender Women Fear Abuse in Immigration Detention", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 Nina Chaubal and her wife, Greta Martela, thought about going through the Rocky Mountains on their way to Chicago from San Diego late last month, but did not want to risk getting caught in a snowstorm. So they drove south through Arizona, where Ms. Chaubal, an Indian national with an invalid work visa, fell into the hands of the Border Patrol.But as a transgender woman, she said she was afraid of what could happen to her while in custody.As she stepped inside the jail on Dec. 30, Ms. Chaubal said she wondered, \u201cIs this what\u2019s waiting for me?\u201dMs. Chaubal, a former software engineer for Google, resumed her trip to Chicago as soon as she was released from Eloy, four days after her arrival. She walked out \u201cfeeling privileged to be able to get out so quickly, and in one piece,\u201d she said in an interview.Others have not been so fortunate. Karyna Jaramillo, a transgender woman from Mexico living in Phoenix without authorization, spent nearly two weeks among male detainees in Eloy in 2015, so fearful for her safety that she said she considered suicide.\u201cThe men whistled, screamed obscenities at me,\u201d Ms. Jaramillo, 46, said. \u201cThey\u2019d touch their genitals and say, \u2018Here comes fresh meat.\u2019\u201dNo one abused her, she said through tears. \u201cBut the emotional trauma, I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\u201cThe abuse, the mistreatment, they are not aberrations,\u201d Mr. Morris said.The question of how to best protect transgender women in immigration detention has confounded federal authorities for some time. In 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 known by its acronym, ICE \u2014 for the first time recognized transgender detainees as a vulnerable population, albeit a small one. According to statistics provided by the agency to The New York Times, among the approximately 41,000 immigrants in custody on Tuesday, 53 identified as transgender.There are guidelines to allow transgender detainees to continue their hormone treatments and be placed in units based on the gender they identify with.While acknowledging the changes, lawyers and advocates say mistreatment and abuse endure. A client of Immigration Equality told her lawyers that she was assaulted in the Hudson County Correctional Facility in Kearny, N.J., on Dec. 21 and was transferred to another detention center in the state afterward, Mr. Morris said.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of training that\u2019s necessary for them to overcome the deep lack of knowledge and understanding about our community and treat us with dignity and respect,\u201d said Ms. Guti\u00e9rrez, who is transgender.Many transgender men and women flee to the United States in search of protection from torture, sexual violence and other types of persecution in their home countries.That is why Ms. Jaramillo, a director at Trans Queer Pueblo in Phoenix, said she left Mexico. She did not, however, petition for asylum. (She said she was not aware it was an option.) She said she landed in immigration detention after a drunken-driving arrest by the local police.She met Ms. Martela, a contract software engineer at the time, while working for Google. They married in San Francisco in the spring of 2015, just before they moved to Chicago to work on Trans Lifeline full time, Ms. Chaubal said.Ms. Chaubal said she had been working on completing her application to adjust her immigration status when she was detained.She always carries her Illinois driver\u2019s license when she travels. That is the document she showed to the Border Patrol agent who stopped their van at the checkpoint near Yuma, Ariz., on Dec. 28.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing if I had left the country and crossed into Mexico,\u201d Ms. Chaubal said. \u201cBut I\u2019m in California, driving down the interstate. There\u2019s this checkpoint in front of us and everything changes.\u201d\u201cWhat would have happened if we hadn\u2019t been able to mobilize so many people, get a lawyer, raise money?\u201d Ms. Martela said. \u201cWhat if we didn\u2019t have the connections that we do?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of immigrants in custody who identified as transgender and misstated the day of that census.

{"Headline": "Under Taliban Siege, a Doctor\u2019s Trial by Fire", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported byKUNDUZ, Afghanistan \u2014 The Taliban controlled the nearby streets and bullets were popping in the dark when Dr. Marzia Salam Yaftali\u2019s neighbors in Kunduz City turned to her for help.Their relative had gone into labor with twins and was having trouble, the streets to the hospital were blocked, and Dr. Yaftali was their best hope. With urban battle all around, she took the risk of leaving her two young children at home to try to save three lives.But on that evening last fall, the doctor did not feel like a hero \u2014 she felt guilty. Her place was at Kunduz Regional Hospital, where she was the chief doctor, directing her staff members as they handled a wave of casualties. But they had begged her to stay home, feeling she would be at risk if the Taliban or even the militiamen fighting them found a woman in charge.\u201cI still struggle with that feeling \u2014 why I was not able to come to the hospital that day,\u201d Dr. Yaftali said in an interview at the hospital months later. \u201cI am still uncomfortable.\u201dFor female health workers in Afghanistan, the risk is compounded by the traditional beliefs of a society that still struggles with the notion of women in the workplace.The Taliban, despite their statements that they have reconsidered their position on female education and women in the work force, have not behaved that way in practice.The 300-bed Kunduz Regional Hospital was built on German donations but is run by the Afghan government. Dr. Yaftali, a gynecologist, was at home the morning of Oct. 3 when the Taliban entered the city.\u201cI called the director of the hospital. I told him that I would come to the hospital even if it rains fire,\u201d Dr. Yaftali said. \u201cHe told me: \u2018How will you come to the hospital? There is no way to get here.\u2019\u201dThe director, a burly surgeon, Mohammed Naim Mangal, expressed another fear over the phone: Many of the staff members had fled already, and Dr. Yaftali would be the only woman if she made it to the hospital. There was risk to her not only from the extremist Taliban, but also from the unruly militias fighting on behalf of the government.At the hospital, about two dozen staff members remained, working nonstop for more than a week. They ran out of food quickly, surviving on boiled rice. Their trips to the medicine depot around the corner from the main building were daunting operations that brought them under fire several times.Their task became only more difficult after mortar shells hit the hospital and patients had to be moved from some of the rooms to the hallways. At the peak of the fighting, hospital employees were treating more than 300 wounded people.Stuck at home, Dr. Yaftali essentially took over the public relations campaign for a hospital under fire. She spoke to radio stations and newspapers and regularly updated her Facebook page with urgent calls to both sides not to fire on the hospital, and notices to the public about which facilities were still functioning.\u201cOthers in Kunduz were looking for water, and I was after a liter of gas \u2014 to make sure I could turn on the generator to charge my phone so I am updated on what is happening at the hospital,\u201d she recalled.Then, one night around 9 o\u2019clock, she heard a knock at her gate and the voices of her neighbors outside. Their pregnant relative, a 30-year-old named Fatima, was in intense pain and desperately needed help.Dr. Yaftali said she had first examined Fatima, who had traveled to Kunduz from an outlying a district, a couple weeks before and knew that natural birth would be difficult. One of the babies was large and in what she described as \u201cshoulder presentation.\u201dThe streets outside were a battlefield. Both sides fired at anyone caught in between.\u201cI was nervous \u2014 how could I go to the house of the neighbor, and their house was just 100 or 200 meters away from mine?\u201d Dr. Yaftali said. \u201cOn the other hand, if I don\u2019t go to their house, what will the mother do? She came to our area and close to me, and she hoped I would help her, I would take care of her.\u201dShe braved the street, and when she got to the house, Fatima was already giving birth on the floor to the first child. The second child, however, was stuck, and the mother was in agony.Dr. Yaftali intervened to try to reposition the baby for a safer delivery. But her patient\u2019s pain was intolerable.\u201cI don\u2019t have any medical equipment with me \u2014 my hands are empty,\u201d Dr. Yaftali recalled. \u201cI worked for them like a local midwife. There was no place to do a cesarean or an operation. Professionally, a cesarean was needed.\u201dThe provincial police chief was called, and he sent an armored vehicle to the house to transport Fatima to the hospital. But the woman\u2019s relatives would not let her go without them, and would not go themselves because of the risk: At the time, civilians were frequently hit by crossfire, and reports of corpses being left on the streets were circulating.\u201cTheir logic was this: We can sacrifice one mother, but we cannot sacrifice several family members by going with you to the hospital,\u201d Dr. Yaftali said.So she sent the police chief\u2019s armored car back to the hospital to bring drugs and medical equipment, and she tried again to help deliver the baby. But she knew the second infant was lost, and there was little she could do other than try to reduce Fatima\u2019s risk and pain.Dr. Yaftali went back home to her two children, the youngest just 6 months old. And in the morning, after the fighting quieted a little, Fatima was able to go to the hospital for treatment, but with just one of her children alive.\u201cIt was very painful for me. The scene was not tolerable, as I saw a child dying in the womb of the mother, and I was not able to help him, to help him even a bit,\u201d Dr. Yaftali said. \u201cThat was the darkest night, and I will never forget.\u201dAfter the Taliban were cleared out, Dr. Yaftali returned to her work. Her Facebook page, after a last plea to all the hospital workers who had fled the city to return, returned to her usual dose of medical advice to her readers.To this day, though, she is racked by remorse.\u201cThe day the fighting quieted down, my suggestion to the hospital and the Ministry of Health was that the first thing I do is resign,\u201d Dr. Yaftali said.The officials turned down her resignation, though, praising her service from home and the fact that she had helped put a system in place at the hospital that had held up even in her absence.Fatima, for one, will never forget her.\u201cIn a time that no one could be relied on, the doctor came, and she went through so much trouble with me,\u201d Fatima said in an interview. \u201cHow can I not be thankful to her? Everyone was trying to get out of Kunduz, and Dr. Marzia came to help me.\u201dNajim Rahim and Fahim Abed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Where Does Cloud Storage Really Reside? And Is It Secure?\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byAsk The TimesA reader asks: \u201cWhere does cloud storage really reside? And is it secure?\u201d_____\u201cCloud\u201d data is stored on hard drives (much the way data is usually stored). And yes, it\u2019s probably more secure than conventionally stored data.What makes cloud storage different? Instead of being stored directly on your own personal device (the hard drive on your laptop, for example, or your phone), cloud-based data is stored elsewhere \u2014 on servers owned by big companies, usually \u2014 and is made accessible to you via the internet.When people think of cloud computing, they often think of internet-connected public clouds run by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. (If you use Gmail, Dropbox or Microsoft\u2019s Office 365, you are using a cloud service.) There are also consumer clouds that, for example, hold your pictures and social media posts (think of Facebook or Twitter), or store your music and email (think of Apple or Google).Each of these companies has cloud computing systems \u2014 computer servers and storage devices, connected with computer networking equipment \u2014 that span the globe. (Facebook\u2019s systems can allow more than one billion people to interact with them.) Your data is in their computers, usually stored in a regional data center close to where you live.Individual companies can also have their own clouds, called private clouds, that employees and customers access, usually over the internet and on their own private networks.Storage aside, computing clouds can also process information differently; they have special software that enables workloads to be shared among different machines. Your Facebook photos, for example, don\u2019t have a permanent home on a specific chip, but may move among computers.That is a big deal. When workloads are shared, computers can run closer to full capacity, with several programs going at the same time. It\u2019s much more efficient than stand-alone computers running one job at a time.For the people running the computers, it doesn\u2019t really matter where the data or the programs are at any one moment: The stuff is running inside a \u201ccloud\u201d of computing capability. Ideally, if one machine fails, the operation moves over to another part of the system with little downtime.Nowadays, computing clouds are everywhere \u2014 which is one reason people worry about their security. We hear more and more often about hackers coming over the internet and looting the data of thousands of people.Most of those attacks hit traditional servers, though. None of the most catastrophic hacks have been on the big public clouds.The same way that your money is probably safer mixed up with other people\u2019s money in a bank vault than it is sitting alone in your dresser drawer, your data may actually be safer in the cloud: It\u2019s got more protection from bad guys.In the case of the big public clouds, the protection is the work of some of the world\u2019s best computer scientists, hired out of places like the National Security Agency and Stanford University to think hard about security, data encryption and the latest online fraud.And they\u2019re pretty good at keeping things safe online.At least, they have been so far.__________Have a question for Ask The Times?

Maynard owns a used-car lot in Genoa, W.Va. He used to work on the pit crew of a drag racing team. He is also a freshman state senator and was an early fan of Mr. Trump, serving as co-chairman of his West Virginia campaign team.I am a national correspondent with The New York Times, originally from New Orleans, and Mark was kind enough to let me drive with him to Washington, where he will be attending Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.A lifelong Republican, Mark has always appreciated Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt talk \u2014 a style he describes as \u201cnot being afraid to say what you feel and not worry so much about being politically correct.\u201dBut Mark, who in 2014 became a politician himself when he was elected to the West Virginia State Senate, can also seem more measured than the president-elect. I ask: Do you agree that there should be a ban on Muslims entering the country?\u201cHmm,\u201d he says. \u201cI would agree that a serious vetting process should take place.\u201dDo you agree with building a wall at the Mexican border?\u201cMmm,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, and I\u2019m not trying to be all politically correct here, but let me think about that for a minute.\u201dThat\u2019s fine. We have seven hours in the car to kill.Miles driven: 0. Miles to go: 447._____The Jaguar is tailing Mark\u2019s brother-in-law\u2019s white Cadillac Escalade, which is adorned with a Trump bumper sticker and one saying \u201c1.20.17: Obama\u2019s Last Day.\u201d It has a Confederate battle flag on the plug of the hitch hole, a Confederate flag license plate holder and a Confederate flag-themed sticker of the South Carolina palmetto. (His brother-in-law does a lot of fishing on the Carolina coast.)\u201cAssociate that flag with my sister, because I don\u2019t have it on anything I have, except the General Lee,\u201d Mark says. He is referring to his near-perfect replica of the 1969 Dodge Charger, adorned with a Confederate flag on the roof, that was driven by the main characters in the TV show \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard.\u201dI imagine we will talk more about that, too.Miles driven: 7. Miles to go: 440._____\u201cHave you ever ordered food on a touch screen?\u201d Mark asks. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d But he also sees something troubling about the technology. He has heard that a certain fast-food chain might ditch employees in favor of touch screens if the minimum wage ever goes to $15 an hour.In West Virginia, the minimum wage is $8.75 an hour. Mark\u2019s State Senate district, which covers Mercer County and parts of Wayne, Mingo and McDowell Counties, is racked with poverty, largely owing to the decline of the coal industry. Thousands of people are trying to get by on the minimum wage.Mark knows it is not easy. But he also believes that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201cBusinesses will just increase their prices, and it really won\u2019t get us anywhere in the long run,\u201d he says. \u201cI think capitalism should prevail.\u201dHe builds his touch-screen breakfast: a cheeseburger and fries. His daughter, Morgan, 15, orders a slice of cheese pizza.The family members riding in the Escalade come in, looking eager to tackle the open road: his brother-in-law, Daron Dean, 51, the owner of an asphalt company; Daron\u2019s wife, Lisa, also 51, and their daughter Elizabeth, 16.Back on the freeway, the lanes are roaring with cars and trucks. We are somewhere between Huntington and Charleston, the two largest cities in the state. We stream by clusters of small, modest midcentury houses, a trailer park, a car lot, and gnarled and naked trees.Miles driven: 33. Miles to go: 414._____Unlike his brother-in-law, Mark is not much of a fishing guy, or a hunting guy, or even a football guy, though he was raised in the country.But he is a car guy. Big-time. He has a collection of cars, apart from the car lot \u2014 Maynard\u2019s Auto World \u2014 including the replica General Lee; a metallic red \u201994 Trans Am convertible; a gold \u201971 Chevelle, which he restored at age 19; and an old Jeep CJ5 with huge tires and a racing engine.Those are just a few. \u201cIf you want me to keep going, I can,\u201d he says.For years, Mark worked on the crew of a professional drag racing team. He quit after his election to the State Senate \u2014 an underdog story not unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s. His opponent was Harry Truman Chafin, a Democrat who had represented the district since 1982.It was also another sign of how tenuous the Democrats\u2019 position had grown in West Virginia. The year he won, Republicans gained the majority in both legislative houses for the first time since the Great Depression.Miles driven: 52.

And the pregnant woman\u2019s current boyfriend was a white racist, she told me. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want it in the house,\u201d the driver said, referring to the baby.I ask Mark how common that kind of overt racism is in his district. \u201cAs far as expressing it, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s that prevalent,\u201d he says. \u201cInner thoughts, maybe a little more.\u201dHe says that his district has a relatively small percentage of African-Americans. He tells me that President Obama is to blame for some of the country\u2019s racial discord.\u201cI do think America saw a bit of racism through the anti-racism efforts of the president,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, he was trying to let everyone know that we\u2019re all the same.

Miles to go: 240._____This year, Mark\u2019s daughter, Morgan, switched from a public school to a Christian private school, where creationism is taught alongside the theory of evolution; the science textbooks are provided by Bob Jones University. She has a lot more work at the private school, she says; specifically, the math is harder. Morgan is concerned about the kids she left at her old school, and she wonders whether they are being adequately prepared for the future.Elizabeth, Morgan\u2019s cousin, attends a Catholic school but is also enrolled at Ashland Community Technical College. She will earn a two-year associate degree in May. She plans to earn a four-year degree while she works at her father\u2019s asphalt business.Daron, her father, has taught Elizabeth how to operate a road grader, a paver and a roller. He taught her how to hunt with guns and with a bow. He taught her how to fly fish. In their house is a room with pine siding, hickory floors and oak trusses supporting a ceiling 28 feet high. It feels almost like a cathedral. On the walls are a stuffed menagerie of Elizabeth\u2019s hunting trophies: elk, wild turkey, deer, antelope and a mountain goat.Lisa, her mother, grew up in Echo, W.Va.: \u201cVery rural,\u201d she said. She helps run the asphalt company, as well as their two side businesses: a fly fishing resort and a hunting guide service. She collects antiques, particularly those that hark to a lost West Virginia past. \u201cShe has a passion for old gas pumps,\u201d her husband says.Miles driven: 210.

He is mostly on this trip, he says, to defend his wife and daughter. He hopes that nothing gets ugly, but you never know. These are tense times.His father was in the asphalt business. Daron started his own company in 1987 and worked hard at it. The first 13 years, he never took a vacation outside of West Virginia.Things changed for him two years ago: He and Lisa own 3,000 acres of land, and a rich vein of oil shale was discovered beneath it. They sold the mineral rights and decided to slow down and enjoy life more.He had the 28-foot-high room added onto the front of his house. He makes more time for hunting and fishing. He bought a muscle car, a Dodge Challenger Hellcat with a 707-horsepower engine.But he says he got lucky: He\u2019d be making less today than when President Obama took office if the shale deposit hadn\u2019t been found.\u201cWhen I found out that Donald Trump was going to run, it was immediate \u2014 I was like, \u2018Hell yes,\u2019\u201d Daron says. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I would have been on the Trump train if I hadn\u2019t have watched \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 so much. He came on there a lot, and everything he said makes sense.\u201dHe says businesses like his are overregulated and overtaxed. An unsecured southern border scares him. He says the United States needs to \u201cwrap our arms around Israel.\u201dI ask: Do you support the Israeli government allowing Jewish settlements to be built in the West Bank?\u201cI\u2019m not on that enough to say,\u201d he says. \u201cBut good friends are hard to come by.\u201dHe believes it is time for the country to rally around its new president, even his critics. \u201cIf they live in this country, by God, they need to wrap their head around it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they better embrace it, \u2019cause here he comes.\u201dMiles driven: 300.

Craig Morgan\u2019s \u201cA Whole Lot More to Me.\u201dShe was also an early Trump supporter. It had much to do with the way he spoke, she says \u2014 the way he didn\u2019t seem to care whom he offended when he opened his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s just been irritating to me,\u201d she says, the way people tiptoe around with their language, afraid to offend anyone. Last night at dinner, her daughter Elizabeth said people seemed to be saying \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d more at the mall this year instead of \u201cHappy Holidays.\u201d The theory was that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory had something to do with it.Asked about the Confederate flags on the Escalade, Lisa explains them partly as a nod to Civil War history, but even more as something signifying good old country boys, riding in trucks and raising a little Cain: \u201cDoing what you want, but just an enjoying-life kind of thing,\u201d she says. \u201cMe and Mark grew up watching \u2018The Dukes of Hazzard\u2019 every Friday night.\u201dWhen the TV Land network pulled reruns of the show after the massacre of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., it felt like an affront. \u201cOn the show they prayed before they had supper,\u201d she says. \u201cThey respected their elders.\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am, no ma\u2019am,\u201d Mark says.\u201cRight!\u201d she says. \u201cThey gave to charity.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Mark says. \u201cAnd just because they had the rebel flag on their car, they just ignored all of that.\u201dMiles driven: 377.

He remembers when people complained about the traffic caused by coal trucks. Now, he says, people shoot cellphone photos of them, as if glimpsing an endangered species.Mark was co-chairman of the Trump campaign in his state. But it was not a heavy lift: Mr. Trump promised to bring back coal. Hillary Clinton warned that some coal companies would go out of business.There is some doubt that Mr. Trump will be able to bring about a coal renaissance with cheaper, cleaner-burning natural gas so abundant. But Mark thinks that coal can grow again if unshackled from onerous federal environmental regulations.Earlier, I asked him if he believed that human activity was linked to the warming planet. He said he didn\u2019t believe it.Now, he finishes the thought: When he drives a convertible in the country at night, it can feel cool, he says, but in the city it can feel warmer \u2014 \u201cI figure, due to the increased amount of asphalt and brick buildings,\u201d which retain heat.I don\u2019t quite follow this.\u201cAl Gore will love me, won\u2019t he?\u201d he says.I show Mark a newspaper article published Tuesday: \u201cEarth Sets a Temperature Record for the Third Straight Year.\u201dMark says that the climate is subject to natural fluctuations.Miles driven: 395.

If you\u2019re among them, you\u2019ll likely give, or receive, artfully decorated red envelopes filled with cash.Giving \u201chong bao\u201d or \u201clai see,\u201d as they are called in Mandarin and Cantonese, comes with many rules. Break them and you can risk causing family rifts.Typically, only married relatives hand out envelopes, and only spouseless, younger family members receive them. At work, they are typically given to subordinates as a sign of recognition.Sometimes, giving too much can be as disrespectful as giving too little.Ideally, the money inside should be unused. Before the holiday, banks struggle to accommodate long lines of customers demanding fresh bills.Technology is changing the tradition. WeChat, a widely used social platform on smartphones, allows for the digital transfer of red envelopes.

Journalists, poets, intellectuals and many politicians who questioned the state were labeled traitors, sometimes jailed or exiled, and on occasion killed. Almost every Pakistani government \u2014 military or civilian \u2014 has tried to control and manipulate the news media.That kind of control has become more difficult as print and electronic media have expanded in the past decade and a half. Since the deregulation of electronic media in 2002, Pakistan has gone from three to 89 television channels. The state\u2019s monopoly of the airwaves is over. Noisy talk shows regularly challenge the elected governments and their policies. But when it comes to the military, journalists and commentators are cautious, often indulging in self-censorship. Laws governing freedom of speech and the news media are vague, and their enforcement is arbitrary; critics are often accused of endangering national security.The rise of social media and blogs has further expanded the space for dissent. Pakistanis can say on Facebook things they still could not get away with on television or in print. The missing activists, for example, were allegedly affiliated with satirical Facebook pages that ridiculed the hypocrisy of religious clerics and the flawed state policies of using jihad to further foreign policy goals.The exact relationship between these right-wing loudmouths and the security services remains, as ever in Pakistan, murky. But these activists\u2019 lives are most likely in danger. In 2011, a police guard killed Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab Province, because he had publicly defended a Christian woman sentenced to death under the blasphemy law, a law he said needed to be reformed.By cracking down on people opining on social media, Pakistan joins Turkey, Bangladesh, China and other countries where journalists and activists are hounded by the state and by extremists. Pakistan\u2019s elites, both civilian and military, frequently complain that their country has an image problem. Such disappearances certainly don\u2019t help. Moreover, in an interconnected world, such moves are counterproductive. The elected government of Pakistan must be held accountable for such brazen curtailment of rights. The Parliament needs to review the scope of internet freedoms as well as reconsider the nebulous guarantee of free speech provided by the Constitution.The international community should help, too. It can remind the Pakistani government of its obligations under the United Nations Convention against Torture and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to put an end to enforced disappearances. In its 2015 compliance report on the civil rights covenant, the government stated that it was \u201cfirmly committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u201d It is time to move beyond lip service. Upholding freedom of speech will only bolster Pakistan\u2019s fragile democracy.But most of all, these missing men should be returned home safely as soon as possible.Raza Rumi, who teaches at Ithaca College and the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs, is a consulting editor for The Friday Times, a weekly in Pakistan, and the author of \u201cThe Fractious Path: Pakistan\u2019s Democratic Transition.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Fight for Health Care Has Begun", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byWhen House Republicans abandoned their plan to gut an independent ethics office last week, it showed the power of public opinion. It also offered a playbook for Democrats in 2017.Remember, some of those victories came when Republicans didn\u2019t control the White House or Congress. But they had other advantages: a focused message, a strong organization and a whole lot of passion. They influenced policy by striking political fear into members of Congress.Now it\u2019s the left\u2019s turn to use public opinion, and the stakes in the next fight are bigger than the House ethics office.Sam Jawitz is one of the beneficiaries. He was born almost two years ago in mid-coast Maine with a birth defect that left his throat unconnected to his stomach. His first month of care cost about $100,000.His parents \u2014 small-business owners \u2014 would have spent their every dime, of course. But without Obamacare insurance, they would have gone deeply into debt, and Sam would have missed out on follow-up care and therapy. \u201cWe would have had to say, \u2018Let\u2019s only do some things,\u2019\u201d his mother, Alyce Ornella, said.Today, Sam is an \u201coutrageous\u201d toddler, as his mom says, who will climb almost anything and likes to break into dance for no reason.And Congress is on the verge of taking health insurance away from a lot of future Sams.What can you do? By all means, post messages on Facebook and Twitter if you want. But you can also do something more effective. You can call your senator.Congressional staff members privately admit that they ignore many of the emails and letters they get. They also admit that phone calls are different. They have to answer them. Other people in the office hear the phone ringing and see their colleagues on the line. Phone calls are a tangible sign of public opinion, which is why they have been effective before.If your senators are Republicans, tell them you\u2019re part of the large majority of Americans who oppose repeal-and-delay. If they\u2019re Democrats, tell them you want them to work harder \u2014 to stay on the Senate floor all night, if need be \u2014 fighting for people\u2019s health care.That\u2019s what this is really about.

{"Headline": "Dumping a Bad App? Tips for a Painless Breakup", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byTech FixEVERYONE is familiar with this scenario: An app you once loved no longer brings the same joy. It\u2019s gotten buggy over time, or an update transformed it to the point it became unusable.Chances are you thought about calling it quits. But after years of sharing your personal data with this app, you probably gave up and stayed in this stale relationship. You put up with the productivity-killing bugs and odd design changes because moving to a new, potentially better app felt harder than sticking with the bad one.Even so, people have stuck with Evernote partly because taking their notes elsewhere is hardly easy.\u201dWe understand those kind of changes don\u2019t make everyone happy,\u201d said Greg Chiemingo, an Evernote spokesman. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve seen continued growth of paying customers over the last two years.\u201dPeople deserve better than this. Every day you stay with a bad app is time you could be spending with a superior product that will make life better. Here are my tips, based on interviews and personal experience, for a clean break.No app is perfect, but you have to draw the line somewhere. The problem is, you may be in such a rut that you can\u2019t recognize the warning signs.An obvious one is when an app stops working reliably in a way that affects your life. For instance, I called it quits on Apple\u2019s Calendar app when I was planning a dinner with friends last month and the software sent a calendar invite in Greenwich Mean Time rather than Pacific Standard Time. As a result, one person thought we were meeting on Saturday instead of Friday and didn\u2019t show up. (It wasn\u2019t the first time this happened, either.)Brian Fitzpatrick, a former manager at Google who led a team that developed tools to help people move their data to and from Google, said he dumps an app when it has stopped improving.\u201cIt\u2019s still functioning, but you don\u2019t see any changes in it for a very long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a zombie app, I would call it at that point.\u201dAnother sign that it\u2019s time to move on is when you have nobody to talk to. Many popular apps for tasks like note taking, photo management and word processing are connected to social networks, or people you can share data with. If an app\u2019s audience is a ghost town \u2014 like Yahoo\u2019s photo-sharing app, Flickr, which sank in popularity after mobile photo-sharing services like Instagram emerged \u2014 then it\u2019s probably time to leave.Yahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Flickr.The hardest part of breaking up with an app is moving your data. So as a rule of thumb, save a backup copy of your data so that you can export it into a new app. Then carefully search for a better app to suit your needs.As a safety measure before changing apps, you should always keep extra copies of your data somewhere, whether it be in the cloud with a service like Dropbox or on a physical hard drive.Some companies deliberately make exporting your data difficult because they want you to stick around.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like moving into an apartment and finding out at the end of the lease you can\u2019t take your furniture and your books with you,\u201d Mr. Fitzpatrick said.Evernote is a good example. It includes an \u201cExport notes\u201d feature, but it only lets you export notes into two formats that are compatible with just a few other note-taking apps. Microsoft\u2019s note-taking app OneNote, along with Apple\u2019s Notes app, can easily import Evernote records. But if your app of choice is something else, such as Google Keep, you will have to manually paste your notes in the new app.Flickr is also difficult to part ways with. Getting out your photos requires lots of manual labor: You have to download all the photos, which can take a significant amount of time if you have thousands of high-resolution images, and then upload them to a new photo service.When companies don\u2019t provide convenient tools to export your data, look elsewhere by doing a quick web search for solutions. There are plenty of people in the same boat as you, and chances are they have written scripts, or lightweight programs, to automatically pull out your data for you.If there is no convenient way to export your data, sometimes it doesn\u2019t hurt to just take out what is most important to you. Perhaps you don\u2019t need five-year-old notes from Evernote anymore, so you could just manually paste your latest memos and get a fresh start with a different app.On the bright side, you can learn a lot from a tough breakup with an app \u2014 which can be especially useful when looking for a replacement.The biggest lessons: Pick a tool that supports a wide array of formats instead of proprietary ones. And before you commit to a new app, make sure it is as easy to get out as it is to get in.Ditching Apple\u2019s Calendar app was fairly easy. All my calendar data was already stored online and Apple\u2019s app supports calendars from multiple online services including Google, Microsoft and Facebook. The key was finding an app that also supported those services but performed better.After testing several apps, I decided that Fantastical 2, a new app with a cleaner interface for getting a glance at calendar events, was the best one. Once Fantastical 2 was installed, I added my Google calendar accounts to load all my events into the app.Google said it updated Google Voice on Monday with photo sharing and group messaging. But that was too late to keep people like Mr. Fitzpatrick.\u201cA lot of it comes down to, How interested are you in change?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Another Million or More to Market the Ad.", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingThis month, Anheuser-Busch InBev hosted a dozen or so reporters at its airy New York office to discuss its advertising plans for the Super Bowl.Company-branded folders labeled \u201cMedia Briefing\u201d were distributed. A news release detailed the four beer labels that would be featured in commercials during the game, on Feb. 5, with instructions to keep the information under wraps until the next morning. Also included: a brochure outlining \u201cfun facts\u201d for each brand \u2014 Bud Light, Michelob Ultra, Budweiser and Busch \u2014 and a business card with a website and email address for \u201call of your A-B Super Bowl needs.\u201dAbsent from the event, which included an hourlong presentation from the company\u2019s United States marketing head: the commercials themselves. Three of the four, the company said, were slated for online release in the lead-up to the big game.\u201cEven though the spots have incredible viewership \u2014 as much as the game itself \u2014 you never know,\u201d Ms. Scott said, adding that she recommends clients spend an amount equal to at least 25 percent of the cost on promotions related to their Super Bowl ad. \u201cThere\u2019s become more of a game around the game in terms of ensuring that really pays off in a big way.\u201dThe willingness of companies to pay record prices for Super Bowl ads while simultaneously spending more to promote them shows how coveted consumer attention has become in the age of smartphones and social media. It can also be a mind-bending thought experiment, given that the ads are attempts to sell consumers on a product or brand.\u201cWhether it\u2019s Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or YouTube, they all have different types of buys you can make,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Super Bowl has created a cottage industry for other media companies to take advantage of it as well.\u201dStarting in January, public relations firms and executives at large brands offered the news media previews or exclusive peeks at their commercials, as long as they agreed not to publish the ads or information about them until a specific time \u2014 say, Jan. 26 at 6 p.m. for Mercedes-Benz, or Jan. 31 at 8 p.m. for Buick. Often, the ads were just one part of a broader brand campaign, bolstered by celebrities or new products, with executives ready for interviews.The hope is that articles about the ads will drive a flurry of \u201cearned media,\u201d industry parlance for morning show segments, articles, blog posts and social media chatter. Often, companies will supplement that with \u201cpaid media,\u201d like promotions on YouTube or Twitter, search keywords or display ads.Releasing the ad early \u201cgives us a longer time span to engage consumers, and I believe it\u2019s a better return on our investment,\u201d said Molly Peck, Buick\u2019s director of marketing, adding that the company wanted to match the interest it generated last year for being a first-time advertiser. The Super Bowl is still a rare opportunity for companies to reach more than 100 million viewers on a day that \u201cpeople really want to see the ads, they\u2019re not skipping over them, they\u2019re watching them in real time and engaged,\u201d she said.Susan Credle, the global chief creative officer of FCB, noted that marketers walk a fine line as they balance the demand for \u201cextras\u201d with the ad itself. \u201cThere are very few places where we experience things together for the first time, and I think we underestimate the power of that,\u201d she said, referring to the Super Bowl\u2019s huge audience.Roughly 80 national commercial slots were available for purchase this year. The average price of a 30-second in-game Super Bowl ad was $2.4 million in 2007, according to figures from Kantar Media that were not adjusted for inflation. The firm estimated that in-game advertising generated $2.6 billion in sales to networks between 2007 and 2016.\u201cAs advertisers more and more look to tell their narrative and tell content stories, this is a tremendous opportunity to do it, but like any story, you can\u2019t just tell it once,\u201d said Randy Freer, the chief operating officer of Fox Networks Group. \u201cYou have to get out and spread it around and elevate that.\u201dSnickers is aiming to do that this year with the Super Bowl\u2019s first live commercial, which will star Adam Driver from the HBO series \u201cGirls.\u201d The concept, which its public relations firm was pitching to news outlets as far back as December, will be accompanied by a 36-hour live stream, highlights posted to Facebook and behind-the-scenes footage from two social influencers. The extra effort will cost \u201cseveral\u201d hundred thousand dollars, the company said.\u201cIt\u2019s more and more difficult for people to talk about the ad and see our ad and get noticed, so that\u2019s why we are taking an approach that is more about creating a platform.\u201d said Berta De Pablos-Barbier, vice president of marketing for Mars Chocolate. \u201cTelevision advertising continues to be an important part, but on its own it\u2019s not enough anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Solving this puzzle got me pondering monikers with multiple meanings, and what it must be like to have one. People get named after flowers, places and old-timey professions all the time, but then there are the names, like the one in this puzzle, that can be nouns and verbs, and puns and slang. Could be challenging, could be fun.All I can offer in my personal experience is a memory from an old neighborhood, where a woman with a small, tremulous voice had named her similarly fragile Italian greyhound Caitlin, why I couldn\u2019t say, but I really didn\u2019t find any possible connection flattering and chose to disregard it. I believe a true namesake of mine would be a heartier dog.I was impressed by Mr. Sessa\u2019s construction today; not only did he make use of his theme nine times, no small feat in a daily grid, he did so using just the across entries, and using perfect symmetry.

Violence against people with disabilities is far more common than most people realize, advocates have said, and frequently goes undetected or is not taken seriously.The defendants are accused of multiple felonies, including hate crimes. Prosecutors said the victim, who was found by the police on Tuesday, was targeted based on his race and his disability. During a Facebook video made by one of the defendants, another can be heard denouncing white people, and, at one point, a man is heard saying he does not care if the victim is schizophrenic.\u201cI\u2019m wondering as I\u2019m hearing this, \u2018Where was the sense of decency?\u2019 \u201d Judge Kuriakos Ciesil asked.

They believe people with disabilities may be unable to take part in a survey or go to the police, or may have trouble being understood. As a result, their complaints often are not taken seriously.\u201cThere are probably thousands of other cases just like this one in Chicago, and in some cases worse, that will never see the impact of the justice system because folks don\u2019t know about it,\u201d said Rebecca Cokley, the executive director of the National Council on Disability, a federal agency. \u201cIn a lot of cases with people with disabilities, the perpetrators are family members or caretakers, so what happens when the person who would have to take you to the police station is your abuser?\u201d\u201cWe have, unfortunately, devalued disabled people forever, which means we devalue their suffering,\u201d said Curt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cWhat we experience all the time is that police, prosecutors, judges say, \u2018Oh, this case is hard, it\u2019s not worth our trouble.

{"Headline": "German Court Rejects Effort to Ban Neo-Nazi Party", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s highest court rejected on Tuesday an attempt to ban the National Democratic Party, the country\u2019s oldest far-right political organization, finding that it did not pose a danger to democracy even though its principles violate the Constitution.Although the National Democratic Party \u201cpursues aims contrary to the Constitution,\u201d there was a lack of \u201cconcrete supporting evidence\u201d that the neo-Nazi party would be able to successfully achieve its goals and to pose a genuine threat, said Andreas Vosskuhle, the president of the court.\u201cThat a party has aims that run contrary to the Constitution is not sufficient grounds for banning a party,\u201d he said.Germany has strict laws on banning political parties, and only two have been outlawed since the defeat of the Nazis at the end of World War II \u2014 the neo-Nazi Socialist Reich Party, in 1952, and the German Communist Party, in 1956.A 2003 attempt to ban the National Democratic Party also failed, after the court found that paid informants in the party were partly responsible for evidence the government used.Over the past decade, the party has continued to lose popularity, with many of its members switching to Alternative for Germany.That party was founded in 2013 on an anti-euro agenda, but it has attracted followers after emerging as a prominent voice against Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to allow nearly one million refugees into the country since summer 2015. Although the influx has slowed, the issue remains a political point of contention.The eight judges of the court cited the party\u2019s lack of playing a significant role in the political landscape as a reason for their decision not to ban it. \u201cIn more than five decades that it has existed, the National Democratic Party has not been able to achieve lasting representation in a state legislature,\u201d Mr. Vosskuhle said, reading from the 300-page ruling. \u201cThere are no indications that this will change in the future.\u201dAt the height of its popularity, the party narrowly missed winning seats in the West German Parliament and was represented in seven of the country\u2019s 11 state legislatures. Since German reunification in 1990, the party has been strongest in states of the former East Germany.The ruling means the far-right party remains eligible under German law for financial support from the government, drawn from taxpayers, one of the arguments for the attempt to ban it. Mr. Vosskuhle acknowledged this point, suggesting the idea of changing the Constitution to restrict funding from parties that are recognized as violating Germany\u2019s democratic principles.On Tuesday, however, the party celebrated the ruling, with its leader, Frank Franz, posting on the party\u2019s Facebook page, \u201cTwo-time winner against an attempt to be outlawed.\u201dThomas de Maizi\u00e8re, Germany\u2019s interior minister, said that despite the ruling, he supported keeping the party under observation by the domestic intelligence services, a move that he credited for keeping the party from posing a substantial threat.But the ruling also earned criticism, especially from Jewish groups such as the World Jewish Congress, which expressed \u201cdisappointment\u201d and \u201cdismay\u201d at the court\u2019s ruling.\u201cThis sends the wrong signal, all the more so as the court made it very clear that the NPD indeed strives to overthrow the democratic order and shares many of the aims of Hitler\u2019s Nazi Party,\u201d said Ronald S. Lauder, the group\u2019s president.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Persecuted Minority in Myanmar Is Escalating Its Armed Insurgency", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byBANGKOK \u2014 The insurgent group announced its existence with a predawn attack on three Myanmar border guard posts. Hundreds of Rohingya militants, armed mainly with knives and slingshots, killed nine police officers and seized weapons and ammunition.It was about time, Naing Lin, 28, said of the October attack near his village, Kyee Kan Pyin.\u201cThe government is torturing us,\u201d he said by phone this week. \u201cThe aim of the group is to protect our rights. That\u2019s all. They are doing what they should do.\u201dThe beginning of an armed resistance is just one of several developments that are reshaping the conflict over Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority with potentially far-reaching consequences.In addition, some analysts fear that turning the Rohingya into a transnational Muslim cause could draw foreign jihadists of varying stripes to Myanmar, adding terrorism to an already combustible mix and giving the Myanmar military a convenient excuse for a draconian response.But after decades of persecution and violence, to which the rest of the world largely responded with a shrug, some Rohingya say an armed response is overdue.\u201cThey are doing good things,\u201d Mr. Naing Lin said of the insurgents. \u201cThey are protecting our rights. If it\u2019s needed, I might join them.\u201dThe attack on the border posts in Rakhine State was a \u201cgame changer,\u201d according to the International Crisis Group report.Harakah al-Yaqin, Arabic for \u201cFaith Movement,\u201d is directed by about 20 Rohingya \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Saudi Arabia and led on the field by another 20 or so Rohingya with international training and experience in guerrilla warfare, the report said. It is well connected in Pakistan and Bangladesh and appears to be attracting financial backing from the Rohingya diaspora and major private donors in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, the report said.The militia enjoys growing support from many Rohingya in Myanmar who see it as the only alternative to government repression, the International Crisis Group said. The organization warned that a continued heavy-handed approach by the military would backfire, leading more Rohingya to back the militants and possibly inspiring foreign Islamic groups to join the conflict.This month, Malaysian authorities detained a man who the government said was an Islamic State follower heading to Myanmar to carry out attacks.\u201cAll this clearly demonstrates I.S. slowly and steadily making inroads to influence the Rohingya issue,\u201d said Rohan Gunaratna, a professor of security studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \u201cYou can even say it\u2019s an attempt to hijack the Rohingya agenda.\u201dThe government has barred journalists and aid workers from entering the conflict area, in northern Rakhine State just over the Naf River from Bangladesh, and accusations that the military is carrying out a campaign of murder, rape and arson have not been independently verified.But the reports and images of violence there have fueled the concern of other countries in the region, especially Bangladesh and Malaysia.At the same time, countries in the region are wary of escalating violence in their backyards.Bangladesh, struggling to contain the spread of Islamist extremist networks within its own borders, is concerned about the rise of an insurgency next door and the prospect of Rohingya militants using Bangladesh as a base to carry out attacks in Myanmar.Refugees fleeing the crackdown in Myanmar have been \u201cpouring over the border\u201d into makeshift settlements, said Shafqat Munir, a research fellow at the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. \u201cIf there is a risk of potentially radicalized people coming in, that presents quite a challenge.\u201dStill, in contrast to previous crises, there has been little effort to stem the flow by sending refugees back to Myanmar. About 65,000 Rohingya are believed to have arrived in Bangladesh since October, joining about a half-million already living in the refugee camps near Cox\u2019s Bazar.Islamist organizations, including the powerful Hefazat-e-Islam, organized large rallies in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, in November and December, urging the government to give the Rohingya shelter.Madrasa students have journeyed to the refugee camps from far-flung cities to help build temporary shelters. Others travel halfway across the country from Dhaka and beyond to hand small gifts of cash to the once-reviled Rohingya.Mohammad Yunus, 26, whose family fled to Bangladesh in 1992, is astonished by the change.\u201cBangladeshis once had hatred for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would call us names. They used to say we were Burmese, with a bad tone, and swear at us in different ways. But now they have the idea that we are persecuted.\u201dBangladeshi television is broadcasting sympathetic news coverage of Rohingya suffering in Myanmar, and images purported to be of atrocities carried out by the Myanmar military are circulating on social media, including on WhatsApp and Facebook.Mohammad Imam Hussein, whose mosque near the Myanmar border provides aid to hundreds of refugees, said the videos have brought the conflict home for Bangladeshis.\u201cThey\u2019re seeing with their own eyes what is happening to them,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier, there was no interaction between us, and I didn\u2019t have the same feeling. But now I have seen it with my own eyes. I have seen people being killed.\u201dThat Malaysia is taking a leading role in promoting the Rohingya cause is not entirely unexpected, given that it is the largest officially Muslim nation in Southeast Asia and that it has taken in tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees.But a rally led by Prime Minister Najib Razak in Kuala Lumpur in December to protest Myanmar\u2019s military crackdown was extraordinary in a region where leaders rarely criticize each other and countries largely mind their own business.Mr. Najib called the military campaign \u201cgenocide\u201d and called out Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate, for not doing enough to prevent the bloodshed. \u201cDoes she really have a Nobel Peace Prize?\u201d he asked.While his motives may have been less than pure \u2014 critics said he was trying to distract attention from allegations that he stole $1 billion in government funds and to rally voters in Malaysia\u2019s Muslim heartland ahead of coming elections \u2014 his voice has been strong.Malaysia, along with Saudi Arabia, is also home to Rohingya Vision, a satellite broadcaster and advocacy group that has helped circulate videos and news from Rakhine State.Muhammad Noor, its Saudi-born managing director, says the station has 30 paid citizen journalists in Myanmar and is financed by Rohingya donors from across Southeast Asia and the Middle East. He says the station reaches at least 150,000 viewers with its app, social media channels and websites in English, Arabic and Burmese.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to tell the story to the world that the amount of persecution is in a very extreme level,\u201d he said.Another Malaysian group, the Malaysian Consultative Council for Islamic Organization, is trying to organize an aid flotilla along the lines of the ill-fated one that tried to break an Israeli blockade of Gaza in 2010. The group, hoping to draw attention to the Rohingyas\u2019 plight, says it will set sail early next month.Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, a Rohingya rights organization, says that increased international attention may attract extremists but could also pressure the government to seek a long-term solution.\u201cWithout pressure,\u201d she said, \u201cnothing will happen.\u201dRichard C.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "It is the often oblique details in Ming Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographs that provide their most profound meaning. Consider the eerie photograph of a person walking on a Harlem street, a blur moving across the image\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface. The street is urban and depressed; graffiti mars steel gates and a portentous crucifix-like shadow rakes across the cold pavement. But other details imbue the picture with additional levels of meaning and irony: a set of grinning faces on a doorway and the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cno money\u00e2\u0080\u009d that run across the top of the picture. The image reminds us that the urban landscape is neither singular nor without contradiction. It affirms that sadness coexists with humor, that poverty is mitigated by culture and ideas, and that the absence of money cannot define a community. This photograph appears in the first major retrospective of Ms. Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, which opens on Friday at the Steven Kasher Gallery in New York. The exhibition, featuring more than 75 vintage black and white photographs from the 1970s to the present, offers a significant opportunity to appraise the work of a less-known but important and aesthetically adventurous artist.A continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race by the professor and curator Maurice Berger.After graduating from Howard University, Ms. Smith moved to New York, where she began working as a model. A friendship with the photographer Anthony Barboza affirmed her interest and talent in a medium that had captivated her since childhood. She was the first female member of the influential Harlem-based photography collective Kamoinge, and in 1975, she became the first African-American female photographer whose work was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. Her subjects have been diverse, from portraits of black cultural figures to children in Europe and Africa and Harlem street scenes to abstract images of architecture and nature. The mysterious, ethereal quality of Ms. Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographs affirm her aesthetics and view of the medium. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhotography is definitely an art form,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she recently observed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using light, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re composing, even to the type of print paper you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her work, personal and expressive, draws from a number of artistic sources, preeminently surrealism. She has employed a range of surrealist techniques: photographing her subjects from oblique angles, shooting out of focus or through such atmospheric effects as fog and shadow, playing on unusual juxtapositions, even altering or painting over prints.Ms. Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evocative pictures summon up dreamlike states to tease out complex emotions and ideas deeply embedded in the places and consciousness of her subjects. We see this in \u00e2\u0080\u009cLil\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Brown Baby wif Spa\u00e2\u0080\u0099klin Eyes, Harlem, NY,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back to the camera, standing in a ramshackle crib left out on a graffiti-strewn street. We see this in the raking shadows and sense of isolation in the 1973 portrait, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOld Man in Robe, New York, NY.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And we see this in the godlike countenance of James Baldwin, his face hovering in the clouds over Harlem, looking down on the fraught nation he left to live as an expatriate in a more stolid, but no less problematic post-war France. Gordon Parks wrote of the transcendent quality of Ms. Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, praising her ability to make visible the \u00e2\u0080\u009cghosts\u00e2\u0080\u009d that remained imperceptible to most of us: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe camera, with its special attention to detail, enables one to hold on to a lifetime full of ghosts that might otherwise crumble to dust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the memory often holds is not exactly what the camera records. . . Wondrous imagery keeps cropping up, stuffing themselves into [Ms. Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s] sight. She grasps them and gives eternal life to things that might well have been forgotten.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographs, like the most profound surrealist imagery, are not without social purpose or commentary. Her imagery of African-American urban life, for example, typically documents the \u00e2\u0080\u009calienation of individuals within the constructs of city living and at the same time celebrates the communal love and pride within those conditions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the photo historian Deborah Willis wrote. They transform the cityscape into tense, motion-filled images that sometimes simultaneously reveal the disturbing, ironic, discordant, joyful or affirming aspects of life.  Ms. Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subjects are often suspended between visibility and invisibility: faces turned away, or are blurred or shrouded in shadow, mist or darkness, a potent metaphor of the struggle for African-American visibility in a culture in which black men and women were disparaged, erased or ignored. Her pictures recall Ralph Ellison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s epochal novel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cInvisible Man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a title employed by Ms. Smith for one of her series. The novel recounts the enduring quest for equality and justice of a black man whose skin color renders him invisible. Throughout the narrative, Mr. Ellison, like Ms. Smith, plays on alternate themes of darkness and illumination. In the instances when light shines, it breaks through ignorance or invisibility, serving as a metaphor for moral and intellectual enlightenment.Ms. Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s images are at once spontaneous, personal and quivering with visual surprise. She positions her varied subjects \u00e2\u0080\u0094 male or female, black or white, anonymous or famous \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as \u00e2\u0080\u009cintimates feeling their way through specific conditions and circumstances, and deliberately invokes this exchange in her images,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote the art historian LeRonn P. Brooks. By deeply engaging the world around her, and ironically through the haze of blur, mist or shadow, Ms. Smith makes visible not only what can be seen, but the complex psychological and social factors that lurk below. In the end, Ms. Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work as a photographer aspires to and parallels James Baldwin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objective as a writer: \u00e2\u0080\u009cA writer is never listening to what is being said, he is never listening to what he is being told. He is listening to what is not being said, he is listening to what he is not being told, which means he is trying to discover the purpose of the communication.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMaurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."}
{"Headline": "Emboldened by Trump, Israel Approves a Wave of West Bank Settlement Expansion", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 In a pointed act of defiance against international pressure, Israel on Tuesday approved a huge new wave of settlement construction in the occupied West Bank.The announcement made clear that just a few days into the Trump presidency, the Israeli government feels emboldened to shake off the constraints imposed by the Obama administration and more willing to disregard international condemnation.The first step came on Sunday, when the Jerusalem City Council approved 566 new housing units in East Jerusalem that had been delayed over President Barack Obama\u2019s objections.Then on Tuesday, the Israeli government announced that 2,500 new housing units would be built in the West Bank. Officials said most would be built in \u201csettlement blocs,\u201d referring to areas of the West Bank that Israel has long intended to keep under any future agreement with the Palestinians, possibly in return for land swaps along the boundary that separated Israel from the West Bank before the 1967 war. But in years of failed negotiations, the Israelis and Palestinians have never agreed on the size or location of such blocs.The Israeli Ministry of Defense said 900 of the newly announced homes were being planned for Ariel, an urban settlement of about 20,000 residents that Israel considers a \u201cbloc,\u201d but is strategically \u2014 and problematically \u2014 located in the heart of the West Bank. It also said it would bring to the cabinet a plan to build a large industrial zone to create work for Palestinians in the southern West Bank.\u201cWe are going back to normal life in Judea and Samaria,\u201d Avigdor Lieberman, Israel\u2019s hard-line defense minister, said in a statement announcing the new settlement building, referring to the West Bank by its biblical names.Asked about the Israeli move, the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, said that Mr. Trump was still getting his team together and that there would be discussions with Mr. Netanyahu. \u201cIsrael continues to be a huge ally of the United States,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cHe wants to grow closer with Israel to make sure that it gets the full respect that it deserves in the Middle East, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do.Palestinian officials immediately denounced the new plans.\u201cOnce again, the Israeli government has proved that it is more committed to land theft and colonialism than to the two-state solution and the requirements for peace and stability,\u201d Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s executive committee, said in a statement.\u201cIt is evident that Israel is exploiting the inauguration of the new American administration to escalate its violations and the prevention of any existence of a Palestinian state,\u201d she added, calling on the United States and other international players to take concrete measures against Israeli settlement activities.Days later, the departing secretary of state, John Kerry, rebuked Israel\u2019s settlement activities in an impassioned speech, saying, \u201cThe status quo is leading toward one state and perpetual occupation.\u201dBut with Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank in its 50th year, the Israeli government, dominated by right-wing and religious parties, is clearly expecting a friendlier approach from the White House after years of tension with the Obama administration.It was not immediately clear whether the Israeli announcement had been coordinated in advance with Mr. Trump\u2019s team. But beyond Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s apparent attempt to chart a new course with Mr. Trump, he is also under intense pressure from the right flank of his governing coalition to demonstrate where his domestic loyalties lie.Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the staunchly pro-settlement Jewish Home party, has been goading the prime minister to seize the moment and take the extreme step of beginning a process of annexing the West Bank settlements to Israel.\u201cNetanyahu is facing a historic decision: sovereignty or Palestine,\u201d Mr. Bennett said on Monday. \u201cWe urge Netanyahu, don\u2019t miss an opportunity that comes along once every 50 years.\u201dMr. Netanyahu appeared to postpone any discussion of annexation: \u201cThis is no time for off-the-cuff decisions or political dictations, and this is no time for surprises.\u201d This, he added, \u201cis the time for considered, responsible diplomacy among friends.\u201dThe prime minister\u2019s office said that in a phone conversation with Mr. Trump on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu discussed the peace process and hoped to forge a \u201ccommon vision\u201d with Mr. Trump \u201cto advance peace and security in the region, with no daylight between the United States and Israel.\u201d No more details were given.But that came in the context of Israel\u2019s plans to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza and from a section of the northern West Bank. And the case of Ariel serves to illustrate the contentiousness of unilaterally defining the blocs.Israelis have long labeled Ariel part of their national \u201cconsensus,\u201d meaning that it would be included in Israel\u2019s borders under any peace deal, and it often appears as one of the regular dots on Israeli weather maps. But Palestinian negotiators have always rejected that idea, arguing that Israeli control over Ariel would preclude the territorial contiguity of a Palestinian state. They also note that Ariel sits on a major aquifer.According to Tuesday\u2019s announcement, 20 of the new units are to be built in Beit El, a settlement deep in the West Bank that has particularly benefited from Mr. Friedman\u2019s fund-raising activities. The government promised in 2012 to build 300 units in Beit El, a settlement of about 7,000 residents, to compensate for the court-ordered evacuation of part of a neighborhood there that was illegally built on private Palestinian land. So far, the promise has remained unfulfilled.According to Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense, bids will now be solicited for the construction of about 900 of the 2,500 new units around the West Bank. But the rest, including most of those planned for Ariel, still have to go through additional planning phases, a bureaucratic process that can take months, if not years, and requires additional government approval at each stage.Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha Council, an umbrella organization representing the more than 400,000 settlers in the West Bank, said in a statement, \u201cWe hope that this is just the beginning of a wave of new building across our ancestral homeland after eight very difficult years.\u201dBut some in the settler camp played down the construction plans and expressed suspicions about Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s intentions.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of the world body that passed a resolution last month condemning Israeli settlements. It is the United Nations \u2014 not States \u2014 Security Council.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Duterte\u2019s List", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "FeatureHe has the names of more than a million supposed drug dealers and corrupt officials in the Philippines. In this violent new drug war, who is determining who dies?Supported byFilipinos had been hearing for months about what is commonly called the \u201cwatch list\u201d for drug suspects. After he entered office on June 30, Duterte began gathering names of suspects from local police officers and elected officials for a new national war on drugs. The list took many shapes in Duterte\u2019s various tellings, containing anywhere from 600,000 to more than a million suspects. He also once claimed that some three million Filipinos \u2014 3 percent of the population \u2014 were drug addicts, and that he would be happy to kill them. \u201cThe human rights people will commit suicide,\u201d he said in October, \u201cif I finish these all.\u201dDuterte made a point of naming names across a broad swath of Philippine society, including 6,000 police officers and 5,000 local village leaders he called corrupt. How they ended up on the list, or even who exactly was on it, was a mystery that fascinated Filipinos. How you got off the list was even more mysterious.Ma\u00f1alac looks much younger than his 40 years, a sharp dresser with one full-sleeve tattoo and an email handle that translates as \u201cda pretty boy.\u201d But he is a diligent and effective local politician and a ubiquitous presence in Malabon City. His face beams from campaign posters along the streets, and his name is emblazoned on the door of a gleaming blue fire engine that services the community \u2014 even if one constituent teased him that the engine appeared at more parades than actual fires.When I went to see Ma\u00f1alac one morning in November, I found him sitting in his second-floor office with a handbag on the desk in front of him. It contained a Glock 17 pistol with an oversize clip. \u201cThis is what is keeping me safe,\u201d he told me, drawing the gun into his lap and stroking it as if it were a cat. \u201cThis and a rosary.\u201d The special clip held enough ammo to hold out here, defending the stairway against any attackers that came for him in the office. Maybe enough bullets to buy time, to let the local police respond. Two policemen had been assigned to look after him as bodyguards.Duterte entered the presidential race at the last minute, vowing to go national with the no-holds-barred campaign he waged in Davao. He promised to kill 100,000 criminals in his first six months in office. In May, he won the election with 6.6 million more votes than his nearest opponent.Once in office, Duterte immediately ordered thousands of police raids across the archipelago. To date, these operations have killed more than 2,000 suspects, according to the Philippine National Police, in what have usually been reported as \u201cshootouts\u201d or attempts to take a police officer\u2019s gun. The fights seem to have been suspiciously lopsided \u2014 nationwide, in six months, 21 officers have died, and three soldiers. But another 4,000 people \u2014 many of them from Duterte\u2019s watch list \u2014 have died under even murkier circumstances. Late last year I visited 10 crime scenes where 18 individual homicides took place, and most of them appeared to have been the work of teams of efficient killers, encouraged by the president\u2019s inflammatory language.The list was the distilled essence of Duterte\u2019s appeal, a raw and brutal effort at law and order, whatever the cost. As of October, the president enjoyed an 86 percent approval rating nationwide; his popularity was greatest among the poorest Filipinos surveyed. Family members of the drug war\u2019s casualties on several occasions told me they supported Duterte\u2019s violence, even as they insisted their sons and daughters were targeted inaccurately. The list was a promise to cleanse society, and surrendering to the police, or even being innocent, was no defense \u2014 not even for politicians who worked to support Duterte\u2019s drug war, as Ma\u00f1alac had.At his desk, Ma\u00f1alac held up his phone to show me a text message, one of dozens of death threats he had received. \u201cYou are a protector\u201d of drug dealers, it said. Another message called him \u201ca cuddler\u201d of addicts. One threatening letter had been written carefully, then scanned and forwarded to him.One body was lying on its back in a black T-shirt and cargo shorts. The man\u2019s eyes stared at the sky; his arms, stiff and opened wide, seemed to be offering a hug. He had been hit in the shoulder and head. Crumpled against the curb was another body in denim shorts, a T-shirt reading CALIFORNIA and a black helmet. The Scene of the Crime Operatives, or SOCO, arrived, navy-clad technicians who secured evidence. SOCO is often overwhelmed by the sheer number of killings \u2014 sometimes more than a dozen a night in Manila alone \u2014 but it was still early in the evening, and the technicians, wearing gloves, worked patiently to mark, inventory and photograph the evidence.Pasay City is a center of the violence, enough so that Philippine reporters have taken to calling it Patay \u2014 \u201cDead\u201d \u2014 City. This particular case was notable only because the dead men had been released from police custody shortly before their killing. They were picked up earlier in the day and questioned about internet gambling, according to police officers at the scene, but the official police report from that night listed one of the men as a \u201csuspected drug personality.\u201d They had been released from custody and headed up F.B. Harrison on a red Honda Wave scooter. They were cut off around 10 p.m. by two motorcycles, each with a driver and a shooter.Duterte has denied both the presence of death squads in the country and the involvement of the police in the killings, but he has also exhorted them openly, vowing to kill so many drug dealers that \u201cthe fish will grow fat\u201d in Manila Bay from eating their bodies. \u201cIf they pull out a gun, kill them,\u201d he told army troops, who assist in police operations, in a speech in September. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, kill them, son of a whore, so it\u2019s over, lest you lose the gun. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d One officer of the National Police bragged anonymously to The Guardian that following Duterte\u2019s election, he had joined a clandestine kill team: Volunteer officers in plain clothes were issued a list of targets. A woman in one Manila slum told the BBC she was hired by a local police officer to kill five people on his list.Duterte has called the existence of death squads \u201ca myth,\u201d and the very few critics who challenge him are overwhelmed by his popular support. This has led to a wave of killings that are meticulously documented (by SOCO, surveillance cameras and the press) but fundamentally unsolvable.Around the bodies in Pasay City, the SOCO team had dutifully drawn eight small circles on the pavement marking where the cartridges fell. Children worked the crowd, asking for money and picking up candy wrappers. Weeping relatives arrived, one at a time, howling with grief and then composing themselves, briefly, for the TV cameras.Abundant theatricality accompanies most things in the Philippines, from religious processions to karaoke. Soap operas and melodramas rule the airwaves. The drug-war killings have taken on an edge of this performance culture. Bodies are often recovered bearing crude cardboard signs: \u201cI AM A PUSHER\u201d or \u201cI AM A DRUG USER DON\u2019T BE LIKE ME.\u201d Filipinos refer to the practice as \u201ccardboard justice\u201d; the signs now sometimes include Twitter hashtags, or riffs on popular Facebook memes. The killing teams have become bolder, sometimes not bothering to hide their faces and exploring more baroque forms of cruelty, like covering their victims\u2019 faces with masks of packing tape, occasionally decorated with cartoon eyes and mouths.Duterte has called both Barack Obama and the pope \u201csons of whores,\u201d labeled the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \u201can idiot\u201d and attacked Human Rights Watch for documenting his long incitement of killings. When he ran for office, people saw a foulmouthed rule breaker, and Filipino and later American journalists dubbed him the \u201cDonald Trump of the Philippines.\u201d Just before Trump\u2019s election, Duterte picked Trump\u2019s business partner on a Manila skyscraper deal as his envoy to Washington. And Trump placed a call to Duterte during the transition period in which they discussed not just international relations but the drug war; according to Duterte, Trump gave him a verbal thumbs-up, saying that he was going after drugs \u201cthe right way.\u201d (Trump\u2019s staff has confirmed that a conversation took place, but not what was discussed.)In Talomo, a poor district insouthern Davao, Grecel Sagpang, a station commander with the Philippine National Police, was sitting in his small, steamy office in Police Station 3, the local precinct house. Many of Talomo\u2019s approximately 60,000 residents are squatters, according to Sagpang, and drug addiction is widespread.It was true that Jimenez was on the list, Sagpang said. But the killing \u201cwas not extrajudicial,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s murder,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the police and army are not involved.\u201d Drug-watch suspects were being killed \u201cby their peers.\u201dDuterte\u2019s reputation derives from what he did in Davao, building a clean and efficient city by Philippine standards. Davao was awash in violence when Duterte arrived, but he tamed both leftist and Muslim insurgents, who had battled the government for years. He banned smoking in public and went after speeders. He crushed street crime and humiliated corrupt officials. By the time he left, the city had drinkable tap water and approved business permits within 72 hours.According to Human Rights Watch, while Duterte was mayor of Davao, elements of the local police and local government operated a death squad in a clandestine war that killed about 1,000 people, including suspected criminals, drug dealers, leftists and street children. Duterte denied the existence of a Davao death squad for years, although he has also said, in what he claims was only a taunt to his critics: \u201cAm I the death squad? True. That is true.\u201dIn September, Leila de Lima, a former justice secretary who had recently been elected to the Philippine Senate, called Edgar Matobato to testify before the Senate\u2019s justice and human rights committee, of which she was chairwoman. A shaggy-haired, teddy-bear-shaped man in late middle age, Matobato confessed \u2014 out of guilt, he said \u2014 to working as an assassin for the Davao death squad. He described a large group of killers, organized by the police and local leaders. \u201cWe were tasked to kill criminals every day, including pushers and snatchers,\u201d Matobato testified.Duterte didn\u2019t just inspire or incite the killings from afar, Matobato claimed, but was personally involved in selecting some victims, including Muslims targeted in revenge killings after a bombing. \u201cWe pounced on them, and later killed them, and buried them in a quarry,\u201d Matobato said. And Duterte, he said, had even participated in a killing in 1993, when he arrived just in time to unload two magazines of ammunition from an Uzi into a suspect.The Matobato hearings, which aired live on national television, transfixed the nation. \u201cWhat kind of a war is this?\u201d De Lima asked when we spoke. But her investigation ended abruptly, at the hands of the world-champion boxer Manny Pacquiao. A national hero who, like De Lima, is serving his first term in the Senate, Pacquiao is a loyal supporter of Duterte. In September, Pacquiao introduced a motion to strip De Lima of her chairwomanship, which passed the Senate with an overwhelming majority. The investigation was shut down, and Matobato is now in a witness-protection program.When I met Pacquiao outside the Senate chamber in October, he insisted that even with De Lima gone, the Senate would continue investigating Matobato\u2019s claims. \u201cWe will remain very active in this case,\u201d Pacquiao told me. The current wave of killings was the work not of the police or vigilantes, he said, but rather of criminals themselves \u2014 \u201cdrug lords, drug syndicates, drug poseurs.\u201d He said that \u201cthe massive campaign of the government against illegal drugs\u201d was a success.A few days after we spoke, Pacquiao left for Las Vegas, where he won another title belt. Duterte attacked De Lima, accusing her of taking money from drug dealers during her time as justice secretary. Duterte called her ugly and claimed to have watched a sex tape involving De Lima and her driver. Legislators released her private phone number on national television, and Duterte\u2019s fans left her more than 2,000 hostile calls and text messages, including death threats. She is now facing allegations of corruption.The list grows longer. The names sometimes come via police posts like Police Station 3, and Sagpang described how he compiled them. \u201cA confidential informant came, to say drugs are very prevalent in such-and-such area,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe have to dig deeper. We deploy detectives and intelligence operatives\u201d to verify that \u201cMr. So-and-So is fiddling drugs in the community.\u201d In other words, the police counted on informants \u2014 impoverished squatters, terrified drug dealers and local politicians \u2014 telling the truth about one another.The national watch list that Duterte waved on television was presumably a lot of these smaller lists, a registry of people who had been informed on. Duterte has asked local police departments and governments all over the country to generate information this way, squeezing names from criminals and cooperative neighbors.Sagpang had personally led more than 100 antidrug raids \u2014 though only four of those led to shootouts, he said. There were no death squads in Davao, he insisted, and when Duterte made radical threats, like calling drug addicts \u201czombies\u201d who should be killed even if they didn\u2019t resist, Sagpang said he did not take the president literally. \u201cWe are so used to him,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than 20 years. He isn\u2019t really meaning what he is saying.\u201d Duterte\u2019s threats were \u201cpsy-ops, like in war,\u201d designed to scare drug dealers into retreat or surrender. More than 1,500 \u201cdrug personalities\u201d had surrendered at Sagpang\u2019s police station, he said. \u201cOperation Double Barrel\u201d \u2014 the official name of the drug war \u2014 \u201cis really effective. It created a domino effect.\u201dWhen Quezon City\u2019s streets became too narrow for the pickup, Lerma and I continued on foot, turning down increasingly decrepit alleys. We arrived at the murder scene after the National Police, who had taped everything off, but ahead of SOCO. Two patrol officers moved around slowly, bent over with flashlights and chalk, finding and circling nine shell casings. Two pairs of legs poked out from behind piles of debris.The closer pair of legs belonged to a 17-year-old girl, who the neighbors said was named Angel. Nearby was another body, this one a 21-year-old male the onlookers identified as her boyfriend, Jerico. Neighbors, including a local shopkeeper with whom I spoke, described two men on a motorcycle following the couple home from a local restaurant. After pulling on masks, they cornered Jerico in a quiet back street and killed him. When Angel screamed, perhaps defending him, they shot her through the throat. After they left, someone threw down a cardboard sign that said \u201cyou are a pusher you are an animal.\u201dJerico appeared to have struggled; shards of pottery and ferns littered the scene where he was thrown against a rack of house plants. He died in shorts and a striped shirt. SOCO arrived and photographed and bagged the nine shell casings, inventorying the pockets of the dead. An officer carefully, almost tenderly, pushed Angel\u2019s hair aside, to better photograph her face. The girl\u2019s mother arrived and erupted in wails of grief, triggering a sympathetic storm of wailing among other women in the crowd, who had been stone-faced up to that moment. The TV crews directed bright lights in the mother\u2019s face, and soon she was giving a tear-choked interview.Mythmaking by Duterte has its corollary in the journalists and the crowds that gather eagerly at the scenes of the killings, where rumor flies faster than facts. A Barbie doll, all blond hair and pink clothing, lay near Angel\u2019s body. After much discussion, the crowd, based on no actual evidence, settled on the theory that Jerico had given her the doll as a symbol of their romance.Angel\u2019s open-coffin wake was held at the end of a tiny alley in Quezon City. A sister and one friend sat stoically on their own until a church group showed up to sing a hymn. Angel\u2019s real name, it turned out, was Ericka Fernandez, and she was the third of seven children. One of her sisters denied that Angel had ever used drugs \u2014 it was \u201ca made-up story,\u201d she said. Likewise, she said the Barbie-doll romance was invented by neighbors \u2014 according to her, Angel and Jerico weren\u2019t a couple anymore at the time of their murders, and Angel had bought the doll herself as a gift for a family member. The coffin was half open, revealing a girl in a white dress with large, poorly concealed sutures holding her neck together. A few doors down, women played a raucous dice game.Jerico\u2019s wake was held about a mile away, and better attended, if only because it took place in a busy footpath. The coffin stood on display in front of his uncle\u2019s house, as food vendors plied their offerings nearby and children skipped underfoot. A dog napped under the half-open coffin.Jerico was innocent, said his father, Rommel Camitan. \u201cHe\u2019s not a pusher. Hundred percent, sir. Not a pusher. For me he is a good son. Ask our neighbors.\u201d Camitan sat on a plastic stool in the street, sheltered by a tarp that friends had strung overhead. Without enough cash on hand for a funeral, the family was buying another week by having Jerico\u2019s body injected with more preservative against the tropical heat. Inside the coffin, illuminated by a light-up Jesus, Jerico had been cleaned up, though the thick makeup could not conceal the zigzag split in his forehead. A week after death, one of his eyes was caving in.Despite his anguish, Camitan endorsed Duterte\u2019s campaign. \u201cAll this talk of finishing drugs and the drug war is good,\u201d Camitan said. \u201cBut he has to be sure that their target is the right person.\u201d He added: \u201cThere have been cases around here. Usually they are pushers or addicts.\u201d Good people had nothing to fear, he told me. \u201cThe only ones who should feel afraid are the ones who did something wrong.\u201dMa\u00f1alac tried the same tactics to get off the list. He went to the offices of his local police chief, where he, too, passed a drug test showing that he was clean.When I emailed him in December, Ma\u00f1alac replied that things were looking up. He was working with the police and the business community, he said, helping President Duterte \u201ccontinue the crusade against drug personalities.\u201d The police chief for all of Malabon City had assured him he was no longer on the list. Nonetheless, Ma\u00f1alac wrote, \u201cI still have my two policemen as security.\u201dAn article on Jan. 15 about President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines included an erroneous description of a fire truck parked outside the office of Alvin Ma\u00f1alac, a local elected official from a district in northern Manila. While Ma\u00f1alac\u2019s name and logo were painted on the truck, his face was not.Patrick Symmes is the author of \u201cThe Day Fidel Died,\u201d due in March from Vintage.

It\u2019s selling the promise that women who wear her clothes can get a piece of her gold dust \u2014 and now that this gold dust is visible in the corridors (and news conferences) of power, that is only going to be more true. Every time she is pictured in an Ivanka Trump outfit, it is bound to give a boost to the Ivanka Trump brand. Whether or not they are technically linked.It\u2019s unclear whether Ms. Trump would benefit from that financially, as specifics about her monetary relationship with her brand were not included in her statement. But even if she is selling her part of the company, for a prominent member of the first family to be seen to be endorsing a brand with her own name on it is a complicated proposition. And an endorsement is exactly what an appearance in an item of clothing has become.You can argue that Ms. Trump is not an elected official, and thus to demand that she recuse herself from all products associated with her name is unfair punishment. You could say that if she wears, for example, an Alexander McQueen dress, as she did on election night, she is giving that brand a boost, so why shouldn\u2019t she do the same for her own brand? You can point out that there is precedent because she wore her own line numerous times during the campaign, including to introduce her father at the Republican National Convention \u2014 but then, the latter choice was not without controversy.A scenario in which Ivanka Trump the brand removes Ms. Trump utterly from its identity is hard to imagine. Though to be fair, the brand\u2019s website is adorned with images and line drawings of many different kinds of women and not with Ms. Trump, so it may be possible.Either way, this is another illustration of the multiple complicated issues that are going to arise with a member of the first family who also had designs on being a fashion brand. There\u2019s really no playbook for this, as the Ivanka team \u2014 figuring it out as it goes along \u2014 is quick to remind. In which case, the clothes question should be the next piece of the puzzle to be solved.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Before Emptying the White House, Obama\u2019s Glittering Round of Farewells", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was the most fitting finale to Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, squeezed into a glittering round of goodbye parties. And yet it was almost a casualty of politics.On Monday, four days before Mr. Obama was to hand the presidency to Donald J. Trump, the Chicago Cubs visited the White House to celebrate their first World Series championship since 1908. It was a rollicking event, with references to the team\u2019s rabid fans in the West Wing and jibes at the one person there who is not \u2014 Mr. Obama, a Chicago White Sox fan.The original thinking, two people close to the White House said, was to hold the ceremony later in the spring with Mr. Trump. He had after all named Todd Ricketts, a member of the family that owns the Cubs, as deputy commerce secretary.But Mr. Ricketts\u2019s sister, Laura, is a big supporter of Mr. Obama, and she pushed for an event before the end of his presidency.As a result, the team\u2019s chairman, Tom Ricketts, agreed to move up the formal celebration. A spokesman for Mr. Ricketts, Dennis Culloton, denied division within the Ricketts family over the timing of the event, and said simply, \u201cTom\u2019s position is, \u2018If the president invites you, you go.\u2019\u201dFor Mr. Trump, however, it was a reminder of the stardust that showers his predecessor, particularly in his last celebrity-drenched days in the White House.On Jan. 6, the Obamas had an all-night party at the White House with a guest list that included Paul McCartney, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Stevie Wonder. Witnesses reported that Mr. Obama tried competitive dancing in a dance circle in the East Room.It was a humbling experience, one said: He faced off against Usher, a pop star who dances at least as well as Mr. Obama speaks, and had trouble holding his own against the talk-show host Stephen Colbert.A few days later, Bruce Springsteen turned up in the State Dining Room to play a two-hour acoustic set for about 200 members of the White House staff. Between songs, he told stories about his life and read from his best-selling memoir, \u201cBorn to Run.\u201dMr. Trump in the meantime has had trouble attracting A-list performers to his inauguration. And a Springsteen cover band, the B-Street Band, snubbed him this week by canceling a show at the unofficial Garden State Inaugural Gala. The band\u2019s keyboardist and founder, Willie Forte, said, \u201cThe most important thing to us is that we\u2019re not construed as being disrespectful or ungrateful to Springsteen and his music and the E Street Band.\u201dIn this White House\u2019s characteristically methodical way, planning for Mr. Obama\u2019s final weeks began a year ago, said Jennifer Psaki, the communications director. Last summer, his aides broached the idea of a farewell address and recommended doing it during his penultimate week, rather than the last, so the pre-inauguration buzz would not overshadow it.\u201cWhen you\u2019re a year out, there\u2019s a recognition that there\u2019s an end date,\u201d Ms. Psaki said. \u201cYou understand you have limited time and you need to make the most of it. And three weeks is a very short period of time, so you better plan it the best way you can.\u201dSome of the events were predictable: Mr. Obama sat for exit interviews with Steve Kroft of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d George Stephanopoulos of \u201cThis Week\u201d and Lester Holt of \u201cNBC Nightly News.\u201d Mr. Holt talked to the president on Air Force One as he flew to Chicago for the farewell speech.But Mr. Obama had requests of his own, including a lunch in the White House with five of his favorite writers: Dave Eggers, Colson Whitehead, Zadie Smith, Barbara Kingsolver and Junot D\u00edaz. Mr. Obama, who said he planned to write a memoir, quizzed the writers about their tradecraft (he told them he liked to write first drafts in longhand on yellow legal pads). Michiko Kakutani, the chief book critic of The New York Times, sat in on the lunch and interviewed Mr. Obama afterward about his reading life.Mr. D\u00edaz, who had been a critic of Mr. Obama on some of his immigration policies, wrote on his Facebook page that he did not expect to be invited. \u201cWhat surprised me was how completely unbowed President Obama was, how certain he was that the country would find its way,\u201d Mr. D\u00edaz wrote. \u201cHe burned with optimism and faith invincible.\u201dThe president is also handing out parting gifts. Longtime aides are getting a print of Shepard Fairey\u2019s poster of Mr. Obama above the slogan \u201cHope,\u201d which became a symbol of the 2008 campaign.Staff members, most of whom packed up their offices last weekend, are marking the end with various rituals. Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser, took a last walk around the grounds and wrote about it on Twitter. \u201cWill be watching from outside the gate after tomorrow,\u201d she said. Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser who negotiated the diplomatic opening with Cuba, said he planned to finish off an 18-year-old bottle of Cuban rum.For Mr. Obama\u2019s original band of brothers, several of whom left the White House years ago, the last days have been an excuse to return to their old stamping ground. On Wednesday, after holding his final news conference in the briefing room, the president gave his last interview, not to journalists but to four former advisers \u2014 Jon Favreau, Tommy Vietor, Jon Lovett and Dan Pfeiffer \u2014 who now host a political podcast, \u201cPod Save America.\u201d\u201cI cannot believe that people actually listen to you guys,\u201d Mr. Obama said by way of an opening.Beforehand, the aides reminisced in the Oval Office with their former boss about their first day at work in January 2009. Mr. Vietor, who first volunteered for Mr. Obama when he was running for the Senate from Illinois, said: \u201cI told him I\u2019d be a supervolunteer forever, and that includes helping him move. He said that wasn\u2019t necessary because he still has movers.\u201dDavid Axelrod, another former senior adviser, had booked Mr. Obama on his podcast, \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d a few days earlier. He was on hand Thursday for the president\u2019s last full day at work, when Mr. Obama commuted the sentences of 330 nonviolent drug offenders. And he was invited to the all-night bash, during which Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, served their guests chicken and waffles.\u201cHad a nice chat with Paul McCartney,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said.Carl Hulse and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A City Built on Refugees Looks at Trump\u2019s Plan With Fear", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byLOWELL, Mass. \u2014 When Hawo Ahmed, her two sisters and their mother arrived here late Wednesday night, the Somali family could hardly believe their good fortune.\u201cIt\u2019s like a dream come true,\u201d said Ms. Ahmed, 24.Their arrival was all the more remarkable because they were among the last refugees allowed into the United States before President Trump closed the borders. He signed an executive order on Friday suspending the nation\u2019s resettlement program temporarily, with an eye toward shrinking it when it resumes. The action touched off widespread protests around the globe.Ms. Ahmed and her family had never heard of Lowell, an old mill city about 30 miles northwest of Boston with red-brick factories lining its canals, until they searched for it on Google from Kenya two weeks ago.But if Lowell is strange to them, having them here is not strange for Lowell.Immigrants, including many refugees, are part of the fabric of life in this city of 108,000, which boasts a kaleidoscope of cultures. Downtown is bursting with restaurants serving Portuguese, Mexican, Greek, Cambodian, Thai and Japanese fare. Lowell features a statue of Buddha, a plaque honoring Nelson Mandela and a big sign in the high school that welcomes visitors in multiple languages. Colorful flags of various nationalities hang in the windows of homes here, and ethnic festivals are common. Arabic is regularly heard in shops.For a city with such a heavy refugee presence, Mr. Trump\u2019s order is not an abstract political issue, but one that could alter families\u2019 lives and even the community itself \u2014 especially if, as people here fear, the temporary policy is made permanent.Farouq Ali, an Iraqi refugee who arrived in Lowell in 2009 and works with new refugees, said he and other Iraqis in the area had been exchanging near-constant Facebook messages about Mr. Trump\u2019s impending policy. Over the weekend, he said, dozens of Iraqi and Syrian women gathered at a restaurant to share their fears.\u201cMost Iraqis have some of their families back in Iraq, so they are struggling to bring them to Lowell, to America,\u201d Mr. Ali said. Mr. Trump\u2019s policy, he said, could shatter their hopes.Lowell and its many nonprofit organizations devoted to refugees and immigrant groups are haltingly coming to terms with the idea that, at least for now, the flow of refugees here could stop or slow, a startling turnaround for a city built by immigrant labor.People from French Canada, Ireland, Portugal and Poland powered Lowell\u2019s once-mighty textile mills starting in the 1800s, and immigrants and refugees have found homes here ever since. It is a place where the history of immigration in America is writ large. Many of the mills closed before World War II, and the city\u2019s population declined, but it picked up again in the late 1970s as a wave of Cambodians fleeing the Khmer Rouge came to the city. Today, Cambodians make up about 13 percent of the population, and Lowell has the second-largest Cambodian community in the country, after Long Beach, Calif. A Cambodian represents part of Lowell in the state legislature.\u201cLowell has been replenished and re-energized by refugees and immigrants for generations,\u201d said Jeffrey Thielman, the president and chief executive of the International Institute of New England, which works with the federal government to resettle refugees in Lowell, Boston and Manchester, N.H.\u201cWe won\u2019t feel it right away,\u201d Mr. Thielman said of a halt in refugees, \u201cbut businesses will not have enough workers, and not having enough workers will inhibit Lowell\u2019s ability to grow.\u201dThe region\u2019s economy and its immigrants are closely intertwined. Southwick, a factory in nearby Haverhill that makes suits for Brooks Brothers, offers four English classes per week for about 70 refugees and other immigrants who work there. Thithi Aye, a Burmese refugee who arrived here in 2010, car-pooled from Lowell to her job at Southwick every day with other refugees, including one from Iraq. Eventually, she was able to buy her own car, and then a condo.Employers see hiring refugees as a win for everyone, as supply meets demand.\u201cThey use us as a steppingstone for the betterment of their families,\u201d said John Martynec, Southwick\u2019s senior vice president for manufacturing.Because there are so many nonprofit organizations, volunteers and government services here to support refugees, a decline in the number of refugees could lead to a withering of those support services.\u201cIf everything\u2019s closed off for a period of time, the problem would then be figuring out how to rebuild the infrastructure to welcome people in,\u201d said Robert Forrant, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, whose classes include third-generation Cambodians.The possibility of closing the borders has unsettled some residents who are not part of the refugee community. Samantha Cail, 49, the owner of HyperText Bookstore and Caf\u00e9, said she found it \u201chorrifying.\u201d\u201cThis administration\u2019s ability to demonize the \u2018other\u2019 is very frightening to me,\u201d said Ms. Cail, who voted for Hillary Clinton.The vast variety of cultures and ethnicities was one reason she was attracted to Lowell, where she has lived for 11 years.\u201cThere\u2019s always Cambodian operas or amazing, yearlong festivals that really add color and depth to the community,\u201d she said.Ms. Cail said she was not worried that terrorists would slip through, in part because the vetting process, which takes at least two years, seemed so rigorous.But Cheryl Carville, 54, a longtime Lowell resident who works in retail and voted for Mr. Trump, was more concerned. She said that her philosophy was \u201clive and let live,\u201d but that she could not think of a reason the borders should not be closed for 120 days. \u201cYou got to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said, adding that she wondered how many refugees the city could really absorb. \u201cYou got to know who\u2019s coming in here.\u201d\u201cAt some point,\u201d she asked, \u201chow much can you take in, and how much before it starts hurting everybody else?\u201dDavid Donovan, 25, an electrician and longtime Lowell resident, agreed that it was \u201creasonable\u201d to suspend the resettlement program, even though he had voted for Mrs. Clinton.Cambodians in particular, he said, had done much to enrich Lowell. But, he added, \u201cgiven that we\u2019re in a state of war, it\u2019s O.K. to freeze the border.\u201dIn the meantime, the city is continuing to absorb refugees like the newly arrived Ahmed family. On Thursday, the International Institute of New England helped organize a job fair here at which 18 other refugees met employers who were looking for workers in the health care field.Lisa Gurgone, executive director of the Home Care Aide Council, told the refugees that the aging of New England virtually guaranteed them jobs in health care. \u201cWe need all of you,\u201d she said.Among the refugees who attended the job fair was Zainab Abdo, 21, who came in May from Syria, where her home in Aleppo had been bombed. She said she was relieved to be here, had been treated well and was taking nursing classes at Middlesex Community College.\u201cThere is security here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel safe.\u201dAnd yet, with Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order in the works, she remains nervous about the future, especially for relatives still in Syria and Turkey, who she had hoped would be able to join her family here.Luis Pedroso, an immigrant from the Azores who helped found an electronics factory, said that he had employees who were refugees and that he viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s order as an overreaction.\u201cLowell has been known as a location for so many different, diverse parts of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Mr. Trump sees that he needs to be doing this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

More predictably, adults 50 and over spent significantly less time on the networks: an average of 4 hours 9 minutes a week.Sean Casey, the president of Nielsen\u2019s social division, said the finding initially surprised him because \u201cthe going thought is that social is vastly owned by the younger generation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of synonymous,\u201d said Mr. Casey, who wrote the foreword to the report. \u201cWhen you think of millennials, you think of social.\u201dMr. Casey, 46, said that eventually, the finding started to make more sense to him.\u201cAt a time when we wanted to be connected, it came out right when we were at the top of our media consumption,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s become second nature to our generation.\u201dThe finding underscores how ubiquitous the smartphone has become. The report, released on Jan. 17, found that in the United States, 97 percent of people 18 to 34, and 94 percent of people 35 to 49, had access to smartphones. Seventy-seven percent of those 50 and older used smartphones, the report found.The 29-page report was based on data from 9,000 smartphone users and 1,300 tablet users across the country from July through September. The data was not self-reported.The report also broke out which social networks were most popular on smartphones, finding that Facebook still dominated on mobile, with about 178.2 million unique users in September. It was followed by Instagram, with 91.5 million unique users; Twitter, with 82.2 million unique users; and Pinterest, with 69.6 million users.Snapchat, a favorite of younger users, was sixth on the list, behind the professional networking site LinkedIn.Finally, the report looked at second-screen activity on social media, measuring how many times Facebook and Twitter users employed those sites to post about programs they were watching or to interact with others\u2019 posts.Again, in this category, it was Generation X that could not look away from its devices: On an average day, the report found, 42 percent of those interacting with television on Facebook were from 35 to 49; only 40 percent were millennials.Advertisement"}

We will address a few of those complaints first, before turning to this week\u2019s topics.The headline is completely inappropriate for the advice question to which it refers. The child seems to harass his guest based solely on his misguided stereotype of a certain heritage. This is plain bigoted, not \u201cpopulist\u201d as the headline suggests. Populism is a broad term that is used to refer to vastly disparate political beliefs and styles, including those of Bernie Sanders and President Obama as well as President-elect Trump. It is synonymous neither with antipathy towards particular ethnicities, nor specific immigration policies. To call the child\u2019s taunt \u201cpopulism\u201d at once minimizes the seriousness of his actions and strains the definition of populism beyond recognition.Sarah Bayer, Boston, Mass.The author of the column, Philip Galanes, took the time to reply to a reader who wrote to him directly.Thank you for your note. I am the author of the column \u2014 but not the headline. And I agree with you. We should have found a better hed, particularly since the answer called on all of us to be extra-vigilant to racism and misogyny in these times. It also asked us to moderate the pitch of our speech, especially in complaint, to communicate better. I thank you for doing both.Shortly before the new year, an ad ran on a Times story that left some readers befuddled.My NY Times digital copy keeps displaying a pop-up that advertises a fabulous Obama tax rebate (supposedly he signed a bill Dec. 18). It would return millions of dollars to anyone who paid sales taxes in 2015. I called my accountant, who said it was a hoax. The pop-up has returned day after day as part of your news for the last two weeks. Could you please tell me if this has been approved by the NY Times? Is my accountant wrong?Rita ClearyThe ad was indeed a hoax, and readers who realized this have asked The Times to address the issue.The below ad is now part of the norm at The Times, alas. I don\u2019t frankly understand the mechanism by which such ads appear but assume, perhaps erroneously, that sites exercise some control in that regard.John Seager, Washington D.C.They\u2019re nearly impossible to catch in advance as they come through advertising technology platforms such as Facebook and Google at random. When fake news ads are reported we block the advertiser, and we\u2019ve also been lifting price floors, which has made an impact since implementation.The byline caught my attention for a couple reasons. I spent a year as a freelancer in Istanbul and understand the myriad challenges and dangers Turkish reporters (and foreign journos in Turkey) face. It seems every week brings fresh reports of journalists detained by the dozens for their work. While it saddens me that reporters in Turkey may elect to shield their identities in the same way those working in active war zones do, I see that in the current climate it could be necessary.Elizabeth Hewitt, Montpelier, Vt.The same story caught readers\u2019 attentions for other reasons, too. Initially, the story reported that the single gunman may have been as many as three gunmen, and they were wearing Santa Claus suits, an image which stayed with readers. The Times, however, never appended a correction to the story nor added a note explaining the change.As of my writing, the Times\u2019s current version of its online article makes no reference to Santa-disguised terrorists, only to a single (apparently normally-dressed) assailant. And there is no correction about \u201cearlier reports of multiple terrorists dressed in Santa costumes were in error.\u201d Especially in a case like this, the Times should go beyond just correcting its reporting to acknowledge that it had hastily printed an inaccurate rumor (and perhaps identify the rumor\u2019s original source).Richard D. Smith, Rocky Hill, N.J.We asked Slackman about this. Here\u2019s his response:It was a fast-breaking story and The Times, and many other sites, used information we thought was credible. Would it have been advisable to adjust the language so that it was clear we were now skeptical of the earlier reports? Probably so. But these were challenging circumstances.Another reader raised an issue that will hopefully be addressed in the new year.Erik Nordlof, Arlington, Va.We asked Alexandra MacCallum, who oversees Times video, for an answer. She told us that while some videos have text overlay, which editors add manually, an automated closed caption system is in the works this year.Different leadership ran the video department in March of 2015; I was unaware of that statement. When I took over in January of 2016, no work had started on the project, which is a large technical heave as well as a change to our newsroom workflow.Closed captions and transcriptions are a priority for the beginning of this year (2017). We spent much of last year fixing some technical infrastructure, and we\u2019re looking have a solution in the coming months. We understand that it\u2019s problematic for our readers and recognize the importance to make sure our readers have a seamless watching experience when they are on our site.As trust in the media falters, a reader has taken a stand, one friend at a time. He wrote us to ask for our aid in his mission.Where might I find the New York Times\u2019s statements on journalistic integrity, quality of journalism, and news standards? I am preparing for a debate with a friend who has called The Times biased.David E. Johnson, San Antonio, Tx.Good luck, and see you next week.An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of the video editor. It is MacCallum, not MacCullum.Advertisement"}

But a word of warning to the president-elect: This one could be different.When Paula Jones sued Bill Clinton, powerful conservative backers bankrolled and pressed her case until the sitting president of the United States was deposed under oath \u2014 and fatefully denied having sexual relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky. The result: the first and only impeachment of an elected president.Ms. Zervos could well have the same kind of political muscle behind her \u2014 from the left.A CNN-ORC poll on Tuesday also put Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating at 40 percent, \u201cthe lowest of any recent president and 44 points below that of President Barack Obama, the 44th president.\u201dNo doubt, many people from both sides of the Trumpian divide will sympathize with his antipathy for pre-election polling \u2014 although Hillary Clinton\u2019s two-percentage point win in the popular vote was about in line with national polling. The postelection polls are well outside the margin of sampling error in their comparisons to other presidents.Mr. Trump consoled himself with all the buses and airplanes heading to Washington this week for the inauguration weekend.Unmentioned: More than 200,000 of those people are going to protest the 45th president. Bikers for Trump has vowed to defend him.While on Twitter, the president-elect decided to again go after Mr. Lewis, Democrat of Georgia \u2014 even though last week\u2019s Twitter confrontation is still reverberating among African-Americans and beyond.It is, in fact, true that Mr. Lewis, a civil rights icon who had his skull cracked in Selma, Ala., questioned the legitimacy of President Bush, the last president elected despite losing the popular vote.It is also true that Mr. Lewis is just not someone easily attacked by either political party.The top Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have sent Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama a letter with two pointed questions: If confirmed as attorney general, will you commit to not shutting down any F.B.I. or Justice Department investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election? And will you recuse yourself from involvement in those investigations?Since his appearance before the committee, Democrats have made clear they do not trust that an Attorney General Sessions would be an independent law enforcement officer when it comes to the man he loyally backed for president, who then picked him to be the highest law enforcement official in the land.The painting, which had won its spot in a student art contest, was an abstract depiction of a conflict between the police and residents of St. Louis.The painting had been taken down a few times by Republican lawmakers and left at the office of Representative William Lacy Clay, Democrat of Missouri, who sponsored the piece, before finally appealing to the architect\u2019s office, which oversees the contest, in which student artwork is chosen to hang in a well-traveled hall between the Cannon House Office Building and the Capitol. The architect wrote a letter on Tuesday suggesting that the painting broke contest rules by being too political.\u201cBy his unprecedented and unconstitutional action, following criticism of the artwork by Speaker Ryan and several G.O.P.

But Mr. Price\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings this week before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee, already set to be contentious, what with Medicare and the Affordable Care Act being hot topics, now promise to be scorching.For much of Tuesday, Democratic members of Congress have been proclaiming on social media that no, they will not be attending Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.And this flurry from the head of the Congressional Black Caucus:It is not unusual for members of Congress to skip the festivities, held outdoors on the steps of the Capitol in January. (This year, the weather forecast is for unseasonably warm temperatures, but rain.) What is unusual is the number proclaiming their truancy. If unity is what he wants, Mr. Trump has his work cut out for him.It may be one of the most contentious of the confirmation hearings.President-elect Trump \u2014 not exactly known for his piety \u2014 will be sworn in as the 45th president with not one Bible but two \u2014 the one that Abraham Lincoln used at his first inauguration and his own personal Good Book.Thomas Barrack Jr., who is leading the inaugural committee, said in a statement:In his first inaugural address, President Lincoln appealed to the \u2018better angels of our nature.\u2019 As he takes the same oath of office 156 years later, President-elect Trump is humbled to place his hand on Bibles that hold special meaning both to his family and to our country.Mr. Trump\u2019s Bible was apparently presented to him by his mother upon his graduation from the Sunday Church Primary School at First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, on Children\u2019s Day, June 12, 1955.The late-day confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, a billionaire and Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary, is expected to feature fierce questioning from Democrats over her still-incomplete ethics form.Ms. DeVos, the heiress to an automotive fortune who married into the even more vast fortune of the family that owns Amway, is one of few nominees to go before a Senate panel before completing an ethics questionnaire for the independent Office of Government Ethics addressing her financial holdings. According to prepared remarks, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, will say:I am going to want to learn more about your extensive financial entanglements and potential conflicts of interest. As a billionaire with hundreds, if not thousands, of investments made through complex financial instruments \u2014 many of which are made in ways that are not transparent and hard to track \u2014 you need to make it very clear how you will be avoiding conflicts of interest should you be confirmed. That goes for your investments, as well as the massive web of investments made by your immediate family.Mr. Trump had already upended Republican plans to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act, then replace it several years down the road, by demanding that a new health care law be ready within weeks.Now he is vexing them on taxes. Mr. Trump campaigned hard on a proposal to impose a 35 percent tariff on goods built by American companies abroad, then imported into the United States. Since Republicans are generally opposed to huge tax increases on corporations, congressional leaders had come up with an alternative: \u201cborder adjustment,\u201d under which companies would no longer be able to deduct the cost of goods they import from their taxes or exclude the revenue from exports when calculating taxable income. That would encourage companies to buy parts and materials from American suppliers.\u201cAnytime I hear border adjustment, I don\u2019t love it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBecause usually it means we\u2019re going to get adjusted into a bad deal. That\u2019s what happens.\u201dHe\u2019s not making it easy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After the Women\u2019s March", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byThe women\u2019s marches were a phenomenal success and an important cultural moment. Most everybody came back uplifted and empowered. Many said they felt hopeful for the first time since Election Day. But these marches can never be an effective opposition to Donald Trump.These are all important matters, and they tend to be voting issues for many upper-middle-class voters in university towns and coastal cities. But this is 2017. Ethnic populism is rising around the world. The crucial problems today concern the way technology and globalization are decimating jobs and tearing the social fabric; the way migration is redefining nation-states; the way the post-World War II order is increasingly being rejected as a means to keep the peace.All the big things that were once taken for granted are now under assault: globalization, capitalism, adherence to the Constitution, the American-led global order. If you\u2019re not engaging these issues first, you\u2019re not going to be in the main arena of national life.Second, there was too big a gap between Saturday\u2019s marches and the Democratic and Republican Parties.Sometimes social change happens through grass-roots movements \u2014 the civil rights movement. But most of the time change happens through political parties: The New Deal, the Great Society, the Reagan Revolution. Change happens when people run for office, amass coalitions of interest groups, engage in the messy practice of politics.Without the discipline of party politics, social movements devolve into mere feeling, especially in our age of expressive individualism. People march and feel good and think they have accomplished something. They have a social experience with a lot of people and fool themselves into thinking they are members of a coherent and demanding community. Such movements descend to the language of mass therapy.It\u2019s significant that as marching and movements have risen, the actual power of the parties has collapsed. Marching is a seductive substitute for action in an antipolitical era, and leaves the field open for a rogue like Trump.Finally, identity politics is too small for this moment. On Friday, Trump offered a version of unabashed populist nationalism. On Saturday, the anti-Trump forces could have offered a red, white and blue alternative patriotism, a modern, forward-looking patriotism based on pluralism, dynamism, growth, racial and gender equality and global engagement.Instead, the marches offered the pink hats, an anti-Trump movement built, oddly, around Planned Parenthood, and lots of signs with the word \u201cpussy\u201d in them. The definition of America is up for grabs. Our fundamental institutions have been exposed as shockingly hollow. But the marches couldn\u2019t escape the language and tropes of identity politics.But now progressives seem intent on doubling down on exactly what has doomed them so often. Lilla pointed out that identity politics isolates progressives from the wider country: \u201cThe fixation on diversity in our schools and in the press has produced a generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self-defined groups, and indifferent to the task of reaching out to Americans in every walk of life.\u201dIdentity-based political movements always seem to descend into internal rivalries about who is most oppressed and who should get pride of place. Sure enough, the controversy before and after the march was over the various roles of white feminists, women of color, anti-abortion feminists and various other out-groups.The central challenge today is not how to celebrate difference. The central threat is not the patriarchy. The central challenge is to rebind a functioning polity and to modernize a binding American idea.I loathed Trump\u2019s inaugural: It offered a zero-sum, ethnically pure, backward-looking brutalistic nationalism. But it was a coherent vision, and he is rallying a true and fervent love of our home.If the anti-Trump forces are to have a chance, they have to offer a better nationalism, with diversity cohering around a central mission, building a nation that balances the dynamism of capitalism with biblical morality.The march didn\u2019t come close. Hint: The musical \u201cHamilton\u201d is a lot closer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump and the Theater of Access", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byNotebookDuring the campaign, the ease with which Trump could demonize journalists, or simply use them as props, took members of the press by surprise. And when Trump won the election, his sense of the media \u2014 what it is worth, and what it is for \u2014 was, in his view, proved right. And it has followed him to the White House.Suddenly terrified of losing access, major media outlets were then forced to mount (individually, institutionally and through their representatives at White House Correspondents\u2019 Association) a hasty, largely context-free defense of a complicated tradition rooted in a deeply conventional sense of what the news media is and how it is supposed to work. Reporters and media organizations found themselves not just advocating their own importance, individually and collectively \u2014 a fraught task even in a more forgiving environment \u2014 but pledging membership in, and solidarity with, the same colloquial \u201cmedia\u201d that Trump had just spent his entire campaign generalizing and vilifying to great effect.There\u2019s been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable. And I\u2019m here to tell you that it goes two ways. We\u2019re going to hold the press accountable, as well. The American people deserve better. And as long as he serves as the messenger for this incredible movement, he will take his message directly to the American people where his focus will always be.He took no questions. The reporters had been stage-managed, again, for their subject\u2019s benefit; summoned for a punishment, and a spectacle, this time to the White House briefing room. They were back in the pen. As a spectacle, Spicer\u2019s scolding may have felt abrupt and extreme, but it was years in the making. Trump\u2019s presidency didn\u2019t bring about the utter remaking \u2014 and repositioning \u2014 of the media. He just made it impossible to ignore.I thought I\u2019d do less of it, but I\u2019m covered so dishonestly by the press \u2014 so dishonestly \u2014 that I can put out Twitter \u2014 and it\u2019s not 140, it\u2019s now 280 \u2014 I can go bing bing bing . . . and they put it on and as soon as I tweet it out \u2014 this morning on television, Fox \u2014 \u201cDonald Trump, we have breaking news.\u201dTo members of the media, this is disorienting, bizarre and crazy-making; through Twitter, the arrival of new statements from the president becomes an event unto itself. They fit most news organizations\u2019 criteria of breaking news: They are important; they are unanticipated and at first glance inexplicable; they demand elaboration, explanation and detail. A few posts in the morning can consume the day ahead.The media\u2019s bewilderment at how to treat Trump\u2019s tweets derives from the speed at which Twitter (and other social-media platforms) has undercut their prerogatives, but also from the media\u2019s reluctance to fully embrace a scenario in which it is so thoroughly decentered. The pre-internet, pre-social media was inherently cartel-like, deriving much of its power from the exclusive access it could provide to large numbers of people. This was obviously interesting to advertisers, who wanted to reach customers. This audience would be similarly appealing to a politician, who would be keenly interested in how he was represented to it. That form of media power was rooted less in vague notions of trust or quality than in control over distribution, and it is voided on a service like Twitter. A social-media platform offers media companies the opportunity to reconstitute its operations within the service \u2014 with the ability to publish all sorts of media, and to maintain a brand, and to gain followers \u2014 but controls the means of distribution. Power is achievable on Twitter, but it is always borrowed, and shared.This, for a figure like Trump, is liberating and changes the press calculus in exciting ways. Not only does he get to communicate frequently and directly with citizens, but he doesn\u2019t have to answer to would-be mediators; in fact, his feed provides him with clear and pleasing evidence of their constant degradation. Benefits once reserved for those who granted access to media \u2014 coverage, reach and the coinciding appearance of legitimacy \u2014 are available to him without cost or compromise. Reporters covering Trump have been confused and confounded by the question of where they stand in relation to him; their subject, in contrast, never is.Thank you very much. It\u2019s very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis. I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it\u2019s good to be with you. We stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news.In recent days, the administration has sought to replicate Trump\u2019s Twitter experience in the briefing room. Spicer\u2019s initial one-way news conference was followed first by a more subdued performance \u2014 his first official daily briefing \u2014 which nevertheless devolved into an extensive critique of the media\u2019s \u201cdemoralizing\u201d coverage of Trump. He cast critical coverage as part of an oppositional \u201cnarrative\u201d and reminded the assembled press, again, that accountability is a \u201ctwo-way street.\u201d The next day, he took his case to Fox News, in an interview with Sean Hannity. More changes to the briefing room, and to the routine, were coming. He wasn\u2019t specific, but again a drip of information from other, questionable sources provided the outlines: The week before, at the DeploraBall, a gathering of \u201cTrumpism\u2019s Twitter Wing,\u201d the founder of The Gateway Pundit, a popular, enthusiastically pro-Trump site with a taste for conspiracy theories, told the crowd that the site would have a seat in the briefing room; briefly, a rumor circulated that Alex Jones would, too.The new administration, in other words, was reconsidering its predecessors\u2019 calculations about access and power. This sentiment seems to be contagious in Washington. Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, speaking on the House floor, suggested giving up on the press entirely. \u201cBetter to get your news directly from the president,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, it might be the only way to get the unvarnished truth.\u201dJohn Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

Why, for example, were Ms. Brjansdottir\u2019s black Doc Martens found on the docks of a harbor about 25 miles from the beach where her body was found? Why was there snow on their soles on a snowless day? How did traces of her blood get splattered on the seat of a red Kia Rio sedan? And was she sexually assaulted before her death?The mystery began on Jan. 14 when Ms. Brjansdottir\u2019s mother phoned the police in a panic after her daughter failed to return home from a bar crawl in downtown Reykjavik on a foggy night.Surveillance video, released by the police, showed Ms. Brjansdottir walking unsteadily by herself down a deserted street at around 5 a.m. At one point, the police said, she could be seen near a red Kia. It was the last time she was seen alive.After reviewing video from the scene, they noticed something else: a fishing trawler from Greenland, the Polar Nanoq, moored to a nearby dock. Not far from it they spotted a small red car. It was parked there at 6:30 a.m., the surveillance video showed, and it was the same model as the vehicle seen next to Ms. Brjansdottir before she vanished. Tracing the license plate, the police learned that the car had been rented by two men from the trawler.About 90 minutes later, Mr. Gudmarsson said, the squad \u2014 part of the only armed police force in Iceland \u2014 rappelled onto the trawler and arrested the two fishermen, who did not resist. He said that the ship was aware \u201cthe Vikings\u201d were pursuing them and had already altered course to return to Reykjavik. \u201cThe weather was bad and there were eight-meter-high waves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crew cooperated.\u201d\u201cMost murder cases in Iceland are not mysteries \u2014 the victims and their killers usually know each other, the murderer rarely seeks to cover up the crime, and cases are usually solved quickly,\u201d Mr. Gunnlaugsson said. He added: \u201cForeign involvement is almost unheard-of. The reaction would be different if the suspects would\u2019ve been two Icelandic boys.\u201dOver the weekend, about 400 Greenlanders braved chilly weather to attend a memorial outside the Icelandic consulate in Nuuk, the country\u2019s capital. The local pastor led hymns as the crowd laid candles on snow drifts around the consulate. Greenland\u2019s foreign minister sent condolences to his Icelandic counterpart.\u201cThe case has dominated headlines in Nuuk, just as it has in Reykjavik,\u201d Petur Asgeirsson, Iceland\u2019s consul general in Nuuk, said in an interview.Sigrun Skaftadottir, a 28-year-old D.J. in Reykjavik, said the killing of a woman in the prime of her life had spooked Icelanders and was already changing the way people behaved, including prompting renewed interest in self-defense classes.\u201cGirls in my circle are either walking home with someone or taking a taxi, even if they are just traveling a few blocks,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking of all the times I walked home alone in Reykjavik, sometimes drunk, sometimes with music in my ears, engaging with strangers, even inviting random people at the bar to an after-party.\u201dShe added, \u201cNow, I won\u2019t do that again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But if an addict attempts to get clean and her home is a hotbed for substance abuse, her chances for sobriety are slim.Bob Bryant, Chief of Police for the Penobscot Indian Nation, told me that when he tries to help move people home from rehab, they protest: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re asking me to come back to the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s den.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis drug epidemic is affecting the whole country, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really got its grips on Indian Country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bryant said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am so tired of articles like this. What happened to parent\u2019s being able to freely choose what is best for their baby?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093AnonymousI completely agree that choice is essential, but wealthy women shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the only ones afforded the choice between breastfeeding and formula feeding.Different socioeconomic groups face disproportionate barriers to breastfeeding. Just look at what happened when California mandated paid family leave. Research showed that low-income women benefited the most from the law \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d previously had the least access to paid leave \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and overall, leave led to a 5.3 percent increase in the probability of breastfeeding. Workplace regulations, family culture, health concerns and time may all affect a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision but poor women typically must jump the most hurdles if they decide to breastfeed.Ellen Piwoz, senior program officer of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation nutrition team, told me that barriers to breastfeeding are endemic. She said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Formula: Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 You have to say \u00e2\u0080\u0098What can I do today to really help make sure that a society and a family and a community and a workplace will allow a woman to breastfeed?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd by the same token, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no need to shame or cast judgment on anyone who chooses to formula feed. A happy, healthy, sane mom should be priority number one, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no single way to be an incredible mother.The decision is deeply personal, but one that all women should have the power to make.Thanks for all your questions!

To do it, I had to give up all forms of sex for a year. The reason: I\u2019m gay.With what we know today about the disease, it\u2019s a stupid reason.In 2015, the agency modified the lifetime ban and allowed men who had sex with men to donate blood if they had abstained from sex for one year. This revision followed several years of study after an advisory committee found the lifetime ban \u201csuboptimal.\u201dThis is a positive but by no means complete step. And it is unclear when the F.D.A. will reach a decision. As the agency put it when it introduced the one-year deferral, because the process was \u201cdata driven,\u201d it \u201ccould not specify a time for when future policy changes might occur.\u201dIn the meantime, people like me who want to donate badly needed blood are barred from doing so, unless they take a yearlong vow of celibacy.Barring an entire group of people based on the gender of their sexual partner is no less outlandish than barring people based on where they live. In 2014, the most recent date for complete data, the national H.I.V. rate per 100,000 people was 12.6; however, in Washington, D.C., it was 74.3. Should the F.D.A. ban blood donations by residents of the nation\u2019s capital?The answer to both questions is obvious: of course not. And the answer should be the same for men who have sex with men.In my work with the National Gay Blood Drive, I\u2019ve heard directly from patients and their family members about their need for blood. After I was finally able to make my donation on Tuesday, a mother messaged me on Facebook, thanking me for giving her son \u201cand kids like him the tools to fight.\u201d You can\u2019t help but well up when you hear that.All potential donors, regardless of race, age, creed or the gender of their sexual partners, should be questioned about any risky sexual behavior. Until this F.D.A. policy is rescinded and replaced by a more enlightened approach, people like me will be forbidden to donate blood. This decision should be based on the best individual assessment of a person\u2019s risk and not driven by stigma and fear.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s like if you care about women and you care about women\u2019s rights then you should be pro-choice.\u201dNow these tensions, which have simmered behind the scenes, are spilling out into the open.On Monday, march organizers revoked so-called partnership status \u2013 a kind of official recognition \u2014 for a Texas anti-abortion group, New Wave Feminists. (Ms. Sarsour called the initial decision to include the group \u201ca mistake.\u201d)Many anti-abortion women like Ms. Lyon are simply staying home. But one group, Students for Life of America, which organizes college students to oppose abortion, does plan to march, banners and all. Kristan Hawkins, its president, a 31-year-old mother of four, said she, too, made a request for partnership status, which she said was ignored.She said her marchers will wear Go-Pro cameras: \u201cWhen they start spitting and screaming at us it will be helpful.\u201dThe march comes as abortion foes are newly emboldened by the election of Mr. Trump. He won the support of 53 percent of white women, who flocked to him primarily for economic reasons, pollsters said, but also because he made explicit promises to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that found a right to abortion within the privacy protections of the Constitution.At the same time, Republicans on Capitol Hill are threatening to withdraw taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood, the reproductive rights behemoth. The group is the lead financial sponsor of the Women\u2019s March and is helping to organize the event, along with Naral Pro-Choice America and other abortion-rights organizations. Their participation makes it clear: Abortion opponents are out of step with the march.\u201cReproductive freedom or reproductive justice means that women decide the fate of our own bodies,\u201d Gloria Steinem, an honorary co-chairwoman of the march, wrote in an email message. She said if women \u201cwant to make decisions over their own bodies themselves, and want other women to have the same power, then they should feel very welcome at the march.\u201dYet many women do not. Among them is Charmaine Yoest, a vocal opponent of abortion who is a senior fellow at American Values, a conservative organization here.\u201cThis is what we conservative women live with all the time, this idea that we somehow aren\u2019t really women and we just reflect internalized misogyny,\u201d she said. Of the march, she added: \u201cI don\u2019t think they represent women. I think they are a wholly owned subsidiary of the abortion movement.\u201dThe relationship, and sometimes tension, between reproductive rights and feminism goes back decades, to the inception of so-called second wave feminism in the 1960s; the first wave culminated in women winning the right to vote. Its pioneers, echoing the American left\u2019s fight for racial justice and its opposition to the Vietnam War, embraced the birth control pill as a way to give women more power over their own lives. Thus a sexual revolution was born.In 1973, just as middle-class women were abandoning homemaking for the work force, inspired by writers like Ms. Steinem and Betty Friedan, the Supreme Court handed down Roe v. Wade. That drove a wedge in the women\u2019s movement, said Carole Joffe, a sociologist and reproductive rights advocate at the University of California, San Francisco.While many feminists saw the right to abortion as essential to women\u2019s empowerment, she said, the decision also galvanized \u201cwhat we now call the religious right\u201d \u2014 Catholics, Protestants and evangelical Christians, as well as churchgoing African-Americans, a number of whom considered themselves liberal on other issues.\u201cI think this march will be discussed for a very long time, because this march raises in a very powerful way the question of who can rightfully be called a feminist, what does feminist organizing mean in the 21st century,\u201d Ms. Joffe said. \u201cIs it even possible to have a conception of American feminism that does not involve pro-choice and pro-contraception?\u201dCelinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said that is because the question is inextricably tied to faith, and women tend to be more religious than men.Officials of Planned Parenthood and Naral, however, say that as soon as word of the march started spreading, their members across the country began asking what they could do. Both groups have a powerful presence here in the capital and are expert at organizing protests.\u201cThere have been some stories about anti-choice folks trying to show up in protest; I\u2019m not worried about them \u2014 they\u2019re going to be drowned out by hundreds of thousands of folks,\u201d Mitchell Stille, Naral\u2019s national political director, said in an interview. Asked if those women could march in solidarity with the march, Mr. Stille sounded irked.\u201cAnti-choice women voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got exactly what they wanted, so I\u2019m not sure exactly what the solidarity of that would be.\u201dMs. Lyon, the law student, did not vote for Mr. Trump; she said she could not support either him or Mrs. Clinton, and picked a third-party candidate.Living in the liberal-leaning city of Madison, she often feels isolated for her views, which she said she came to through research that reinforced her Catholic beliefs. She also accepts the church\u2019s ban on contraception, and sees her position as consistent with her pursuit of racial justice in prisons.Advertisement"}

What experiences must one have, or how long must a transplant have lived here, to be considered a full-fledged New Yorker?Is it when you know how to hail a cab? The first time you nap on the subway? Or when you see a rat and think nothing of it?We asked a few longtime residents to share their thoughts.The New York attitude develops over time, according to the 72-year-old Patti Hayward, who was reared in Canarsie, Brooklyn.\u201cAttack everything you do here with a lot of heart,\u201d Ms. Hayward said. \u201cWhen you feel like you\u2019ve persevered,\u201d consider yourself a New Yorker. And know how to ride the subway, she added.Doris Shankman, 92, was born at home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and grew up in the Bronx. For her, becoming a New Yorker is all about shared experiences.\u201cRide the bus. Join walking tours or cultural activities,\u201d she said. \u201cOne becomes a New Yorker by participating.\u201dFor Marilyn McNair the only real New Yorkers are those born here.\u201cThere is no rite of passage,\u201d said Ms. McNair, 67, of Harlem. \u201cEven though you may have a New York address, there\u2019s always a silhouette that separates you, like a cutout that\u2019s pasted onto another picture.\u201dOthers were more generous with their definitions.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you come from,\u201d said Rose Binder, 93, who grew up on the Lower East Side in Manhattan.\u201cMaybe you have a different accent,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re decent and kind, you\u2019re a New Yorker.\u201dSo, how does it work? When do you think a transplant can be called a New Yorker? Let us know in the comments.Here\u2019s what else is happening:As a T-shirt or mug somewhere once read: \u201cToday has been canceled; go back to bed.\u201dWe wish, and so will you when you roll out from under those covers.Seeing is believing \u2014 so hang tight and join us in doing a weather dance \u2014 but the first white blanket of the season may be upon us this evening.That is, if everyone shared rides.Using data from three million taxi rides, M.I.T. researchers found that ride-sharing cabs could reduce traffic and pollution and result in fewer trips. Passengers would only have to wait an average of 2.7 minutes for a car.Sounds great, right?The only hiccup we can foresee is that the ride-sharing system would require every taxi-taking New Yorker to squeeze into a car with strangers, peacefully.We\u2019re not so sure that would happen.Advertisement"}

Unlikely Idea Has People Talking", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byFrom political circles in New York City to cocktail parties on Capitol Hill, on right-of-center Facebook pages and among left-of-center donors, two of the biggest untethered threads in New York politics are being drawn together around a single question.Would Hillary Clinton run for mayor?The prospect has an obvious, novelistic allure: A run for mayor of New York this year would pit Mrs. Clinton against Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat who managed her Senate campaign in 2000, and, should she win, would put her in charge of President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s hometown, ensuring years of potential clashes between bitter rivals.The question has gained momentum in the weeks since Mrs. Clinton lost to Mr. Trump, a Republican. It began quietly at first, then grew louder among the conservative media outlets and pundits who hold her and Mr. de Blasio in disdain.While the answer would almost certainly be no, supporters of Mrs. Clinton and former members of her staff appear to have been happy to let the speculation spread from closed-door gatherings of donors and allies, where it has been discussed among the many hypothetical future jobs Ms. Clinton might pursue, to more public forums.\u201cObviously, that\u2019s a conversation point for everybody; it\u2019s a logical point after you ask, \u2018What is Hillary going to do next?\u2019\u201d said Alan Patricof, a fund-raiser, donor and longtime friend of Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. \u201cWhether that\u2019s a university presidency, the head of some women\u2019s and children\u2019s group, something international, or even mayor of New York.\u201dA spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Nick Merrill, declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign, Dan Levitan, declined to comment on the possibility that she might enter the race, though similar requests for comment are typically met with a response citing lower crime figures and the creation of universal prekindergarten and affordable housing on the mayor\u2019s watch.\u201cI heard it three times in the two days I was on the Hill,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, a former top aide to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg who has been actively courting potential challengers to Mr. de Blasio.Mr. Tusk, citing figures from a private poll of New York Democrats he conducted last year, said he believed that Mrs. Clinton would win the race if she entered. (He said she was included in the poll for comparison, not as a potential candidate.) But he said he did not believe she would run.\u201cThe reality is that she\u2019s not going to,\u201d Mr. Tusk said, \u201cand all it does is further delay the thinking and plans of people who actually could run and win.\u201dThe Clintons live in the Westchester County hamlet of Chappaqua, but state law requires only that a candidate for mayor be a New York City resident by Election Day, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections said.One of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s best periods as a 2016 presidential candidate came before the New York primary as she raced between bubble tea shops in Flushing, Queens, struggled to swipe a MetroCard and addressed supporters in the West Village. \u201cToday, today, you proved once again, there\u2019s no place like home,\u201d she told a jubilant crowd in Midtown Manhattan after defeating Senator Bernie Sanders by nearly 16 points.But she has kept an exceedingly low profile since the election, making only occasional appearances in selfies snapped by supporters who encountered her at a bookstore or walking her dogs near her home.At her last public appearance \u2014 an event at the Plaza to thank major donors \u2014 Mrs. Clinton complained of Russian interference in the election, saying that the hacking of Democratic targets was intended to \u201cundermine our democracy\u201d and was ordered by Vladimir V. Putin \u201cbecause he has a personal beef against me.\u201d\u201cThe best platform to change the world is the White House,\u201d said Stu Loeser, a former longtime aide to Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cAnd a pretty close second is running one of the three biggest cities in the United States.\u201dMr. Loeser recalled witnessing a conversation between Mr. Bloomberg and President Obama at a New York City diner in 2007, when Mr. Obama was a senator making his first run for the White House. \u201cHe said that if he doesn\u2019t win the presidency, he\u2019s going to strongly consider running for mayor of Chicago,\u201d Mr. Loeser said, adding that he thought \u201cit was a great idea.\u201dOthers eager to see Mrs. Clinton return to public office, and disgruntled over what they called Mr. de Blasio\u2019s lukewarm support for her during the campaign, noted that she had begun her political career in another New York office she swore she was not interested in: senator.For his part, Mr. de Blasio attended a fund-raiser in Washington on Thursday for his re-election. Guests included two top campaign aides to Mrs. Clinton, John D. Podesta and Neera Tanden, said Mr. Levitan, the mayor\u2019s campaign spokesman. Mr. Levitan said that Mrs. Clinton and her team had not spoken with Mr. de Blasio \u2014 recently or in the past \u2014 about her running for mayor.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article described incorrectly a suggestion by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to Hillary Clinton before the 2013 mayoral race. Mr. Bloomberg suggested that Mrs. Clinton run to succeed him, not Bill de Blasio, as mayor.Advertisement"}

He commented on one that was posted to Facebook:The post, which was shared 14,000 times, linked to a story about a case in which the authorities have not described the immigration status of the suspect, or said that he was a noncitizen. They have also discredited the claim that the man yelled \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d during the episode.Nevertheless, the comment that Mr. Eason posted on the site, which he later said he could not remember making, garnered 87 likes. \u201cIf Muslims are taught hate by their religion,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthen all Muslims are potential terrorists and should be treated accordingly. TRUMP will stop this kind of stuff.\u201dSgt. Timothy Briggeman of the Cass County Sheriff\u2019s Office in North Dakota, which is investigating the case, said such stories and responses often appeared on social media when a person in his jurisdiction with an Arabic-sounding name is charged with a crime.\u201cTo be honest,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s embarrassing and it\u2019s disheartening when anyone with a name of such ends up in the news \u2014 the comments that get thrown around. That seems to be the No. 1 remark: \u2018Send them back and get rid of them,\u2019 and, \u2018We don\u2019t need them.\u2019\u201dWorries that refugees might be radicalized have also been amplified on the internet. This story was shared at least 1,400 times:And this one, posted by The Daily Caller, was shared more than 3,000 times, despite linking to a story with no evidence of a cover-up:Mr. Eason, the police officer in Oklahoma, said that part of the challenge for him in evaluating stories on the internet is that many are written with headlines that appeal to common sense.But Mr. Eason has read stories that suggest the conditions in Syria are so bad that it is impossible to verify refugees\u2019 stories, which has made him worry that no level of scrutiny will be sufficient.\u201cThey were saying with them coming from these areas, it\u2019s hard to vet them,\u201d Mr. Eason said. \u201cAnd it makes sense.\u201dAn article on Jan. 29 about the anxiety toward Muslim refugees that is being stoked by the far-right media misidentified the source of a widely shared article claiming that members of Al Qaeda had entered the United States disguised as refugees.

{"Headline": "Facebook Hires Campbell Brown to Lead News Partnerships Team", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byFacebook is turning to a former television news journalist to help smooth over its strained ties to the news media, which views it as both a vital partner and a potentially devastating opponent.It has hired Campbell Brown, a former NBC News correspondent and CNN prime-time host, to lead its news partnerships team, starting immediately.The addition of Ms. Brown comes as Facebook is struggling with its position as a content provider that does not produce its own content \u2014 that is, as a platform, not a media company.Facebook\u2019s ambivalence in applying editorial judgment to the information coursing through its site has repeatedly drawn the company into trouble.Facebook executives emphasized that Ms. Brown\u2019s role was not to act as the sort of editor in chief that some commentators, including Margaret Sullivan, the Washington Post media columnist, have said it needs. They said she would not be involved in content decisions.Rather, they said, she will work as a liaison with news organizations so that Facebook can better meet their journalistic and business imperatives and lessen some of their suspicion about the social media giant.But Facebook executives said they were hiring Ms. Brown for her understanding of the news industry as a onetime White House correspondent, co-anchor of \u201cWeekend Today\u201d and primary substitute anchor of \u201cNightly News\u201d at NBC News, and prime-time anchor on CNN, which she left in 2010.Facebook declined to comment beyond Ms. Brown\u2019s original post on Facebook.The social media site\u2019s relationship with the news media is, at best, in frenemy territory.The company relies on major news organizations \u2014 including The New York Times \u2014 for reliable news content. News organizations, in turn, rely on Facebook for distribution to its 1.8 billion users, who are increasingly turning to its news feed for information instead of to news organizations\u2019 own home pages.That shift has allowed Facebook to eat up a huge share of the online advertising market, contributing to devastating consequences for the ad-supported news organizations. So, Facebook has gotten double blame in recent months for enabling the circulation of false news items while contributing to the financial pressures that are causing the continuing, national wave of newsroom buyouts and layoffs.Facebook executives said Ms. Brown would help find better accommodations between Facebook and its journalistic partners so that both find the partnerships equally worthwhile \u2014 whether through Facebook Live, its Instant Articles feature or its news feed.The company does have some seasoned journalists in its ranks. But it does not have any in a senior position working on its newsroom partnerships, contributing to a disconnect between the company and news organizations when discussing how to collaborate on projects.Advertisement"}

Kennedy as a historical marker and suggesting that Mr. Trump\u2019s address was a striking reminder of just how much the country has changed.\u201cA speech that in the early 1960s gave us \u2018Ask not,\u2019\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cToday, gave us \u2018American carnage.\u2019\u201dOn election night in November, Chris Wallace of Fox News was among the first anchors to recognize that Mr. Trump had a realistic shot at victory.On Friday, Mr. Wallace beat his competition again, reporting the thrust of Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural address nearly an hour before it was delivered.\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a unique readout on this speech,\u201d Mr. Wallace told Fox viewers.

Afterward, he offered this on-air analysis:\u201cThis was not about the transfer of power \u2014 this was about Donald Trump seizing power in the sense that there is a new sheriff in town,\u201d Mr. Wallace said. \u201cThis was the speech of an insurgent, the leader of a revolt who has taken control in Washington.\u201dA phrase in President Trump\u2019s heavily populist speech mimicked a speech delivered by Bane, the super villain played by Tom Hardy in the Batman film \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises.\u201dYou better believe the internet noticed.It was only one of a cavalcade of memes that surfaced on social media almost as soon as the day\u2019s events kicked off.On Reddit, elated supporters of Mr. Trump congregated on a message board named \u201cThe_Donald,\u201d and circulated photos of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton with the gleeful caption, \u201cnot my president.\u201dDivided country, divided news media on the internet.\u201cWinter Comes,\u201d blared The Huffington Post, the left-leaning site founded by Arianna Huffington, minutes before President Trump took the oath of office.By contrast, the conservative Drudge Report struck a more optimistic tone with the headline, \u201cIt All Begins Today\u201d \u2014 later updated to the more euphoric \u201cAmerica Again!\u201dBuzzFeed briefly went with a millennial-friendly \u201cYes, this is really happening\u201d with a live video of the inauguration.

Either way, there is a touch of something selfless in the act. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of a more lasting memorial to someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life than to be constantly contributing to research.\u00e2\u0080\u009dNot surprisingly, given his admiration, Mr. Shults has agreed to donate his body to the Center so he can help further scientific knowledge after he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone. While he admitted that being around death\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smell triggered deep, primal warnings, his experience has helped him achieve a deeper understanding about his mortality, and given him peace of mind about where he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spend eternity.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI filled out my paperwork,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filed. I have my donor card. That is where my body will be after I die; in a field, on a ranch, at Texas State University.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}

I\u2019m talking about the battle between incivility and dignity.He triumphs when opponents trade righteous anger for crude tantrums. When they lose sight of the line between protest and catcalls.\u201cBarron will be this country\u2019s first home-school shooter,\u201d the writer, Katie Rich, tweeted. I cringe at repeating it. But there\u2019s no other way to take proper note of its ugliness.There\u2019s so much substantive ground on which to confront Trump. There are acres upon acres. Why swerve into the gutter? Why help him dismiss his detractors as people in thrall to the theater of their outrage and no better than he is?And why risk that disaffected Americans, tuning in only occasionally, hear one big mash of insults and insulters, and tune out, when there\u2019s a contest \u2014 over what this country stands for, over where it will go \u2014 that couldn\u2019t be more serious.But the treatment of presidential progeny isn\u2019t the real story here. And that\u2019s a complicated saga anyway, because so many presidents and candidates try to have things both ways, putting family on display when it suits them and then declaring them off limits when it doesn\u2019t.The larger, more pressing issues are how low we\u2019re prepared to sink in our partisan back-and-forth and what\u2019s accomplished by descending to Trump\u2019s subterranean level. His behavior has been grotesque, and it\u2019s human nature to want to repay him in kind. It feels good. It sometimes even feels right.If Trump\u2019s presidency mirrors its dangerous prelude, one of the fundamental challenges will be to respond to him, his abettors and his agenda in the most tactically prudent way and not just the most emotionally satisfying one. To rant less and organize more. To resist taunts and stick with facts. To answer invective with intelligence.And to show, in the process, that there are two very different sets of values here, manifest in two very distinct modes of discourse. If that doesn\u2019t happen, Trump may be victorious in more than setting newly coarse terms for our political debate. He may indeed win on many fronts, over many years.Advertisement"}

Trump \u2014 performed show-tunes-with-a-message on Friday afternoon at Town Hall in Manhattan to raise money for social justice organizations. With Mr. Trump celebrating the start of his presidency, the singers celebrated art as a comfort, an inspiration and a rallying cry for the coming months and years.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something to lift people\u2019s spirits,\u201d he said, \u201cand to help these charities that are probably going to be hard hit.\u201dMusicians organized protest concerts in several cities, including an \u201cAnti-Inaugural Ball\u201d in Los Angeles that featured Rage Against the Machine. But others sought to honor Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration: The Newseum, a Washington museum dedicated to promoting and defending the First Amendment, organized a day of events billed as a \u201ccelebration experience\u201d \u2014 even though Mr. Trump has had a rocky relationship with the news media.So, how creative were artists in reckoning with the start of the Trump era? Here is a sampling of Inauguration Day in culture.Glen Roven is no stranger to presidential inaugurations. He was the conductor of the opening ceremonies for Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, gathering performers like Barbra Streisand, Fleetwood Mac and, yes, the Rockettes. Earlier this year, he thought he might get the call for Hillary Clinton\u2019s, too.When Mrs. Clinton lost, Mr. Roven decided to draw on her candidacy to create a counterpoint to the actual inauguration. At National Sawdust in Brooklyn on Friday, Mr. Roven presented the premiere of \u201cThe Hillary Speeches,\u201d a 25-minute video recital that featured two of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches set to music. The video includes a diverse group of artists \u2014 including the opera singers Isabel Leonard, Nathan Gunn and Lawrence Brownlee, the actress Annie Potts and Chilina Kennedy (currently starring in \u201cBeautiful\u201d on Broadway) \u2014 singing excerpts from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s initial declaration of candidacy and recent concession speech. The video was also livestreamed.The music largely conveyed optimism and empowerment instead of failure. \u201cHillary\u2019s words are beautiful \u2014 they should live on in music,\u201d Mr. Roven said before the event, which drew Ms. Potts, Ms. Kennedy and the soprano Camille Zamora, among others.A funereal feeling hung in the crisp mountain air in Park City, Utah, as attendees at the ardently liberal Sundance Film Festival trudged into the 1,300-seat Eccles Theater for Friday\u2019s first big screening. At least they would be in a darkened movie theater when Mr. Trump took the oath of office.Two hours later, many of the same people came tumbling out of the Eccles with grins on their faces, having just received an unlikely message of optimism \u2014 from none other than Al Gore, a guy who knows a thing or two about losing elections.\u201cAn Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,\u201d about the former vice president\u2019s ongoing crusade focused on climate change, would not seem like much of a picker-upper. But the documentary has surprisingly upbeat messages both personal (when you are dealt a blow, regroup and keep going) and political (Mr. Trump will have a difficult time wreaking environmental havoc because of the economic momentum behind clean energy).\u201cNobody will be able to stop the sustainability revolution,\u201d Mr. Gore, wearing a blue sweater, said afterward from the stage, as the crowd hooted. \u201cWe are going to win this.\u201dBROOKS BARNESMr. Trump campaigned on threats to limit First Amendment protections for the news media while also routinely criticizing the press, singling out and insulting journalists, and rarely holding news conferences. The Newseum shrugged that off, though, as it held a $500-a-head party, a more expensive affair than the similar events it had held during the past two inaugurations.\u201cLike now, and then, it\u2019s not about the person,\u201d Jeffrey Herbst, president of the Newseum, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s about celebrating something all too rare in the world, which is the peaceful transfer of power.\u201dThe sold-out event included big-screen viewing of the inauguration ceremony and parade, access to the full museum and panels throughout the day \u2014 including two Trump-specific discussions, both called \u201cAn Insider\u2019s View of the Trump Administration.\u201dSOPAN DEB\u201cBad presidents make for great music,\u201d the veteran rabble-rousing guitarist Tom Morello has said. Fortunately for Mr. Morello\u2019s career, then, he is never quite satisfied with those in power.In an interview before the concert, Mr. Morello listed five \u201cconcrete suggestions\u201d for action under President Trump: Show up, join up (\u201ca union, a band\u201d), stand up (\u201cfor those who are targets of bigotry\u201d), read up (\u201cdon\u2019t just pick a news channel that confirms your prejudices\u201d) and rise up.\u201cNow is not the time to agonize,\u201d he added. \u201cNow is the time to organize.\u201dJOE COSCARELLIThe call by artists and critics for an \u201cArt Strike\u201d on Inauguration Day led to so many galleries being closed in Los Angeles that one of the city\u2019s busiest art destinations, the block of La Cienega Boulevard south of Venice Boulevard, looked like a ghost town late Friday morning.The parking lot of Blum & Poe, the city\u2019s only homegrown mega-gallery, was empty. Across the street, most gallery lights were off. And the facade of the Walter Maciel Gallery was covered with a large silver banner reading \u201cNOT OUR PRESIDENT.\u201dIn all, 11 of the 15 galleries on the block were closed, including Luis de Jesus, Anat Egbi, Cherry and Martin, Edward Cella Art+Architecture, Samuel Freeman, Paul Kopeikin and Zevitas Marcus.About two miles north, from his home office near La Cienega, the contrarian private collector-dealer Stefan Simchowitz vowed to continue business \u201cper usual,\u201d which often involves heavy Instagram and Facebook use to promote artists. He also used Facebook this week to criticize the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of galleries planning to close.\u201cWe sell art to the wealthy shareholder and leisure classes of the world, and this protest just sounds like a penny in an empty cup to me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cContribute your profits from the day to financing local and state elections with representatives who can run the platform you believe in.\u201dJORI FINKELAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Some, the Affordable Care Act Is a Lifesaver. For Others, a Burden.", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported byI have three separate diagnosed mental disorders, including chronic depression, severe anxiety/panic disorder and PTSD that make me ineligible for health insurance. It\u2019s expensive to treat; I take a combination of five medications and see two doctors a month. It used to cost nearly a thousand dollars every month out of pocket for treatment uninsured. Without treatment, my condition is life-threatening and I\u2019ve almost died on a couple of occasions.Because of the A.C.A., I can treat my conditions for a fraction of the cost, live a healthy productive life and work a job that I love that enables me to have my own apartment, car, savings even. I remember my friend and I reading what would now be covered, under the A.C.A, out loud to each other and laughing and crying like our team had just won the Super Bowl.I\u2019m absolutely terrified of what will happen if I lose all of this. I don\u2019t want to go back down that long dark tunnel again. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll survive it. The A.C.A is flawed yes, but instead of yanking it from the people who desperately need it, like me, why can\u2019t it stay in place while we fix it?It would significantly improve my life: lower premiums, more quality care, and more choices. We paid $486 per month last year for my daughter and me, plus the $4000 for my son\u2019s birth. We later switched to my husband\u2019s employer plan and were able to pay $552 for all three of us. I didn\u2019t even consider signing up with HealthCare.gov again because it would have easily been $700 for all three of us, with a deductible that would have bankrupted us if I had another health issue that required intervention.Before my premiums started paying for everyone else\u2019s subsidies, we could afford reasonable health care plans at a reasonable rate. Obamacare has just increased the cost and not improved the lives of those who are in the middle class.I live in a very rural part of Utah, in one of the poorer counties in the state. There are very few job opportunities here, unless you work at the coal mine or the prison. My sister and I have started a small online business. We eke out a living on it, but wouldn\u2019t be able to afford insurance without the subsidies.If the A.C.A is repealed, I will not have insurance and would take the risk. If something big happened I would have to declare bankruptcy or find a job in another state that provided insurance. The A.C.A allows people to leave the corporate world and become small business owners!It would help me. I am 62 years old and I had purchased insurance \u2014 the Silver Plan through the marketplace \u2014 for 2016 and it was horrible. I live in South Carolina, and the only company offering insurance for 2017 is Blue Cross Blue Shield. I had purchased the insurance, then I found out that they will not cover me at all if I leave the state. I spend 3 to 5 months a year up north. This insurance is useless to me. My premiums were $875 a month and I had to spend $7300 before it even kicked in. I got a refund for my first month\u2019s premium and now for the first time in my life I have no insurance. It is cheaper for me to pay the fine.My job offers health insurance but to cover my entire family it would be $250 deducted out of every check as well as a $3,000 deductible I would need to meet before my insurance plan kicked in. I have four kids, one of who is in college, and there was just no way I could afford that.The Affordable Care Act allowed my children to be insured with a premium that I could afford! If I didn\u2019t have this my family would have gone uninsured or I would have had to decide between food or a doctor visit. Thank goodness it hasn\u2019t come to that!I would not be able to work for my amazing employer, which is the best job I have ever had in my whole life, who does not offer insurance because they have fewer than 50 full-time employees. It is a start-up company in Milwaukee and I am a manager at the company. The A.C.A allows me to work for them and allows them to operate as a business.Although I realize some people\u2019s situations are more life-or-death than mine, I believe an important aspect of the A.C.A is its empowerment of small businesses, and for those who wish to work outside the corporate structure. I would have to find another job where I would not be as happy.Right now, my husband and I chose to go without insurance for the first time in our lives. Why? Because my husband, 64, is self-employed and makes over $65,000 a year and I do not get any benefits elsewhere. We do not qualify for any subsidies. Our quoted premiums from a choice of only three companies doing business in our area were over $2,000 a month and a $7,000-plus deductible. We are both in our 60s and nonsmokers and healthy!! So we decided to wait and see what happens in the next three months rather than pay this astronomical amount! And this is constitutional?It would be terrible for my husband and me. We have no other means to get affordable health care that will cover our pre-existing conditions. My husband is self-employed and therefore has no employer-based health plan, and I am a stay at home parent to our 8-year-old son with autism.Our son receives Medicaid and I am also very concerned about proposed cuts to Medicaid, and the Republican party\u2019s desire to turn it over to the states in block grants. The Republican plan for health care is no plan. Many sick and disabled people will be left out in the cold.My husband and I run our own business of which we are the only employees. Our health insurance options are limited, costly and have an insanely high deductible. We purchased insurance through the A.C.A. because it\u2019s our only choice. In order to get a plan that\u2019s lower than our mortgage payment, we have to accept options where virtually nothing is covered and deductibles are upward of $15,000. This isn\u2019t affordable care.We make enough money that we don\u2019t qualify for any subsidies, but not enough money where spending thousands of dollars a month on health insurance is some insignificant drop in the bucket. But even though I think about all of the money we\u2019d save on a regular basis, going without health insurance was never really an option for my husband or I.We\u2019re both healthy, and in all of the time we\u2019ve been on the insurance plan that we buy on the exchange, we\u2019ve never submitted a claim. The few times we\u2019ve needed minor health care services, we\u2019ve paid in cash. We\u2019ve never come close to hitting our deductible and we get a better rate if we pay in cash. However, we know that one accident or hospital stay without insurance could absolutely devastate us financially. We just can\u2019t take that risk.If I lost my health insurance that I purchased under the A.C.A I would have two options. I could get the \u201cfamily plan\u201d through my husband\u2019s employer, which would cost somewhere between $7,000 and $7,500 annually. Or I could get divorced. This option is financially more affordable, but I can\u2019t believe we are considering such an emotional expense.If we got divorced, I could get MediCal, the low-income option in California for which I am currently ineligible due to our combined income. This issue is on my mind when every morning when I wake up \u2014 I worry about losing my coverage constantly.After I left my start-up job in 2012, I didn\u2019t have health insurance for four years. With a pre-existing diagnosis of anxiety and depression, although both were under control, the premiums available to me were prohibitively high. I was either getting alternative treatments or, after being diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, saw specialists who didn\u2019t accept insurance. So while I worried about what would happen in case of an accident, I was happy not to pay for an insurance policy I felt I didn\u2019t need.When the A.C.A. was introduced I was actually very unhappy and frustrated at having to pay a monthly premium for a service I wasn\u2019t going to use on top of my medical bills. I refused to sign up and decided that the $600-something fine was better than a monthly premium. About a year ago though, my health took a turn and I knew that I would need more testing and doctors\u2019 visits than I had the resources for, so I enrolled.The premium on the plan I chose was steep but the tax credit was generous; the monthly cost was a strain but I have made good use of the services now available to me.Since I got insurance in February, I\u2019ve been diagnosed with several medical conditions, and they are not well-controlled. Even if approval for patients with pre-existing conditions remains mandatory, if the A.C.A is repealed, my premiums will become untenable.My husband and I, both 43, were able to go back to school in midlife. I now have a Ph.D. in gerontology and he is finishing a law degree, and we have been able to obtain affordable insurance thanks to the A.C.A. I am looking for an academic teaching position and likely to be unemployed until August even if my job search is successful. We are counting on the A.C.A. to get us through 2017.I\u2019m a chest surgeon and I don\u2019t have Obamacare, but it\u2019s critical for my patients. I treat mostly lung and esophageal cancer. Repealing Obamacare without a replacement would be a disaster for my patients. You can\u2019t get your cancer treated in the E.R.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article erroneously attributed some statements to Masha Chepovetsky. Another reader, who was not included in the final article, submitted the following statement, not Ms. Chepovetsky: \u201cI probably would lose my health insurance. Or go back to the awful insurance I had before. The only type of insurance I could afford before the Affordable Care Act had a $10,000 deductible and cost about $350 per month. Now I have a plan with a $750 deductible and it covers checkups right away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mar-a-Lago, the Future Winter White House and Home of the Calmer Trump", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported byWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 When President-elect Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend, he did it in Gatsby-like opulence, joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone, the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach.President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford, Tex. His father had a compound in Kennebunkport, Me. President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii, staying at a private home.But Mr. Trump\u2019s 118-room private club in Florida, where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City, is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th president\u2019s winter White House. And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post, the cereal heiress and the property\u2019s original owner, who left Mar-a-Lago to the federal government when she died in 1973, hoping it would serve as a home for presidents.But the government had no interest in her plan, and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $10 million, turning it into a club where membership costs six figures.Mr. Trump\u2019s arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite, and he opened up Mar-a-Lago\u2019s membership to Jews and African-Americans, who had been excluded from other members-only establishments. He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple.Since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November, Mar-a-Lago has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club: the chance to rub shoulders with the next president.\u201cIt\u2019s like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long,\u201d said Jeff Greene, a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010, who is a Mar-a-Lago member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter.Instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Trump has been seated at an ornately designed couch, upholstered in pale fabric laced with gold, beneath a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, a scene resembling a mansion in \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d or \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d two of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite movies.At night, the couches are moved out and tables are added to accommodate the evening cocktail crowd, among whom Mr. Trump moves from one table to the next, the most powerful greeter in the world.At the annual New Year\u2019s Eve party on Saturday night, a gold-laced white menu included \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s wedge salad,\u201d a wild mushroom and Swiss chard ravioli and a \u201cbreakfast buffet.\u201d Those in attendance drifted in under a yellow-and-white striped awning, the men dressed in tuxedos, the women in ball gowns, many with their hair swept high.Guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party. Mr. Trump later delivered remarks, according to a guest, who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years.Howie Carr, a conservative radio host who was supportive of Mr. Trump, roamed the crowd, with Mr. Carr posting on Twitter that his daughter asked Mr. Trump if she could be an intern in the White House. Mr. Trump\u2019s two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., posed for photographs. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d were also there.Like most aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s business interests, the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than $500. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides rejected the questions.Mr. Trump returned to New York on Sunday night. But the club will remain an escape for him. His contentious Twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at Mar-a-Lago compared with when he is isolated inside Trump Tower. Mr. Trump\u2019s combative public persona \u2014 often on display during his campaign \u2014 mostly dissolves behind the carved-stone walls of his castle.\u201cMar-a-Lago is an environment he can control,\u201d said the historian Douglas Brinkley, who last week attended a Mar-a-Lago lunch with a longtime club member, Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media. \u201cI watched him hold court \u2014 he was so comfortable in his own skin, and so relaxed.\u201dMr. Ruddy has hosted Mr. Carr and Laura Ingraham, another conservative radio host who supported Mr. Trump, at the club and has introduced Mr. Trump to a range of news media figures, politicians and donors. He described the president-elect as \u201cseeking the pre-election Donald Trump: totally at ease, very positive, very gregarious.\u201dMr. Trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club.Over the Thanksgiving holiday, he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint Rudolph W. Giuliani or Mitt Romney as his secretary of state (he ended up picking neither).Isaac Perlmutter, the reclusive head of Marvel Entertainment, is a Mar-a-Lago member who helped Mr. Trump put that meeting together. Mr. Trump has also held sit-downs with Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a club member, and hosted prominent figures like Carlos Slim, the billionaire who is Mexico\u2019s richest man.Mr. Trump; his wife, Melania; and their 10-year-old son, Barron, inhabit a residential area of the club. His adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property. Mr. Trump frequently dines on the patio, a central point of action, where at night a singer plays with a small band, sometimes belting out requests from Mr. Trump and other guests. (\u201cMy Way,\u201d a song popularized by Frank Sinatra, was one recent choice.) A violinist sometimes moves among tables, plucking tunes like the theme from \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201dMr. Trump has given the cadre of White House reporters who now cover him some access to the club, but grudgingly so \u2014 he once again eluded the reporters covering him on Saturday, slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in Jupiter.And outside the confines of Mar-a-Lago, old grievances flare up. On the golf course, Mr. Trump spotted Harry Hurt, a biographer who wrote critically of Mr. Trump years ago, preparing to play a round with David H. Koch, a billionaire conservative donor. Mr. Trump ordered club officials to remove Mr. Hurt from the property, according to a Facebook post by Mr. Hurt.Over the years, Mr. Trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with Palm Beach officials. He has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over Mar-a-Lago, and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds.With its owner\u2019s coming new job, the club has had some changes. Guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance. Secret Service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property, at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds.Robin Bernstein, a club member for nearly 25 years, said that some club members might express frustration, but that most thought it was important \u201cthat we keep Donald and his family safe.\u201d Attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the president-elect around, and expect it will continue.\u201cThe loser in this game is Camp David,\u201d said Mr. Brinkley, referring to the longtime presidential retreat in Maryland. \u201cOnce you\u2019re at Mar-a-Lago, and it\u2019s so opulent and resort-friendly, the idea of suddenly inserting yourself into Camp David\u2019s Maryland mountains environment seems unlikely.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham attended President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago. While Ms. Ingraham was previously a guest at the club, she did not attend the party.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018We\u2019ll Grow Again\u2019: Bangladesh Cafe Attacked by Terrorists Reopens", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 It was nothing special \u2014 just a cafe in a shopping mall supermarket \u2014 but when an elegant matron named Aisha Sattar walked into the newly reopened Holey Artisan Bakery on Wednesday, a sweet, reminiscent look came over her face, as if she weren\u2019t sure it was all real.Rocky, one of the waiters, caught his breath when he saw her and trailed off in the middle of a sentence: She was Auntie Nini, one of the regulars. The whole day had been like this. A few customers, an owner said, walked in, stepped behind the counter and wordlessly hugged the staff. One woman burst into tears and bought every last pastry and yogurt carton still on sale.Six months have passed since anyone thought of the Holey Artisan Bakery with anything but horror.Diners and waiters and cooks and busboys scattered throughout the building. The gunmen calmly sorted them, explaining that their intention was to kill only foreigners and non-Muslims. They killed the hostages one by one, using guns and machetes, and used the victims\u2019 phones to publish images of the bodies on social media.By the time the ordeal ended, 10 hours later, 22 people, including two police officers, were dead, the restaurant spattered with blood and shattered glass.For months, Dhaka\u2019s diplomatic quarter was a spooked place. Restaurants were empty night after night. Foreigners no longer left the safety of their compounds. Young Bangladeshis found themselves wondering who they could trust: Several of the terrorists came from wealthy, cosmopolitan families, not so different from the young elites who died in the siege.In an effort to break this trance, the restaurant\u2019s owners decided to reopen the Holey, known for its flour-dusted baguettes and homemade pasta. One of the owners, Ali Arsalan, said he was inspired in part by the staff: When he paid them two months\u2019 salary and suggested they return to their villages to recover from the trauma, they said they would prefer to go back to work.So when a friend offered him a space in his new supermarket, Mr. Arsalan said, he and his business partner said yes \u201cpretty much within five minutes.\u201d\u201cWhat else is there to do except move on?\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cNo one is going to pay us to sit around and feel bad about what happened.\u201dMany were thrilled by the decision. \u201cPast terror, past grief, past agony,\u201d exulted Syeda Zareen Rafa, 17, on Facebook.She has read in the newspapers about young men who have disappeared, perhaps to join militant groups, and she said she worried in the back of her mind that another big attack might happen. But for the moment, she is, as she put it, \u201cecstatic\u201d that the restaurant is back.\u201cIt felt like a kind of victory or something,\u201d she said.Still, it was painful remembering. Ms. Sattar \u2014 Auntie Nini \u2014 was close friends with Claudia D\u2019Antona, an Italian garment executive killed in the attack. Mr. Arsalan\u2019s 20-year-old nephew, Faraaz Hossain, was one of the victims. Rocky the waiter \u2014 whose full name is Rakib Ahmed \u2014 had, by the luck of the draw, worked the early shift on the day of the siege. For three or four months afterward, he said, he could not sleep.The new space is different from the two-story lakeside home where the restaurant stood until July 1: It is much smaller, inside a mall, and ringed with security. He said he was not under the illusion that the new restaurant would be like the old one.\u201cI can\u2019t explain in words how that place felt,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople would bring their children, their dogs, and they would spend all day there. There won\u2019t be a place like that again, because the grounds are now being used for something else, and because there is a fear in people now.\u201dHe was heartened, though, by the sight of a dozen foreigners who planted themselves at tables over the course of the day; he had not expected them to dare.\u201cWe\u2019ll grow again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll show people Holey\u2019s back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Florida Man Strangled Wife, Then Impersonated Her on Facebook, Police Say", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byA Florida man has been charged with murder after strangling his wife during an argument and then posting messages on her Facebook page under her name to try to fool her friends and family about her absence, the police said.The man, George J. McShane Jr., was trying to \u201cconvince her friends and family she was still alive,\u201d according to the Orlando Police Department.Mr. McShane, 42, who a police report said worked at a resort, was arrested on Jan. 11 and charged with second-degree murder and battery by strangulation in the death of Kristen McShane, 30, the police said.For several days this month, Ms. McShane\u2019s Facebook page was updated with cheerful photographs documenting her life in Florida: a portrait of her smiling in front of an easel, paint brush in hand; and another of her enjoying an outing with friends.On Jan. 7, a Facebook message informed friends and relatives why she had not been in touch: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I dropped my phone in the toilet. I am such an idiot. Message me here, til I can get it fixed.\u201dFriends replied with advice (\u201cPut it in rice\u201d) or with offers to lend her a phone.This week, the police in Orlando, where the McShanes lived, revealed that the author of some of those messages was not Ms. McShane, who was 30, but her husband.Mr. McShane posted the Facebook message about her phone so that others would not become alarmed because she \u201cwas not returning their phone calls or text messages,\u201d the police said.Officers were called to the house on Jan. 10 by a relative of the couple who had been concerned about them, according to a police affidavit. They found Mr. McShane sitting in his car in the garage with the engine running. Then they found Ms. McShane\u2019s body in a bedroom.The authorities said Mr. McShane told them that he had \u201clost his temper and jumped on Kristen, using his two hands to choke her until he realized she was dead.\u201d The reason for the argument was not available on Friday.Robert Larr, a public defender assigned to Mr. McShane, declined to comment on the case on Friday.The Florida murder case is the latest example of someone assuming the social media identity of another person to deflect suspicion from family and friends after a crime.In the Orlando case, Ms. McShane\u2019s Facebook page was updated on Jan. 7 with a photograph showing her next to a man at a social event.\u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d someone wrote.\u201cThat\u2019s my new guy,\u201d came the reply in the comments section under Ms. McShane\u2019s name. Another post the same day described her dropping her phone in the toilet.Both posts appeared after 3:30 a.m. that day \u2014 the time that Mr. McShane told the police the couple had started to argue, according to the police.Her Facebook profile was updated twice again on Jan. 8 with posts showing a photo of her painting and another image including the sleeping face of a little girl, apparently the couple\u2019s daughter.By Jan. 11, after Mr. McShane\u2019s arrest, there were only condolence messages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Dissident Artist Will Seek Asylum in France", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 He has nailed his scrotum to the cobblestones of Red Square, sewn his lips shut to protest free-speech restrictions and set fire to the doors of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service. Now, Pyotr Pavlensky, Russia\u2019s best-known anti-government performance artist, has fled to France, where he intends to seek political asylum.Russian authorities questioned Mr. Pavlensky and his partner, Oksana Shalygina, last month after an actress at an avant-garde Moscow theater filed a complaint accusing them of sexual assault. The couple deny the allegations, saying that the encounter was a consensual threesome and that the case is politically motivated. Amid the ambiguities \u2014 and at a time when violence against women is a topic of intense debate in the country \u2014 Russia\u2019s cultural opposition is now divided over a figure once seen as a symbol of the resistance to President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia.Mr. Pavlensky and Ms. Shalygina have not been formally charged, but were questioned by the police in Moscow on Dec. 15 and informed that they could face up to 10 years in prison. Told not to leave Moscow while the case was pending, they said they saw what was likely to happen and took their daughters, ages 6 and 8, to France over the weekend after spending a month in Ukraine.\u201cWe\u2019ve become victims of this investigation,\u201d Mr. Pavlensky said in an interview on Monday in a Paris cafe, speaking Russian through an interpreter, and with Ms. Shalygina at his side. \u201cIt\u2019s like a horrible dream that you can\u2019t even imagine.\u201dSoon after, Mr. Pavlensky said, he gave some lectures at Teatr.doc. It was at one of them last September that he met the actress who later filed the assault complaint.Mr. Pavlensky said that on Dec. 4, the actress texted Ms. Shalygina. The couple \u2014 who say they have an open relationship \u2014 invited her to their Moscow apartment that evening. \u201cWe talked about art,\u201d he said. \u201cWe sat and drank coffee. We drank Cognac, but not a lot.\u201d\u201cThere was some form of intimacy,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd then she said she wants to leave. We said, \u2018Fine, no problem.\u2019 We parted as friends.\u201dBoth Mr. Pavlensky, 32, and Ms. Shalygina, 37, said it was the first time the three had had sex together.Yuri A. Lysenko, a lawyer for the actress, said that Mr. Pavlensky had committed a \u201ccrime,\u201d a rape, and that he wanted to portray the police investigation as politically motivated to avoid punishment.Adding to the confusion over the allegations, this week Teatr.doc posted on its Facebook page a video dated Oct. 31 that it said showed Mr. Pavlensky and others beating up a man they said was the actress\u2019s boyfriend, in the theater\u2019s parking lot.Mr. Pavlensky said that the video was \u201cmurky\u201d and that he didn\u2019t recognize himself in it. But he said he had been involved in a physical altercation with the actress\u2019s boyfriend in October, when he and others confronted the man over allegations that he had beaten her. The Interfax News Agency reported that the police told him that a criminal case had been opened about the fight. Mr. Pavlensky said that was not the case.Mr. Lysenko said the fight with the boyfriend and the sexual assault allegations were \u201cnot related.\u201dHe then added: \u201cYou have to ask Mr. Pavlensky if he has seen a psychiatrist recently. What he did is part of his carefully crafted plan to paint his crime in political colors.\u201dIn a Facebook post that she said would be her last word on the matter, Yelena Gremina, the director of Teatr.doc, called the couple\u2019s claims that the actress worked for the security services \u201cslander.\u201dOn Russia\u2019s vibrant social media, artists are divided over the case. \u201cThe hysteria with Pavlensky is an alarming sign that anyone who becomes a significant \u2018fighter against the regime\u2019 is immediately put on a pedestal and declared a saint,\u201d the artist Lena Hades wrote on Facebook.Others came out against Mr. Pavlensky. \u201cAlas, yesterday a national hero and a great performance artist, today \u2014 it\u2019s true \u2014 a criminal, a psychopath and a rapist,\u201d Olga Papernaya, a former art director at a Moscow film club, wrote on Facebook, suggesting that she was friends with the actress.\u201cFor now, the authorities are winning,\u201d Mr. Pavlensky said. The press is weak, he added, and \u201cthe so-called opposition\u201d divided, even over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. \u201cBut each move is not the last,\u201d he said of the country\u2019s situation. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear who will have the last word in this conflict.\u201dSophia Kishkovsky and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

She was 65.Suzzy Roche said in a statement that the cause was breast cancer. She did not say where her sister died.Margaret Roche was born on Oct. 26, 1951, and grew up in Park Ridge, N.J. She and her two younger sisters sang in Roman Catholic church choirs, and she started writing songs after getting a guitar for her birthday in 1964. She and Terre formed a duo, performing at first for Democratic Party fund-raisers in New Jersey.Mr. Simon signed them to a production company he had formed for young musicians, and he was also among the producers of Maggie and Terre Roche\u2019s album \u201cSeductive Reasoning,\u201d released by Columbia in 1975.Suzzy Roche joined her sisters in 1976 and, as a trio, the Roches became a local sensation at clubs in Greenwich Village.

Her mother had been trafficked to Singapore as a domestic worker in 1996 and has worked for a wealthy woman in Hong Kong for the last 19 years. Xyza \u00e2\u0080\u0094 only 8 at the time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was left to care for her younger siblings in their rural village in the Philippines. Xyza followed her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s path and became a domestic worker in the same Hong Kong household for seven\u00c2\u00a0years.Her own story opened the door to the shelter. Once inside, she forged deep connections with the women who lived there. She had been one of them. She saw them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMigrant workers are invisible people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Xyza said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are like air. People need us but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see us. We exist to please them, to serve them, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really see us as part of the society. We have voices \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that no one is listening.\u00e2\u0080\u009dXyza has dedicated the last three years to documenting the plight of illegally trafficked workers in Hong Kong and New York, making sure their stories are told and their voices are heard. Last year, she turned her attention to Singapore, where her mother first worked.There is one question that she is always asked by the women she photographs: How did you feel about your mother\u00c2\u00a0leaving you to be a migrant worker and growing up without her? While she collects their stories, Xyza shares her own journey:Her mother, Georgia, who only has a\u00c2\u00a0sixth-grade education, was the village washer woman. One day, a recruiter came to town promising a lucrative job in Singapore that could lift the family out of poverty. Her mother left Xyza to care for two younger siblings while their father, Villamor, worked construction jobs and was home only on weekends.Georgia was illegally trafficked into Singapore on a tourist visa, but there was no job waiting. She was held in a small room with 10 other Filipino women and not allowed to leave. After four days, an employer picked her out of the group and brought her home. She said she was treated poorly, to the point that she was only allowed to go out 3 times in the first two years. Georgia fled Singapore and found employment in Hong Kong working for an affluent\u00c2\u00a0woman who was kind to her.Back home, Xyza essentially grew up without a mother, since Georgia only visited for two weeks every other year. All she had of her mother\u00c2\u00a0were photographs she sent home depicting what seemed like an extravagant lifestyle. Xyza did not know her mother well and \u00e2\u0080\u009calways had the feeling she left me for money and good food and was having a good time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, while Xyza took care of her siblings.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI always tell migrant workers that it is really important to tell their children the real situation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Xyza said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo tell them that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not here having a great time, but that you are working for their future.\u00e2\u0080\u009dXyza was 19 when she decided to go to Singapore, too, so she could help her younger siblings get an education. Her mother urged her not to go because of her own bitter experiences there and instead asked her to join her as a domestic worker in Hong Kong, where they worked side by side for the next seven years.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt took us four years to mend the relationship and for me realize that she never did anything for herself because she was saving money to send to me and my siblings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Xyza said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI found out it was hard to be a migrant worker.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLast year, she began a hard look at Singapore, where her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey as a domestic worker started.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSingapore is really beautiful physically and economically successful, but underneath that are these migrant workers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt costs a lot of money for migrant workers to go there and then they are tied to these contracts and cannot find any other employment.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere, she discovered that the wearying toll of illegal trafficking, sexual and physical abuse, and unscrupulous employment agency practices leads\u00c2\u00a0many migrant workers to run away.After documenting\u00c2\u00a0the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shelter, Xyza broadened her coverage by photographing\u00c2\u00a0Southeast Asian men who toiled as migrant laborers in the booming construction industry. Their stories echoed Xyza\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiences as a migrant construction worker in Saudi Arabia 25 years ago. When her father\u2019s employer refused to let him leave after his two-year contract ended, he fled and returned to the Philippines.Xyza zeroed in on Sohag Faslul Haque, a Bangladeshi man who was injured at work and was trying to navigate the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complicated workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation system. She also produced another photo essay on three Chinese workers who had been injured while working in Singapore but banded together to help each other through their ordeal. This work was supported by the Pulitzer Center on\u00c2\u00a0Crisis Reporting.All these stories remain important to her, not just to tell\u00c2\u00a0the world of the ordeals faced by the migrant workers, but to show that one-time migrants like her can go on to make a difference.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt makes them hopeful that they can be somebody else or their children can be somebody else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said."}

She\u2019s been up for an hour already, checking emails and sending a quick note to her husband, who is looking after their two boys, but mostly, she admits, blow-drying her hair. This is her first observation of the day: Davos Woman gets less sleep than Davos Man because of her hair.Ms. Bohnet studies gender inequality. A behavioral economist at the Harvard Kennedy School, she is one of about 600 female participants at this year\u2019s World Economic Forum. There are about 2,400 men \u2014 that\u2019s 80 percent of all participants. The gender imbalance here very much reflects the dearth of female leaders in the real world. As one female American executive put it: \u201cWho do they think they are? The Senate?\u201dI was curious: What is it like to be Davos Woman for a day?We step into the Davos dawn and start walking down the icy sidewalk. Ms. Bohnet\u2019s first appointment is a breakfast panel on how to increase gender diversity in companies. She recently wrote a book on the subject and will be one of the speakers.Ms. Bohnet arrived the day before and caught the end of the conference\u2019s annual women\u2019s reception. This is where female newcomers to Davos receive advice from the regulars \u2014 a sort of survivors\u2019 guide for the 20 percent. Bring sturdy shoes. Expect long security lines. Don\u2019t be intimidated, but if you are, don\u2019t show it.Judging from the stories here, Davos Man is still coming to terms with the presence of Davos Woman. High-powered women getting mistaken for the \u201cplus one.\u201d The confusion of men when they meet with female executives.Ms. Bohnet knows the drill. This is her fourth year as Davos Woman. She is wearing sturdy shoes and carries her high heels in a spare bag.There are quite a few men in the line at the Morosani Schweizerhof hotel. \u201cThat\u2019s encouraging,\u201d Ms. Bohnet whispers.Have they all gotten up this early to learn about gender equality? We quickly discover that there is a finance breakfast scheduled for the same time.Still, of the roughly 200 people who have come for the gender discussion, perhaps a third are men. And half of the speakers are women. This is good, in my thinking.The first time I came to Davos, in 2002, it was pretty standard to have a panel with four middle-aged men. A \u201cmanel,\u201d as women here call it.The setup for the rare female speaker was often awkward. Microphones that interfered with earrings. Barstool-like chairs that made legs dangle, skirts ride up and high heels fall off.Not today.Over the next hour and a half, it almost seems as if the corporate world could be on the cusp of a gender revolution. Unilever and Mercer are using a gender-neutral assessment test to hire employees. SAP is using a big data tool to evaluate employees and job ads that avoid adjectives like \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201ccompetitive\u201d that have been shown to put off women. The number of female managers has risen at all three companies.This is all in Ms. Bohnet\u2019s book, \u201cWhat Works,\u201d a blueprint for how to de-bias organizations rather than human beings. We are all biased, she explains. \u201cEven if you have the best intentions, it\u2019s hard to overcome your unconscious biases.\u201dHer favorite example is about the top orchestras in the United States, which began having auditions behind curtains in the 1970s. At the time only 5 percent of their musicians were women. Orchestra directors were confident that they did not need the curtain and that they had been choosing candidates purely on sound.But with the curtain, the proportion of female musicians in American orchestras started to rise. It\u2019s nearly 40 percent today.It\u2019s not even lunchtime and I\u2019m beat. Ms. Bohnet pops an acetaminophen. Nine out of 10 panels have female speakers \u2014 so the 20 percent are in hot demand.We\u2019re walking down the Promenade, Davos\u2019s main street, passing Russia House (usually a coffee shop); the HSBC cafe (a shoe shop the rest of the year); the Salesforce Lounge (a bookstore); and the Facebook building, a two-story pop-up that will be dismantled after the conference.Ms. Bohnet is heading into a McKinsey studio, normally an office building, for an interview about her book.McKinsey has done extensive research to prove that gender diversity is good for business. It recently piloted an algorithm built to recruit employees without bias. The formula picked more women.\u201cWow,\u201d Ms. Bohnet says. \u201cAfter a morning like this, you really think something is happening.\u201dBack in reality, we are at an event on artificial intelligence run by two male presenters. There are 12 men in the audience and four women.When they open up the session for questions, two women in the back row raise their hands first, followed by a man in the front row.\u201cUm, shall we start with the front row?\u201d the speaker says, his eyes darting up and down.\u201cNo, let\u2019s start with a lady,\u201d the man in the front row quickly says. It\u2019s awkward.A woman asks about the impact of artificial intelligence on education and children. The man asks about the impact of the technology on the bottom line of his business.\u201cThat was cringy,\u201d Ms. Bohnet says later. \u201cI mean, it was good to call him out on wanting to pick the guy. But then the whole \u2018ladies first\u2019 thing.\u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t seem natural.\u201dWhat would she have done?\u201cUse a generic description: \u2018Let\u2019s start with the person in the blue scarf,\u2019 something like that,\u201d she offers.On our way out, we meet Sophia. She has beautiful soft features, clear skin, lightly made-up eyes and a winning smile.Sophia is an android, basically a hot female robot. Ms. Bohnet and I stop to take a closer look. \u201cHi,\u201d I say. Sophia nods and her smile deepens. She is pretty good at animating human expressions but is only beginning to learn about emotions, explains her maker, a lanky young man.It suddenly occurs to me that every android I\u2019ve ever seen is female. I ask Bob Goodson, the founder of Quid and an artificial intelligence specialist, whether he has ever come across any hot male androids made by women.\u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now that you mention it, yeah, all the androids I\u2019ve ever seen are females made by men.\u201dIt\u2019s a little creepy, I think. What does it mean for the next technological revolution if most smart machines are made by men? I remember something that was said in a session earlier: \u201cAlgorithms are only as unbiased as those who program them.\u201dBias is a big theme today. At a session that Ms. Bohnet moderates on forecasting bias, two professors \u2014 one male, one female \u2014 present together. He presents first; she doesn\u2019t interrupt him once. When she speaks, he interrupts her six times \u2014 once, as he puts it, to clarify, before repeating what she said just 30 seconds earlier.I\u2019m beginning to understand what women here mean when they tell me they\u2019re \u201cin the room but not in the conversation.\u201dNext on the schedule: a Harvard reception at the Steigenberger Grand Hotel Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, the poshest hotel in town. At the cloakroom we are told that bags with shoes now cost 5 Swiss francs to check. Call it a tax on women.I stop at the bathroom to freshen up. There is a long line outside the men\u2019s room and the staff is getting annoyed because men keep wandering into the kitchen by mistake. The women\u2019s bathroom is quiet \u2014 one advantage of being among the 20 percent.The World Economic Forum actually has a female quota of sorts. Big companies are allowed to bring five people as long as one of them is a woman. Otherwise, the maximum is four.Whether the guys notice the imbalance is another question. \u201cWhen men see a room full of people and 20 percent are women, they see 50 percent,\u201d says Laura Liswood, secretary general of the Council of Women World Leaders, citing social science research.The guys think we\u2019re already there. Is 20 percent the new glass ceiling?Not among the millennials, it seems. The Global Shapers, the under-30 cohort of leaders in Davos, have a 50-50 gender split. Young women like Gianina Caviezel, 29, the founder of Student Impact, a management consultancy, tell me that gender equality is not a major focus for them, at least in the West. They care about climate change and youth unemployment and refugees. I remember feeling the same way \u2014 until I had children.I catch up with Ms. Bohnet after dinner. It\u2019s 11:20 p.m., early by Davos standards. But it\u2019s been a long day. We have changed shoes 10 times and gone through security eight times. We have paid the woman\u2019s tax, suffered through a couple of manels and met Sophia. Onward.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Art Market Mines Gold on Instagram", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The singularity and relatively high cost of most fine art have, so far, made it resistant to sales on the internet. There aren\u2019t many collectors who seem willing to spend millions of dollars online. But Instagram has quietly become a commercial game changer for the art market, a force in influencing auction and gallery transactions, especially for younger buyers.\u201cI often get contacted by collectors about specific objects I\u2019ve shown on Instagram, and then that turns into a different conversation,\u201d said Matt Carey-Williams, the London-based deputy chairman for Europe and Asia at the Phillips auction house.Mr. Gorvy\u2019s Instagram account is all the more influential for having no corporate branding and a strong individuality.\u201cIt allows you to get into the hearts and minds of important collectors,\u201d Mr. Gorvy said. \u201cPeople think they know you, and that pulls down barriers. People saw that I had a daughter, a dog and a home. I became less of a guy that sells paintings.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a two-way thing,\u201d said Stefan Ratibor, the director of Gagosian\u2019s London galleries. \u201cWe put out the information and we value the feedback. This has led to conversations that have led to sales, but they can\u2019t be quantified.\u201d\u201cInstagram made it more special,\u201d Mr. Ratibor said. \u201cPeople think they are in on a secret. That\u2019s the magic of the medium.\u201d\u201cYoung people of our age are growing up on social media. They\u2019re glued to their phones,\u201d Mr. Burt said. \u201cInstagram creates a safe place to enjoy art. They feel part of the gallery before they walk in.\u201dAlthough half of the show was reserved via Instagram before it opened, sales at Unit London continue to be confirmed in person, in the way that gallerists have been closing sales for hundreds of years.But there is one, perhaps slightly unlikely, area of the market in which Instagram has proved a true sales platform: affordable collectibles.Mikki Towler, a dealer in antique kitchen items in Norfolk, England, has been active on Instagram for 12 months, drawing 2,427 followers and averaging two sales a day.\u201cI put a piece on Instagram and it\u2019s sold before I get to put it on my website,\u201d said Ms. Towler, a trader for 26 years. \u201cSome people don\u2019t even ask the price, they just say, \u2018I\u2019ll have it.\u2019\u201d Ms. Towler added that the Instagram-friendliness of her business was helped by having few pieces priced at more than \u00a3200.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of parts in a Rudolf Stingel exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery. There were eight parts, not seven.Advertisement"}

In Manhattan, Fifth Avenue became a river of pink hats, while in downtown Los Angeles, even before the gathering crowd stretched itself out to march, it was more than a quarter mile deep on several streets.They \u201cain\u2019t for grabbing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are for birthing new generations of filthy, vulgar, nasty, proud, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh, you name it, for new generations of nasty women.\u201d\u201cMake sure you introduce yourselves to each other and decide what we\u2019re going to do tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re never turning back!\u201d\u201cThis is not the time for shy people! Shy people, you have two hours to get over it.\u201d\u201cI feel that in the face of this current political climate, it is vital that we all make it our mission to get really, really personal,\u201d she said.\u201cPresident Trump, I did not vote for you,\u201d she continued. \u201cI want to be able to support you. But first I ask that you support me. Support my sister. Support my mother. Support my best friend and all of our girlfriends.\u201dOtherwise, Ms. Johansson said, her own daughter, \u201cmay potentially not have the right to make choices for her body and her future that your daughter Ivanka has been privileged to have.\u201d__________Just after 10 a.m., Mr. Trump and his family headed in the opposite direction of the march in Washington for the National Prayer Service, an inaugural tradition, at the National Cathedral. When he spoke at C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va., in the midafternoon, he told his audience that they were his \u201cNo. 1 stop\u201d on his first full day in office, because they were \u201creally special amazing people.\u201d__________In a speech in Boston, Ms. Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, said fundamental freedoms, like abortion rights and gay marriage, could be at stake under Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court.\u201cWe can whimper, we can whine or we can fight back,\u201d she said, as demonstrators in pink hats waved American flags. \u201cMe, I\u2019m here to fight back.\u201d\u201cWe believe in science,\u201d Ms. Warren said, adding, \u201cwe know that climate change is real.\u201d A police officer patrolling the rally pumped his fists in agreement.\u201cWe also believe that immigration makes this country a stronger country,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cWe will not build a stupid wall and we will not tear millions of families apart.\u201d\u201cYou know, I could do this all day,\u201d she added, to laughs and cheers. \u201cBut we gotta march.\u201dJess Bidgood_____\u201cI\u2019m ready to march again,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, a Democratic representative of Georgia, who chaired the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s. \u201cI\u2019ve come here to say to you: Don\u2019t let anybody, anybody, turn you around.\u201dCiting the demonstrations across the country, Mr. Lewis urged marchers, who flowed onto the street running near the Center for Civil and Human Rights, to \u201cuse this unity to organize\u201d future political efforts.\u201dThe next election, we must get out and vote like we never, ever voted before,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, who was embroiled in a public clash with Mr. Trump recently.Alan Blinder_____\u201cThe crowd was so heavy, we didn\u2019t know which way to go,\u201d said Sabitha Pillai-Friedman, a psychotherapist who traveled to Washington from Philadelphia with her 17-year-old child, Sanji, and a friend, Pallavi Sreedhar. \u201cWe were squeezed, touching.\u201d_____As the sun set downtown, protesters made their way to the White House and assembled in small groups in a park just across from the building\u2019s entrance. There in an area surrounded by temporary gates, people walked single file through one open entrance and one by one laid protest signs across gates set up for inauguration several hundred feet away from the White House.While the temporary gates made walking up to the building impossible, people stood shaking their heads in frustration.Fontella Garraway, a 50-year-old retired Army veteran who drove three and half hours from her home in Rocky Mount, N.C., sat on a bench staring at the White House with a pin that read \u201cgirl power.\u201d\u201cEven looking at the White House, it\u2019s like I hope he\u2019s looking out here at us,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump. \u201cI hope it\u2019s penetrating to him that we mean business and we are serious.\u201dMoments later she lay a handwritten sign that read \u201cLove trumps hate; Hear our voice,\u201d on the a fence facing the White House.\u201dThat\u2019s his inauguration gift,\u201d she said.Yamiche Alcindor_____Ellen Ferreira and her friends felt as if they were fighting for some of the same things they used to. They are mostly retired and many of them are veterans of past protests, including the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\u201cFor our right to choose,\u201d said Piya Jacob, 70, a retired elementary school principal.\u201cFor equality,\u201d said Mary Helsaple, 67, an artist.\u201cFor healing justice,\u201d said Gretchen Vorbeck, 72, who runs a nonprofit that buys grocery gift cards for public schoolteachers.Carol Decker, 70, a retired magazine publisher, jumped in and said, \u201cWe\u2019re mad as hell and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\u201dFernanda SantosJust off 15th street, a block north of the parade\u2019s official end point, a large flatbed float with big \u201cTRUMP\u201d letters arched along the back parked itself in the middle of the street, drawing the ire of the thousands of marchers, who berated the float with chants of \u201cShame!\u201d and \u201cWe are the popular vote!\u201dPolice officers formed a barricade around the float with more than a half-dozen sidecar motorcycles. The six or so men and one woman on the float all took pictures of the protesters.Yet some of those who chanted to chase the float away weren\u2019t surprised at its appearance at their march.\u201cI mean the inauguration was yesterday,\u201d said Chrissy Fiore, 39, of Washington, though she said it was \u201ccrazy that they made it down here and that now they\u2019re getting police escorted out.\u201dOfficers wouldn\u2019t let reporters approach those on the float or those driving it, but a magnet on the side said \u201cTrump Unity Bridge.\u201dAs the float headed east to move away from the parade, Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County, a Trump supporter, was seen walking along the sidewalk, taking in the scene but remaining silent. He did not respond to a reporter\u2019s question about his opinion of the march or protest.Nick Corasaniti_____At the rally in Mr. Trump\u2019s hometown near Trump World Tower, elected officials and celebrities assailed the president. Signs in the crowd mocked his bouffant hair and the size of his hands. The actress Whoopi Goldberg said it would be the first of many protests against the president.\u201cThis is how people ended the war in Vietnam,\u201d Ms. Goldberg told the cheering crowd.Grace Huezo, 20, a student at Hunter College, marched with her twin sister holding a \u201cNasty Woman\u201d sign. She said she was there to defend women\u2019s rights after she was appalled by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about grabbing women.\u201cWe\u2019re here saying, no, people do not have permission to grab women without our permission,\u201d she said.She said she was buoyed by the huge turnout and the camaraderie.\u201cI\u2019m hopeful to see so many people that are not giving up and they\u2019re keeping their spirit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all just going to stick together over the next four years.\u201dEmma G. Fitzsimmons_____The march began in a park at the center of the city with a group singing \u201cYou\u2019ve got a friend.\u201d Marchers blanketed the park nestled between the gold-domed state capitol and city hall, hauling strollers, wearing pink hats and often hugging and kissing.Julie Turkewitz_____Thousands of demonstrators gathered on a drizzly morning clad in rain boots, ponchos and pink knit \u201cpussyhats\u201d to march to the Capitol.\u201cWhat Trump has said is so based on exclusion and winning and being right versus taking care of everyone,\u201d said Hilary James, 27, a musician from Minneapolis. \u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t listen to us, I feel it\u2019s important to not sit back.\u201dChristina Capecchi_____Gloria Cole, 66, had turned the protest into a family affair, traveling here with her wife, her daughter, her daughter\u2019s boyfriend, and her brother and sister-in-law.\u201cI drew a line, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m an old woman \u2014 I\u2019m not that old, I\u2019m 66 \u2014 I have to stand up for equal rights for everyone, for human rights,\u201d Ms. Cole said. \u201cWe\u2019re here, and we\u2019re not going away.\u201dAili Shaw, 14, held a white sign that read, \u201cOur arms are tired from holding these signs since the 1920s.\u201dMs. Shaw had traveled here, by train and car, with friends from her home in Coventry, R.I.\u201cWomen don\u2019t have the rights they should,\u201d she said.Jess Bidgood_____People were also getting creative with the signs they carry. Alan and Alison Lewis drove in from Astoria with their 20-month-old, Grace.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to have a relationship to a woman to stand up for women,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cEquality and justice is enough of a reason to be here.\u201dKatie Rogers_____\u201cI wanted them to know you can be a smart, intelligent black person. You don\u2019t have to sag your pants and follow certain things that became media culture. I wanted them to know that people marched, bled and died for us to be able to vote and be able to go to college and have certain jobs.\u201d\u201cYou can really lose your sense of self if you don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve come from and you don\u2019t have a vision of where you want to go.\u201d_____\u201cOn the evening of election night, after saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to vote and I\u2019m going to get my friends to vote,\u2019 I sat on the sofa bawling trying to figure out what to say to my daughters the next morning because they went to bed certain that Hillary was going to win.\u201d\u201cMarching is my way of putting my money where my mouth is as far as being an active citizen.\u201d\u201cI want my daughters to have agency and have control over their bodies and feel comfortable in the country that they are in so this is my way of saying, \u2018Hey everybody, I agree with all the people who are out here for different reasons and we don\u2019t agree with what is happening right now and we are taking a stand.\u2019\u201d_____\u201cI think it\u2019s good to share the moment with them and help protest Donald Trump because we want to stand up for our rights because a long time ago, lots of women could not vote. Now we can vote and protest people and stuff.\u201d\u201cIf he affects the world in a bad way \u2014 like I have lots of friends from different countries and he could make them all move away \u2026 that makes me mad because all the people from the civil rights movement had a hard time trying to put us together. It\u2019s like a puzzle, all these people came together, piece by piece, and now Donald Trump is coming over and just breaking those puzzle pieces.\u201dAnemona Hartocollis reported from New York and Yamiche Alcindor from Washington.

{"Headline": "With Electricity in Short Supply, 10,000 Protest in Gaza, Defying Hamas", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byJABALIYA, Gaza Strip \u2014 The nearly two million residents of Gaza have been suffering through a cold winter of crippling power cuts, receiving electricity for only three or four hours a day.The popular anger over the cuts erupted on Thursday in a large protest.In a rare display of defiance against the Hamas authorities who control the Palestinian territory, about 10,000 people took to the streets in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip. They marched toward the offices of an electricity company, chanting slogans against Ismail Haniya, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, as well as against the rival Fatah party and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority.\u201cOh, Haniya and Abbas, we are being trampled!\u201d people shouted.Outside the electricity company, protesters hurled stones and burned tires as the Hamas police fired their weapons into the air to disperse the crowd.The protest was one of the largest unauthorized demonstrations in the Gaza Strip in the decade since Hamas took full control of the enclave.The political schism between Gaza and the West Bank has compounded the misery for many residents of the Gaza Strip, who already face tough restrictions from Israel and Egypt on crossing the territory\u2019s borders.Most of the population is too poor to run private generators, given the scarcity and price of fuel, and those that have them use them sparingly.\u201cI look at the sky but even the sky in Gaza has no stars,\u201d said Ahmed Mohareb, 19, a student who was demonstrating. \u201cI cannot read or study in my home, and even when I go out into the street there is no light.\u201dIyad al-Buzom, an Interior Ministry spokesman in Gaza, said in a statement that the police had acted on Thursday to protect the electricity company from \u201cvandalism.\u201dThe Palestinian Center for Human Rights based in Gaza said Mr. Mashoukhi had been arrested by the military police at his home in Rafah, in southern Gaza. The rights group said he had been arrested twice before after making other videos critical of Hamas.A close friend and neighbor of Mr. Mashoukhi said by telephone that the comedian \u201cloves art and songs more than Hamas and its military,\u201d and that Mr. Mashoukhi was \u201cfed up of being without electricity and being treated like a sheep.\u201d The friend requested anonymity for fear of retribution by Hamas\u2019s security apparatus.An Interior Ministry official said that Mr. Mashoukhi, aside from being a comedian, received a salary from the ministry as a member of the security apparatus, and that he was arrested for disciplinary violations, as well as a lack of commitment to the performance of his duties.Gaza requires up to 470 megawatts of power per day \u2014 with demand increasing when people use heaters during the winter \u2014 but it is producing or receiving barely a third of that amount, according to officials.The Gaza power plant, bombed by Israel in 2006 during fighting between Israel and Hamas, has long been working at half capacity, in part because of funding shortages that limit fuel purchases. It has been producing only 60 megawatts since 2013, according to the United Nations office for humanitarian affairs in the region.In addition, Israel supplies 120 megawatts and Egypt up to 30 megawatts, but the flow from these lines is sometimes disrupted for technical reasons.Many Gaza residents do not pay their electricity bills, leaving the electricity companies in debt. The Palestinian Authority has also been reducing the tax exemptions it grants to Hamas to purchase fuel for the Gaza power plant, increasing the cost. Authority officials, for their part, have blamed Hamas for imposing its own taxes and tariffs.Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, blamed the Palestinian Authority for delays in upgrading the electricity supply lines to Gaza.

And like all Apple employees, he was discouraged from talking about his job with co-workers.His current employer, Pearl Automation, could not be more different.Founded in 2014 by three former senior managers from Apple\u2019s iPod and iPhone groups, Pearl has tried to replicate what its leaders view as the best parts of Apple\u2019s culture, like its fanatical dedication to quality and beautiful design. But the founders also consciously rejected some of the less appealing aspects of life at Apple, like its legendary secrecy and top-down management style.The start-up, which makes high-tech accessories for cars, holds weekly meetings with its entire staff. Managers brief them on coming products, company finances, technical problems, even the presentations made to the board.\u201cIt\u2019s very liberating to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Mr. Latimer, who left Apple in May to join Pearl. \u201cEveryone is contributing here, so everyone has a need to know.\u201dBest of all, Mr. Latimer is working with many of his old Apple colleagues.Pearl, which is led by Bryson Gardner, has recruited heavily from Apple. More than 50 of Pearl\u2019s 80 or so employees worked for the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant at some point.Although Apple pays very well, many of the Apple recruits had gotten bored cranking out incremental improvements to the iPhone and the Mac, said Brian Sander, Pearl\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer. \u201cThey were vibrating. It was time for them to do something different,\u201d he said.Pearl\u2019s pitch was appealing: Make the roads safer by giving tens of millions of older autos the same high-tech safety features that the newest models have.Mr. Gardner declined to disclose specific sales figures but said Pearl had released the product too late to make it into physical retailers before the holidays. The company plans to expand distribution early next year.Like Apple, though, Pearl is playing the long game. Engineers are already testing self-parking technology and other driver-assistance features for future products. So far, the company has raised $50 million from prominent venture capital firms, including Accel, Shasta Ventures and Venrock, but Mr. Gardner said it would need to raise more money in 2017.Pearl\u2019s headquarters \u2014 in an office complex between vast redwood groves and Santa Cruz\u2019s beaches \u2014 are a world away from Apple\u2019s campus in the busy technopolis of Silicon Valley.The larger company\u2019s influence, however, is clear.Apple, which has about 110,000 employees, breaks big projects down into smaller tasks. Those are assigned to small teams, and each subtask is given to a specific employee, who must get it done \u2014 what Apple calls the \u201cdirectly responsible individual.\u201dPearl has copied this system. \u201cIn leading small teams, that\u2019s very effective,\u201d Mr. Gardner said.Pearl has also imported Apple\u2019s disciplined approach to engineering. Deadlines are regularly set, and flaws are relentlessly investigated. \u201cWhy did this fail?\u201d Mr. Gardner said. \u201cYou really understand the full bounds of the problem.\u201dAnother Apple hallmark \u2014 elegant design \u2014 is also a core value. \u201cWe\u2019re building something that has an Apple-quality fit and finish,\u201d Mr. Sander said.Unlike competing models, the RearVision has two high-definition cameras to provide a better view, and one is tuned for night vision. The cameras peek out of a license-plate frame and are powered by a hidden solar panel. They transmit data wirelessly to an adapter that plugs into the car\u2019s diagnostic port near the steering wheel. The images are displayed on an app on the driver\u2019s smartphone. The setup allows the company to frequently update the software to fix bugs and add new features.Like Apple, Pearl dealt with dozens of suppliers, mostly in Asia, to obtain the 400 unique components in RearVision.\u201cWe were used to doing this with the iPhone and iPad,\u201d said Joseph Fisher, Pearl\u2019s co-founder and head of engineering. Indeed, the Pearl team tapped many of the same suppliers they worked with at Apple.But Pearl\u2019s leaders also consciously rejected Apple\u2019s view that only the top executives should have a view of the whole company.Apple\u2019s longtime chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, exercised control over the smallest details about products. When he stepped down in 2011, his power was distributed among more of the company\u2019s executives, but decisions remained highly centralized.Apple, for all of its success creating phones and computers, has spawned very few start-ups like Pearl in recent years, especially compared to peers like Google and Facebook.Eswar Priyadarshan, who sold his mobile advertising company, Quattro Wireless, to Apple in 2010 and stayed for four years, said that he learned about design and aesthetics during his time there. But he noted that Apple\u2019s high compensation, focused product mission and top-down decision-making tended to damp the risk-taking necessary to start a company.Mr. Priyadarshan, who is now chief executive of BotCentral, a six-person start-up, compared Apple to a community of warrior monks. \u201cWarrior monks don\u2019t talk and do whatever is asked,\u201d he said.Nest Labs, the most successful company to have been founded by Apple veterans in the last few years, was born in part because its founders, Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, were told that Apple had no interest in their smart thermostat.\u201cIt was a great place to work: superhigh growth, great product, lots of innovation,\u201d said Mr. Rogers, who remained at Nest after its sale to Alphabet for $3.2 billion in 2014. \u201cBut Apple is very much, \u2018How do we ship our next iPhone for Christmas?\u2019\u201dBut Mr. Rogers, who worked with some of Pearl\u2019s founders at Apple and serves on its board, said that the start-up absorbed many of the positive lessons of Nest: Recruit top Apple people, control your hardware and software, establish a culture of openness and empowerment, and constantly upgrade the product.Apple, for its part, appears to hold no hard feelings toward Pearl, despite the start-up\u2019s steady recruitment of its employees.\u201cPearl Auto is a great example of the creativity and innovation driving the iPhone ecosystem,\u201d said Josh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman. \u201cWe wish them great success with their new product.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 91.His son Michael said the cause was heart failure.Mr. Lilly began fishing as a young boy in Manhattan, Mont., where he was influenced by his father\u2019s tales of trout fishing in his native California. After his father closed up his barbershop for the day, the two of them would fish.In time, Mr. Lilly\u2019s youthful fascination with trout became a life\u2019s work. He became a guide on the Madison, Gallatin and Yellowstone rivers; the owner of a renowned trout shop in West Yellowstone, Mont.; and an author, preaching the joys of casting artificial flies into rivers and streams.\u201cI was always engaged by the instant of the strike,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography, published in 1988. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many thousands of trout I\u2019ve taken since. I still have the same excitement when I put a fly over a trout and a miracle happens.\u201dAnd, until the early 1960s, he viewed trout as a reward to be eaten, not as a natural resource that could be imperiled.\u201cLife was simple,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou caught a big fish; you killed it. Only an idiot would let it go.\u201dBut he eventually changed his mind. He heard about catch and release from fishermen from Michigan and made it his cause, reasoning that the popularity of fly-fishing in Montana might deplete the stocks of trout. He created a catch-and-release club in his shop, selling fishermen silver buttons that boasted of their releases of trout of various lengths.\u201cThe club caught on and a lot of anglers wore one or more buttons on his/her vest,\u201d Paul Schullery, a friend who co-wrote Mr. Lilly\u2019s books, said in an email. \u201cPresumably, the button kind of replaced the trout as the \u2018trophy.\u2019\u201dMr. Lilly\u2019s reputation in Montana as a fisherman, retailer and outfitter helped persuade reluctant anglers that they could change their behavior.\u201cHe had a megaphone, and people picked up on what he said,\u201d Bruce Farling, executive director of Montana Trout Unlimited, a conservation group, said in an interview. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only voice, but he was probably the most prominent one.\u201dWalen Francis Lilly II was born in Manhattan, Mont. \u2014 \u201con the kitchen table,\u201d he said \u2014 on Aug. 13, 1925, to Walen Lilly, a barber, and the former Violet Collins, a homemaker.Fishing and baseball were young Bud\u2019s passions. As a teenager, he played for a local men\u2019s baseball team against a squad of black players, and, as he told the story, hit a single off the legendary pitcher Satchel Paige. He was talented enough, he said, to attract the attention of the Cincinnati Reds. But service in the Navy during World War II interrupted his baseball dreams.Mr. Lilly\u2019s conversion to catch and release was one element of his conservation work. He also worked to end Montana\u2019s practice of planting hatchery trout in rivers \u2014 which let fishermen increase their catches \u2014 to allow wild trout to thrive.In recent years, Mr. Lilly\u2019s vision was diminished by macular degeneration, and he could no longer fish.\u201cBut he\u2019d sit on the bank with lots of advice,\u201d his son Michael said.In addition to Michael, he is survived by another son, Gregory; a daughter, Annette Lilly Russ; a stepson, Chris Lilly; a stepdaughter, Alisa Flores; his second wife, the former Esther Neufeld; five grandchildren; and two step-grandchildren.Mr. Lilly was known as a raconteur whose conversations often began with a joke. Last year, his stepson told his Facebook followers to visit him for a chat on the porch of his father\u2019s home, a converted boardinghouse, in Three Forks, Mont.\u201cChances are he\u2019s out front, taking in some vitamin D,\u201d Chris Lilly wrote, \u201cand waiting for a chance to talk about fishing or what it was like to be an officer in the Navy at age 19 during WWII.\u201dAn obituary on Monday about the conservationist Bud Lilly omitted several survivors. A stepson, Chris Lilly; a stepdaughter, Alisa Flores; and two step-grandchildren also survive him. In addition, the obituary misidentified the author of a 2016 Facebook post inviting people to visit Mr. Lilly. It was his stepson, Chris \u2014 not his son Gregory.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Leaders Reject Trump\u2019s Refugee Ban as Violating Principles", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported byThe spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said there was no justification for the policy \u2014 not even the fight against terrorism \u2014 of refusing to admit refugees fleeing war. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain revised her stance on the American directive to take a harder line, while Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy said that Mr. Trump\u2019s approach ran counter to basic European principles.Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for Ms. Merkel, said in a statement that she had reminded Mr. Trump during their telephone conversation on Saturday that the Geneva Convention on refugees obliges all member states to take in those fleeing war.In London, after Mrs. May\u2019s response to a question about the issue on Saturday at a news conference in Turkey prompted sharp criticism of her unwillingness to criticize Mr. Trump, her spokesman said that the British government did \u201cnot agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking.\u201dInstead, in notably spare tones, the statements suggested that the two had agreed to cooperate in reinforcing NATO and a trans-Atlantic alliance that Mr. Trump has questioned, most recently in an interview with European newspapers days before his inauguration, in which he called the alliance \u201cobsolete.\u201dMs. Merkel reacted coolly to Mr. Trump\u2019s election in November, offering close cooperation only on the basis of shared values such as equal treatment for all, with no discrimination on the basis of faith, political views, sexual orientation or ethnic origin. Her stance on Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order was in line with that approach.Ms. Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany and is the daughter of a Lutheran pastor, has invoked that background in justifying her decision to allow more than one million asylum seekers, many of them Muslims, into Germany since 2015.The party, Alternative for Germany, seems certain to enter the federal parliament after the Sept. 24 elections, which will follow crucial votes in the Netherlands and France this spring and help determine whether a weakened Europe can maintain its unity.A spokesman for Mrs. May, who was not identified by name under traditional ground rules, said that if Mr. Trump\u2019s policy affects British citizens, as it will for people who are citizens of two countries, \u201cthen clearly we will make representations to the U.S. government about that.\u201dThe comments followed a backlash from politicians and on social media, after comments from Mrs. May in a news conference in Ankara, the Turkish capital. She had flown there she after becoming the first foreign leader to meet with the new American president, a source of pride for Downing Street.After meeting Turkish leaders, she was asked several times by British journalists about her reaction to the executive order. She refused to condemn the policy and finally said \u2014 after reporters shouted, \u201cAnswer the question!\u201d \u2014 that \u201cthe United States is responsible for the United States\u2019 policy on refugees. The United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom\u2019s policy on refugees.\u201dOne person likely to be affected is a British sports hero, the Olympic champion runner Mo Farah. He was born in Somalia and came to Britain at age 8, and he may not be able to return to his training base and home in Oregon, where his family lives.Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order was preceded on Friday by an emotional appeal from the mayor of Berlin, related to another proposal by Mr. Trump that has proved polarizing \u2014 the construction of a wall along the United States border with Mexico.\u201cBerlin, the city of Europe\u2019s division, the city of Europe\u2019s freedom, cannot silently look on as a country sets about building a new wall,\u201d the mayor, Michael M\u00fcller, said in a statement.\u201cWe Berliners know better than most the pain caused when a whole continent is split by barbed wire and walls. Our division destroyed the prospects of millions. But ultimately, we, the people, overcame it,\u201d he wrote, recalling the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989.Mr. M\u00fcller took the unusual step of invoking another United States president, Ronald Reagan, in appealing to Mr. Trump to tear down walls rather than build new ones.Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from London, and Alissa J.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Though Harry Littell was teaching digital photography to Lois Barden, she came to class one day in 2004 with a question about a much older process. She had with her a box of 8-by-10 glass plate negatives that she had found 30 years earlier in a shed belonging to her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandmother near Rochester, N.Y. She asked her teacher what he thought. When he started scanning the plates, Mr. Littell was amazed. There were images of logging camps, railroads, studio portraits, children and outdoor scenes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was a foreign world unlike anything I really knew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Littell, the chairman of photography at Tompkins Cortland Community College in Dryden, N.Y. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was amazed at the detail, the mystery of these images. There were people and horses in a woodland setting, and immediately I wanted to know: What are the stories that explain these people and their situation? Are there any connections to us?\u00e2\u0080\u009dThose questions started him on a meandering path that ended with the discovery that the photos had been taken in Pennsylvania, starting in the late 19th century, by William T. Clarke, a photographer who had worked in the area for some 40 years. With Ronald E. Ostman, an emeritus professor of graduate communications at Cornell and Mr. Littell\u2019s collaborator on previous books, he assembled a detailed look at a bygone world in \u00e2\u0080\u009cWood Hicks and Bark Peelers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d published by Penn State University Press.The book, whose title comes from names given to certain jobs at lumber camps, chronicles how the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unceasing demand for wood \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for railroads, trestles and houses \u00e2\u0080\u0094 transformed Pennsylvania\u00e2\u0080\u0099s landscape from virgin forest to desolation. It also brings to light the work of Mr. Clarke, whose detailed negatives displayed a certain flair.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is so much humanity in those pictures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Littell said.Mr. Ostman saw familiar scenes in the images. He grew up in northern Minnesota, and both of his grandfathers were in the lumber business. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of it was familiar to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat impressed me was I had never seen 8-by-10 glass plate negatives, but when you scan and blow them up, you see every little thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It took some sleuthing to root out the stories. Starting with information scratched onto the edges of the negatives, as well as details from locomotives, they narrowed down the area to Pennsylvania. While researching at the Pennsylvania State Archives, they met Linda A. Ries, who recognized the work as Mr. Clarke\u2019s because the images were similar to ones in the archive that had been rescued from a leaky barn.Ms. Ries did some genealogical research, which led her to the name Isabel Mayo. Though it meant nothing to Mr. Littell, the name jolted Ms. Barden: Isabel Mayo was her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandmother, who had kept the box of negatives in her shed. As one could imagine, life in the lumber camps was rough. The workers were isolated for a good part of the year and prohibited from drinking (and sometimes even speaking at meals), and one of the few comforts they had was good food. And while some of the pictures showed a certain quiet, almost pastoral, tone, the men depicted were rough-and-tumble.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen they hit town, usually on the Fourth of July, they were ready to rock and roll when they got into town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ostman said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were victims of cabin fever from being isolated in the boonies for nine months. They got drunk immediately and took it out on the townspeople, or they started fighting among themselves. They had spikes in their boots, and when they fought, the idea was to get the other guy down and spike his face. They called it logger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smallpox.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Clarke spent 40 years in Pennsylvania before returning to the Rochester area to be with family. By then, the landscape had been cleared, and the lumber companies had moved on to other states. The glass plates that were later discovered in Rochester may have been favorites that Mr. Clarke decided to keep.Among them are group portraits of lumber workers, which was as much an economic choice as an aesthetic one: The more people in the image, the more photos could be sold. As a result, there are probably descendants of loggers who have more of Mr. Clarke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s images in their homes. With the publication of this book, they may now have some answers not just on their family history, but on that of Pennsylvania.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is this whole environmental story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Littell said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis whole boom-to-bust story. Clarke was able to get to the tail end of the virgin hemlock forest. At the end, you see where everything was logged off. It took a hundred years for it to grow back. Now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Nixon Tried to Spoil Johnson\u2019s Vietnam Peace Talks in \u201968, Notes Show", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported by\u201cThere\u2019s really no doubt this was a step beyond the normal political jockeying, to interfere in an active peace negotiation given the stakes with all the lives,\u201d said John A. Farrell, who discovered the notes at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library for his forthcoming biography, \u201cRichard Nixon: The Life,\u201d to be published in March by Doubleday. \u201cPotentially, this is worse than anything he did in Watergate.\u201dHis discovery, according to numerous historians who have written books about Nixon and conducted extensive research of his papers, finally provides validation of what had largely been surmise.While overshadowed by Watergate, the Nixon campaign\u2019s intervention in the peace talks has captivated historians for years. At times resembling a Hollywood thriller, the story involves colorful characters, secret liaisons, bitter rivalries and plenty of lying and spying. Whether it changed the course of history remains open to debate, but at the very least it encapsulated an almost-anything-goes approach that characterized the nation\u2019s politics in that era.Through much of the campaign, the Nixon team maintained a secret channel to the South Vietnamese through Anna Chennault, widow of Claire Lee Chennault, leader of the Flying Tigers in China during World War II. Mrs. Chennault had become a prominent Republican fund-raiser and Washington hostess.Nixon met with Mrs. Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador earlier in the year to make clear that she was the campaign\u2019s \u201csole representative\u201d to the Saigon government. But whether he knew what came later has always been uncertain. She was the conduit for urging the South Vietnamese to resist Johnson\u2019s entreaties to join the Paris talks and wait for a better deal under Nixon. At one point, she told the ambassador she had a message from \u201cher boss\u201d: \u201cHold on, we are gonna win.\u201dLearning of this through wiretaps and surveillance, Johnson was livid. He ordered more bugs and privately groused that Nixon\u2019s behavior amounted to \u201ctreason.\u201d But lacking hard evidence that Nixon was directly involved, Johnson opted not to go public.The notes Mr. Farrell found come from a phone call on Oct. 22, 1968, as Johnson prepared to order a pause in the bombing to encourage peace talks in Paris. Scribbling down what Nixon was telling him, Mr. Haldeman wrote, \u201cKeep Anna Chennault working on SVN,\u201d or South Vietnam.A little later, he wrote that Nixon wanted Senator Everett Dirksen, a Republican from Illinois, to call the president and denounce the planned bombing pause. \u201cAny other way to monkey wrench it?\u201d Mr. Haldeman wrote. \u201cAnything RN can do.\u201dDuring a phone call on the night of Oct. 22, 1968, Richard M. Nixon told his closest aide (and future chief of staff) H.R. Haldeman to \"monkey wrench\" President Lyndon B. Johnson's efforts to begin peace negotiations over the Vietnam War.After leaving office, Nixon denied knowing about Mrs. Chennault\u2019s messages to the South Vietnamese late in the 1968 campaign, despite proof that she had been in touch with John N. Mitchell, Mr. Nixon\u2019s campaign manager and later attorney general.Other Nixon scholars called Mr. Farrell\u2019s discovery a breakthrough. Robert Dallek, an author of books on Nixon and Johnson, said the notes \u201cseem to confirm suspicions\u201d of Nixon\u2019s involvement in violation of federal law. Evan Thomas, the author of \u201cBeing Nixon,\u201d said Mr. Farrell had \u201cnailed down what has been talked about for a long time.\u201dKen Hughes, a researcher at the Miller Center of the University of Virginia, who in 2014 published \u201cChasing Shadows,\u201d a book about the episode, said Mr. Farrell had found a smoking gun. \u201cThis appears to be the missing piece of the puzzle in the Chennault affair,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. The notes \u201cshow that Nixon committed a crime to win the presidential election.\u201dStill, as tantalizing as they are, the notes do not reveal what, if anything, Mr. Haldeman actually did with the instruction, and it is unclear that the South Vietnamese needed to be told to resist joining peace talks that they considered disadvantageous already.Moreover, it cannot be said definitively whether a peace deal could have been reached without Nixon\u2019s intervention or that it would have helped Mr. Humphrey. William P. Bundy, a foreign affairs adviser to Johnson and John F. Kennedy who was highly critical of Nixon, nonetheless concluded that prospects for the peace deal were slim anyway, so \u201cprobably no great chance was lost.\u201dLuke A. Nichter, a scholar at Texas A&M University and one of the foremost students of the Nixon White House secret tape recordings, said he liked more of Mr. Farrell\u2019s book than not, but disagreed with the conclusions about Mr. Haldeman\u2019s notes.

(The report made no determination on how they affected the election.)Of the comments he had seen from fellow Trump supporters on Facebook and in emails, he added, \u201c90 percent of them are like, \u2018What\u2019s the big deal?\u2019\u201dThe Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in American elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries\u2019 elections. Even if the Russians did do it \u2014 which some were more willing to concede than others \u2014 what difference did it make? People did not need the Russians to make up their minds about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s election opponent. Blaming her loss on the Russians was, as one Trump supporter here said, \u201cjust being sore losers.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think the Russians posed as big a problem to the Clintons as the Clintons posed to themselves,\u201d said Paul Emenes, 49, while he sold ribs, shoulders and chops at a frigid outdoor farmers\u2019 market in Covington. Russian hacking was concerning, sure, Mr. Emenes said. He added that, as long as Mr. Trump was not involved himself, \u201cit doesn\u2019t change the way I view him.\u201dTina Gunaldo, 44, taking blankets off the citrus trees in her Mandeville, La., front yard after the previous night\u2019s frost, had a similar attitude.\u201cTrump is Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cDo I think he\u2019s going to become more of a friend to Russia because of this? No I don\u2019t. I think \u2014 I hope \u2014 his focus will be on making America great again.\u201dMs. Gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for, but she did say Mr. Trump\u2019s slogan resonated with her. It apparently resonated quite widely in this parish, which he won by more than 50 points. But it was a quiet support, she said. She knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign.That yard belonged to Thurston Yates Sr.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mr. Yates, 78, said flatly of the intelligence report. He was standing in the yard under his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d flag, which he bought at a gun show several months ago. \u201cWhy would Putin even want Trump?\u201dMr. Yates, who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales, was not concerned about what Mr. Trump might do in office, but said he was deeply alarmed about what President Obama might do before he leaves office.It was Mr. Obama who was too soft on Russia, who let Mr. Putin get away with things, Mr. Yates continued. Mr. Trump would be much tougher.But Mr. Yates then added: \u201cWhy is everybody so afraid of Russia? I\u2019m not against Putin.\u201dThis last sentiment was not uncommon. Even among those who were troubled by the hacks, few felt that Russia was a serious threat. The country was \u201ca basket case,\u201d and not the powerful foe it once was, said Mr. Marino, from his seat at McDonald\u2019s. Others said that North Korea, the Islamic State and China were the real threats. Russia could even be a potential ally in some fights, suggested Valarie Kubacki, 54, a real estate broker in Valparaiso, Ind.Ms. Kubacki said she perceived Russia as \u201csomewhere in the middle\u201d between friend and enemy, but agreed with Mr. Trump that the United States could work with them to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. \u201cWe may have to line up with people who may not be our \u2018friend\u2019 to make that happen,\u201d she said.That those on the right seemed to be warming to Russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development, though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the Central Intelligence Agency.As they watched their son skate with his Boy Scout group at the public ice rink in downtown Valparaiso, Monty and Mary Willis, both registered Republicans, considered the ramifications of the intelligence report.\u201cThe idea of a fair election\u201d had been placed in doubt, Ms. Willis said. \u201cWe were concerned about money being involved in the election. Now you\u2019re talking about espionage.\u201dThe Willises, who both work in real estate, might be Republicans, but they were not Trump voters. In fact, they had last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008, when Senator John McCain of Arizona ran. The party seemed to have changed in recent years, they said. And the incoming administration had them deeply worried.\u201cOur president being in cahoots with the Russian government?\u201d Mr. Willis said. \u201cYes, I\u2019m very concerned about that.\u201dIn Louisiana, David Gubert, 56, chain-smoked Eagle 20 cigarettes in the cab of his pickup, with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed.

But the most capable virtual reality headsets are expensive and require powerful personal computers to support them. Breakout applications, including video games, have not materialized because developers have been reluctant to pour resources into an uncertain market.While Facebook does not provide sales figures for the $599 Oculus Rift headset, which was released to the public last year, analysts believe they are slow.

Last month, a founder of Oculus, Brendan Iribe, stepped down as chief executive, moving to lead an Oculus group focused on virtual reality on personal computers. Facebook is also facing a lawsuit from ZeniMax Media, which has accused Oculus of stealing technology that went into the creation of the Oculus goggles.

{"Headline": "Sensing Gains Ahead Under Trump, the Kochs Court Minorities", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byThe crowd that thronged a gospel concert last month in Richmond, Va., was in for an unusual Christmas treat.The concert flier was adorned with a red car bearing Christmas gifts. \u201cThankful for the fuels and innovation that make modern life possible,\u201d it read.The Kochs, whose use of their fortune to promote climate-change denial research has angered environmentalists, are quietly courting new allies in their quest for a fossil fuel resurgence: minorities.Since its start in the spring of 2016, Fueling U.S. Forward has sent delegates to, or hosted, at least three events aimed at black voters, arguing that they benefit most from cheap and abundant fossil fuels and have the most to lose if energy costs rise.Fueling U.S. Forward is \u201cdedicated to educating the public about the value and potential of American energy, the vast majority of which comes from fossil fuels,\u201d the group says on its website. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk to people of diverse backgrounds \u2014 industry employees, small-business owners, community leaders and low-income families \u2014 and share their stories.\u201dThe group has seen early results from its outreach.A Koch Industries spokesman, David Dziok, did not respond to a request for comment.The Kochs\u2019 public relations drive takes a page from minority outreach by other industry lobbies, like those representing tobacco and soft drinks. Those industries have long argued that stiffer regulations or taxes on cigarettes or sodas would disproportionately affect low-income and minority communities.It also adds a new dimension to the Kochs\u2019 more traditional approach to climate and the environment, which has mainly involved financing research skeptical of climate change, backing pro-oil politicians and ballot initiatives, and fighting incentives for renewable energy, all through a network of charitable and political organizations.In recent years, the industry has increased its sway among Republicans, supporting a rightward shift toward sharp cutbacks of Social Security and Medicare and the rollback of environmental protections. And the Kochs find themselves well positioned to influence the Trump administration, with many allies in important cabinet and transition posts.But numerous polls show that a majority of American voters continue to support many environmental regulations, including those that govern carbon dioxide emissions. And there is significant support among voters, even in red states, for renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which the Kochs have long worked to quash.We got here, the ad says, by \u201charnessing the power of the earth and the natural fuels of soil and rock.\u201dIt remains unclear who else, apart from the Kochs, is financing Fueling U.S. Forward. It is registered as a nonprofit business association, a designation that allows its involvement in both lobbying and political activities. But because it is so new, it has not yet made public filings detailing its financial and other activities.The group has even experimented with outreach to the kind of left-wing audience that has long vilified the Kochs. In his Facebook Live broadcast, Mr. Drevna specifically addressed those critics, inviting them to see fossil fuels as part of a progressive worldview.\u201cEnergy security means economic security,\u201d Mr. Drevna said. \u201cEconomic security means an increased, progressive lifestyle.\u201dThe group\u2019s outreach to African-Americans has been more overt, and involved multiple members of the Kochs\u2019 network.He discussed what high energy costs could mean for households in Richmond, which has a large African-American population. And he encouraged audience members to contact their legislators to lodge concerns about energy costs, said Clovia Lawrence, a local journalist and radio personality who helped host the show.Then four lucky people picked from the crowd of about 300 were told that their latest monthly electricity bills would be paid, up to $250, she said.\u201cEveryone was so excited,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was dancing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information provided by the American Energy Alliance, misstated Hubbel Relat\u2019s position with the organization.

{"Headline": "Why BuzzFeed News Published the Dossier", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBuzzFeed News decided to publish the dossier, with appropriate context and caveats, for two related reasons, and only after we had spent weeks with reporters in the United States and Europe trying to confirm or disprove specific claims.First, the documents were in wide circulation among top intelligence and elected officials and news organizations. They were being fought over \u2014 and acted on \u2014 at the highest levels of power. But the rest of the country was getting only the occasional glimpse of those battles, never the source documents themselves.We at BuzzFeed News had, of course, considered that someone else would post the dossier, and planned in that case to follow by adding what we knew on it. We hadn\u2019t anticipated what actually happened: a bombshell report that described the document, while the document itself remained secret.That halfway position ran contrary to how we think of our compact with our audience: You trust us to give you the full story; we trust you to reckon with a messy, sometimes uncertain reality. And with other news organizations already trumpeting the dossier\u2019s central allegation \u2014 that the Trump campaign maintained secret ties to the Russian leadership \u2014 our decision to publish it in full rapidly advanced the story.News organizations should instead consider this reality: Our audience inhabits a complex, polluted information environment; our role is to help them navigate it \u2014 not to pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. The need to show our work and earn trust has never been more important, since once reliable official sources are peddling \u201calternative facts\u201d \u2014 as the White House press secretary did Saturday.If I were to design a media ecosystem from scratch, it wouldn\u2019t be this one. And I certainly did not anticipate this environment in the utopian, early days of digital journalism 15 years ago. The web was supposed to allow powerful media organizations to build trust and connections to their audience by sharing their knowledge and sources. The audience could hold power to account. At its best, that kind of transparency has been powerful.Today, we can see a dystopian path clearly, too. Every Facebook user encounters a profusion of sources and claims. If the presidential campaign did nothing else, it gave Americans reason to read carefully, exercise judgment and view with skepticism what they heard \u2014 even from the most powerful man in the nation.There is an instinct, easy to understand, to turn away from this chaos. Some legacy media organizations have reacted to the new challenges by retreating to traditional reporting procedures of ostentatious, and sometimes false, balance and voice-of-God authority. Their theory is that the media can confront power by engaging in a theater of traditional journalism and proving their purity and incorruptibility \u2014 in short, hew to the same rules that got them steamrollered in 2016.This retreat is dangerous. Instead, we need to develop new rules that adhere to the core values of honesty and respect for our audience. That means debunking falsehoods, and being transparent with readers about our process of reporting. Sometimes, it means publishing unverified information in a transparent way that informs our users of its provenance, its impact and why we trust or distrust it.Of course, there are lines to be drawn, and we draw them every day. BuzzFeed News receives false tips that lead to dead ends we do not publish. But the Trump dossier was legitimate news: a document that was already influencing decision makers at the very highest levels. In a democracy, the justification for shielding the public from something like that must be overwhelming. The instinct to suppress news of this significance is precisely the wrong one for journalism in 2017.Advertisement"}

Medallions. Certificates. Toys. Guns. Letters. Countless photographs.\u201cOne of my best memories was that there was an American officer who used to remember the birthdays of my three children and he used to bring them gifts,\u201d said Yasir Khaleel, who lives in Baquba, in eastern Iraq, and used to work as a translator for American troops.But he has another memory, too, equally poignant.\u201cMy worst memory was the killing of my nephew, who was just a kid, who had been shot by an American patrol,\u201d Mr. Khaleel recalled, evoking the close but painful personal relationships that have developed over the recent history between the two countries.Now, with the inauguration of President Trump, and particularly after his plan to bar citizens of Iraq from visiting the United States, Iraqis are asking: Will this new chapter in this long story be one of betrayals and insults?For more than a quarter-century, since the first Persian Gulf war in 1991, the United States military has been involved in Iraq. Tens of thousands of Iraqis signed up to help the American cause, and their own, by working to achieve democracy and stability in a country that had never experienced either.Through the most difficult times \u2014 when sectarian violence was tearing the country apart, when revelations came of torture by Americans at the Abu Ghraib prison \u2014 there were always the personal interactions between Iraqis and Americans, nurtured against the backdrop of war.The day he took office, Mr. Trump became the fifth president in a row to bomb Iraq. He has also suggested that he would put more military resources into Iraq, where American forces are working closely with Iraqi troops in the battle to retake Mosul from Islamic State militants, to make good on his promise to eradicate the group \u201cfrom the face of the earth.\u201d\u201cIt is going to alienate the whole of Iraq against the man, to say to all Iraqis, \u2018You are not welcome in our country,\u2019\u201d said Mouwafak al-Rubaie, a member of Parliament and a former national security adviser in Iraq.The issue could also become a political liability for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who has spoken optimistically about expanding cooperation between Iraq and the United States under Mr. Trump in the fight against ISIS. It will be difficult, Mr. Rubaie said, for Mr. Abadi to justify to the Iraqi public a close relationship with the United States when the country is closing the door on Iraqis.\u201cThis is going to be a huge embarrassment for the prime minister,\u201d Mr. Rubaie said.On Monday, Iraq\u2019s Parliament voted to ask the government to respond by barring Americans from the country. It was unclear whether the government would do so, and in a statement issued on Monday the Foreign Ministry was more cautious, asking that the United States reconsider the policy.Other leaders, including the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, and the spokesman for Iraq\u2019s paramilitary units that have been fighting the Islamic State, said that Americans should be barred from Iraq.Mr. Abadi\u2019s spokesman took a more measured approach, saying that the executive order should not affect security cooperation between the countries.\u201cWhen you are trying to rebuild Iraq, it is important to get Iraqis to study in the United States, to get training,\u201d Mr. Barkey said.He gave the example of the American University of Iraq, Sulaimani, in Iraqi Kurdistan, which receives American funding and on whose board he sits. \u201cKurdish-Iraqi academics will have a very hard time to visit the United States, which defeats the purpose of setting up these institutions,\u201d Mr. Barkey said.Mr. Trump\u2019s new restrictions were particularly heart-rending for the thousands of Iraqis who had worked closely with American troops and made many friends among the Americans. There was no guarantee, but signing up to join the American cause came with an implicit promise: a chance at a new life in the United States, through a special immigration program that Mr. Trump seems intent on ending.\u201cYou have let us down, Trump, and wasted all our hopes and future,\u201d said Ali Salam, a former military translator. He said he once thought of America as \u201cthe land of dreams.\u201dAnas Nasir, who worked for an American security contractor in Baghdad, said that the new restrictions had shattered his hopes. His job brought a steady paycheck, but, facing many death threats, he quit and applied for asylum in the United States. His dream was a simple one: to open a restaurant in Los Angeles serving Iraqi food.\u201cBut now Mr. Trump came to destroy this last dream,\u201d said Mr. Nasir, 30. \u201cI always dreamed of raising my son away from car bombs and sectarian tensions, and America was the ideal place.\u201dFacing long waits for an answer to their applications, Iraqis have spent hours learning English and researching life in the United States.\u201cI was waiting for the day when I would leave Iraq and start over with a new life, free of problems and fear and sadness, and where I can protect the lives of my wife and daughters,\u201d said Haider al-Kadhimi, who has worked for an American news outlet and who applied for resettlement in the United States five years ago after being threatened by a militia. He said he hoped to move to Utah, a state he had learned about on the internet.\u201cUnfortunately, Trump has decided to not welcome us and has left us as easy prey for those who consider America as an enemy and occupant in Iraq,\u201d he added.Strict American immigration procedures had already divided many Iraqi families, as some members were approved for entry while others were left waiting, or denied. For a long time Iraqis hoped the separation was temporary, but now many are fearful that it will be permanent.Namo Abdulla, a Kurdish journalist who moved to the United States a few years ago but recently returned to marry, worries that his new wife, who has been waiting for months for a visa to the United States, will be barred from joining him.Mr. Abdulla wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday: \u201cThank you, Mr. Trump, for closing your country\u2019s borders on the most vulnerable people. My wife has been waiting for her visa to be issued for months. Please don\u2019t say this is going to impact my wife.

In the pre-internet past, Tufekci explains, a protest march was the culmination of the months of phone calls, letters and meetings needed to plan the event. The planning for March on Washington in August 1963, for example, started in 1962.Today, digital communication has made the planning of marches far easier. It can start with a single Facebook post and culminate in a march weeks later. Just look at the rapid planning and enormous turnout for the Women\u2019s March.As a result, Tufekci argues, a protest is not necessarily a sign of an actual movement; that\u2019s why some large protests in recent years, like those opposing the war in Iraq or the Occupy rallies, have had relatively muted real-world impact.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that protests no longer matter \u2014 they do,\u201d Tufekci writes. \u201cNowadays, however, protests should be seen not as the culmination of an organizing effort, but as a first, potential step. A large protest today is less like the March on Washington in 1963 and more like Rosa Parks\u2019s refusal to move to the back of the bus. What used to be an endpoint is now an initial spark.\u201dBarack Obama, in his last interview as president, made the same point when asked what individual citizens could do to help protect the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of health insurance.Advertisement"}

Restaurants feel the glow. So do schoolchildren.Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Just before the holidays, on a dark street a few blocks from downtown, a group of public officials crowded onto a makeshift stage before a shivering crowd, flipped a big switch \u2014 and the last of this city\u2019s 65,000 new streetlights blazed on.For years, urban decline here was encapsulated in headlines about Detroit\u2019s lights going out. Nowadays, tales of the city\u2019s slow recovery tend to focus on plucky hipsters from Los Angeles or Brooklyn colonizing abandoned spaces, opening pickle companies or tilling little urban agriculture plots. Glossy magazines acclaim Detroit as the next Berlin; never mind that Germany\u2019s reunified capital has always floated on a bed of cushy federal subsidies.Let\u2019s hope that if anyone writes a history of Detroit\u2019s rejuvenation, a chapter is devoted to the lights returning. Like picking up the trash, fixing potholes and responding to emergencies, these efforts signal that no matter where you live in Detroit, you are no longer forgotten \u2014 that government here can finally keep its basic promises.So far, much news about growth has focused on downtown, where Dan Gilbert, the billionaire owner of Quicken Loans, is a vocal booster, and on Midtown, home to businesses like the luxury brand Shinola. A light rail under construction will soon link the two neighborhoods, doubling down on their redevelopment.They recommended LED technology. Investments by the Obama administration in energy-efficient lighting have reduced costs, making LEDs feasible for a city like Detroit. Three years ago, nearly half the 88,000 streetlights in the city were out of commission. The more potent LED lights allow the authority to replace those 88,000 old fixtures with 65,000 new ones, strong enough for you to read one of those glossy magazines after dark.The whole thing came in under budget and on time. When was the last time anyone could say that about a major infrastructure project in Detroit? \u201cAn example of how good government should work,\u201d as Lorna L. Thomas, chairwoman of the lighting authority, put it at the switch-flipping ceremony.It\u2019s also an example of how one smart urban-design decision can have ripple effects. Some residents here grumbled about fewer lights. That said, the stronger new ones turn out to save Detroit nearly $3 million in electric bills. They use aluminum wiring, which nobody wants to strip, discouraging crime. The technology even cuts carbon emissions by more than 40,000 tons a year \u2014 equivalent to \u201ctaking 11,000 cars off of your streets,\u201d Shaun Donovan, Mr. Obama\u2019s director of the Office of Management and Budget, pointed out at the lighting event, as well as \u201cputting more money in the city\u2019s pockets to do more good things.\u201dBusinesses like Kuzzo\u2019s pretty much had to shut down by dinnertime during the winter when the lights were out, Mr. Bartell told me. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to go out to eat or shop after the sun went down,\u201d he said. He gestured out the window toward a shop across the street. \u201cI own a store that sells furs and leather goods, with a customer base that skews older. Foot traffic almost fell to zero after dark. Since the lights came on, it\u2019s up 15 percent across this neighborhood.\u201dBack at Sister Pie, I talked with Shannon Smith, 26, another Detroit native, who said he had grown up in Cody Rouge, an area on the northwest side of the city where getting to and from the bus stop as a teenager was a twice-daily nightmare when streetlights failed. He and other schoolchildren all across town waited in the dark for broken-down buses that often didn\u2019t arrive on schedule.\u201cI was especially vulnerable whenever it snowed, because the city didn\u2019t clear the sidewalks,\u201d Mr. Smith recalled.City officials told me that since 2014, using federal Department of Transportation funding, Detroit has added 80 buses, hired dozens of drivers and increased ridership by approximately 100,000 trips a week. Buses are critical to bringing together the far-flung areas of newly targeted development. It\u2019s one of the cruel (many here say racist) burdens of life in Detroit that automobile insurance rates for city residents are through the roof; many can\u2019t afford a car. Like the streetlights, buses restore the fabric of the streets and re-establish a base line of normalcy.Now the lights are on, Mr. Spencer said, and diners are returning at night. But more important, he said, the lights demonstrate that City Hall followed through on a promise: \u201cResidents stopped trusting government, and without trust people won\u2019t want to settle here or start a business. The mayor said he\u2019d turn the lights back on. He did.\u201dAmong ripple effects, trust may be the most invaluable.As I said, one smart design move.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Lending Support to Baltic States Fearing Russia", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported byVILNIUS, Lithuania \u2014 Dozens of United States Special Operations forces are now in the Baltics to bolster the training and resolve of troops who are confronting a looming threat from Russia, and to enhance the Americans\u2019 ability to detect Moscow\u2019s shadowy efforts to destabilize the former Soviet republics.\u201cThey\u2019re scared to death of Russia,\u201d Gen. Raymond T. Thomas, the head of the Pentagon\u2019s Special Operations Command, who visited here recently, said of the tiny militaries of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. \u201cThey are very open about that. They\u2019re desperate for our leadership.\u201dAs a result, General Thomas said, American commandos now have a \u201cpersistent\u201d presence here with Baltic special operations troops, after forging close ties with them over the past decade while fighting together in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Americans bring sophisticated surveillance technology and broad sources of intelligence. The Baltic partners have a deep understanding of conventional Russian military might as well as Moscow\u2019s increasing use of cyberwarfare, information subterfuge and other means less than all-out war to weaken the Western-backed governments.It is unclear how supportive President-elect Donald J. Trump will be of this initiative as he aims to mend fences with Moscow. Mr. Trump suggested during the election campaign that only NATO allies that paid their fair share deserved protection from the United States, although he has since softened his warning. His remarks alarmed the Baltic nations, which count on NATO\u2019s collective security efforts to deter an unpredictable Russia.In response to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the clandestine war in eastern Ukraine, as well as Moscow\u2019s heightened military force on patrol off the coasts of the Baltics and Western Europe, the United States and its NATO allies have bolstered their own military exercises in recent years, and this spring will send battalions of 800 to 1,200 troops to each of the three Baltic States and Poland.Russia\u2019s deployment this fall of nuclear-capable Iskander ballistic missiles to Kaliningrad, between Lithuania and Poland, underscored Moscow\u2019s efforts to intimidate the Baltics and the West, Baltic officials said. Russia dismissed such fears, saying the missile movements were routine drills.In November, the top commander of American Special Operations in Europe, Maj. Gen. Mark C. Schwartz, met here with Lithuania\u2019s chief of defense, Lt. Gen. Jonas Vytautas Zukas, to discuss the security situation and military cooperation, including exercises.The American commandos have deployed quietly but deliberately in the past several months, to send a message. \u201cDo the Russians know we\u2019re there?\u201d General Thomas said. \u201cYes.\u201dThe Baltic States have taken steps to increase their ability to resist overt and covert Russian advances. Since the Ukraine crisis began nearly three years ago, orders for new defense equipment in the Baltics have doubled and will double again in the next two years, according to an analysis by IHS Markit, a London-based research firm.Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia increased spending on new defense equipment to $390 million in 2016, from $210 million in 2014. Latvia and Lithuania have had the two fastest-growing defense budgets in the world since 2014, according to an IHS Jane\u2019s analysis.Lithuania has updated its civil defense booklet, which tells citizens what to do in the event of a Russian invasion. Tens of thousands of copies of the 75-page guide have been distributed. \u201cIt is most important that the civilians are aware and have a will to resist \u2014 when these elements are strong, an aggressor has difficulties in creating an environment for military invasion,\u201d the manual says.In 2015, Lithuania announced that it would reintroduce conscription for men between the ages of 19 and 26. In addition, Lithuania\u2019s self-defense league, akin to the National Guard in the United States, is to grow this year to about 4,900 citizen-soldiers from 4,600, Lithuanian officials said.The deployment of about a dozen American Special Operations forces to each of the Baltic States is a piece of the larger allied military strategy to deter any future Russian aggression. Embedded with their Baltic counterparts, the American commandos augment intelligence-gathering and other assessments by the Central Intelligence Agency and American diplomats on the threat posed by Russian activities.Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the commander of United States Army forces in Europe, said this new focus had improved the American forces\u2019 \u201cspeed of recognition\u201d of Russian activities. \u201cA big part is being on the ground and getting a feel for what\u2019s happening,\u201d General Hodges said in a telephone interview.The intelligence also informs planning in Washington. In October, the military\u2019s Joint Staff conducted a three-day confidential simulation exercise involving four possible situations in Latvia in which Russia used drones, cyberwarfare and media manipulation.Russia has employed disinformation, a tactic dating to Soviet days, to try to discredit the Lithuanian government and NATO, officials here said. In March, for instance, one national Lithuanian exercise involved the simulated contamination of a ship with an unknown chemical weapon. A blog announced that the threat was real and that five people had died from the chemicals. Lithuanian military officials were hiding the truth, the blog said.Although the report was patently false, it made its way into Russian-language news sites in the country, as well as antigovernment Facebook groups, which posted the reports.\u201cHere in the Baltics, we experience an avalanche of propaganda against our states,\u201d said Darius Jauniskis, the director of Lithuania\u2019s State Security Department and a former commander of Lithuanian special operations forces. \u201cIts purpose is to subvert our political and social coherence, to spread mistrust between state authorities and society, and even to disclaim our statehood.\u201dIn July, during the NATO summit meeting in Warsaw, at which decisions regarding stationing multinational NATO battalions in the Baltic States and Poland were made, another blog reportedly quoted a top Lithuanian general as saying that basing NATO forces in the country \u201cwas posing a threat to stability in ties between NATO and Russia.\u201d This kind of language was typical in Russian propaganda, and was quickly picked up by Russian news sites. The Lithuanian general publicly denied having said this.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to recognize in this foggy environment the actions that are taking place,\u201d Mr. Jauniskis said.Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the United States\u2019 assisting Baltic militaries misidentified the position held by Lt. Gen. Jonas Vytautas Zukas in Lithuania. He is the country\u2019s chief of defense, not chief of Special Operations forces.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Myanmar Holds Officers After Video Purports to Show Police Beating Rohingya", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Myanmar has detained four border police officers after a video surfaced online that appears to show two of them beating unarmed men in the restive border state of Rakhine, putting more pressure on the government to address tensions there between the authorities and the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority.\u201cThis video came out as the international community is criticizing her, so she will face more criticism now,\u201d said Ro Nay San Lwin, a Rohingya activist and blogger who lives in Europe and posted the video on his Facebook page.On Sunday, after the video became public, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s office said in a statement that the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Myanmar Police Force had detained four officers in connection with the incident, adding that they \u201cwill be punished.\u201dThe statement said two of the four detained officers, Pyae Phyo Thwin and Tay Zar Lin, had participated in the beating. It said the third detained officer was a supervisor, Maj. Ye Htun Naing, a member of the Border Guard Police Force. Two other officers who appear to be joining in the violence on the video were not identified.The statement said the fourth detained officer, Zaw Myo Htike, had recorded the images during what it described as a clearance operation in the village of Koe Tan Kauk on Nov. 5. It said the officers were responding to a tip that six suspects who had previously attacked a nearby border post were in the village.The village is in Rathedaung Township, near Maungdaw Township, the site of much of the recent violence against the Rohingya. The population in both townships, in northern Rakhine, is mostly Muslim.The government has \u201ctime and again stressed the need to be careful with each and every action, to make sure there is no violation of human rights and to act in line with the law,\u201d U Zaw Htay, a government spokesman, told reporters on Sunday in Naypyidaw, the capital.But Rohingya activists disputed that narrative, saying in interviews on Tuesday that the episode illustrated a larger pattern of abuse.\u201cShockingly, our Buddhist brothers and sisters in Burma have lost the virtue of Buddhism,\u201d said Kyaw Win, the executive director of the Burma Human Rights Network, an advocacy group based in London, using the country\u2019s former name. He said the video helped explain why the government had restricted the international news media\u2019s access to northern Rakhine.The United Nations said in late November that at least 10,000 Rohingya had fled Rakhine for neighboring Bangladesh since the October attacks. The Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that about 50,000 \u201cMyanmar citizens\u201d had taken shelter in Bangladesh over the same time period, referring to the Rohingya.\u201cIf we fail to take action, people may starve to death if they are not killed with bullets, and we may end up being the passive observers of crimes against humanity, which will lead us once again to wring our hands belatedly and say \u2018never again\u2019 all over again,\u201d the letter said.On Tuesday, Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, called for a transparent investigation of the violence and said that the government\u2019s response would test its commitment to the rule of law.\u201cIf the police feel so immune that they film themselves committing such brutal beatings, one wonders what other horrors might be taking place off camera that they were not willing to record,\u201d Mr. Robertson said in an email.But on social media, some people in Myanmar, including journalists, said that the authorities\u2019 handling of the police was unfair. They said the detained officers should not be punished.\u201cBengali deserve to be beaten because they are not from our country,\u201d one user wrote.James T. Davies, a doctoral candidate at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, Australia, who studies Myanmar, said that the government had probably felt forced to take action against the police officers after the video of purported abuse spread widely online. But the government has continued to deny involvement in other recent abuses against the Rohingya, he added, including the death of six people in its custody over the last three months.Saw Nang contributed reporting from Mandalay, Myanmar.Advertisement"}

There was going to be a Women\u2019s March on Washington on Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration of Mr. Trump as president. The organizers hoped to attract over a million marchers and show the new administration that women\u2019s rights could not be ignored. To achieve that goal, they were going to need eye-popping visuals.The end of the year was a difficult time for the company. Client deadlines were approaching, a key designer was taking off work to get married, and the team was scattering for the holidays. But the staff, mostly liberal millennials, ignored the barriers. \u201cWe are making posters,\u201d Jessie McGuire, the executive director of strategy at ThoughtMatter, announced.They crammed a process that normally takes months into two weeks. They covered their office with sketches, trial slogans and historical examples of illustrations and graphics to use for inspiration. \u201cSome of those suffragette posters, you could use those slogans today,\u201d Mr. Jaffe said.ThoughtMatter was planning on closing its offices between Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Day. To finish this volunteer project, however, the company stayed open and worked every day. No one minded, said Wednesday Trotto, one of the designers, explaining: \u201cWe needed something positive to end 2016 with.\u201d\u201cWe are very anxious and afraid of what is going to happen,\u201d said Nancy Ricci, a teacher at the store and one of the regular knitters. \u201cWe need something to feel better about, and with this project, we can feel like we are doing something. It\u2019s very therapeutic.\u201dThe group has finished about 600 hats, no small feat considering that each hat takes around three hours to make. Many people have come to learn how to knit just so they can be involved.Wanting to make sure everyone has a hat, Ms. Barraclough has made a few of her own. She even dragged her chef out of the kitchen and taught her to knit so she could make them as well.\u201cMy friend was like, \u2018You can\u2019t just sit there and knit, you have to run your shop,\u2019\u201d Ms. Barraclough said. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018It\u2019s O.K.

If people need the hats, we will give them the hats.\u2019\u201dDigitally crafty New Yorkers have gotten involved as well.Lauren Bugeja, a user experience designer at a large tech firm in New York, noticed that people were using a public Facebook page to request free rides and places to stay for the march.\u201cEven if it just helps one extra person get to the march, and it helps them be more civically active, then I will be fully satisfied,\u201d said Ms. Bugeja, who worked on the project over her holiday break and still spends up to three hours a day revising it, in addition to working full time.\u201cThe message is there are a lot of us out there and we are united,\u201d Ms. Hagler said.\u201cIt\u2019s about the physicality of it, about people getting out, people getting on buses and holding posters,\u201d said Ms. McGuire, who alluded to populist sentiments and aesthetics that helped get Mr. Trump elected.\u201cI went upstate and saw barns that were painted with Trump signs, and in my mind, I was like, whoever painted this barn took so much effort to paint it for him,\u201d she said. \u201cI was thinking all my friends just changed their profile picture. Their commitment was that much stronger.\u201dMs. Bugeja said the march was about people becoming civically active, not about doing what was trendy.\u201cI feel like all we are doing is working,\u201d she said. \u201cOur heads are down and we are trying to get whatever we can done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementJanuary 11, 2017Kelly McBrideTom ScoccaBuzzFeed did the right thing when it chose to publish the dossier of unverified allegations about Donald Trump's supposed entanglements with Russia. Some experts on media ethics were quick to argue otherwise this morning. This kind of second-guessing generally proceeds from the underlying premise that journalistic ethics is some set of straightforward rules about right and wrong, which, when dutifully followed, will reliably produce good journalism. This is a deeply useless approach. Any decision to publish any piece of reporting involves balancing competing principles and coming to a conclusion that fits the subject matter, the broader context and the publication's own mission and appetite for risk. This case, in particular, is a good reminder of the fact that the flip side of deciding to publish something is deciding not to publish something. But journalists are rarely called to account for their errors of omission. Multiple news organizations reportedly had their hands on the Russia dossier for weeks, and before yesterday, even as the circle of public officials who deemed it a serious concern kept widening, none of those media outlets could figure out how to share it. Now the untouchable story has become a matter of open discussion, whether the ultimate scandal turns out to be about Trump's alleged conduct, his relations with Russia, his feud with the intelligence services or some combination of all of those. Follow-up reporting is helping the public sort through the dossier's claims. BuzzFeed's decision was the key to all of this.Judgments about what and how and why to publish vary from publication to publication, and that variation is healthy and productive. What CNN and BuzzFeed executed last night was a classic high-low interaction: CNN reported that the dossier existed and that it was of great public importance; BuzzFeed produced the dossier. CNN's vagueness was redeemed by BuzzFeed's specificity, and BuzzFeed's risk-taking was justified by CNN's testimony about the ultimate news value. Sometimes the transaction simply goes from low to high: A less respectable outlet publishes a story, and the subject of the story responds, and the subject's response becomes a fact in the world that is safe for judicious publications to discuss in the open. Thus this morning's Times was liberated to discuss \"sex videos involving prostitutes with Mr. Trump,\" or, more precisely, reports of memos describing those sex videos. Journalism is a rude business and we live in rude times. Blind appeals to principle won't make things any nicer, but they could make things worse. \nBy publishing an unverified report alleging the Russians have compromising information on President-elect Donald J. Trump, BuzzFeed made it less likely that truth will be journalists' only goal and less likely that when the truth surfaces,  the public will believe it. In his news conference on Wednesday morning, Trump conflated the work of BuzzFeed and CNN, although they were very different forms of reporting. He started by complimenting all the newsrooms that did not post the document, criticizing those who did without initially naming them, and suggesting that the reason for keeping it out of public view is because it is \u201cfake news.\u201dTo the untrained eye, it looked like he was making friends with the media by patting them on the back for doing the right thing by ignoring that ludicrous rumor that the Russians have a sex tape.Here\u2019s what really happened: BuzzFeed posted the dossier, noting that it was unverified and even highly problematic,  about two hours after CNN began informing its viewers that the report existed, who had seen it and what the possible implications were to Trump\u2019s ability to run the country.Those are two distinct acts, with BuzzFeed merely showing its cards to the public, and CNN trying to build context and meaning through reporting and analysis. But by lumping the two newsrooms together, Trump was able to cast the shadow of doubt on all the reporting that journalists are doing on the dossier. Now, anyone who might have been genuinely curious about the truth has reason to stop listening. If you hate Trump, you automatically assume it\u2019s true. And if you love him, you assume this is one more example of unfair reporting.Had BuzzFeed taken a different approach, the story today would be that senior intelligence officials were concerned enough about the report to brief the outgoing and incoming president. The follow-up stories would address how America\u2019s senior most leaders were responding.Instead, BuzzFeed said it wanted to give its readers the opportunity to decide for themselves. So now we\u2019re all engaged in a charade of Spy Kids, trying to determine if the information is likely true or false.  Yet average citizens don\u2019t have the tools to sort through these claims. But the most damaging result of BuzzFeed\u2019s unfortunate decision is Trump\u2019s newfound weapon to dismiss all journalists who criticize him as unfair and unethical. In painting the entire news media as a caricature of BuzzFeed, he undermines the efficacy of solid reporting and legitimate criticism. The president-elect is doing his best to diminish the role of journalism in our democracy. He doesn\u2019t need any help."}

Xiaomi grew quickly in China by selling cheaper smartphones with premium features, initially only online. It has had mixed success outside China, however. At home, it faces rising competition from big, deep-pocketed rivals like Huawei Technologies and other scrappy upstarts like the Chinese brand OnePlus.In a note about his resignation on Facebook, Mr. Barra, who joined Xiaomi in 2013, called his time there \u201cspectacular\u201d and said that he was moving on for personal reasons.\u201cBut what I\u2019ve realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health,\u201d he wrote, adding that he was moving back to Silicon Valley to be closer to friends and family.Bryan Ma, an analyst at IDC, said that Mr. Barra\u2019s departure was a blow to the company and that it called into question the future of Xiaomi\u2019s fledgling overseas business.\u201cThe question is, Who will replace him? Will that person be as effective an ambassador?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing fine in India, but what happens for everything else? Where does this all sit in the grand plan they had several years ago to expand to a bunch of markets?\u201dXiang Wang, a veteran of Qualcomm who has led Xiaomi\u2019s supply chain and intellectual property rights teams, will take over Mr. Barra\u2019s responsibilities and lead Xiaomi\u2019s global business, Xiaomi said. Mr. Barra did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Barra, the vice president responsible for Xiaomi\u2019s global division, presided over international expansion. Unlike China\u2019s other major internet companies, Xiaomi made an early decision to expand beyond China\u2019s borders, targeting markets like India, Myanmar and Brazil.Mr. Barra, a widely recognized name in the tech world, was often the public face of that expansion. Orchestrating product releases in new markets and acting as an ambassador, he often gave talks in local markets to build buzz.Xiaomi has done relatively well in India, which accounted for about 18 percent of the company\u2019s total phone shipments in the third quarter of 2016, according to IDC.In other markets it has been less successful. For instance, after a high-profile release of its phones in Mr. Barra\u2019s home country of Brazil in 2015, the company has not been able to establish a significant beachhead there.Competition has intensified in China from Huawei, OnePlus, Lenovo Group Limited and other companies getting into the handset business. From the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016, Xiaomi\u2019s market share in China dropped to 8 percent from 16 percent, according to IDC.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Plans on Businesses May Fall Short", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump said Wednesday that he would place his vast business empire in a trust controlled by his two oldest sons and take other steps in an attempt to remove any suggestion of a conflict of interest with his decisions as president. But he said he would not sell his holdings.Hours later, the government\u2019s top ethics monitor said the plan was wholly inadequate and would leave the president vulnerable to \u201csuspicions of corruption.\u201dThe steps Mr. Trump outlined include turning over to the United States Treasury any profits received at his hotels from foreign government clients. An ethics officer and, separately, a chief compliance counsel will be appointed at the Trump Organization to watch its operations and ensure that it is not receiving special terms, payment or favors as a result of its ties to Mr. Trump, even as the organization is managed by a trust controlled by his two oldest sons and a longtime legal associate.Mr. Shaub made clear that he believes Mr. Trump's plan for avoiding the appearance of conflicts of interest as president is inadequate.In addition, she said, the price of a sale of assets would draw scrutiny, and Mr. Trump would still be owed royalties.The president-elect, speaking at a news conference Wednesday in Trump Tower, repeated his view, expressed shortly after his election, that as president, he will be exempt from conflict of interest laws that apply to all other federal employees except the vice president. But he and his legal team said he would still take voluntary steps to avoid even a perception of a conflict, such as the appearance that a decision he made as president might benefit one of his business ventures.Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives also would not release the names of people who stand to benefit from any profits the trust generates, or say whether Mr. Trump would be able to reverse the transaction. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump rebuffed a renewed call to release his tax returns, which presidents have done for decades and which would show how much profit he makes from his business endeavors, including golf courses, marketing deals and commercial office space.\u201cWe can\u2019t risk creating the perception that government leaders would use their official positions for profit,\u201d said Mr. Shaub, whose office establishes ethical standards for 2.7 million civilian employees in the White House and more than 130 executive branch agencies. \u201cI appreciate that divestiture can be costly. But the president-elect would not be alone in making that sacrifice.\u201dDonald J. Trump\u2019s global business empire will create an unprecedented number of conflicts of interest for a United States president, experts say.He criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to put his assets into a trust instead of under the far stricter control of an independent manager, known as a blind trust.\u201cThe only thing this has in common with a blind trust is the label, \u2018trust,\u2019\u201d Mr. Shaub said during an unusual news conference Wednesday at the Brookings Institution, a policy research center in Washington. \u201cHis sons are still running the businesses, and, of course, he knows what he owns.\u201dEven some Republican ethics experts questioned how far Mr. Trump had gone to confront the many ethical issues he faces. They noted, for example, that Mr. Trump had not promised to prohibit communication between federal employees and anyone at the Trump Organization, or his current or future business partners.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a real firewall, outsiders will view doing business with the Trump Organization as a way to gain access to the administration or to influence it,\u201d said Matthew T. Sanderson, a Washington lawyer who worked on the Republican presidential campaigns of John McCain, Rand Paul and Rick Perry.Now, his legal team said, this standard will apply only to foreign deals. Ms. Dillon said the Trump Organization had canceled about 30 pending deals, costing it millions of dollars. But the company will continue to look for new business opportunities \u2014 be it hotels, golf courses or other ventures \u2014 within the United States at a time when the Trump Organization brand has an unrivaled profile.Instead, the Trump enterprise will clear new transactions with an ethics adviser to be named by the president-elect in the coming days. That person will vet the deals for potential conflicts, using a standard that Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers said had not yet been determined. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump said he had always intended the \u201cno new deals\u201d promise to apply only to foreign deals.He has consistently used his position to showcase his real estate properties, inviting dignitaries and cabinet hopefuls to visit him at his golf club in Westchester County, N.Y., and his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.And the business offers have been flowing in, Mr. Trump says. His lawyers said his company had canceled 30 deals as he prepares to take office, and last weekend, Mr. Trump said he had turned down a $2 billion deal in Dubai.\u201cI don\u2019t want to take advantage of something,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The Dubai offer came from Damac, a major developer in the Persian Gulf region that is building the Trump International Golf Club, Dubai, and an adjacent luxury housing development.Ms. Dillon, the Trump Organization lawyer, who works for the Washington firm Morgan Lewis, said the clause, in her view, did not apply to market-value transactions such as a foreign government\u2019s paying a hotel bill. But to address the issue, the organization plans to donate to the federal government the \u201cprofits\u201d derived from any payments from foreign governments to hotels it owns. Representatives of the organization did not reply when asked how this calculation would be made or whether a public accounting of the payments would be provided.But Trump Organization officials said this agreement would not apply to golf courses or other businesses. That means Mr. Trump could still benefit from payments by foreign governments, critics said.Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law, also said the plan to turn over profits from foreign government payments to Mr. Trump\u2019s hotels was not sufficient to eliminate the constitutional issue.\u201cAs soon as he receives the payment, he will have benefited, even if he later decides to give it away,\u201d Mr. Chemerinsky said. \u201cThis will mean he will have violated a provision of the Constitution.\u201dBut ethics experts said the family might have figured out a way to accelerate the growth of their business while taking modest steps to separate themselves from the day-to-day operations.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine anything she could do to help the brand more than simply being a part of the White House apparatus,\u201d Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a liberal nonprofit, said of Ivanka Trump. \u201cThe only solution for all of this is for them to divest \u2014 and that does not include handing it to another family member.\u201dSusanne Craig reported from New York, and Eric Lipton from Washington.

It supports paid family leave; anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans; access to affordable reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion; an end to the use of military-style weapons and tactics by the police in minority communities; a living minimum wage; immigration reform, with a path to citizenship; and protection of the environment and public lands.None of these goals are particularly radical.

{"Headline": "Troops Who Cleaned Up Radioactive Islands Can\u2019t Get Medical Care", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byRICHLAND, Wash. \u2014 When Tim Snider arrived on Enewetak Atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to clean up the fallout from dozens of nuclear tests on the ring of coral islands, Army officers immediately ordered him to put on a respirator and a bright yellow suit designed to guard against plutonium poisoning.A military film crew snapped photos and shot movies of Mr. Snider, a 20-year-old Air Force radiation technician, in the crisp new safety gear. Then he was ordered to give all the gear back. He spent the rest of his four-month stint on the islands wearing only cutoff shorts and a floppy sun hat.\u201cI never saw one of those suits again,\u201d Mr. Snider, now 58, said in an interview in his kitchen here as he thumbed a yellowing photo he still has from the 1979 shoot. \u201cIt was just propaganda.\u201dToday Mr. Snider has tumors on his ribs, spine and skull \u2014 which he thinks resulted from his work on the crew, in the largest nuclear cleanup ever undertaken by the United States military.Roughly 4,000 troops helped clean up the atoll between 1977 and 1980. Like Mr. Snider, most did not even wear shirts, let alone respirators. Hundreds say they are now plagued by health problems, including brittle bones, cancer and birth defects in their children. Many are already dead. Others are too sick to work.The military says there is no connection between these illnesses and the cleanup. Radiation exposure during the work fell well below recommended thresholds, it says, and safety precautions were top notch. So the government refuses to pay for the veterans\u2019 medical care.Congress long ago recognized that troops were harmed by radiation on Enewetak during the original atomic tests, which occurred in the 1950s, and should be cared for and compensated. Still, it has failed to do the same for the men who cleaned up the toxic debris 20 years later. The disconnect continues a longstanding pattern in which the government has shrugged off responsibility for its nuclear mistakes.But in the months since the report, nothing has been done to help them.Documents from the time and interviews with dozens of veterans tell a different story.Records show that protective equipment was missing or unusable. Troops requesting respirators couldn\u2019t get them. Cut-rate safety monitoring systems failed. Officials assured concerned members of Congress by listing safeguards that didn\u2019t exist.And though leaders of the cleanup told troops that the islands emitted no more radiation than a dental X-ray, documents show they privately worried about \u201cplutonium problems\u201d and areas that were \u201chighly radiologically contaminated.\u201dTying any disease to radiation exposure years earlier is nearly impossible; there has never been a formal study of the health of the Enewetak cleanup crews. The military collected nasal swabs and urine samples during the cleanup to measure how much plutonium troops were absorbing, but in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, it said it could not find the records.A tally of 431 of the veterans by a member of the group shows that of those who stayed on the southernmost island, where radiation was low, only 2 percent reported having cancer. Of those who worked on the most contaminated islands in the north, 20 percent reported cancer. An additional 34 percent from the contaminated islands reported other health problems that could be related to radiation, like failing bones, infertility and thyroid problems.Between 1948 and 1958, 43 atomic blasts rocked the tiny atoll \u2014 part of the Marshall Islands, which sit between Hawaii and the Philippines \u2014 obliterating the native groves of breadfruit trees and coconut palms, and leaving an apocalyptic wreckage of twisted test towers, radioactive bunkers and rusting military equipment.Four islands were entirely vaporized; only deep blue radioactive craters in the ocean remained. The residents had been evacuated. No one thought they would ever return.In the early 1970s, the Enewetak islanders threatened legal action if they didn\u2019t get their home back. In 1972, the United States government agreed to return the atoll and vowed to clean it up first, a project shared by the Atomic Energy Commission, now called the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense.So federal officials decided to collect radioactive debris from the other islands and dump it into the Runit crater, then cap it with a thick concrete dome.Safety planners intended to use protective suits, respirators and sprinklers to keep down dust. But without adequate funding, simple precautions were scrapped.Paul Laird was one of the first service members to arrive for the atoll\u2019s cleanup, in 1977. Then a 20-year-old bulldozer driver, he began scraping topsoil that records show contained plutonium. He was given no safety equipment.\u201cThat dust was like baby powder. We were covered in it,\u201d said Mr. Laird, now 60, during an interview in rural Maine, where he owns a small auto repair shop. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t even get a paper dust mask. I begged for one daily. My lieutenant said the masks were on back order so use a T-shirt.\u201dBy the time Mr. Laird left the islands, he was throwing up and had a blisterlike rash. He got out of the Army in 1978 and moved home to Maine. When he turned 52, he found a lump that turned out to be kidney cancer. A scan at the hospital showed he also had bladder cancer. A few years later he developed a different form of bladder cancer.His private health insurance covered the treatment, but co-payments left him deep in debt. He applied repeatedly for free veterans\u2019 health care for radiation but was denied. His medical records from the military all said he had not been exposed.\u201cWhen the job was done, they threw my bulldozer in the ocean because it was so hot,\u201d Mr. Laird said. \u201cIf it got that much radiation, how the hell did it miss me?\u201dAs the cleanup continued, federal officials tried to institute safety measures. A shipment of yellow radiation suits arrived on the islands in 1978, but in interviews veterans said that they were too hot to wear in the tropical sun and that the military told them that it was safe to go without them.Every evening, Air Force technicians scanned workers for plutonium particles before they left Runit. Men said dozens of workers each day had screened positive for dangerous levels of radiation.\u201cSometimes we\u2019d get readings that were all the way to the red,\u201d said one technician, David Roach, 57, who now lives in Rockland, Me.None of the high readings were recorded, said Mr. Roach, who has since had several strokes.The veterans\u2019 only avenue for help is to apply individually to the Department of Veterans Affairs for free medical care and disability payments. But the department bases decisions on old military records \u2014 including defective air sampling and radiation badge data \u2014 that show no one was harmed. It nearly always denies coverage.\u201cA lot of guys can\u2019t survive anymore, financially,\u201d said Jeff Dean, 60, who piloted boats loaded with contaminated soil.Mr. Dean developed cancer at 43, then again two years later. He had to give up his job as a carpenter as the bones in his spine deteriorated. Unpaid medical bills left him $100,000 in debt.\u201cNo one seems to want to admit anything,\u201d Mr. Dean said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer we can wait, we have guys dying all the time.\u201dAn article last Sunday about medical problems among soldiers who cleaned up the fallout from nuclear tests on Enewetak Atoll misstated, in some editions, the type of cancer that one service member, Paul Laird, learned he had after turning 52. It was kidney \u2014 not testicular \u2014 cancer. An accompanying picture caption also misstated Mr. Laird\u2019s age in some editions. As the article correctly noted, he is 60, not 59.Advertisement"}

Mr. Mehlman will volunteer part of his time to the new board, which is recruiting other members who will also serve in a part-time capacity.\u201cYou can make change, but in order for it to be sustainable, you need to build a movement to support it,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview. \u201cNo amount of private research or philanthropy is going to shift that. At the end of the day, the government has far more resources than any individual organization does.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Chan, who live only a few miles from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s office in Palo Alto, Calif., are regularly involved in its direction and major decisions.

{"Headline": "How Alexa Fits Into Amazon\u2019s Prime Directive", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyWhen \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation\u201d first aired in the 1980s, it envisioned a number of technological advances for humankind\u2019s future. Set in the 24th century, the show featured 3-D printers, visors that could provide artificial sight and a virtual reality simulator called the holodeck. But perhaps its most prescient creation was the supercomputer onboard the ship. The software \u2014 usually referred to only as \u201cComputer\u201d \u2014 could locate people, open doors and retrieve answers to complicated questions. Crew members spoke their requests, and an always-present helper responded within seconds.Amazon brought a version of that computer to life recently \u2014 albeit a few centuries earlier than \u201cStar Trek\u201d predicted. Last July, David Limp, a company executive who works on the product, said in an interview with Fortune that the idea of an all-knowing machine, with access to all the world\u2019s information, had captured his imagination since the first time he saw it on television. It took, he said, a team of 1,000 engineers to write its code, and when the device was finished, Amazon decided to call it Alexa, shorthand for Alexandria, as in the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt. It is designed to work primarily with a suite of wireless speakers, also made by Amazon, called Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.The company bills Alexa as a smart personal assistant, one that can play your favorite song or read you a book or recite a recipe as you cook. You can also make purchases through Amazon simply by asking. The possibilities are seemingly endless, because Alexa can learn new \u201cskills\u201d (as Amazon likes to call them) from third-party developers who integrate Alexa into their own products. And developers have leapt at the opportunity to do so: At the beginning of 2016, there were 135 skills designed to work with Alexa, but this year that number increased to more than 7,000. Alexa can now order you an Uber or a pizza, check your bank balance, control your TV, turn your lights on and off and even measure your car\u2019s carbon-dioxide emissions. \u201c\u2009\u2018Alexa, buy me coffee\u2019 is just a fraction of what it\u2019s going to be over time,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an internet analyst who covers Amazon for the equities firm Macquarie Securities. \u201cWhat can they improve with the voice activation? Some of that has yet to be seen.\u201dAlexa has already evolved from an experimental device to an irresistible household fixture \u2014 perhaps surprisingly, given Amazon\u2019s spotty track record with hardware. Kindle e-readers are popular, but the company\u2019s attempt at a smartphone flopped hard. Schachter told me that part of Alexa\u2019s success was luck, in that there were few other shiny consumer offerings on the market this holiday season and the price point was affordable. But something about the future-feel of this device, its ease and convenience, has captivated a mass audience, even the most privacy-conscious among us. Alexa is always listening, ready to be of service. (This has already backfired: When a newscaster relayed a story about a little girl using her Alexa to order a dollhouse, it triggered dozens of Alexas in the homes of people watching the broadcast to also try to order one.)Five years ago, few would have guessed that Amazon would already be ahead of the top tech companies vying to be leaders in home automation. But Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of the company, has been shaping this vision since the earliest days of Amazon. I recently revisited \u201cThe Everything Store,\u201d a 2013 book by Brad Stone about how Bezos transformed the start-up from an online bookstore into the e-commerce behemoth it is today. \u201cBezos\u2019 long-term goal is to sell everything, everywhere,\u201d Stone writes. \u201cHe will attempt to move faster, work his employees harder, make bolder bets and pursue both big inventions and small ones, all to achieve his grand vision for Amazon \u2014 that it be not just an everything store, but ultimately an everything company.\u201dThe fact that I live in New York, a city that thrives on accessibility, might explain why I was slow to grasp the appeal of Alexa. Here we have bodegas on every corner, most open 24 hours, in case you need to pick up a roll of toilet paper or a bottle of hot sauce in the middle of the night. But most Americans don\u2019t live with the luxury of that immediacy. I didn\u2019t really understand this until the holidays, when I went home to visit my mom in Virginia and we ran out of seltzer. Carbonated water is not an essential item. But in that moment, it would have been easier to quickly tell Alexa to place an order for us and forget about it until it arrived two or three days later, rather than try to remember to pick up a case of Poland Spring the next time someone made the 20-minute drive to the store. That\u2019s the entire enticing promise of Amazon and Alexa: a much more efficient and manageable life, one in which you can outsource mundane tasks while you do something more important, like spend time with your family.It\u2019s not hard to imagine that Alexa might be displaced as rivals introduce their own efforts. Facebook is working on an intelligent assistant, called Jarvis (named for the smart computer that helps Tony Stark, or Iron Man, navigate his surroundings), as is Microsoft. There are rumors that Apple is working on a major update for Siri. Google is currently Amazon\u2019s closest competitor. The company has spent decades organizing the world\u2019s information and learning about our habits and preferences in the process, so that it will one day know what we want even before we do. Search, then, will evolve away from the actual act of searching to the act of surfacing. The company is working on a version of artificial intelligence called Google Assistant to perfect that very ability.But while Google is working to anticipate your needs, Amazon is readying itself to be the only place you need to go to fulfill them. Thinking about Amazon\u2019s restraints \u2014 the company has never tried to introduce a social network or an email service, for example \u2014 you can understand something about the future Amazon seems to envision: A time when no screen is needed at all, just your voice.Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of CB Insights, a trend-forecasting start-up in New York, told me that Amazon has something that its competitors only dream of \u2014 consumer attention and trust. \u201cIn the last few years, Amazon has become the search engine for consumer products, instead of Google,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to buy something, and you already have an Amazon account, you\u2019re probably going to just buy it there. With Google, you still have to go to Amazon or Walmart.\u201d Amazon is investing in supply trailers, drones and fulfillment centers to develop its own postal service and delivery system. And it\u2019s still pushing its Dash buttons, those small pieces of hardware with one purpose: to order a single item from Amazon, like laundry detergent or dish soap. They seem unnecessary, until you consider them with all of Amazon\u2019s other efforts: It\u2019s not just an everything store, or even an everything company, but an everywhere (and anytime!) store.The various products that Amazon is planning to roll out \u2014 including Pantry and Fresh, its grocery service \u2014 can be easily baked into default Alexa services. Restaurants, the company\u2019s version of Seamless, already is. All this in turn brings in more money for Amazon. As Limp put it back in July: \u201cThe nice thing about the Amazon device business is that when we sell a device, generally people buy more bluejeans. And little black dresses. And shoes.\u201dThere\u2019s a theory that behavioral economists use to explain our consumption habits called \u201chyperbolic discounting,\u201d which is the tendency to choose short-term rewards over long-term gains. The \u201cmarshmallow test\u201d of the 1960s tested the ability of preschoolers to resist temptation \u2014 the titular marshmallow, within reach \u2014 with the promise that they would be rewarded with two if they waited. In the experiment\u2019s most popular interpretation, those who had self-control grew up to be much more successful than those who did not. It is one of the most formative studies in self-control and how people make decisions. Alexa is the ultimate marshmallow test, and most of us are failing. We are being conditioned, as a population, to never wait, to never delay our gratification, to accept thoughtless, constant consumption as the new norm. But how we think about consumption and willpower carry enormous implications for the environment and the culture of society as a whole. Think about that the next time you ask Alexa to order you another roll of toilet paper.An article on Jan. 29 about Alexa, Amazon\u2019s home assistant, misstated the total number of marshmallows offered to subjects of the \u201cmarshmallow test,\u201d which measured the ability of preschoolers to delay gratification. If the subjects could resist the temptation of a single marshmallow, they were rewarded with one more \u2014 not two more.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Editors\u2019 Note AppendedIn remote western Nepal, where the Himalayas brush the sky, girls spend their childhoods as they have for generations, dreading growing up. Puberty starts a monthly exile. An entrenched, superstitious practice linked to Hinduism, Chaupadi, considers menstruating women impure and bad luck, rendering them untouchables. Menstruating women are banished, often to forests where they sleep in crude, cubbylike sheds or caves, braving extreme weather and lurking predators, from snakes to rapists. There they stay as long as their periods last, several days a month, and they must do this for 35 to 40 years. Rarely \u00e2\u0080\u0094 usually only when death strikes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 does this practice, outlawed by Nepal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Supreme Court in 2005, make the news. Last month, a 15-year-old girl choked to death on smoke after lighting a fire in her menstrual hut to keep warm, just weeks after a 21-year-old woman died the same way. Their deaths generated headlines for perhaps a day. Ms. Basu spent three years, from 2013 to 2016, documenting women during their monthly confinement, to reveal the dangers and hardships Chaupadi creates in poor farming villages. The portraits, landscapes and details in her Nepal portfolio, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Ritual of Exile,\u00e2\u0080\u009d offer a narrative of Chaupadi that leaves the viewer both stunned and engaged by the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plight.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Ritual of Exile\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows the jarring reality of women boxed into tiny holes amid wild, lush nature, a landscape usually associated with beauty, freedom and adventure. The portraits bare the sorrow the women endure, usually in silence. Raised to accept their condition without complaint, the women have told Ms. Basu of travails that repeat themselves year after year. She has documented stories of women and girls abducted and raped; bitten by snakes; mauled by jackals; starved for days; prostrated by heat; burned by warming fires. They have told her of cases of kidnapping and murder. In addition to meeting menstruating women, Ms. Basu has encountered women in confinement just after childbirth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also considered impure \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in huts with their babies. She has witnessed a young girl beaten by a healer after seeking help for fever and pain during her period. (The girl\u2019s presence, Ms. Basu was told, might make her house catch fire, attract hungry tigers to the livestock or sicken anyone nearby.)  Ms. Basu has watched women scramble for dry rice thrown at them from afar. She has met women forced into prison-style hard labor, such as breaking rocks for use in roads or chopping and hauling firewood for long distances through harsh terrain.Chaupadi, while extreme, rang a bit familiar to Ms. Basu, who grew up Hindu in Calcutta, India. After puberty, she was prohibited from attending religious festivals or entering the kitchen while menstruating. Nor was she allowed to pursue creative passions or see the world. Not until her father died, when she was 17, could she leave her limited, working-class environment and pursue life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possibilities. Eventually, after teaching herself photography using her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old Nikon FM2, Ms. Basu earned a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in art at the London College of Communication. In 2012, she was awarded the Magnum Foundation Human Rights scholarship at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. The honor validated her love of photography and her passion for social justice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Ritual of Exile,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which she finished with help from the Magnum Emergency Fund Award and the Prince Claus Fund, was a finalist for the W.

At 10 a.m. on a dank January day here, there weren\u2019t many puffer-jacketed tourists browsing, let alone buying its framed \u201cStar Wars\u201d posters (8 pounds, or about $10, each), handbags shaped as puppy heads (\u00a330 each) or Banksy fridge magnets (\u00a34 each, or three for \u00a310).Twenty years ago, this grandly named emporium was an arcade with 200 antiques dealers. It is now one of eight arcades owned by the Portobello Group, the area\u2019s biggest private landlord, and has been turned into an open-plan gallery selling mass-produced souvenirs. This all-too-typical transformation of one retail outlet encapsulates the dramatic changes and challenges that the entire mile-long market on the Portobello Road has faced in recent years, caught between the dwindling interest in antiques and rising business costs.Now officially in its 152nd year, the market is open daily, with antiques traditionally the main draw on a Saturday. It is in one of the last enclaves of relative scruffiness in the otherwise exclusive Notting Hill district of London.\u201cThis place is about tourism,\u201d said Marion Gettleson, 70, whose family shop, Delehar Antiques, was established in 1919.Nonetheless, more of Portobello\u2019s hundreds of indoor and outdoor retail units have been given over to \u201cnew goods,\u201d such as Scottish knitwear, amber jewelry and London-themed souvenirs.The 1996-97 \u201cGuide to the Antique Shops of Britain\u201d listed more than 700 active dealers in the Portobello Road arcades. Mark Atkinson, the markets development officer for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which includes Portobello Road, put the current figure at 300 to 400.\u201cAntiques make Portobello distinct from other destination street markets in London, like Brixton, Camden and Brick Lane,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said.\u201cThe Lonely Planet guide told us it was a typical place to visit in London,\u201d said Fred Eral, 43, a chemical worker from France, who was visiting with friends.By noon, solitude is hard to come by as the selfie-taking crowd flows northward up Portobello Road toward the stalls where Hugh Grant\u2019s character bought vegetables in the movie \u201cNotting Hill.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an atmosphere here,\u201d said Lyndon Grady, 54, a dealer in rare and secondhand books. Ms. Grady said she was happy to cater to the tourists pouring past her stall, which displayed hardback editions of Jane Austen, \u201cWinnie-the-Pooh\u201d and \u201cJust William\u201d stories. \u201cI sell a lot to Americans and Chinese,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Chinese love poetry.\u201dMs. Grady\u2019s space costs her \u00a355 for the day. By 11 a.m. on a recent Saturday, she said she had already covered that expense with \u00a370 of sales.\u201cToday is very dead. The people just look and go,\u201d said Sahin Sheikh. His stall specializes in wooden iPhone covers, priced at \u00a310 each. Nearby, another street trader was trying to sell a Picasso-style ceramic plate.\u201cThere\u2019s certainly a segment that\u2019s basically a tourist trap,\u201d said Mr. Atkinson, the markets development officer.Despite these issues, he said he remained optimistic about the market\u2019s future.Mr. Todd of the Portobello Group did not respond to requests for comment. His son, Ryan Todd, principal of the Portobello Group, said in an email that \u201c\u2018new goods are of course a problem.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe do our best to ensure we opt for quality where possible, but quality demand has dwindled of late, and with increased costs to consider, we operate a business and occasionally have to make difficult decisions.\u201d He added that the relentless rise in London\u2019s business taxes, soon to increase again in the Portobello area, was a major issue.However, traders said some antiques dealers were giving up because the market was overrun by tourists and by counterfeit wares.\u201cA lot of dealers are annoyed they\u2019re surrounded by fakes,\u201d said Matthew Holder, 25, one of the younger dealers with a booth in the antiques-filled basement area of the Admiral Vernon arcade, owned by the Portobello Group. \u201cBut where else is there to go in London that\u2019s still affordable?\u201d Mr. Holder specializes in medieval and Renaissance objects.\u201cIt is getting harder,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s less trading between dealers, and the big dealers don\u2019t really come to the market anymore.\u201d But he maintains that he would never give up Portobello. \u201cI don\u2019t just want to do Instagram and fairs,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to get here at 5 a.m. on a Saturday morning.

{"Headline": "What Do They Want? Graeme Wood Speaks With Supporters of ISIS", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In early 2011, as American forces were packing up to leave Iraq after eight years of fighting and occupying, one of the war\u2019s most hideous byproducts was lurching toward what appeared to be certain death: Al Qaeda in Iraq, which had recently renamed itself the Islamic State in Iraq, had seen most of its leaders killed and its membership whittled to a handful of dead-enders, who were huddled in sanctuaries in and around the northern city of Mosul.But then the Americans departed, and a vast uprising against the government across the border, in neighboring Syria, took off. Suddenly, the Islamic State in Iraq, led by an ambitious former graduate student who called himself Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saw its fortunes brighten anew. Baghdadi dispatched a handful of fighters to Syria and within a few months they were running operations across much of the country. Iraq promptly returned to chaos, and in April 2013, Baghdadi, presiding over a vast fief that stretched from the Iraqi desert to the outskirts of Damascus, rechristened his group yet again \u2014 as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS \u2014 and appointed himself caliph. Tens of thousands of volunteers from around the world flocked to defend his far-off kingdom in the sand.In the years since, ISIS\u2019 breathtaking lust for anarchy \u2014 temple-smashings, beheadings, crucifixions \u2014 has inevitably prompted the question: What do these people want? The usual answers \u2014 money, power, status \u2014 do not seem to suffice. Graeme Wood, a correspondent for The Atlantic and a lecturer at Yale, believes he has found something like an answer, and that it can be located in the sacred texts, teachings and folklore of early Islam. In \u201cThe Way of the Strangers,\u201d Wood, through a series of conversations with ISIS enthusiasts, shows that many of them claim to want the same thing: a theocratic state without borders, ruled by a leader who meets a series of strict qualifications, and who adheres to a brand of Islam that most people \u2014 including most Muslims \u2014 would find stifling and abhorrent.The most novel aspect of Wood\u2019s book is that he shows, convincingly, that the stifling and abhorrent practices of the Islamic State are rooted in Islam itself \u2014 not mainstream Islam, but in scriptures and practices that have persisted for centuries. There\u2019s no use denying it. \u201cFor years now, the Islamic State and its supporters have been producing essays, fatwas, .\u2008.\u2008.\u202ffilms and tweets at an industrial pace,\u201d Wood writes. \u201cIn studying them we see a coherent view of the world rooted in a minority interpretation of Islamic scripture that has existed, in various forms, for almost as long as the religion itself.\u201d That goes for the most barbarous practices as well: \u201cSlavery has been practiced by Muslims for most of Islamic history, and it was practiced without apology by Muhammad and his companions, who owned slaves and had sex with them.\u201dWood has obviously studied the old Islamic texts. And he makes clear, in the conversations he has with Islamic State supporters, that they have, too. The value of \u201cThe Way of the Strangers\u201d is that it gives the lie to the notion, repeated so often in the West as to become a clich\u00e9, that ISIS zealots are betraying Islam, and that their practices are un-Islamic. They are Islamic, and in that sense, the end-state of their murderous program is not hard to discern.The Islamic State, such as it is, is a dangerous place, and Wood\u2019s book amounts to a tour around its far edges, where it can be safely traversed. And so we sit down with Hesham Elashry, a suit tailor in Cairo who tries to convert Wood to his Salafist ways. We meet Yasir Qadhi, a Houston-born scholar who abandoned his hard-line views and earned a Ph.D. at Yale. We tag along with Wood as he travels to Footscray, Australia, to meet a jihad-minded young man named Musa Cerantonio, who writes about ISIS on Twitter and Facebook, and who follows an obscure strain of doctrinaire Islam, popular in the Islamic State, known as Dhahirism. And we trace the path of John Georgelas, a.k.a. Yahya Abu Hassan ibn Sharaf, a native of Plano, Tex., who rebelled against his middle-class upbringing, converted to Islam and made the pilgrimage to Syria in 2013 to join the Islamic State; he was wounded soon after and since then has been one of the group\u2019s chief propagandists. Together, Wood\u2019s conversations amount to a thorough discussion of the theological underpinnings of the Islamic State.Still, while \u201cThe Way of the Strangers\u201d has its moments, I often found myself wondering how useful all this theology really is. The first problem with Wood\u2019s argument is the people he has chosen to speak for ISIS; with the exception of Georgelas, whom Wood did not meet, none of the characters featured in his book have actually fought for, or even joined, the Islamic State. They are fellow travelers, whose zealotry has not brought them to join the group they claim to support. Cerantonio, the Australian, lives with his mother. Elashry, the tailor, complains that he is \u201ctoo old\u201d to travel to Syria or Iraq. While I sympathize with the obvious logistical challenges involved in trying to sit down with real-live ISIS theologians, the armchair quality of the people Wood features here can make his discussions feel abstract. If the subtitle of your book is going to be \u201cEncounters With the Islamic State,\u201d then you owe it to your readers to get closer than London or Footscray.That leads to another, broader problem with Wood\u2019s discussion. Is religion really that important to these people? Wood does not discount the presence of \u201cdullards and goofballs\u201d in the movement, but he is adamant that Islam is at the heart of the engine that drives not just the Islamic State\u2019s leaders, but also its fighters. \u201cThe foot soldiers view their mission in religious terms and spend great energy on piety and devotion.\u201dAssessing human motives is always a tricky game, even when we are trying to decipher our own. While I don\u2019t deny that Islam provides the framework within which ISIS operates, describing the group as essentially a bunch of religious fanatics strikes me as simplistic. My own experience in the Muslim world, and especially in Iraq, was that the motivations for joining a militant organization were varied and complex. Some fighters joined because they hated a rival group \u2014 Shiites, say. Others took up arms because they were seeking revenge for a wrong done to their family \u2014 by the American Army, say. Still others became militant because doing so offered them an unparalleled chance to rob, rape and kill. Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, who founded Al Qaeda in Iraq \u2014 ISIS\u2019 precursor \u2014 was a thug and a gangster who used Islam to justify what he was doing anyway.Did Mohammed Emwazi, the British-born Muslim who became known as \u201cJihadi John\u201d for personally beheading Western hostages, really join ISIS to get closer to God? Groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS have always struck me as primarily death cults: Murder first, pray later. All the better if you can find sacred texts to justify your actions, of course. But murder just the same.Dexter Filkins, a former Baghdad correspondent for The Times, is a staff writer at The New Yorker and the author of \u201cThe Forever War.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sticker Shock, and Maybe Nausea, Hamper Sales of Virtual Reality Gear", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For a technology to crack the mainstream, there is an unspoken understanding: It shouldn\u2019t make the people who use it want to throw up.And yet there was a reminder, at last week\u2019s International CES trade show in Las Vegas, of how far virtual reality has to go until everyone is ready to fasten 3-D goggles to their faces. At a news conference, Intel, the chip maker, provided virtual reality headsets to about 250 attendees so they could watch a 3-D video from the perspective of sky divers hurtling out of a helicopter in wingsuits. Intel also passed out motion sickness bags to everyone, in case anybody felt inclined to vomit, an unfortunate side effect of turbulent virtual reality experiences for some people.Laura Anderson, an Intel spokeswoman, said the company had provided the bags \u201cout of an abundance of caution and to be tongue in cheek about our immersive experience.\u201d No one used the bags, she said.It is time for a reality check for virtual reality, one of the most hyped technologies of last year. Sales of the most capable headsets have been sluggish by most estimates, held back by high costs, a lack of must-have content, and the complexity and awkwardness of the products. Less expensive mobile headsets that use smartphones as their screens are selling better, but are far more limited in what they can do.\u201cThis is going to be a long slog, as the technology continues to improve, more content becomes available and awareness increases,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research.That deal sparked a wave of start-ups creating products for virtual reality and a related technology called augmented reality, which overlays digital imagery on a view of the real world, as seen through smartphones and headsets. Last year, $1.48 billion was invested in start-ups in that category, compared with $331 million the prior year, estimated Pitchbook, a financial data firm.Many of those start-ups were funded before major headsets went on sale to the public. Entrepreneurs raising money in the future are likely to encounter tougher questions about what kind of use their products are getting.\u201cAll the major headsets have launched \u2014 the numbers are coming in,\u201d said Alex Rosenfeld, the founder of Vrideo, a start-up that acted as a YouTube-like hub for virtual reality videos. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have some companies here that don\u2019t survive. If the industry is going to continue to attract dollars, there\u2019s going to have to be real numbers.\u201dThe companies that make the major headsets do not report their sales, and all of them said they were pleased with the results so far. SuperData Research, a technology research firm, estimated that Oculus had sold 360,000 headsets and HTC 450,000 since their products went on sale in March and June, respectively. Both of those headsets require high-end PCs with powerful processors.The firm estimated that Sony, which began selling a virtual reality headset in October, has sold about 750,000. Sony\u2019s headset was seen as a potentially big boost to the virtual reality industry because it is less expensive than rival headsets and relies on a PlayStation 4 console, more than 53 million of which have already been sold.A bundle with the PlayStation VR headset and specialized controllers sells for $500, while comparable bundles from HTC and Oculus sell for just under $800 each. Less expensive Sony and Oculus headsets are available without controllers designed for virtual reality. Still, the Sony sales were fewer than SuperData and others had expected.\u201cThe holidays were pretty disappointing for many in the industry,\u201d said Doug Renert, a venture capitalist with Tandem Capital. \u201cI\u2019m not all that surprised.\u201dIn a bright spot, Samsung said last week at CES that is had shipped more than five million of its Gear VR headsets, which act as a cradle for a mobile phone, with lenses that create a 3-D image from the phone\u2019s screen. Samsung often runs promotions in which it gives away a headset with the purchase of a Samsung smartphone.Price drops on technology are likely to be a big factor in mainstream acceptance of virtual reality. Starting Monday, a company that makes gaming PCs, CyberPower, will begin selling a $499 computer that can play virtual reality content when used with an Oculus headset. That is hundreds of dollars less than the normal cost.Ergonomic challenges with virtual reality headsets are likely to take longer to overcome. The more powerful headsets must be tethered by thick cables to PCs or consoles, which can tangle up players\u2019 legs when these rigs occlude their view of the real world.\u201cWith wireless, V.R. will be ready for the mass market,\u201d said Mykola Minchenko, chief executive of Sixa, which plans to sell its adapter for $200.Mr. Renert, the venture capitalist, said his firm had invested in several start-ups working in virtual reality, including Sixa, despite slow sales of headsets, though the companies are working on technologies in other categories, too. He is confident that virtual reality will one day be a mainstream technology, comparing its evolution to touch-screen devices from Apple that were flops and hits.\u201cWe\u2019re not at the Newton stage, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at iPhone stage,\u201d Mr. Renert said.Advertisement"}

Perhaps best of all, when a train is inevitably delayed, a rider can check the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s website for an explanation.\u201cAll the other stations have it too, and I\u2019m loving it,\u201d Yolanda Hung, 35, a nail stylist, said as she downloaded a list of appointments to her phone at the Whitehall stop in Lower Manhattan.\u201cThis is a frill,\u201d David Gurin, 76, a retired city transportation official, said as he waited for a train at the newly connected station at Fourth Avenue and Ninth Street in Brooklyn. \u201cGood, regular, frequent subway service is far more important than having cellphones.\u201dBeth DeFalco, a spokeswoman for the authority, said officials were, in fact, working to improve subway service, noting that the authority\u2019s $29.5 billion capital plan would pay for new signals and other upgrades.\u201cFree Wi-Fi and cell connectivity underground doesn\u2019t come at the expense of service improvements for riders,\u201d Ms. DeFalco said in a statement.The authority and Transit Wireless are currently testing technologies to bring Wi-Fi and cell service to subway tunnels too, Ms. DeFalco said.At the Ninth Street subway station in Brooklyn on a recent morning, a countdown clock was installed above the platform but not yet turned on. A woman sat on a bench using the station\u2019s new cell service to chat on her phone. Samantha Lopez, a nonprofit executive in her 40s, was reading a print copy of the novel \u201cSweetbitter.\u201d She said she preferred to read on the subway and would only occasionally use cell service.\u201cI\u2019m worried a little about all the noise if people are talking all the time \u2014 the cacophony of all these voices together,\u201d she said.More than a third of the subway runs aboveground, and subway riders have long been able to use their cellphones on those parts of the system. A team of professors and dozens of students from Hunter College studied subway behavior and found that riders were more likely to use mobile devices aboveground, where they have had reliable service.Mike Owen Benediktsson, an assistant sociology professor involved in the study, said hardly any riders talked on their phones, even when they had service on trains running aboveground, because of the unwritten etiquette rules of the subway.\u201cIt reflects the social norm of preserving your own privacy and respecting the privacy of others in a public space,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to change immediately just because the technology is changing.\u201dAnother Brooklyn subway rider, Camille Francis, 23, said she would use the new service to play music on Spotify and to immediately alert her friends when she sees rats on the tracks \u2014 a ritual they call \u201csqueaky sightings.\u201d And now she can also use Google Maps to find a new route if her train is delayed.\u201cBefore, I\u2019d have to try to read the map and feel slightly archaic like I\u2019m Nicolas Cage in \u2018National Treasure,\u2019\u201d she said in reference to the film about the hunt for a treasure map.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young Symbol of Afghan Resilience Joins List of Lost Leaders", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Abdul Ali Shamsi had already covered a lot of ground before he moved to Kandahar Province to become deputy governor a year and a half ago.On Tuesday, Mr. Shamsi, 38, became a victim of the kind of violence he had helped others withstand, killed along with 10 other people when explosives placed within the Kandahar governor\u2019s guesthouse detonated during a reception for visiting Arab officials.The attack in Kandahar this week seemed expressly aimed at breaking down the cause that Mr. Shamsi and his colleagues were dedicated to: trying to restore faith in government after years of devastating war and disappointing failures. Among the dead were an Afghan senator and a member of Parliament, five officials from the United Arab Emirates and an Afghan envoy to the United States, according to officials. Eighteen others were wounded.The governor of Kandahar, Humayoon Azizi, and the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates, Juma Mohammed Abdullah al-Kaabi, were among the wounded, but their injuries were not considered life-threatening, said Gen. Abdul Raziq, the security chief of Kandahar Province.The president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, said in a statement that the officials were in Kandahar \u201cto carry out humanitarian, educational and development projects.\u201d He ordered flags to be flown at half-staff for three days of mourning in his country.The explosions in Kandahar capped a bloody day in Afghanistan. A bombing targeted a meeting of militia commanders in the Helmand provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, killing from seven to 11 people, according to various Afghan officials. Hours later, a double bombing that was claimed by the Taliban killed at least 38 people and wounded 86 others outside the Parliament during the early evening rush hour.Even by the standards of Kandahar, which has a long history of officials and elders being targeted in complex attacks over the years, the extent of the security breach raised questions. To get to the governor\u2019s guesthouse requires passing through multiple security checks, and measures were so tight on Tuesday before the dignitaries\u2019 visit that, according to one official, Mr. Shamsi\u2019s own car was even searched.General Raziq said that an intense investigation into the attack was starting, and that the national security adviser was coming to Kandahar to lead the effort. In an interview, the police commander said the guesthouse had been under construction for months, with about three dozen workers coming to the site each day, raising the possibility that explosives could have been smuggled in that way.\u201cWe have detained several people who were working there, and they are under investigation,\u201d General Raziq said.\u201cI wasn\u2019t finished with my prayers when the loud explosion occurred,\u201d General Raziq said. \u201cIt shook the whole building, blew out the windows, and the entire hall was in flames that were out of control.\u201dMany of the bodies were burned beyond recognition, Afghan officials said. And despite the government\u2019s formally declaring Mr. Shamsi among the dead, his brother, Fazal Bari Shamsi, said the family had yet to receive the body, which was awaiting DNA testing for identification.On Wednesday, tributes poured in after it was confirmed that Mr. Shamsi was among the dead. President Ashraf Ghani was described as openly grieving, remaining solemn through his morning meeting with aides and describing Mr. Shamsi\u2019s death as a profound loss for the country.\u201cThis unfortunate and poor nation had such need for you,\u201d wrote Baryalai Helmand in a Facebook post about Mr. Shamsi. \u201cThe martyrdom of youth like you breaks our back.\u201dShaharzad Akbar, who was one of the founding members of Afghanistan 1400 along with Mr. Shamsi, posted another emotional tribute.\u201cHe always gave us morale \u2014 in the hardest days he was hopeful, and in the darkest moments patriotic,\u201d Ms. Akbar wrote. \u201cHe was more experienced than most of us. With me, a much younger girl with much less experience, he would interact with such respect that it would put me to shame.\u201dThe political group found itself developing a side specialty in trying to rebuild after violence. When a gruesome massacre took place in western Farah Province, Mr. Shamsi was among the group of young leaders who traveled to the province to console the residents of the shaken city. As the most experienced of the lot, having dealt with death and violence during his years in Helmand and the American troop surge, he often took the lead in those kinds of delegations.One of Mr. Shamsi\u2019s first acts on the job the day he became deputy governor in August 2015 was to visit the elderly father of his assassinated predecessor, Abdul Qadeem Patyal, to pay his respects. Dawa Khan Meenapal, then the provincial director of culture in Kandahar and currently a deputy spokesman for Mr. Ghani, was with him.\u201cIt was the atmosphere of a funeral, especially after Patyal\u2019s children came to the room,\u201d Mr. Meenapal said about the visit. \u201cThe two deputy governors before him had been martyred. Shamsi knew that working in Kandahar meant being mentally prepared for that.\u201dMujib Mashal reported from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar.

{"Headline": "The Youth Group That Launched a Movement at Standing Rock", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "FeatureIn the fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline, Native American activists achieved one of the most galvanizing environmental victories in years \u2014 and it all began with a group of teenagers.Supported byJasilyn Charger was 19 when she learned her best friend had killed herself. Charger was Lakota Sioux, and she had left the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota for Portland, Ore., just a few months earlier. But in the summer of 2015, she flew home for her friend\u2019s funeral. Then, two days later, while she was still in Eagle Butte \u2014 the largest town on the Cheyenne River Reservation with a population of 1,300 \u2014 another friend killed herself. Charger was shocked. \u201cIt hurt all of us because these were people who we thought we knew but really we had no idea what they were going through,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really woke us up.\u201dIn the weeks that followed, more teenagers on the reservation killed themselves with belts, knives and handfuls of Benadryl. Native American teenagers and young adults are 1.5 times as likely to kill themselves as the national average, with suicides often clustering in epidemics that hit and fade. Suicide is so common on the reservation that Lakota youth don\u2019t bother to say \u201ccommitted suicide\u201d or \u201cattempted suicide.\u201d They just say \u201cattempted\u201d or \u201ccompleted.\u201d By the end of that summer, Jasilyn told me, 30 Cheyenne River kids attempted and eight completed.\u201cWe said, \u2018They committed suicide for a reason,\u2019\u2009\u201d Charger told me. In Eagle Butte, reasons weren\u2019t hard to find. Their elders liked to talk about them as the future, but no one seemed to pay much attention to how their lives were hard, bordering on hopeless. Cheyenne River kids had families struggling with poverty and parents and relatives with serious drug-abuse problems. Often there was violence at home, to the point that many youths had nowhere safe to go at night. And amid all this, there was a hard-edged social pressure to drink or use drugs.Charger had seen all of this. Her father died before she was born; her mother, she said, \u201cpaid the bills and drank.\u201d She and her twin sister, Jasilea, were incredibly close even if, by 13, they were also perfect foils: Jasilea, willowy and bookish, a good student; Jasilyn, chubby and wild, cutting school and running away on the weekends to do odd jobs \u2014 mowing lawns, babysitting, breaking horses, selling weed \u2014 that helped put food on the table. But her mother called her in as a runaway one too many times, and the South Dakota Division of Child Protection Services took both girls, sending them to group homes on opposite sides of the state.\u201cIt felt like something had been sawed off,\u201d Charger said about her separation from Jasilea. She got so depressed she was moved to a psychiatric unit, where she often got into fights. She aged out of the system at 17, but when she returned to the ranch developments and trailer parks of Eagle Butte, she struggled with depression. She and Jasilea had gone \u201cfrom knowing everything about each other to being strangers.\u201d She fell into a monthslong cocaine binge, crashing in abandoned cars with other homeless kids. Her weight had dropped to 80 pounds by the time that her cousin, Joseph White Eyes, intervened. \u201cHe would say, \u2018You\u2019re killing yourself, and we need you,\u2019\u2009\u201d Charger recalled. \u201c\u2009\u2018Don\u2019t get high, let\u2019s go to a sweat.\u2019 He got me off drugs and into our culture.\u201d She eventually found a job in Rapid City on the production team of the local Fox News affiliate but quit, she said, after her boss made one too many \u201ccowboys and Indians\u201d jokes in response to Native Americans\u2019 being shot by the police. In early 2015 she moved to Portland, as far away as she could get. She hadn\u2019t intended to return.But now she was home, amid a new plague of suicides, and she wanted to do whatever she could to help other teenagers on the reservation. Together with White Eyes and their friend, Trenton Casillas-Bakeberg, she formed a youth group. They raised money for basketball tournaments and for a youth trip to the Red Nation Film Festival in California, where the kids were able to see the ocean for the first time in their landlocked lives. They went to the tribal council, demanding and getting funds for a safe house for young people. Most of all they counseled young people, urging them to look out for one another and get involved. \u201cYeah, it looks all pretty on Facebook,\u201d Charger remembered saying, \u201cbut really, what\u2019s going on in real life? You can be busy getting on Snapchat while someone\u2019s getting bullied.\u201dAs the suicide wave crested and broke, the youth group, now called the One Mind Youth Movement, turned to something more political. They spent that fall as part of the local campaign against the Keystone XL pipeline, whose route would cut under the Cheyenne River just upstream from the reservation that bears its name. And after the Obama State Department denied the Keystone XL permission to cross the U.S.-Canadian border in November 2015, they moved their focus to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where the company Energy Transfer Partners was trying to build the Dakota Access Pipeline. That pipeline would move half a million barrels of oil a day beneath the Missouri River, the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux, which is one of the cousin bands to Cheyenne River, as well as for other downstream Sioux reservations. The youths came to believe that the Dakota pipeline was not only a threat to their drinking water but also a harbinger of the larger environmental crisis their generation was set to inherit.Last April, Charger, White Eyes and a few One Mind teenagers and mentors helped establish a tiny \u201cprayer camp\u201d just off the Dakota Access route, on the north end of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Over the next six months that camp grew into an improbable movement that united conservative farmers with the old radicals of the American Indian Movement; urban environmentalists with the traditional chiefs of hundreds of tribes. As Donald Trump pushes forward with the Keystone XL and Dakota Access, he will face a movement emboldened by a victory on Dec. 4, 2016, when the Department of the Army denied an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline and directed the Army Corps to consider an alternate route. It was a rare triumph for both the environmental and land rights movements, as well as for the American left in an otherwise dark moment. But little remarked upon at the time was the unlikely seed from which the movement had grown: an anti-suicide campaign among a tight-knit group of youths, most younger than 25, impelled by tragedy and guided by prophecy.Those days, the temperatures were in the 30s and there was still snow on the ground. The youths dubbed the camp Sacred Stone and lit the sacred fire. At first, they lived on little more than bologna sandwiches, potato chips and water. But then residents from the small reservation town of Cannon Ball, up the hill from Sacred Stone, began to bring donations: leftovers from dinner, cut-up wooden corrals for the campfires, a chain saw. Life in the prayer camp was supposed to be lived \u201cin ceremony,\u201d a sort of mindfulness or religious retreat in which all things are done with the intention of maintaining purity. Days began with a water ceremony; the sacred fire had to be regularly fed; meals began with prayer and a \u201cspirit plate\u201d served for the ancestors; alcohol and drugs were strictly forbidden.It was, in other words, the sort of safe place that the youths had been insisting was necessary for them. They needed a haven, Charger explained, to \u201cregroup, figure out what you\u2019re going to do and not worry about where you\u2019re gonna sleep.\u201d The previous fall, they rented a hotel room in Eagle Butte as an informal crash house for Cheyenne River youth, where sometimes as many as 20 teenagers stayed, sleeping and showering, safe from bullying or the lure of alcohol or drugs. The prayer camp at Standing Rock provided something similar. Members of One Mind would drive home every week to resupply and pick up youths who wanted to experience the camp.For Charger and other leaders, as important as the idea of the safe space was the idea that activism would teach children the skills to survive more immediate threats, like bullying and drug abuse. They hoped to pass on skills at the camp that they themselves had been taught by Keystone activists in their community. During the long campaign against the Keystone XL, groups like the Indigenous Environmental Network (I.E.N.) helped set up a \u201cspirit camp\u201d on the Cheyenne River Reservation, about 50 miles southwest of Eagle Butte, where activists prayed and taught the surrounding communities about civil disobedience. The I.E.N. paid for One Mind members to be trained as organizers \u2014 they sent Charger to Washington and White Eyes to network with aboriginal climate activists in Australia \u2014 and the teenagers and young adults were exposed to ideas and training that linked the pipeline fight to larger struggles in their society. Every direct-action training against the Keystone XL, for example, referenced the prophecy of the black snake, a figure out of Lakota myth that in recent times has been identified with pipelines. But it has a more general meaning: \u201cIt symbolizes a darkness, a sickness, whose only intention is to sow dysfunction and loss of life in our communities,\u201d said Dallas Goldtooth, an I.E.N. organizer who worked with Charger and other One Mind members. The message was clear: The struggle against the pipeline was part of the same struggle against alcoholism, suicide and abuse.After weeks at the Standing Rock camp with minimal tribal support, the young people decided that they needed to carry out some sort of public action. \u201cIt was important to make the adults see that if you\u2019re going to sit there and argue, we\u2019re gonna go wake up our brothers and sisters,\u201d Charger said. Bobbi Jean Three Legs, a young mother and long-distance runner from Standing Rock who had become active in the camp, had a vision. Her daughter woke her one night to ask for water, and she suddenly saw a day when, thanks to water pollution, there would be no water to give. Soon after that, she and White Eyes proposed a 500-mile relay run from the Sacred Stone Camp to Omaha to deliver a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers, asking it to deny the Dakota Access Pipeline permission to cross the Missouri River. The I.E.N. began a social-media campaign announcing the run and organized a blitz of calls and letters from tribal members on various reservations.Within days, far sooner than expected, an Army Corps representative from the Omaha district agreed to meet with members of the tribe. To some, this meant the youths could call off the run. But they insisted on going ahead. Not only did they still want support from the tribal council; they had also begun to believe that this run could bring together young people from all the Sioux reservations. The seven bands of the people commonly known as the Sioux had organized themselves in the Oceti Sakowin, or \u201cthe Seven Council Fires,\u201d a tribal republic that spread out over a vast area, including the Dakotas, Minnesota, Kansas and Nebraska, until federal campaigns forced its members onto the scattered, tiny reservations they occupy now. One Mind saw water as an issue that could unify all Oceti Sakowin youth. And their run had rich cultural resonance: Before Europeans brought horses, long-distance messenger runners held the scattered tribes of Oceti Sakowin together. Three Legs, White Eyes and Charger mapped a route to pass through as many reservations as possible. The run would use a traditional method in which a messenger ran a short distance, about a mile, and then rested while another runner took his or her place. It allowed people who were not very good runners, like Charger, to go on a long-distance run.Three Legs insisted on bringing someone from each of the nine Oceti Sakowin bands, and the run quickly brought in people from reservations that hadn\u2019t been involved with the Standing Rock camp. Daniel Grassrope, now 25, came from the Lower Brule, a band whose reservation lay down the Missouri from Cheyenne River. Grassrope, the second-youngest boy of 13 children, grew up disgusted by the abuse and dysfunction around him, \u201cracist,\u201d he said, \u201ctoward my own people.\u201d As a child, he dreamed of being taken away from his family and adopted by whites, something he associated, vaguely, with having his own bedroom and a mother who came to his basketball games. He was getting wasted every night when he saw Three Legs\u2019s Facebook posting asking someone to represent the Lower Brule on the run.The run immediately gave him what Standing Rock would later give many other youths: a sense of purpose he had been lacking. It also inspired something more radical, in a way, than antipipeline activism: the belief that a group of lost people from scattered nations could still find kinship. Grassrope wrote to Three Legs immediately. \u201cI had been praying for something like this,\u201d he said.By then time seemed to be running out: The Army Corps of Engineers was still considering the Dakota Access Pipeline\u2019s permit, and the Tribal Council still wasn\u2019t offering much support. On July 9, through a video released on YouTube, Bobbi Jean Three Legs and several other runners announced an even more ambitious action: a run that would cover 2,000 miles to Washington, where they would deliver a petition to the Army Corps\u2019 headquarters. \u201cWe need your help,\u201d a young woman says in the video. Another woman, with glasses and a long black braid, says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be traveling through many of your towns.\u201d On July 15, 30 runners set out from Sacred Stone, adding more as they made their way along their route. Jasilyn Charger\u2019s estranged twin sister, Jasilea, was one. She was in bed asleep when Jasilyn, passing through Cheyenne River, ran into their house, threw her clothes into a bag and urged her onto their support van. Over the course of the next week or so, a dozen more joined.But on July 26, the runners learned the Army Corps of Engineers had approved the Dakota Access pipeline easements. The black snake was on its way. The runners decided to carry on to Washington, but the focus shifted back to the camp, as I.E.N. activists at Standing Rock urged people via Facebook messages to rise to the standard set by the youths. Across the great archipelago of North America\u2019s Indian reservations and urban communities, people took notice. They loaded cars and buses and camper vans with donations and headed for Standing Rock.Twenty-six-year-old Eryn Wise moved to the camp in late August, at the beginning of what organizers called the big boom, when the population spiked from dozens to thousands. A native of Minneapolis, Wise was raised by her grandmother on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation after a suicide attempt at 11. On the reservation, she was picked on for excelling at school but was surrounded by her siblings, with whom she formed a close bond. But she returned to Minneapolis when she was 16 to care for her mother. When she read an article about the youth run she felt a pull and quit her job. She found her twin siblings, Alex and Lauren Howland, already at the camp.Wise arrived just as the elders began to claim more control over the movement the youths had started. The run, Goldtooth told me, had forced their support by transforming the Dakota Access pipeline from a regional Lakota issue into an international one. Standing Rock council members began to visit the camps and pay for emergency services, propane and portable toilets. The camp had expanded onto the floodplain across the river, and grass-roots activists and members of the unelected traditional leadership, which serves as a sort of parallel Oceti Sakowin government, erected a Council Lodge, a large tepee from the tribe\u2019s past that the young people had only heard about. The Council Lodge was the traditional meeting place of the Oceti Sakowin in the 19th century, when the bands would gather on the Plains. The Council Lodge tepee at Standing Rock was a sign of a new political awakening, as the traditional chiefs and medicine men collaborated with grass-roots organizers \u2014 the youth and other Native American factions that had joined \u2014 to restore the old, unified tribal republic. It was part of a larger move toward formalizing the prayer camps under a council government. By then, the protests against the pipeline had, for the traditional leadership, become about far more: They had become a long-prophesied end to history.The black-snake, prophesy said, would only be overcome by the Seventh Generation, which would rise up and, as Charger explained, \u201cbring balance to the Earth. Not just to its people. To the Earth.\u201d Many of the youths that I spoke with took this to mean the Seventh Generation had a sort of messianic role to help restore order, on behalf of all beings, to a world thrown out of balance by modernity and greed.\u201cThe Seventh Generation is almost clich\u00e9 in Indian communities,\u201d Goldtooth, the I.E.N. organizer told me. Anyone born between 1980 and the 2000s, he said, \u201chears about it constantly. The hope that our generation will see a significant shift toward community renewal and nation building and the reminder that our communities expect big things of us.\u201d The Seventh Generation tracks roughly with millennials of all races, but they share their own unique history. The generation between Goldtooth, 34, and Charger, now 20, is the first to have grown up free to be Indian. They are familiar with their ancestors\u2019 scars but also fluent in mainstream American culture.\u201cI don\u2019t blame my mom,\u201d Charger told me. \u201cHer mother was murdered.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThe abuse lives in our blood.\u201dCharger was referring to Native American history, not just what happened on the frontier but also in more recent decades. After federal campaigns reduced the Oceti Sakowin in the late 1800s, there were nearly 100 years of calculated assault as the state tried to force Native Americans to assimilate. The unified nation of Oceti Sakowin was broken into widely separated reservations, and after Congress privatized reservation land, many starving Lakota families had to sell off their property to white farmers, further cutting the size of reservations. The U.S. Government banned the Sundance, the Plains religions\u2019 most sacred ceremony, with its days of fasting and ritual bloodletting; Native Americans could no longer openly practice their religions. But perhaps most devastating to their psychological health were the boarding schools, in which generations of Indians were sent to schools to be taught white culture. This system reached its nadir in the forced assimilation campaigns of the 1940s and 1950s, when the grandparents of many of the I.I.Y.C. youths were taught English literally under the lash.At Standing Rock, the youths felt they were developing the means to overcome that trauma. The key, as Charger explained it, was to let their history go, which they took as an almost holy responsibility: Forgive, and then take action to spare those who are coming in the future. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our children to inherit this depression,\u201d she said. The remarkable thing about this philosophy was that it was deeply practical: not just forgiving \u201cthe white man\u201d but also the parent who beat you. For many, this provided a means to re-establish difficult relationships with parents or siblings. But it also helped bind them together into their own sort of family.In the final months of 2016, the camps at Standing Rock grew to more than 10,000, filling with indigenous peoples from hundreds of nations, climate-change activists, members of the Rainbow Family and Burning Man communities and those who simply felt a call. By that point, the role of the I.I.Y.C. had become a sort of advance guard, taking risks and pushing actions forward and winning new young converts to the cause.Thomas Tonatiuh Lopez Jr. was one. A 24-year-old Lakota and Latino from Denver, Lopez grew up the child of AIM and Chicano activists, and as the adopted grandson of the powerful medicine man Leonard Crowdog. He came to Standing Rock in September on a supply run and hadn\u2019t intended to stay. Once he found himself at the camp, Lopez was touched by the message of activism and reconciliation. One afternoon, he was sitting with I.I.Y.C. members, rolling cigarettes for everyone in front of a fire, as Charger talked about the role of youth. \u201cShe said one thing that stuck with me: Who better to speak for the past than the voice of the future?\u201d He thought about it as he drove home to Denver, and when he got there, he helped establish a local I.I.Y.C. chapter, drawing from local indigenous and Latino youths. In mid-November, the group took hundreds of Denver high-school students for a march through downtown to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline. Another new chapter, in Chicago, galvanized hundreds for Thanksgiving events that drew in members of other activist groups, including Black Lives Matter, which resulted in black community medics going to serve in Standing Rock\u2019s volunteer medical corps.One factor that helped recruitment into the regional chapters and Standing Rock was the increasing violence by the police at the camps. The images of campers being maced or attacked by dogs spread anger across the country, and many brought that anger to Standing Rock. For traditional leadership, any violence was deeply concerning. Part of the matrix of prophecy that underlies their movement is the idea that should the Oceti Sakowin or their allies resort to violence, they could be wiped out. Among the Native Americans there were strict rules that the protest would have to be done in \u201cpeace and prayer.\u201dThe youths took this seriously, even as they found themselves under physical threat. Wise, the camp mom, remembers, for instance, watching on Facebook Live as her sister was maced. Furious, she raced to the scene and threw herself at the police. Suddenly there were six hands on her shoulders: I.I.Y.C. members, pulling her back. She saw her brother Alex, his face white with what appeared to be war paint. \u201cHe was pointing over my shoulder and shouting, \u2018We\u2019ll pray for you, we\u2019ll pray for you!\u201d His face, she realized, was covered in tear gas, \u201cand he was still praying for them. That brought me back.\u201dThe youths also tried to reach out to the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department, which in the larger camp had come to be seen as the enemy. After the Army Corps of Engineers withdrew permission for the camp in late November, protesters expected the sheriff\u2019s department to violently clear campers off the land. But on Dec. 2, when the department posted on Facebook soliciting donations of granola bars, fruit soda and socks, the I.I.Y.C. showed up with large plastic containers filled with granola bars, warm clothing and water. Lopez, who had returned to the camp to stay in October, made a speech: \u201cThough you have brutalized us, we will not brutalize you.\u201d The station was on lockdown; after a while, an officer looking sheepish in his helmet, faceplate and full body armor, opened the door and accepted the containers. From the crowd, someone yelled for Lopez to explain to the officer why they hadn\u2019t brought soda. Lopez half turned. \u201cWe want you to be healthy!\u201d he yelled. \u201cMni wichoni! Water is life!\u201dIt was a small gesture, but one that prompted thanks from the officers and anger from some in the camps. \u201cWhy are you supporting them?\u201d Wise remembers people asking. But prophecy was important to the youths; they worried that if the movement became too violent, it would ruin everything they had been trying to build.But the youths didn\u2019t want to go home. For them, leaving was more complicated. They thought that the \u201cvictory\u201d was too tentative. Energy Transfer Partners had announced it would ignore the Army\u2019s decision, and the election of Donald J. Trump had put into office a president who vocally supported both the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines. \u201cDave Archambault doesn\u2019t speak for our entire generation,\u201d Jasilyn Charger said. \u201cWhen he dies, my grandchildren are going to be here, and nobody can speak for them but me.\u201dThere was also a more personal problem. Many of them had nowhere else to go. They had become dependent on the I.I.Y.C. for a support network and a place to live. Over their months spent in close quarters, the members of the youth council had bound themselves together not only as friends but as family. The stakes of dissolving the group had become obvious in a more immediate way, too: One of the youth runners had already attempted suicide and been rushed to the hospital in Bismarck. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for them to stay here,\u201d Wise told me in mid-December, as temperatures remained below zero and the ground was covered with ice. \u201cBut I also don\u2019t want that to happen to any of these kids.\u201dAs the camps emptied out, though, there were not enough resources for everyone to stay, and most of the young people dispersed for the winter, leaving behind a skeleton crew of 10. Wise went home to Minneapolis to begin a job as an organizer for Honor the Earth, an indigenous environmental activist group. Grassrope went back to Lower Brule. Charger was couch-surfing with friends in Eagle Butte. Tribal leaders of the Cheyenne River had found a property for the youth safe house that One Mind had fought for, but progress had stalled, and life for the reservation\u2019s youths was as hard as it had been before. But the I.I.Y.C. were in the process of setting up a 501(c)(3), a nonprofit organization that would allow them to establish some formal order to what had been an ad hoc group.And in January, after a month apart, the I.I.Y.C. youths reunited in Washington for the mass protests against Donald Trump. They were still in Washington when the news came that he had signed executive orders allowing the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines to proceed. After that, Jasilyn Charger made the trip back to Standing Rock. She planned to spend a couple of days there before heading south to Eagle Butte, where she would organize against the Keystone. \u201cMy sole purpose,\u201d she said, \u201cis to create for the youth what we did in Standing Rock at my home in Cheyenne River. To really challenge the youth in my community to follow in the lead of Standing Rock to fight for their own people, because if they don\u2019t, this black snake will not die again.\u201dAll believed their work had to spread, not because they necessarily believed they could stop the pipeline but because the movement had connected, as Lopez told me, \u201cyouths who would otherwise never have had much interaction.\u201d He offered a practical reason as well: In December, back home in Denver, he got a call from a young person on the verge of suicide. He felt helpless, but he stayed on the phone, \u201clistening to hear, not listening to respond. All I could do was say: \u2018You are loved, someone cares about you, not necessarily right where you are, but in your community at Standing Rock. Even if you feel no one loves you, no one cares about you, I love you, I care about you. I want to pray with you again. And if you kill yourself now, I won\u2019t be able to do that.\u2019\u2009\u201dHe paused. \u201cAnd my brother is still alive today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Anti-Inauguration", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byThe inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States is just two weeks away, so now is the time to begin making plans to send him the strongest possible signal that your opposition to the presidency he has foreshadowed will not be pouting and passive, but active and animated.Now is the time to begin making your plans for the anti-inauguration.Exclaiming your resistance, while necessary, is insufficient. Resistance is a negative position. While negativity in the face of this menace is justified and admirable, negativity alone is a fractional response. As with most things in a fully articulated life, balance is required. You need to augment your outrage with actions that are affirming, behaviors that reinforce principles and values.When politics seem out of your control, remember that community and culture are very much in your control. We help shape the world we inhabit every day. A life is a collection of thousands of decisions, large and small, made every day. Make those decisions with purpose and conviction, especially for Jan. 20.The point is not necessarily to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power, but rather to deprive it of oxygen and eyeballs; to plant a flag of resistance firmly at the opening gate. This doesn\u2019t mean that people won\u2019t attend or watch. They will. But every station that carries it, as many will, should feel the impact of your absence.Just because succession of power in our fragile democracy isn\u2019t denied by dictator or compelled by coup does not mean that the majority of Americans who voted for someone other than Trump, and view his ascension as an offense, should feel any pressure or compunction to bear witness to the pomp and pageantry surrounding the installation of a demi-fascist and full-blown demagogue as president.This ceremony is part of a governmental apparatus meant to project a picture of seamless continuity and normalcy to Americans and the world.But making Trump appear normal is contingent on public cooperation, which must be denied.Here are some ways to make your opposition felt and bring forth some light on the impending Day of Darkness.Protest.Volunteer.If you can\u2019t travel to Washington or if there are no protests being organized in your area, volunteer at an agency or nonprofit that serves a community or advocates on an issue that has been directly targeted by the incoming president. These range from women\u2019s rights, to civil liberties, to immigrant outreach, to environmental protection.Donate.If you can\u2019t find a way to volunteer, donate. These groups will need as much funding as possible to defend themselves and their positions from a hostile administration and compliant Congress.Subscribe.Coming from me this may sound self-interested, but please try to look over my obvious and admitted conflict to see that the press, even with all its flaws \u2014 particularly those exposed during this election \u2014 is one of the last lines of defense against corruption and a slide toward autocracy. Trump\u2019s hostility to, and delegitimizing of, the press is a deliberate tactic meant to shield him against future discovery and disclosure.\u201cIf Donald Trump is trying to inoculate himself in advance, it\u2019s like giving himself a vaccine, to prevent the illness that\u2019s going to come when the media turn on his tax returns if they get another leak on it, when they look at some of the business dealings as he\u2019s talking to foreign leaders. There are all kinds of stories that you can imagine, that have already been written, some of them, and what he\u2019s trying to do here is, as I say, sort of inoculate himself by demonizing media. So, don\u2019t believe anything they say.\u201dRead.Watch.\u201cA group of entrepreneurs have banded together to create Love-a-thon, a Jerry Lewis-style telethon for the digital age. Love-a-thon will be a three-hour Facebook Live broadcast, beginning at 12:30 p.m. E.T. on Inauguration Day, January 20. The move is a part of an effort to raise money for three organizations \u2014 the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, Planned Parenthood and Earthjustice.\u201dWrite.Connect.Reach out to your friends and family \u2014 the people in what I call your \u201cgreat sphere of influence.\u201d First, let them know that you love them. This may seem mawkish, but in the wake of Trump\u2019s hateful rhetoric, expressions of love and support are necessary. But beyond that, make sure that they too have an anti-inauguration plan. If they don\u2019t, have them join you in yours. Also, make sure that everyone in your sphere is registered to vote.You have the power to make anti-inauguration day an enormously effective first step on the path forward through an arduous four years, which promise to be difficult to navigate. Affirmative actions must be as much your guide and solace as resistance is your fuel and fire.Remember your pre-Trump ideals and make sure that they survive into a post-Trump world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Peter Thiel, Trump\u2019s Tech Pal, Explains Himself", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byWith ... Peter ThielLet others tremble at the thought that Donald J. Trump may go too far. Peter Thiel worries that Mr. Trump may not go far enough.\u201cEveryone says Trump is going to change everything way too much,\u201d says the famed venture capitalist, contrarian and member of the Trump transition team. \u201cWell, maybe Trump is going to change everything way too little. That seems like the much more plausible risk to me.\u201dMr. Thiel is comfortable being a walking oxymoron: He is driven to save the world from the apocalypse. Yet he helped boost the man regarded by many as a danger to the planet.\u201cThe election had an apocalyptic feel to it,\u201d says Mr. Thiel, wearing a gray Zegna suit and sipping white wine in a red leather booth at the Monkey Bar in Manhattan. \u201cThere was a way in which Trump was funny, so you could be apocalyptic and funny at the same time. It\u2019s a strange combination, but it\u2019s somehow very powerful psychologically.\u201d\u201cI was thinking, \u2018I hope this doesn\u2019t look too weird on TV,\u2019\u201d he says.I ask if he had to twist arms to lure some of the anti-Trump tech titans, like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.\u201cI think, early on, everybody was worried that they would be the only person to show up,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cAt the end, everybody was worried they would be the only person not to show up. I think the bigger tech companies all wanted to get a little bit off the ledge that they had gotten on.\u201cNormally, if you\u2019re a C.E.O. of a big company, you tend to be somewhat apolitical or politically pretty bland. But this year, it was this competition for who could be more anti-Trump. \u2018If Trump wins, I will eat my sock.\u2019 \u2018I will eat my shoe.\u2019 \u2018I will eat my shoe, and then I will walk barefoot to Mexico to emigrate and leave the country.\u2019\u201cSomehow, I think Silicon Valley got even more spun up than Manhattan. There were hedge fund people I spoke to about a week after the election. They hadn\u2019t supported Trump. But all of a sudden, they sort of changed their minds. The stock market went up, and they were like, \u2018Yes, actually, I don\u2019t understand why I was against him all year long.\u2019\u201dTalking about how the Billy Bush tape was not so shocking if you\u2019ve worked on the Wall Street trading floor, Mr. Thiel says: \u201cOn the one hand, the tape was clearly offensive and inappropriate. At the same time, I worry there\u2019s a part of Silicon Valley that is hyper-politically correct about sex. One of my friends has a theory that the rest of the country tolerates Silicon Valley because people there just don\u2019t have that much sex. They\u2019re not having that much fun.\u201dI note that several Silicon Valley companies have pre-emptively said they will not help build a Muslim registry for the Trump administration. Will Palantir, the data-mining company of which Mr. Thiel was a founder, and whose clients include the N.S.A., the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., be involved in that? (Palantir\u2019s C.E.O., Alex Karp, sat in at the Trump tech meeting.)\u201cWe would not do that,\u201d Mr. Thiel says flatly.When I ask him if he can explain to Mr. Trump that climate change is not a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, he offers a Chinese box of an answer: \u201cDoes he really think that? If he really thinks that, how would you influence that? If he really thinks that and you could influence him, what would be the best way to do it?\u201dHis critics demanded to know how someone who immigrated from Frankfurt to Cleveland as a child could support a campaign so bristling with intolerance. How could a gay man back someone who will probably nominate Supreme Court justices inclined to limit rights for gays and women? How could a futurist support a cave man who champions fossil fuels, puts profits over environmental protection and insists that we can turn back the clock on the effects of globalization on American workers?\u201cThere are reduced expectations for the younger generation, and this is the first time this has happened in American history,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cEven if there are aspects of Trump that are retro and that seem to be going back to the past, I think a lot of people want to go back to a past that was futuristic \u2014 \u2018The Jetsons,\u2019 \u2018Star Trek.\u2019 They\u2019re dated but futuristic.\u201dIt is a theme he has struck before, that Silicon Valley has not fulfilled the old dreams for bigger things. \u201cCellphones distract us from the fact that the subways are 100 years old,\u201d he says.He says he isn\u2019t. Yet the billionaire views the visceral torrent against him with his usual rationality, surveying the scene deliberately, like the chess prodigy he once was. \u201cI was surprised that it generated as much controversy as it did,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a push to remove me from the board of Facebook, which is kind of crazy, since I\u2019m the longest-serving director there after Zuckerberg.\u201dHe recalls that he went through a lot of \u201cmeta\u201d debates about Mr. Trump in Silicon Valley. \u201cOne of my good friends said, \u2018Peter, do you realize how crazy this is, how everybody thinks this is crazy?\u2019 I was like: \u2018Well, why am I wrong? What\u2019s substantively wrong with this?\u2019 And it all got referred back to \u2018Everybody thinks Trump\u2019s really crazy.\u2019 So it\u2019s like there\u2019s a shortcut, which is: \u2018I don\u2019t need to explain it. It\u2019s good enough that everybody thinks something. If everybody thinks this is crazy, I don\u2019t even have to explain to you why it\u2019s crazy. You should just change your mind.\u2019\u201dOn the Russian hacking, Mr. Thiel says: \u201cThere\u2019s a strong circumstantial case that Russia did this thing. On the other hand, I was totally convinced that there were W.M.D.s in Iraq in 2002, 2003.\u201dThe reaction from the gay community has been harsh, with one writer in The Advocate going so far as to suggest that Mr. Thiel was not even a gay man, because he did not \u201cembrace the struggle.\u201d\u201cI think Trump is very good on gay rights,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will reverse anything. I would obviously be concerned if I thought otherwise.\u201dI ask if he\u2019s comfortable with the idea that Vice President-elect Mike Pence, regarded in the gay community as an unreconstructed homophobe, is a heartbeat away from the presidency.\u201cYou know, maybe I should be worried but I\u2019m not that worried about it,\u201d he replies. \u201cI don\u2019t know. People know too many gay people. There are just all these ways I think stuff has just shifted. For speaking at the Republican convention, I got attacked way more by liberal gay people than by conservative Christian people.\u201cI don\u2019t think these things will particularly change. It\u2019s like, even if you appointed a whole series of conservative Supreme Court justices, I\u2019m not sure that Roe v. Wade would get overturned, ever. I don\u2019t know if people even care about the Supreme Court. You know, you\u2019d have thought the failure to have a vote on Merrick [Garland] would be a massive issue. And somehow it mattered to Democrats, but it didn\u2019t matter to the public at large.\u201dWould he like to get married and have kids?He looks a bit startled by the question, then says: \u201cMaybe.\u201dI ask him if he worries about the bromance with Vladimir V. Putin and Mr. Trump\u2019s bizarre affinity for dictators. \u201cBut should Russia be allied with the West or with China?\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cThere are these really bad dictators in the Middle East, and we got rid of them and in many cases there\u2019s even worse chaos.\u201dSo he doesn\u2019t worry about Mr. Trump sending an intemperate tweet and spurring a war with North Korea?\u201cA Twitter war is not a real war,\u201d Mr. Thiel says.If the worst fears of annihilation seem plausible, Mr. Thiel can always invest more in his libertarian fantasy of a new society of Seasteads: islands at sea with their own rules, starting with a French Polynesian lagoon. \u201cThey\u2019re not quite feasible from an engineering perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s still very far in the future.\u201dHe does think, though, that human violence is more of a risk than a pandemic or robot army. \u201cIt\u2019s the people behind the red-eyed robots that you need to be scared of,\u201d he says.Mr. Thiel is focused on ways to prolong life. He was intrigued by parabiosis, a blood regeneration trial in which people over 35 would receive transfusions from people aged 16 to 25 \u2014 an experiment that Anne Rice gave a thumbs up to.\u201cOut of all the crazy things in this campaign, the vampire accusations were the craziest,\u201d he says, adding that while blood transfusions may be helpful, there may be harmful factors and \u201cwe have to be very careful.\u201dMr. Thiel has, however, used human growth hormones and he has signed up for cryogenics. \u201cWe have to be more experimental in all our medical procedures,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should not go gently into that good night.\u201dI ask why everyone in Silicon Valley seemed so obsessed with immortality.\u201cWhy is everyone else so indifferent about their mortality?\u201d he replies.He has invested in many biotech companies and has been advising the Trump transition team on science. \u201cScience is technology\u2019s older brother who has fallen on hard times,\u201d he says. \u201cI have some strong opinions on this. At the F.D.A. today, aging is still not an indication for disease. And you\u2019re not allowed to develop drugs that could stop aging. We have not even started yet.\u201dGiven the passion of his friend Mr. Musk for colonizing Mars, has he influenced Trump\u2019s thinking about NASA?\u201cIt\u2019s this very large agency that has kind of lost its way over the last 30 to 40 years,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cWhen we went to the moon, it took less than a decade from the time Kennedy announced it to the time we got there. Mars is harder but surely possible.\u201dHe says Mr. Trump\u2019s foes want to cast the president-elect \u201cas this uniquely evil person, Trump as Hitler; that doesn\u2019t strike me as remotely plausible.\u201dOver a four-hour dinner of duck and chocolate dessert \u2014 a surprisingly sybaritic meal for a man who admits he is prone to weird diets \u2014 Mr. Thiel shows, again and again, how he likes to \u201cflip around\u201d issues to see if conventional wisdom is wrong, a technique he calls Pyrrhonian skepticism.\u201cMaybe I do always have this background program running where I\u2019m trying to think of, \u2018O.K., what\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019re saying?\u2019 and then I\u2019ll try that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt works surprisingly often.\u201d He has even wondered if his most famous investment, Facebook, contributes to herd mentality.When I remark that President Obama had eight years without any ethical shadiness, Mr. Thiel flips it, noting: \u201cBut there\u2019s a point where no corruption can be a bad thing. It can mean that things are too boring.\u201dWhen I ask if he is concerned about conflicts of interest, either for himself or the Trump children, who sat in on the tech meeting, he flips that one, too: \u201cI don\u2019t want to dismiss ethical concerns here, but I worry that \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 gets overly weaponized in our politics. I think in many cases, when there\u2019s a conflict of interest, it\u2019s an indication that someone understands something way better than if there\u2019s no conflict of interest. If there\u2019s no conflict of interest, it\u2019s often because you\u2019re just not interested.\u201dWhen I ask if Mr. Trump is \u201ccasting\u201d cabinet members based on looks, Mr. Thiel challenges me: \u201cYou\u2019re assuming that Trump thinks they matter too much. And maybe everyone else thinks they matter too little. Do you want America\u2019s leading diplomat to look like a diplomat? Do you want the secretary of defense to look like a tough general, so maybe we don\u2019t have to go on offense and we can stay on defense? I don\u2019t know.\u201dWhen I ask about the incestuous amplification of the Facebook news feed, he muses: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody you know who knows anybody. There\u2019s nobody you know who knows anybody who knows anybody, ad infinitum.\u201dMr. Thiel and Mr. Trump are strange bedfellows, given that much of Mr. Thiel\u2019s billions came from being one of the original investors in Facebook and Mr. Trump recently said it\u2019s better to send important messages by courier. (\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Thiel notes, \u201cone does have to be very careful with what one says in an email.\u201d)The 70-year-old president-elect rose by wildly lunging with his Twitter rapier in an \u201cunpresidented\u201d way in the first campaign that blended politics, social media and reality. But the 49-year-old social-media visionary rarely updates his Facebook page and doesn\u2019t tweet, \u201cbecause you always want to get things exactly right\u201d and \u201cif you start doing it, you have to do it a lot.\u201dAs Silicon Valley has devolved into a place that produces apps like one that sends the word \u201cYo,\u201d Mr. Thiel worries its thinking is \u201cnot big enough to take our civilization to the next level.\u201dWhen I ask if it is true that Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, wasn\u2019t invited to the Trump tech meeting because the Trump camp was angry that Twitter wouldn\u2019t let the Republican nominee create a \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d emoji, Mr. Thiel replies that \u201cthere were people upset about that,\u201d but that he set up the meeting according to the market caps of the bigger tech companies.\u201cI think the crazy thing is,\u201d he says, \u201cat a place like Twitter, they were all working for Trump this whole year even though they thought they were working for Sanders.\u201dMr. Thiel says he fell into his role in the Trump candidacy.\u201cIt was one of my friends who called me up and said, \u2018Hey, would you like to be a delegate at the Republican convention?\u201d\u2019 he recalls. \u201cI said: \u2018Actually, I kind of would. I think it would be fun to go.\u2019 Then, two weeks before the election, they talked to me about speaking at the convention.\u201dI note that the audience in his hometown, Cleveland, gave him a great reception when he appeared as only the third openly gay speaker at a Republican convention.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that my speech was that good,\u201d he says. \u201cI do think a lot of other speeches were just very bad.\u201dHe had his first conversation with the man whom he sometimes calls \u201cMr. Trump\u201d at the convention, when the Manhattan mogul told the San Francisco mogul, \u201cYou were terrific. We\u2019re friends for life.\u201d Mr. Thiel never did go to a Trump rally or watch a whole video of one. \u201cI would think they were very repetitive,\u201d he says.He says that at the tech meeting, Mr. Trump showed \u201ca phenomenal understanding of people. He\u2019s very charismatic, but it\u2019s because he sort of knows exactly what to say to different people to put them at ease.\u201dI ask him if Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk are similar.\u201cI\u2019m going to get in trouble, but they are, actually. They\u2019re both grandmaster-level salespeople and these very much larger-than-life figures.\u201dHe recalls a story from his and Mr. Musk\u2019s PayPal days, when Mr. Musk joined the engineering team\u2019s poker game and bet everything on every hand, admitting only afterward that it was his first time playing poker. Then there was the time they were driving in Mr. Musk\u2019s McLaren F1 car, \u201cthe fastest car in the world.\u201d It hit an embankment, achieved liftoff, made a 360-degree horizontal turn, crashed and was destroyed.\u201cIt was a miracle neither of us were hurt,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt, which is not advisable. Elon\u2019s first comment was, \u2018Wow, Peter, that was really intense.\u2019 And then it was: \u2018You know, I had read all these stories about people who made money and bought sports cars and crashed them. But I knew it would never happen to me, so I didn\u2019t get any insurance.\u2019 And then we hitchhiked the rest of the way to the meeting.\u201dMr. Trump, with his litigious streak and his pugilistic attitude toward the press and his threat to change the libel laws, naturally admired Mr. Thiel\u2019s legal smackdown of Gawker. The tech titan was disturbed by the \u201cpainful and paralyzing\u201d stories published on the gossipy website and other blogs under the Gawker banner, including a 2007 post that originally appeared on Valleywag blithely headlined \u201cPeter Thiel Is Totally Gay, People.\u201dSo he secretly financed the lawsuit filed by Terry Bollea (the real name of the wrestler Hulk Hogan) against Gawker for posting an excerpt from a sex tape showing Mr. Hogan with a friend\u2019s wife. A court ruled in Mr. Bollea\u2019s favor, in a judgment of $140 million, which drove the site into bankruptcy. (The Gawker founder Nick Denton, who is also gay, described Mr. Thiel to Vanity Fair as \u201cinteresting \u2014 and scary.\u201d)\u201cIt basically stands for the narrow proposition that you should not publish a sex tape,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cI think that\u2019s an insult to journalists to suggest that\u2019s journalism now. Transparency is good, but at some point it can go in this very toxic direction.\u201dJust as there was \u201ca self-fulfilling Hillary bubble\u201d where \u201ceverybody was just too scared to say this was a really bad idea\u201d to support this \u201cvery weak candidate,\u201d Mr. Thiel believes Gawker manufactured \u201ca totally insane bubble full of somewhat sociopathic people in New York.\u201d When the case went to court in Florida, he contends, the culture that \u201cyou could do whatever you wanted and there were no consequences\u201d was exposed.\u201cThere\u2019s some resonances between Hogan beating Gawker and Trump beating the establishment in this country,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. Hulk Hogan was \u201cthis crazy person\u201d who didn\u2019t seem like the best plaintiff, but \u201che didn\u2019t give up.\u201dUsing two wrestling terms he learned, Mr. Thiel says that many people assumed Mr. Trump was \u201ckayfabe\u201d \u2014 a move that looks real but is fake. But then his campaign turned into a \u201cshoot\u201d \u2014 the word for an unscripted move that suddenly becomes real.\u201cPeople thought the whole Trump thing was fake, that it wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere, that it was the most ridiculous thing imaginable, and then somehow he won, like Hogan did,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cAnd what I wonder is, whether maybe pro wrestling is one of the most real things we have in our society and what\u2019s really disturbing is that the other stuff is much more fake. And whatever the superficialities of Mr. Trump might be, he was more authentic than the other politicians. He sort of talked in a way like ordinary people talk. It was not sort of this Orwellian newspeak jargon that so many of the candidates use. So he was sort of real. He actually wanted to win.\u201dI ask Mr. Thiel about a prescient theory he proffered when I had dinner with him at the convention \u2014 again, flipping conventional wisdom \u2014 that Hillary was making a mistake by being too optimistic.\u201cIf you\u2019re too optimistic, it sounds like you\u2019re out of touch,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Republicans needed a far more pessimistic candidate. Somehow, what was unusual about Trump is, he was very pessimistic but it still had an energizing aspect to it.\u201dHe says he has no plans to buy a place in Washington. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s striking about talking to people who are politically working in D.C. is, it\u2019s so hard to tell what any of them actually do,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of place where people measure input, not output. You have a 15-minute monologue describing a 15-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9, starting in seventh grade.\u201dWhile many predict that Mr. Trump will crash and burn, Mr. Thiel does not think he will regret his role.\u201cI always have very low expectations, so I\u2019m rarely disappointed,\u201d he says.I ask him how Mr. Trump, who is still putting out a lot of wacky, childish tweets, has struck him during the transition. Isn\u2019t he running around with his hair on fire?\u201cThe hair seems fine,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cMr. Trump seems fine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Oklahoma has one of the highest rates of female incarceration in the country \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which experts say is largely due to stringent drug laws.)Inmates crowded around us as we entered, and we explained that we had come to photograph Manning. As we walked toward her bunk, the inmates shouted, though they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yell the jeers that movies had conditioned me to expect:\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou look beautiful, you really do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a younger inmate yelled to Manning.An older woman passed and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is your day, smile!\u00e2\u0080\u009dMuch to my embarrassment, I realized that, of course, these inmates were not what popular culture had made them out to be. In this crowded dorm, the incarcerated women were still people, clinging to their humanity. The circumstances of their incarceration may have been painful, and many were mothers who had been separated from their children. Still, in front of us, they seemed considerate of each other and polite to a gaggle of intruding journalists.As local news outlets close and reporting becomes increasingly east-coast-centric, we tend to fixate on the people who pass policies, rather than the people policies affect. My reporting trip with Nick was full of women who reminded me that on the other end of impersonal rules and regulations \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0such as mandatory minimum sentencing, severe drug laws and fines \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there are people. To truly understand an issue, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no substitute for face-to-face contact.My main worry was how best to report on the uniquely agonizing nature of American poverty. Mother Teresa said during her Nobel lecture in 1979 that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoverty of the West\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the most pernicious: \u00e2\u0080\u009cA person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI find that very difficult.\u00e2\u0080\u009dI interviewed people who, on paper, could have been my classmates or friends, yet because they grew up amidst poverty, drugs and trauma, were now among the most ostracized people in society.For instance, I met Haley Lakey, 21, a recovering meth and opiate addict in rehab at the Tulsa Women and Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Center. I got chills when I learned she and I had been born less than 24 hours apart.Although our lives had begun at the same time, our paths had taken dissonant turns; in her 21 years, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d overcome much more. Her parents struggled with meth addiction when she was young and her dad has been incarcerated since she was 8. She said she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d always craved the stability of an idealized nuclear family, so when she was 17, she moved in with her boyfriend. He became violently abusive, and she was trapped. He was a meth addict who prompted her to use, too, and coerced her to steal jewelry from her own grandmother. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had three children and lost custody of two.But perhaps that can change, if we begin to pay attention, leave our bubbles and make poverty a priority.

{"Headline": "Australian Drug Maker Has Low Profile but Powerful Backers in Washington", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Innate Immunotherapeutics is a tiny pharmaceutical company from Australia that has no approved drugs and no backing from flashy venture capital firms, and trades for just over a dollar a share on the Australian Stock Exchange. More than once, the company has run out of money and nearly closed its doors.Other Washington power players with investments in the company include Michael Hook, Mr. Collins\u2019s chief of staff, who is a top shareholder, and Bill Paxon, a Washington lobbyist and former congressman, according to company filings and congressional financial disclosures. Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon bought the stock at a discount as part of a private offering organized by Innate aimed at \u201csophisticated U.S. investors.\u201d They have since quintupled their money, at least on paper.Representatives of Mr. Price and Mr. Collins say they have not broken any rules, but what has puzzled Washington and industry insiders alike is how a no-name Australian biotech, with only one experimental multiple sclerosis drug under development, attracted a coterie of Washington investors, including the man who is likely to become the next health secretary.A spokesman for Mr. Collins said the congressman had followed all ethical guidelines and said Innate was one of many companies he had been involved in. \u201cHe is very proud of the progress the company has made over the years and hopeful it will be able to develop a potentially lifesaving treatment for the millions of individuals suffering from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,\u201d said the spokesman, Michael McAdams.In an interview this week in San Francisco, Innate\u2019s chief executive, Simon Wilkinson, seemed amused at all of the attention now being paid to what he described as his \u201clittle biotech at the wrong end of the world.\u201dTheir goal, they said, is to sell the company to a larger pharmaceutical company.\u201cIt won\u2019t be up to us to seek approval for the drug,\u201d Mr. Wilkinson said in the interview, which took place at his hotel on a rundown block in San Francisco, where he was pitching the company to potential buyers at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference.Like many biotech start-ups, Innate has had ups and downs, Mr. Wilkinson said. \u201cBut sometimes, things happen,\u201d he added. In his case, he said, \u201cI met Chris.\u201dMr. Wilkinson said he was on a fund-raising trip to the United States in 2005 when the two met, and he made his pitch to Mr. Collins, who was then a businessman with a reputation for turning around struggling companies. Mr. Collins decided to invest in the company, eventually joining its board.In 2007, Mr. Collins was elected county executive of Erie County, which includes Buffalo, and in 2012, he won election to Congress. He remained on Innate\u2019s board, and Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Quinn said his new political career has had little impact.\u201cIf anything, I suspect it\u2019s probably a negative,\u201d Mr. Quinn said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s a bit harder to access \u2014 he\u2019s just busy.\u201dMr. Collins remained one of the company\u2019s top cheerleaders, enlisting many of his associates as investors and even lending the company money a handful of times when it was at risk of going out of business.Today, many of Innate\u2019s biggest shareholders have ties to Mr. Collins. They include two of his adult children, Caitlin and Cameron, who are the company\u2019s third- and fourth-biggest shareholders, as well as several Buffalo businessmen who have donated to his political campaigns, according to company filings and campaign finance disclosures. Lindy Ruff, the head coach of the Dallas Stars hockey team and a former player and coach for the Buffalo Sabres, is also an investor.Innate\u2019s sole drug in development, MIS416, is in clinical trials in Australia and New Zealand to evaluate whether it works in people with an advanced form of multiple sclerosis. A midlevel trial is underway, and results are due in the middle of this year.Experts in congressional ethics and trading rules said there did not appear to be evidence that Mr. Collins or Mr. Price used nonpublic information to steer their investment activities, a practice that would violate what is known as the Stock Act, which bans insider trading by members of Congress. But, said Donna M. Nagy, a law professor at Indiana University who has written on the financial investments by members of Congress, \u201cOne needs facts in order to get answers to those questions, and coming up with the facts for that is going to be difficult.\u201dMr. Holman of Public Citizen said Mr. Collins\u2019s recruiting efforts among Washington power players created the opportunity for \u201cinfluence peddling.\u201d For example, Mr. Paxon, who represented Mr. Collins\u2019s congressional district in the 1990s, could appear before Mr. Collins as both a lobbyist and a fellow investor in Innate.\u201cIt\u2019s a very effective means of buying access and hopefully influencing politicians,\u201d Mr. Holman said.Mr. Collins\u2019s spokesman said Mr. Paxon and Mr. Collins had never discussed Innate and noted that, because they are both from the Buffalo area, he might have become aware of Innate through other investors in the region. Mr. Paxon did not respond to emails and a call for comment.Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon were among 16 entities that took part in the private American placement, as did several other of Mr. Collins\u2019s associates and donors, according to the company filing. Mr. Price and Mr. Hook also participated in a second offering in the summer, the filings show. Mr. Price purchased between $50,000 and $100,000 in Innate shares in August, which was among the largest stock buys he had made since 2012, according to congressional financial disclosures. The investment was larger than his trades in more established pharmaceutical stocks like Pfizer and Merck.With his discount from the private placements, Mr. Price would have purchased some stock at 25 Australian cents per share in August and some at 34 cents. The stock closed on Friday at $1.31.Mr. McAdams, Mr. Collins\u2019s spokesman, said the private placement was available to qualified American investors and said Mr. Hook had previously invested in a private placement with the company in 2009, before Mr. Collins was a congressman. Several other investors were longtime friends of Mr. Collins, Mr. McAdams said, and their investment predates his time in Congress.Mr. Quinn dismissed questions about whether anyone engaged in insider trading and said the company\u2019s stock had been rising in anticipation of the results of the clinical trial later this year. The outcome of such trials is typically kept secret from investors and even company executives.\u201cRight now the whole value of this thing swings on a bet on the study results,\u201d he said.In San Francisco this week, Mr. Wilkinson said he had received interest in a possible acquisition from about 20 \u201chigh grade\u201d pharmaceutical companies. The drug, if approved, would be the first to treat a progressive form of multiple sclerosis.But he was also self-deprecating, noting wryly that Innate was such a \u201cbottom feeder\u201d at the JPMorgan conference that the company had not even qualified for an invitation to attend the main event.Abby Goodnough contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Helping Mobile Publishing? Some Publishers Are Not So Sure", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last month, Federico Viticci, who runs MacStories, a news site devoted to Apple and its products, made a change in how the site publishes articles for mobile gadgets. MacStories, he declared, would no longer support a Google-backed method for faster loading of mobile web pages, called AMP.AMP has since delivered on its promise of faster mobile web pages. Even so, publishers \u2014 of smaller sites, especially, or individual bloggers \u2014 are beginning to worry about giving too much control to Google in exchange for zippier web pages. What\u2019s more, Google\u2019s approach to AMP has rankled some critics already suspicious of the company\u2019s outsize influence on the internet.Much of the publishers\u2019 unease is rooted in Google\u2019s presentation of AMP stories, which appear as if they are Google articles. That\u2019s because Google, to speed up AMP, stores copies of publisher\u2019s pages and serves them from its own internet network. So when a reader clicks an AMP link, the address bar at the top of the page displays google.com instead of the actual web address from the publisher.\u201cIt looks like a Google story,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a web search news site. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why you\u2019re getting the nervousness from some of these publishers.\u201dGoogle said that it had designed AMP to prioritize speed and that it wanted to help \u2014 not harm \u2014 publishers, who get full accounting of traffic, data and advertising revenue. Publishers also retain control of their content and design. Google said serving up articles from its own internet network was the best way it knew to achieve the AMP speeds, which are as much as four times faster than a regular mobile web page.\u201cWe always try to present the content that is the best experience,\u201d said David Besbris, Google\u2019s vice president of engineering.Google started AMP in 2015 because it worried that competitors like Facebook were drawing web surfers inside their networks with faster-loading articles and keeping them there. For Google, those rival sites were siphoning people away from the open internet, where the search company \u2014 which created the internet\u2019s most valuable property by organizing the expanse of the World Wide Web \u2014 typically operates.Now articles that use AMP appear prominently in Google search results on mobile devices. A Google search for \u201cDonald Trump\u201d on a smartphone brings back a horizontal carousel of articles from media organizations like Slate and The Wall Street Journal at the top of the page. If someone clicks the first story in the carousel, he or she is moved into a browser and can swipe instantly from one story to another without leaving Google\u2019s network.Another benefit of AMP for Google is that it keeps activity on the web, and away from apps. More browsing on the internet means more web searches, and, in most cases, that means more Google. This is even more pronounced on mobile devices, where Google accounts for about 95 percent of all global web searches, according to StatCounter.David Gehring, a former Google employee and the chief executive of Relay Media, a company that works with publishers to convert pages to AMP, said the format had been positive for publishers grappling with shrinking revenue in the shift from print to online advertising. He estimated that up to 10 percent of mobile web content was already on AMP.Yet Mr. Gehring also said Google suffered from \u201ctone deafness\u201d when it came to explaining the benefits of AMP, such as the ability for publishers to syndicate articles across the mobile web without losing advertising or traffic.\u201cIt made me feel like my site wasn\u2019t my own,\u201d Mr. Kras said.Still, Mr. Kras decided to keep AMP because it was fast. \"For that, a lot of little things can be (temporarily) forgotten,\u201d he said.Several bigger publishers say they are pleased with AMP and do not see anything worrisome with Google.\u201cGoogle has been a good partner,\u201d said Mark Silverstein, the head of business development at The Huffington Post, which is planning to push almost all of its news content into AMP. \u201cWhen they make decisions, they do a good job of explaining why they reached that decision.\u201dEmily Smith, head of content operations at Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s Wired magazine, said supporting AMP had pushed its mobile articles to the top of search results. For web surfers conditioned to believe that the most relevant information is presented first in search results, it\u2019s important for a media organization to be near the top.\u201cIt\u2019s like being above the fold in a newspaper,\u201d she said.About 15 percent of The Washington Post\u2019s traffic comes from AMP pages. The Post is now using the lessons from AMP to move its articles to a separate, faster-running mobile platform that runs like an app but does so over the web.Joey Marburger, director of products for The Post, said that its readers were scrolling further on AMP stories, but that it was building its own fast system to gain greater control over ads and features.\u201cWe have to be where our readers are coming from,\u201d Mr. Marburger said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also important to have more control over our own content.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Humanism Really Humane?", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe StoneThis is the tenth in a series of dialogues with philosophers and critical theorists on the question of violence. This conversation is with Cary Wolfe, who is the director of the Center for Critical and Cultural Theory at Rice University and the founding editor of the Posthumanities book series at the University of Minnesota Press.There is, in fact, a genealogy of posthumanist thought that stretches back well before the 21st or even 20th century. You find hints of it in anything that fundamentally decenters the human in relation to the world in which we find ourselves, whether we\u2019re talking about other forms of life, the environment, technology or something else. Perhaps more importantly, you find it in the realization that when you don\u2019t allow the concept of the \u201chuman\u201d to do your heavy philosophical lifting, you are forced to come up with much more robust and complex accounts of whatever it is you\u2019re talking about. And that includes, first and foremost, a more considered concept of the \u201chuman\u201d itself.The sketches of the \u201chuman,\u201d \u201cthe animal\u201d or \u201cnature\u201d that we get from the humanist tradition are pretty obviously cartoons if we consider the multifaceted, multidisciplinary ways in which we could address these questions. Humanism provides an important cultural inheritance and legacy, no doubt, but hardly the kind of vocabulary that can describe the complex ways that human beings are intertwined with and shaped by the nonhuman world in which they live, and that brings together what the humanist philosophical tradition considered ontologically separate and discrete domains like \u201chuman\u201d and \u201canimal,\u201d or \u201cbiological\u201d and \u201cmechanical.\u201dDarwinian thought was a huge step in this direction. So was Marx\u2019s historical materialism or the Freud of \u201cCivilization and Its Discontents.\u201d For me, one of the big breakthroughs was the emergence at mid-20th century of the wildly interdisciplinary type of thought known as systems theory, where fundamental processes such as the feedback loop allow you to describe how cruise control in a car works, but also how thermoregulation in warm-blooded animals happens \u2014 without ever invoking (or really even being interested in) the old humanist taxonomies that would have separated such questions.It\u2019s given us a language where we can now describe much more intricately and robustly how human beings \u2014 not just their minds but their bodies, their microbiomes, their modes of communication and so on \u2014 are enmeshed in and interact with the nonhuman world.Gregory Bateson\u2019s work on human and animal communication is a wonderful example. He once wrote that when a guy says to a woman \u201cI love you,\u201d she would do well to pay more attention to his body language, the dilation of his pupils, the tone and timbre of his voice, whether his palms are wet or dry, and so on, than to the denotative content of his words. That\u2019s because communication is a multilayered phenomenon that requires attention to both its \u201chuman\u201d and \u201cnonhuman,\u201d or evolutionarily inherited, involuntary elements. Bateson said that\u2019s why we don\u2019t trust actors, and I tell my students that\u2019s what makes email such an incendiary form of communication: all those dampening and texturing dimensions of the communication go away, and so the communication becomes all the more thin and brittle, and to try and get some of it back we start inserting emoticons, and so on. In all this, the properly \u201chuman\u201d is only part of the story; it\u2019s nested in a larger, and in many ways nonhuman, set of contexts and forces.But the problem with how rights discourse addresses this problem \u2014 in animal rights philosophy, for example \u2014 is that animals end up having some kind of moral standing insofar as they are diminished versions of us: that is to say, insofar as they are possessed of various characteristics such as the capacity to experience suffering \u2014 and not just brute physical suffering but emotional duress as well \u2014 that we human beings possess more fully. And so we end up reinstating a normative form of the moral-subject-as-human that we wanted to move beyond in the first place.So on the other hand, what one wants to do is to find a way of valuing nonhuman life not because it is some diminished or second-class form of the human, but because the diversity and abundance of life is to be valued for what it is in its own right, in its difference and uniqueness. An elephant or a dolphin or a chimpanzee isn\u2019t worthy of respect because it embodies some normative form of the \u201chuman\u201d plus or minus a handful of relevant moral characteristics. It\u2019s worthy of respect for reasons that call upon us to come up with another moral vocabulary, a vocabulary that starts by acknowledging that whatever it is we value ethically and morally in various forms of life, it has nothing to do with the biological designation of \u201chuman\u201d or \u201canimal.\u201dHaving said all that, there are many, many contexts in which rights discourse is the coin of the realm when you\u2019re engaged in these arguments \u2014 and that\u2019s not surprising, given that nearly all of our political and legal institutions are inherited from the brief historical period (ecologically speaking) in which humanism flourished and consolidated its domain. If you\u2019re talking to a state legislature about strengthening laws for animal abuse cases, let\u2019s say, instead of addressing a room full of people at a conference on deconstruction and philosophy about the various problematic assumptions built into rights discourse, then you better be able to use a different vocabulary and different rhetorical tools if you want to make good on your ethical commitments. That\u2019s true even though those commitments and how you think about them might well be informed by a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the problem than would be available to those legislators. In other words, it\u2019s only partly a philosophical question. It\u2019s also a strategic question, one of location, context and audience, and it shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that we can move more quickly in the realm of academic philosophical discourse on these questions than we can in the realm of legal and political institutions.Having said all that, however, social media merely dramatizes something that has always been true of the \u201cself\u201d \u2014 that it is, in fact, a prosthetic entity, a distributed, dispersed \u201cassemblage\u201d constituted by many elements, some of them physical and material and biological, some of them not, the constitution of the self by language and how it rewires the brain being the most obvious example. That is, if you like, the \u201ctruth\u201d of the self: that it exists nowhere as a totality.As Gregory Bateson put it, the bioenergetic physical entity called \u201cSocrates\u201d ceased to exist a long time ago. But \u201cSocrates\u201d understood in a more complex way, as a network of texts, readers, cultural legacies, the institutions they depend on and so on, is still alive and exerts a powerful influence on the world, every day, to this day. The false move \u2014 or false desire, would be more apt \u2014 is to think that \u201cit,\u201d that \u201cself,\u201d exists as a totality somewhere. There is no \u201cself\u201d in that sense, even though the tip-of-the-iceberg phenomenon called \u201cconsciousness\u201d encourages us to think that there is, and understandably enough.That\u2019s why the discourse of animalization is so powerful, because it uses a biological or racial taxonomy to institute an ethical divide between who is \u201ckillable but not murderable,\u201d those who are \u201cproperly\u201d human and those who aren\u2019t. So the first imperative of posthumanism is to insist that when we are talking about who can and can\u2019t be treated in a particular way, the first thing we have to do is throw out the distinction between \u201chuman\u201d and \u201canimal\u201d \u2014 and indeed throw out the desire to think that we can index our treatment of various beings, human or not, to some biological, taxonomic designation. Does this mean that all forms of life are somehow \u201cthe same\u201d? No, it means exactly the opposite: that the question of \u201chuman\u201d versus \u201canimal\u201d is a woefully inadequate philosophical tool to make sense of the amazing diversity of different forms of life on the planet, how they experience the world, and how they should be treated.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s a bot for that.Now, the booking services Expedia, Kayak, Skyscanner and many others are allowing potential customers to seek recommendations on hotel rooms and flights and book them via Facebook Messenger.Several other travel-related bots have sprung up in recent months, providing services like bookings and tips for activities, with a robotic touch.The technology is young, and while most of these chatbots have yet to become viable alternatives to existing travel planning options like Trip Advisor and traditional guides, it could be only a matter of time before our smartphone-obsessed culture embraces booking by text.Here is what three of the more interesting options have to offer so far:The bot first asks for your travel city and dates, whether you have a specific hotel brand in mind and if you have any neighborhood preferences in the city.I texted SnapTravel while I was looking to book a few nights in my hometown, Binghamton, N.Y., during Thanksgiving week. Based on my initial responses, SnapTravel gave me a cost estimate for three- and four-star hotels in the area.After another series of questions regarding my budget, brand preference and more, I was told to hang tight and it would get back to me with hotel options within an hour.Seven minutes later, I was sent what it deemed my four best options, with photos and links to more details and booking options for each hotel, a link to a map with more options, and I was asked if I wanted to be put in touch with one of its travel agents (who can offer some human insight).The entire process from start to finish took 16 minutes. But it felt more like an automated phone call with a cable company than a typical text conversation. I thanked the bot, and was pleased that it did not bug me later on, something I had expected.The hotel recommendations were a mixed bag. I told the bot that I prefer Marriott hotels, and it included a Courtyard Marriott within my budget. The other three included a bed-and-breakfast, a local resort and a Homewood Suites by Hilton. Points for variety, but another Marriott choice would have been nice. Meanwhile the map with more options had only two additional hotels.As far as the deals themselves, they seemed legitimate when compared with the prices seen on discount booking websites like Hotwire.com. When you click on the hotel\u2019s link on SnapTravel, you get its rates, are told whether there is a cancellation fee and are given the opportunity to compare its rate for that hotel with other booking sites.While you won\u2019t get a comprehensive list to shop from, SnapTravel mostly did what it claims it can do, and in a timely manner.Just be careful what you ask for. You will need to be specific if you want to get relevant results.I used Messenger to converse with Hipmunk, and before I had a chance to say hello, the critter asked me what airport I usually fly from. I said La Guardia, assuming it would understand that I meant La Guardia Airport in New York City. But it came back with: \u201cLooks like you\u2019re planning a getaway from Laguardia, Spain.\u201dI tried again, asking for some flight deals from New York to Chicago for the next week. He came back with: \u201cYou\u2019re looking for the best time to go from New York City, NY, to Chicago, IL. Hold on, I\u2019m digging through the data now. :)\u201d Not really there, but we\u2019re getting closer, and I appreciate the service with a smile.Next I tried: \u201cI need a flight from New York to Chicago, leaving tomorrow and coming back on October 9.\u201dThat seemed to do it.\u201cReady to jet? I\u2019m finding you flights from New York City, NY, to Chicago, IL, on October 05, coming back on October 09,\u201d the Hipmunk bot said. \u201cI searched 736 itineraries. The least agonizing itinerary flies from LGA to ORD.\u201d Below were nine itineraries, rated one to nine in order of \u201cleast agonizing\u201d with times and prices.This bot is fun to play with if you have the time, but it has a ways to go in the accuracy department.You don\u2019t need to be a business traveler to benefit, but you do need to be a frequent-enough traveler to justify the cost: $49 per month ($499 annually) for its \u201cconcierge\u201d plan. But there is a seven-day free trial to start.The involvement of humans may have explained the short delay in Pana\u2019s response to my initial text (three minutes felt like an eternity compared with the other bots), but it also ultimately led to better results.After signing up and giving some basic information, including your email and phone number, Pana asks you for a quick phone call to get to know you a little better. But in keeping with the spirit of avoiding as much human interaction as possible, I passed on that and sought out its A.I. guidance.Pana gives you three ways to start: through email, SMS or its app. I chose SMS and received an introductory hello. I then texted that I wanted to fly from New York to Chicago, leaving next Monday and returning Friday.I got a response from \u201cJo\u201d and learned that she is \u201ca Canadian transplant in Hong Kong, avoiding the snow and loving the urban island life.\u201d Jo promised to look into my flight options and send them to me shortly. About an hour later, I received four flight itinerary options, sorted by price from lowest to highest.This was as far as I took it, but Pana is designed to be a long-term relationship. Your virtual travel agent can check you into flights and suggest hotels, and then can pivot to concierge-mode to recommend restaurants and activities in your destination city.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frantic Phoning Among C.E.O.s: How to Address Trump Ban?", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byDealBookThe phone calls flew back and forth among the nation\u2019s top chief executives over the weekend, all asking the same questions: \u201cWhat are you going to say publicly about Trump\u2019s executive order? And what can we say about it without becoming his next punching bag?\u201dWelcome to the new reality for corporate America.Last fall, John Chipman, the director-general and chief executive of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, advanced the notion that in our globalized world, \u201cevery company needs a foreign policy.\u201d Now, our largest companies also have to think about having a domestic policy \u2014 and possibly a moral policy, too.For corporate executives, the decision about whether to speak out against a policy from Mr. Trump so early in his administration has clearly been nerve-racking.The reaction from major American companies to President Trump\u2019s order has ranged from silence to outrage.While it may appear as though a tidal wave of executives has come forward to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order over immigration during the last 48 hours, each did so with a different flavor and tone \u2014 and most didn\u2019t go public until some of their rivals and peers did first, as they sought safety in numbers.Much of the early criticism came from the West Coast: Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook weighed in first, and then Tim Cook of Apple as well as Howard Schultz of Starbucks, who pledged to hire 10,000 refugees.But other big firms, including those on Wall Street and in the consumer-goods sector, took much longer to respond \u2014 if at all \u2014 because of worries about blowback from regulators and customers.And for good reason: Mr. Schultz\u2019s comments prompted calls for a boycott from Trump supporters who started the hashtag #boycottStarbucks on Twitter. But there was a counterpunch. For every tweet about plans to boycott, someone else tweeted something like this: \u201cThere is a #boycottStarbucks going around because they\u2019re pledging to hire refugees, you know what that means? Time to get some Starbucks.\u201dCoca-Cola didn\u2019t say anything until late Monday, when the chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said the company opposed the travel ban. Many other large companies have so far remained silent on the issue. Among them are Blackstone Group, Disney, General Motors and Pepsico.And while the criticism (although limited) was real, few took shots directly at Mr. Trump, for fear of retribution. The harshest comment from a C.E.O. of a large, public company appeared to come from Reed Hastings of Netflix, who directly named the president: \u201cTrump\u2019s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all.\u201d(It\u2019s easy to surmise that Netflix could soon be on the losing end of Mr. Trump\u2019s possible plan to upend net-neutrality laws.)But most top executives took a more circuitous route. The wording was purposely dripping with politeness: \u201cThis executive order is one we do not support,\u201d became the language almost universally adopted by C.E.O.s.Of course, the business community, up until this past weekend, has largely cheered many of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to lower taxes, remove regulations and invest in infrastructure.Several dozen chief executives have found their ways onto a variety of councils to meet with Mr. Trump and advise him on business issues, making it even thornier to criticize him in public.By all accounts, people close to Mr. Musk say he was upset about Mr. Trump\u2019s order, but offered a somewhat tepid rebuke on Twitter: \u201cThe blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201dHe quickly found himself as the target of criticism from fans who wanted him to go further. \u201cExpected a much more forceful condemnation from someone like Elon,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.A lot of the discussion among C.E.O.s, which they shared with me anonymously for fear of retribution for even discussing the subject, said that in the Venn diagram they made about how to deal with public issues like this, they came back to the word \u201ctrade-off.\u201dWhat\u2019s the best alternative? One executive explained that he could offer a morally righteous argument that would feel good in the moment and probably cause a series of cheering \u2014 and booing \u2014 from his various constituents, while potentially losing whatever influence he might have on the president to guide him to make sensible policy in other areas. Or he could offer a Milquetoast response that appeased his employees and nodded at the issue without upsetting his relationship with the president.Given that Mr. Musk has been willing to bring up contentious subjects with Mr. Trump in the past \u2014 like introducing a carbon tax \u2014 perhaps making the point in person will do more than doing so in an email or on Twitter.Whatever the case, the first shots between the business world and the White House have been fired. And more are likely to come.\u201cThere\u2019s some strange mythology that when you go public you can\u2019t speak up,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve heard from plenty of investors appreciating our stance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jonathan Capehart and Nick Schmit: One Transition Speeds Another", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byVowsIt isn\u2019t often that you get to see a former attorney general of the United States cry, but there was Eric H. Holder Jr. on Jan. 7, standing in a small room in the Jefferson hotel in Washington, dabbing his eyes with a hankie.Mr. Holder had borrowed the hankie from the two tuxedo-clad grooms in front of him, and it hadn\u2019t been his objective to go all verklempt in front of them and their 40 guests.\u201cI\u2019ve done I don\u2019t know how many weddings,\u201d he said after he led the short ceremony, standing in his dark gray suit, looking surprised at himself. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever shed a tear as the officiant.\u201dWhat could he say? It had been a whirlwind weekend.Just as important, the grooms who stood before him are friends of his.And befitting a Washington power couple, their story is filled with A-list political names.In spring 2010, Jed Hastings \u2014 who is now married to Joe Solmonese, the former president of the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates gay rights \u2014 reached out to Mr. Capehart on a matchmaking mission.Mr. Hastings explained that his sister-in-law had a cousin, Mr. Schmit, who had recently moved to Washington and was single. But Mr. Capehart was dating someone and quickly shut down the idea.So Mr. Hastings waited six months and contacted Mr. Capehart again, on Facebook, where he encountered a somewhat more receptive audience. \u201cBeing a journalist, I said, \u2018Send me a picture,\u2019\u201d Mr. Capehart said.Once Mr. Capehart got a look at Mr. Schmit and approved of what he saw, Mr. Hastings introduced the two men in a joint message.Over instant messages, Mr. Capehart was quickly impressed with Mr. Schmit\u2019s command of language \u2014 that he actually knew the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d and \u201cits\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s.\u201dMr. Schmit was impressed to find that the person he had seen on television was turning out to be self-effacing and approachable.\u201cJonathan is across-the-board so true to himself whether he\u2019s here at home or on television or doing a panel,\u201d Mr. Schmit said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any ability to change who he is, for better or worse.\u201dTwo dates occurred in rapid succession. And with the Democratic Party reeling from the midterm losses, in addition to topics like where they got their hair cut, there was a lot to discuss.Mr. Capehart worried about the 13-year age gap between them, but Mr. Schmit turned out to be an old soul, the sort who wanted nothing other than to curl up at night and fall asleep watching a movie.Still, Mr. Capehart moved slowly, taking nearly two years to give Mr. Schmit a key to his apartment.The day after the key was handed over, Mr. Capehart went on a business trip and asked Mr. Schmit via text what he was up to. Mr. Schmit sent back a photo of his feet on Mr. Capehart\u2019s sofa with the TV on in front of him. Which both scared Mr. Capehart a little and made it clear that the man before him was playing for keeps.In 2015, marriage equality became the law of the land, and Mr. Capehart began hearing from friends who were flummoxed about why he hadn\u2019t yet proposed.A persistent voice in Mr. Capehart\u2019s ear on his marriage status was Valerie Jarrett, an adviser to Mr. Obama, who first brought up the issue in 2015. Then she revisited it at a cocktail party over Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday weekend in 2016.\u201cShe was at it again,\u201d Mr. Capehart said. \u201cI said, \u2018Come on,\u2019 and she said, \u2018Jonathan, what\u2019s the problem? What\u2019s going on?\u2019 Then she said: \u2018I\u2019m going to tell you what the president tells young straight guys who are on his staff and are in relationships. The first question he asks is, \u201cDo you love her?\u201d The next is, \u201cDo you know for a fact that she wants to marry you?\u201d If the answer to both those questions is yes, then you have to get married. If you don\u2019t want to, then you should end the relationship.\u2019\u201dThe presidential advice took some time to sink in, but Mr. Capehart ultimately came around, particularly after going to meet Mr. Schmit\u2019s family at their lake house in Ottertail, Minn.Mr. Schmit said that one big contrast between the two men was their upbringing: Mr. Capehart\u2019s father died when he was little, and it was often just he and his mother. \u201cI\u2019m the third of four,\u201d Mr. Schmit said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big family. Sometimes, I think that\u2019s a little overwhelming to him, but it\u2019s also been lovely because he didn\u2019t have that, and kids everywhere and people coming and going.\u201dMr. Capehart decided to propose to Mr. Schmit on a 2016 visit to Positano, Italy. He had bought engagement rings for both of them and had spent months drafting the proposal, even calling Mr. Schmit\u2019s mother, Jan Schmit, for her blessing.When the right moment came on a terrace balcony overlooking the Mediterranean, Mr. Capehart put a box on the ledge and just pointed. \u201cAre you ready to see what Santa Claus brought you?\u201d Mr. Capehart recalled saying.Of course, it was May. Mr. Schmit said yes immediately.Initially, the couple figured they would tie the knot in fall 2017. They even put down a deposit to get married at the Meridian House in Northwest Washington. Then, Mrs. Clinton lost the election and they chose to marry during an administration they view as more friendly to gay rights than the one about to take office \u2014 particularly given the role Ms. Jarrett had played as needler in chief.\u201cI\u2019m very pleased he took my advice,\u201d she said at the wedding, standing in the hotel among a quickly assembled group that included Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation; the grooms\u2019 mothers, Margaret Capehart and Jan Schmit; and the \u201cToday\u201d co-host and MSNBC anchor Tamron Hall.\u201cLife is short,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cWhen you find somebody who you truly love, what are you waiting for? Why would you wait a second longer to commit in the most public way?\u201dOnce rings were exchanged and tears were shed, the party moved to a room down the hall, where a roast beef dinner was served.Mr. Walker toasted Mr. Schmit for the calming effect he\u2019d had on the fearsome reporter he knew.A chocolate brownie dessert was brought around, and Alexandra Stanton, the chief executive of an international business development firm, mentioned the strange feeling of celebrating amid what had been a heartbreaking two months for people among her set.\u201cAll of us in this room are still mourning the outcome of this election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut let\u2019s give the devil his due. I\u2019d like to personally thank Donald Trump for one thing: accelerating our opportunity to watch Nick and Jonathan merge their two lives into one.\u201dThen she began badgering them about the next step on their journey: having children.An \u201cOn This Day\u201d listing accompanying an article last Sunday about the wedding of Jonathan Capehart and Nick Schmit referred imprecisely to the song \u201cThat\u2019s All.\u201d Frank Sinatra was among the artists who sang the song, but it was written by Alan Brandt and Bob Haymes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Democrats Take to the Streets, Lawmakers Rush to Keep Up", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania left the Philadelphia Orchestra\u2019s 160th annual Academy of Music Concert and Ball and rushed to Philadelphia\u2019s airport, still clad in white tie and tails.Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts tore up their schedules to shout their way through impromptu speeches in airport concourses thronged with protesters.And some of those vying to lead the Democratic National Committee, sensing where the energy of the party was, made a beeline for Houston\u2019s airport on Saturday night after appearing at yet another desultory candidate forum at yet another hotel.But the fury is also spurring liberal voters to demand uncompromising confrontation and resistance from their elected officials to a president they believe poses an existential threat to the country. The Democrats\u2019 increasingly assertive base wants the party\u2019s leaders to eschew any cooperation with Mr. Trump: They are already expressing rage at some senators for confirming the president\u2019s cabinet appointees, and for their willingness to allow a vote on his pick for a vacant Supreme Court seat.Addressing activists on Sunday at a rally in Lower Manhattan, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, shed tears as he lamented Mr. Trump\u2019s refugee ban as an affront to democracy and pluralism. Later, he was met with chants of \u201cvote down his nominees!\u201d and a scattering of hecklers shouting \u201cvote Schumer out.\u201d\u201cThe Tea Party didn\u2019t really become a force until it started ousting Republicans it didn\u2019t feel represented them. That\u2019s clearly going to have to happen here,\u201d said Markos Moulitsas, the progressive activist who founded the Daily Kos website. \u201cDemocrats either need to feed, nurture and aggressively champion the resistance, or they need to get out of the way in favor of someone who will. The usual rules no longer apply.\u201dSome party elites are clearly getting the message. Mr. Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, hastily scheduled a Monday rally for House and Senate Democrats on the steps of the Supreme Court.\u201cI think the key for the Democratic Party is to show to a very powerful and dynamic coalition that we are hearing them and connecting to their issues,\u201d said former Representative Tom Perriello, who made a surprise entry into the Virginia governor\u2019s race after Mr. Trump\u2019s election and drove to Dulles International Airport from Richmond, Va., on Saturday to join the protests.The demands for purity from Democratic leaders are likely to grow only more unequivocal, and standing in solidarity with sign-waving protesters may prove insufficient. A rising chorus of liberals is pressuring senators to filibuster Mr. Trump\u2019s selection for the Supreme Court, which he has said he will announce this week.\u201cWhen it comes to the Supreme Court, eight is enough,\u201d said Representative Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who is one of the top contenders to be the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThey literally stole a Supreme Court justice from President Obama, so I see no reason why we should facilitate them putting in some right-wing extremist.\u201dBut some Democratic senators, including those facing re-election next year, are uneasy about forming a blockade against Mr. Trump\u2019s pick, as Senate Republicans did last year against Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland. Doing so could be fruitless, anyway. Mr. Trump has already encouraged Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to ram through new Senate rules that would allow a Supreme Court pick to be seated with a simple majority of 51 votes \u2014 the same rules change Democrats engineered in 2013 to end filibusters of virtually every presidential appointment besides a Supreme Court justice.\u201cI believe we must fulfill our constitutional responsibility to have a hearing and a vote,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a member of the Judiciary Committee, while urging Mr. Trump to choose a nominee \u201cin the mainstream.\u201dMs. Klobuchar, who stood on Sunday with members of her state\u2019s large Somali population, said she was not concerned that the party\u2019s base would turn on its elected officials.\u201cAs a whole, the 48 Democratic senators share their anger and passion and will pull the emergency brake on such things as the executive order, but also some compromise if there are areas we can find common-sense agreements,\u201d she said.In truth, fissures are already emerging among Senate Democrats. Some of the newer senators, including those who may be eyeing the presidency, are taking a more confrontational line. Senator Kamala D. Harris of California, who was elected last year, opposed the confirmations of Gen. John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security and former Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas as Central Intelligence Agency director. The senior senator from her state, Dianne Feinstein, who was first elected in 1992, supported them both.Even some of the Democrats most beloved by the left are proving vulnerable to increasingly pointed criticism about their handling of Mr. Trump. Ms. Warren faced searing anger from liberals last week over her willingness to vote for the confirmation of Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon and former Republican presidential candidate, for secretary of housing and urban development. Some activists at the national committee\u2019s meeting shouted that she had \u201csold us out\u201d when her name was mentioned.The scale and ferocity of the anger coming out of the Democratic base has astounded even some party veterans.\u201cThere is much more energy opposing Trump than there ever was in reaction to George W. Bush and the Iraq War,\u201d said Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist. \u201cI have never seen so much spontaneous grass-roots energy on the left.\u201d\u201cTim, this is great,\u201d former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont responded on Twitter, \u201cbut the Dems in the Senate actually have to do something about this stuff. You are being left behind by your base.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snapchat Discover Takes a Hard Line on Misleading and Explicit Images", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byThose kinds of risqu\u00e9 and misleading images will now be much less prominent on Discover because early on Monday, Snapchat updated its guidelines for publishers in a way that essentially cleans up what is shown on its news service.The new rules more explicitly restrict publishers from posting questionable pictures on Discover that do not have news or editorial value. Snapchat also clarified guidelines that prevent publishers from including reports or links to outside websites that could be considered fake news, saying that all content must be fact-checked and accurate.The changes aim to \u201cempower our editorial partners to do their part to keep Snapchat an informative, factual and safe environment for everyone,\u201d said Rachel Racusen, a spokeswoman for the company.Snapchat said it also planned to give publishers a tool in February that would allow them to age-gate content, or stop minors from seeing some content altogether.Snapchat is pre-emptively acting to limit those problems in a way that is reminiscent of how traditional media companies curate what they show people.\u201cSnapchat thinks about the role that its content plays in the lives of consumers differently,\u201d said Steven Kydd, one of the founders of Tastemade, an online food publication. \u201cThis is cable all over again, except for a mobile and global audience.\u201dCleaning up what is published on Discover could have many benefits for Snapchat, like helping the service appeal to advertisers, which would not have to worry as much that they would be advertising alongside inappropriate content for Snapchat\u2019s primary audience of teenagers and 20-somethings.The new rules could also whet investors\u2019 appetites for Snapchat if they help the company avoid the taints of fake news and online abuse that have dogged its rivals.\u201cIn this environment, every technology company that touches media is concerned about being vulnerable to connections to fake news and disinformation,\u201d said Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. \u201cThat\u2019s doubly true for a company planning for an I.P.O.\u201dFrom the start, Snapchat approached news differently from other social networks. While Facebook has said it is not a media company and does not want to be an arbiter of truth in news on its website, Snapchat has long prohibited false or deceptive content and is thoroughly involved in editorial standards for content on Discover.As a result, Snapchat has always exercised a large degree of control over Discover. To secure a place on Discover, publishers have had to agree to fairly stringent guidelines around editing and video production, including having audio play at a consistent volume and a ban on images that are misleading or gimmicky. Snapchat also mandated that all images and headlines be appropriate for an audience as young as 13 years old.Discover has grown quickly. More than 100 million Snapchat users view content on Discover each month, according to the company. While some publishers said people were initially slow to embrace Discover, interest has increased over the past year. Tastemade, which publishes different editions for different areas around the world on Discover, said it had been pleased enough with the size of its Snapchat audience that it planned to grow with Snapchat as it rolled out worldwide.While the lawsuit was dismissed in November because the sides agreed to settle, Snapchat said it had decided to take action in response to the litigation. It soon created a new tool, which Snapchat said it had been discussing for a while, that let publishers prevent Snapchat users who were under age 18 from seeing certain content.When people sign up for Snapchat, they must enter their age and a phone number that is confirmed by the service. Snapchat also reserves the right to gate content for youngsters, even if a publisher has chosen not to do so.In updating its publisher guidelines, Snapchat aimed to clarify vague language and provide more examples around its restrictions on the use of nudity, profanity and violent images.The new rules more clearly state that publishers should not use overly sexualized or violent images as the initial visual that users are exposed to when they look at Discover and that content intended simply to shock or disgust is not allowed. Some exceptions are made for otherwise-forbidden material that has news value.For the first time, the guidelines have a dedicated section detailing the warnings that publishers must run when graphic images are deemed newsworthy, as well as when to age-gate that content.Some of these updates came out of conversations that began months ago with several publishers that routinely published racier content, including The Daily Mail and Cosmopolitan, as well as news services that published controversial images.\u201cWe have been collaborating closely with all of our publishers, whose content has continued to evolve,\u201d said Nick Bell, Snapchat\u2019s vice president for content. \u201cWe want to be a great partner to all of our editorial partners, and updating our content guidelines to better reflect where our platform is today is an important part of that.\u201dOne of the publishers that talked with Snapchat about the new rules was Sweet, a pop-culture channel created by the media company Hearst, which said its viewership on Discover had grown substantially over the past few months. Ross Clark, Sweet\u2019s general manager and vice president, likened the updated guidelines to a parental advisory sticker on an album or to ratings on movies.\u201cThe media industry has always included clearly established content guidelines,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s what allows a platform to have a large, diverse set of users.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Raising a Transgender Child", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byIn September 2015, Vanessa and JR Ford sent a group email to announce that their 4-year-old, whom their family and friends knew as their son, would be starting prekindergarten that year as \u201cher true self\u201d \u2014 a girl named Ellie.The Fords\u2019 decision to help Ellie transition socially from boy to girl was not something they did on a whim. Starting well before age 4, Ellie showed countless signs of being unhappy as a boy: being sullen; drawing self-portraits as a stick-figure girl; pretending to be female superheroes; dressing up in princess costumes.\u201cFor Ellie, whenever she put on a dress, she would turn into a different person; she would smile at people and talk to people,\u201d Ms. Ford said. \u201cIt was such a profound change, we thought we had a son who would grow up to be a gay man. We were only thinking about sexuality because it didn\u2019t occur to us that gender identity was a part of this.\u201dThat is, until their family\u2019s \u201cFrozen\u201d-themed birthday party. When Ms. Ford said to her child, who was dressed in a Princess Elsa costume, \u201cYou\u2019re my favorite princess boy,\u201d the response was strikingly clear: \u201cMom, I\u2019m not a boy; I\u2019m a girl in my heart and my brain.\u201d\u201cBy the time Ellie gets to puberty, there will be a couple hundred kids who are 10 years into the study having already gone through puberty,\u201d Ms. Ford said. \u201cSo all of these questions around stability of gender, puberty blockers, cross sex hormones, impact in mental health \u2014 we\u2019re going to have such a better idea because of other kids who\u2019ve been surveyed.\u201d\u201cThe one really big thing that we know about human development is that feeling loved and supported is really important to the well-being of all children,\u201d Dr. Olson said.The Fords, who live in Washington, D.C., sought guidance from gender experts and mental health practitioners. Ellie, they said, was \u201cconsistent, insistent, and persistent\u201d in her gender identity, which experts say is a hallmark for those who are transgender \u2014 those whose gender identity does not align with the gender they were assigned at birth. An estimated 1.4 million adults in the United States currently identify themselves as transgender.The Fords felt certain that their child was not merely going through a phase. In fact, the Fords said, once she began to express herself and dress as she wished she immediately blossomed into a happier child. She chose the name Ellie, inspired by a favorite stuffed elephant.The Fords said they went public with their story because they feel it is important to raise awareness about transgender issues and to humanize and normalize gender nonconforming people.\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a real historical, cultural shift,\u201d said Christia Spears Brown, a professor of developmental psychology at the University of Kentucky and author of \u201cParenting Beyond Pink and Blue: How to Raise Your Kids Free of Gender Stereotypes.\u201d \u201cThe complexity of gender has always been there, we\u2019ve just long ignored that it\u2019s much more complex than we want it to be.\u201dThe response to National Geographic\u2019s issue reflects how divisive the topic is for many people. An editor\u2019s note on the magazine\u2019s website about its transgender cover girl, Avery Jackson, said: \u201cTens of thousands of people have weighed in with opinions, from expressions of pride and gratitude to utter fury. More than a few have vowed to cancel their subscriptions.\u201dThe Jacksons, who live in Kansas City, Mo., received hate mail and death threats via social media. As a result, they decided to step away from the public eye and, through a publicist, declined to be interviewed.But the Fords say they have had overwhelming support from their community. Still, they are acutely aware of the national climate and controversies surrounding transgender rights. They try to shield Ellie, but occasionally she will hear something on the radio about bathroom laws.\u201cThe very first question we got about growing up was, \u2018Daddy, do I have to have a man voice like you?\u2019\u201d Ms. Ford said. \u201cWe\u2019ve told her that we can help her, and medicine can help her be the girl and the woman she wants to be.\u201dThe Fords are optimistic, but they are also bracing themselves for possible struggles. To that end, they legally changed their child\u2019s name to Ellie the week before the inauguration in an event they called \u201cEllie\u2019s Forever Name Day.\u201d They consider it a first step in legally protecting her rights as a transgender person.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cyberwar for Sale", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "FeatureAfter a maker of surveillance software was hacked, its leaked documents shed light on a shadowy global industry that has turned email theft into a terrifying \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 political weapon. Supported byNow Lagunes was worried. Around 1 o\u2019clock, she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her. She reached him at a restaurant, where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies. \u201cI did not send you an email,\u201d he insisted. A consultant with the campaign \u2014 who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates \u2014 overheard the conversation. He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages: emails with vague subject lines, asking the recipient to review a document or click a link. The campaign, he realized, had been hacked.In the vote for party leader, Lagunes and her allies in Puebla \u2014 a two-hour drive southeast from Mexico City \u2014 were supporting the challenger, a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots. But the incumbent was backed by Puebla\u2019s powerful governor, Rafael Moreno Valle. One of Mexico\u2019s rising political stars, Moreno Valle is close to Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and has forged an alliance between PAN and Nieto\u2019s centrist Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI, long the dominant force in Mexican politics. Since winning the governorship in 2010, Moreno Valle\u2019s opponents say, his ambitions have grown, and he has resorted to increasingly harsh measures to keep Puebla state \u2014 including members of his own party \u2014 under control. \u201cIn the beginning, the governor was low-profile and respectful,\u201d Rafael Micalco, a former leader of PAN in Puebla state, told me. \u201cWhen he became governor, he transformed. Now he controls the party through threats.\u201dThis race to retain control of the party leadership in 2014 was a crucial test for the governor, who was rumored to be considering a run for Mexico\u2019s presidency in 2018. (This past September, Moreno Valle publicly announced his intent to run.) Clashes between the two camps were especially intense in Puebla, where backers of the challenger, Ernesto Cordero, claimed that the governor was using public money to support the incumbent, Gustavo Madero, though the governor\u2019s office has denied these charges. Shortly before the election, Madero\u2019s campaign manager said that Cordero\u2019s side was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the process. \u201cTheir strategy is clear from the outset,\u201d he said in an interview with a Mexican magazine. \u201c\u2009\u2018If I win, good. If not, I was cheated.\u2019\u2009\u201dAfter Lagunes\u2019s call on Election Day, her colleagues rushed from the restaurant back to their local headquarters, a hotel conference room that they had nicknamed \u201cthe bunker.\u201d All morning, they had been trying to reach their field network, a group of 40 Cordero canvassers who were working to get out the vote in Puebla state. But the field network seemed to have gone dark. Few of the canvassers were even answering their phones. Hackers, the team concluded, must have found the list of the canvassers\u2019 names and phone numbers \u2014 widely circulated by email within the campaign \u2014 and begun to intimidate them.\u201cThe day before,\u201d the consultant told me, the field network was \u201cmotivated and eager to do this work. After the hack, it was very hard to reach them. The few who did answer said that they had received phone calls saying that their lives were at stake. They were worried that if they went out, they or their families would get hurt.\u201dAccording to another worker on Cordero\u2019s campaign, who also requested anonymity, citing fear of reprisal, the message to the canvassers was simple and direct: \u201cWe know who you are. If you don\u2019t want any trouble, shut down your cellphone and stop your activity.\u201d The worker added: \u201cIt\u2019s an authoritarian regime.\u201dAnd so, like Lagunes, Podesta fell into a trap. The button appeared to lead to an official Google page, but it was in fact a meticulously personalized fake, with a domain address linked to a remote cluster of atolls in the South Pacific. The details were designed to trick Podesta into entering his password. This technique is known as \u201cspear phishing.\u201d It is an especially potent weapon against companies and political organizations because it needs to succeed only one time, against one target. After that, attackers can use the trusted identity of the first compromised account to more easily lure colleagues into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links. Not only will a working email password yield years of intraoffice chatter, invoices, credit-card bills and confidential memos; it can often be leveraged into control of other personal accounts \u2014 Twitter, Facebook, Amazon \u2014 and even access to company servers and internet domains.The White House, C.I.A. and F.B.I. have all claimed that, based on classified evidence, they can trace the hacks of Podesta\u2019s email account (and other hacks of people close to the Clinton campaign) back to the Russian government. But with the rise of private firms like Hacking Team, penetrating the email accounts of political opponents does not require the kind of money and expertise available to major powers. A subscription-based website called Insider Surveillance lists more than a dozen companies selling so-called ethical malware, including Milan-based Hacking Team and the German firms FinFisher and Trovicor. Compared with conventional arms, surveillance software is subject to few trade controls; a recent attempt by the United States to regulate it under a 41-country pact called the Wassenaar Arrangement failed. \u201cThe technology is morally neutral,\u201d says Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency. \u201cThe same program that you use to monitor your babysitter might be used by Bashar Assad or Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to keep track of whomever they don\u2019t like.\u201dHacking Team has fewer than 50 employees, but it has customers all over the world. According to internal documents, its espionage tool, which is called the Remote Control System, or R.C.S., can be licensed for as little as $200,000 a year \u2014 well within the budget of a provincial strongman. After it has been surreptitiously installed on a target\u2019s computer or phone, the Remote Control System can invisibly eavesdrop on everything: text messages, emails, phone and Skype calls, location data and so on. Whereas the N.S.A.\u2019s best-known programs grab data in transit from switching rooms and undersea cables, the R.C.S. acquires it at the source, right off a target\u2019s device, before it can be encrypted. It carries out an invisible, digitized equivalent of a Watergate-style break-in.The United States government is almost certainly the world\u2019s most formidable repository of hacking talent, but its most powerful cyberweapons are generally reserved for intelligence agencies and the military. This might explain why, according to company documents, at least two federal law-enforcement agencies have been Hacking Team clients: the F.B.I., beginning in 2011, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, beginning in 2012. The F.B.I. contract paid Hacking Team more than $700,000; the D.E.A. appears to have used the software to go after targets in Colombia.Documents show that the company has also sold its software to some of the world\u2019s most repressive governments. Some, like those of Honduras, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are Western allies. Other countries, like Uzbekistan and Turkey, have a more troubled relationship. A few are openly hostile to the West. Between 2012 and 2014, Hacking Team was paid nearly one million euros by the government of Sudan, a United States-designated state sponsor of terrorism. Even more notable, in light of recent events, is the three-year relationship that Hacking Team carried on with the F.S.B., one of Russia\u2019s main intelligence agencies. As with Puebla, Hacking Team used a middleman, a research agency called Kvant, to handle its sales to Russia. Between 2012 and 2014, the agency paid Hacking Team 451,000 euros to license the Remote Control System.Hacking Team claims that it draws the line at customers who commit \u201cgross human-rights abuses\u201d and that it sells exclusively to governments operating within the laws of their own countries. In at least one case, David Vincenzetti, Hacking Team\u2019s founder and chief executive, told a salesman to hold off on a potential Mexican client. \u201cWe sell to official, governmental LEAs\u201d \u2014 law-enforcement agencies \u2014 \u201cand security agencies ONLY,\u201d Vincenzetti wrote in an email. But at other times, a more casual attitude prevailed inside the company. \u201cIf one sells sandwiches to Sudan, he is not subject, as far as my knowledge goes, to the law,\u201d one Hacking Team lawyer wrote in an internal email. \u201cHacking Team should be treated like a sandwich vendor.\u201dWhen asked about its arrangements in various countries, the company responded that it \u201cdoes not comment on confidential business dealings.\u201d Its American spokesman, Eric Rabe, did tell me that neither Russia nor Sudan is a current Hacking Team customer. (The relationships, Rabe wrote, ended in 2014, Russia because \u201cthe Putin government evolved from one considered friendly to the West to a more hostile regime\u201d and Sudan \u201cbecause of concerns about the country\u2019s ability to use the system in accordance with the H.T. contract.\u201d) Separately, the company confirmed that the state of Puebla was, in fact, a former client.With the source code for the Remote Control System now public, the company and its clients had to stop using it temporarily. By the end of the year, though, Hacking Team had updated its product and was trying to rebuild its reputation. I was curious whether a company that profited from online breaches could recover from its own. Eric Rabe, the American spokesman, sounded eager to meet me for coffee in Philadelphia. A grandfather and former television-news anchor, he exudes square-jawed credibility. \u201cIf you disagree with someone on the internet,\u201d he said, of the Hacked Team files, with a wave of his hand, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to have a public-policy debate. Just go destroy them.\u201dA couple of months later, I went to Milan to visit Hacking Team\u2019s headquarters, a stately gray apartment building with boxes of limp flowers adorning a few of its sooty sills. Waiting to demonstrate the company\u2019s software were Rabe; Philippe Vinci, a company vice president; and Alessandro Scarafile, a young engineer. Scarafile had gathered a Dell desktop computer and three smartphones: iPhone, BlackBerry and Android. The screen from his own laptop, which represented the console of a client intelligence agency, was projected on the wall. Several icons represented the various streams of data that could potentially be acquired by gaining control of the target\u2019s computer: images from built-in cameras, sound from built-in mikes, screenshots, detailed records of applications opened and bitcoins transferred, a continuous log of location with latitude and longitude, and logs of address books, calendars, phone calls, Skype calls and passwords, as well as websites visited. A key logger recorded every key that was pressed. It was a lot to keep track of. Two other views, called \u201cline of events\u201d and \u201cline of actions,\u201d assembled the information into chronological order.Scarafile, who was playing both the customer and the target, or \u201cbad guy,\u201d turned on the Dell. Judging by the background on the desktop, a gothic scene framed by castlelike silhouettes, our target seemed to be planning a terrorist attack from Transylvania.Whatever the method of infection, the malicious code, known as an \u201cagent,\u201d then communicates with its masters anonymously, its dispatches routed through a series of dedicated servers scattered around the world. Even if the target gets suspicious and figures out that something is wrong, this chain of servers makes it nearly impossible for him to figure out exactly who is using Hacking Team\u2019s product to spy on him.For the demo, Scarafile opted for the third method, which he referred to as \u201ca bit of social engineering.\u201d Using the customer\u2019s computer, he sent the target an email with a Word file attached. Then he returned to the target\u2019s computer and double-clicked on it, just as Lagunes had clicked on the link in her inbox. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d he said, \u201cthis system is currently infected, or monitored, by the Remote Control System.\u201d It would remain so even if the suspect turned off his machine or logged out.On the timeline, the target appeared as a stubbly lout in an undershirt, named \u201cJimmy Page ... head of the terrorist cell.\u201d Using Jimmy Page\u2019s Dell, Scarafile logged into Page\u2019s Gmail, Facebook and Twitter. He opened up Skype, perused Page\u2019s criminal colleagues (Don Corleone, Harry Potter, Keyser Soze) and left one of them a voice mail message from Page\u2019s phone. Accessing a USB drive attached to the infected computer, Scarafile opened an encrypted file that turned out to contain an order to \u201ckill David Vincenzetti.\u201d R.C.S. captured it all, including periodic snapshots of Scarafile, as Page, at work.\u201cI don\u2019t like the words \u2018inject\u2019 and \u2018infect,\u2019\u2009\u201d Vinci, the vice president, said. \u201cR.C.S. is deploying the agent into the device of the target because you want to monitor some of his activities. Exactly the way that law enforcement is listening to some of your phone calls, right?\u201d\u201cI think the Iran deal is just terrible,\u201d Vincenzetti said, and then added, sarcastically, \u201cOh, it\u2019s such a very peaceful expansion. Very peaceful.\u201d\u201cThat is not an official company position,\u201d Rabe interjected.Vincenzetti, now 48, is a familiar type \u2014 a ferociously competitive, driven entrepreneur whose existence is organized around his work. He has a wife, who was born in Morocco, and no children. His small, heavy-lidded eyes can make him seem sleepily blas\u00e9. On the morning we met at Hacking Team\u2019s offices, he wore jeans, a navy-blue cardigan and a striped shirt, unbuttoned to midchest. He seemed more comfortable on his feet than sitting down. As we talked in a conference room, he periodically leapt to his feet and stalked around the table, considering in turn the espresso machine, the view from the window, a case of bottled water.\u201cIf I wanted to break into this room, how would I do it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere is a door, and there are two windows.\u201d He pressed his hands against the glass panes. \u201cThe perimeter is the first thing you must secure,\u201d he continued. Securing data was what he did earlier in his career. Now he had moved on. \u201cIf you cannot break into a bank, you cannot protect a bank. So when you are in security, really there is no difference between thinking offensively and defensively.\u201dIn the mid-1980s, Vincenzetti\u2019s parents, a salesman and a schoolteacher, bought him a Commodore 64, one of the earliest personal computers. He soon created a Pac-Man clone, a Tron lightcycle-style game and a text-based adventure game. As a computer-science student at the University of Milan in the \u201990s, he became fascinated by cryptography; he corresponded with programmers around the world about new cryptographic theories and wrote code for email encryption. In his senior year, he was appointed to administer the university\u2019s internal network, a post that was usually reserved for a graduate student. Vincenzetti remembers these early days as a time when \u201ceverything was free and no one was trying to harm you. We were wide open and accessible. All the best were called hackers, and I was a hacker.\u201dVincenzetti left university early and founded three companies, all of them focused on defensive cybersecurity. After he founded Hacking Team in 2003, he tried to sell his services to Italian police agencies but found them skeptical that Mafiosi and other high-level criminals would ever bother to encrypt their communications. In Italy, the police were also used to getting whatever they needed through wiretaps, arranged with varying degrees of formality through their contacts at telecommunications firms. But after the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which were coordinated via cellphones and the internet, police officers and intelligence agents not just in Italy but all across Europe became interested in contracting with offensive-hacking vendors, part of an emerging arms race over consumer-grade encryption. The growth of Skype made it easy for users to encrypt their communications, and the authorities were eager to pay for countermeasures like the Remote Control System. Singapore, Hacking Team\u2019s first non-European client, signed on in 2008. The company\u2019s Middle Eastern business took off in 2011, a boom that coincided with the beginning of the Arab Spring.All Hacking Team customers sign contracts agreeing to comply with local laws. The company says that it vets potential customers and studies reports from journalists and human-rights groups, looking for \u201cobjective evidence or credible concerns\u201d that its products are being abused. But when it comes to Hacking Team\u2019s own interactions with customers, leaked documents suggest that employees have sometimes turned a blind eye. In the case of the Puebla government and other Latin American customers, Hacking Team employees appeared to ignore warnings suggesting that the Remote Control System was being used to gather intelligence on the political opposition. On multiple occasions, customers emailed Hacking Team attachments with election-related content, including polling data, party registration forms and invitations addressed to and signed by elected officials. Rather than ask what these files had to do with fighting crime and drug trafficking, Hacking Team support-staff members simply emailed them back, as requested, with an embedded \u201cexploit,\u201d turning the document into a surveillance tool to be used against whomever it was sent on to. Asked about these cases, Rabe replied that customers \u201care not supposed to be using it for political purposes, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that an Italian computer programmer,\u201d i.e., a support technician, \u201cwould have seen these files and known what was going on. ... I think that\u2019s a stretch, that an Italian software guy could know that an individual is a dissident.\u201dShortly thereafter, R3D published three invoices from the Hacked Team cache showing that one state government \u2014 that of Jalisco, on the Pacific Coast \u2014 had paid the company nearly half a million euros for the Remote Control System. Soon other documents were found in the leak to implicate several more states, including Puebla, though most of the states denied ever using the software. (Jalisco later admitted to purchasing the system, which it claimed was for its prosecutor\u2019s office.) The story failed to get much traction in the Mexican press, except in Puebla, after R3D connected with Lado B, a small online-news collective there. The site\u2019s name translates to \u201cB Side,\u201d as in the back of a hit single \u2014 symbolizing its dedication to telling stories that would otherwise go untold.Lado B\u2019s editor, Ernesto Aroche, was not surprised that Puebla\u2019s government had been using the Remote Control System. In Moreno Valle\u2019s six years as governor there, he has spent lavishly on new surveillance systems, including multiple \u201csecurity arches,\u201d highway-spanning structures that scrutinize traffic with video cameras and X-rays, and whose cost had raised some questions in the local press. Beginning in 2013, Aroche began noticing solicitations on the Puebla-state website for hidden cameras and other spying equipment. When he filed a public-records request about them, the government\u2019s form response indicated that these orders had never been filled, but Aroche was skeptical, given the mounting evidence that Moreno Valle\u2019s administration had begun using its security apparatus for political purposes. There were periodic break-ins of homes belonging to dissident politicians and journalists, with the burglars sometimes taking little besides their victims\u2019 laptops. Politicians would answer calls from unknown numbers, only to hear their own taped conversations played back to them. Another journalist, Fernando Maldonado, received an unmarked envelope full of what were purportedly transcripts of 400 private phone calls made by Puebla politicians.As Aroche and R3D sifted through the Hacked Team file dump, they discovered that the files on Puebla had more detail than those dealing with Hacking Team\u2019s other Mexican accounts. The Puebla client often wrote emails asking for help with infecting a particular document with a malicious virus. Some of these came from an account \u2014 soporteuiamx@gmail.com \u2014 that also appears in many of Hacking Team\u2019s internal support tickets. One of those tickets documents a client\u2019s request for help in infecting an attachment: an invitation to attend an event for a Mexican political organization, signed by Violeta Lagunes and addressed to another party colleague opposed to the governor.Aroche interviewed politicians and journalists who were on the receiving end of the infected emails contained in the Hacked Team trove. According to a 2015 article that Lado B published in conjunction with a politics website, the Puebla group sent Hacking Team at least 47 requests to infect specific files that it would then forward on to their targets. Almost all of those files had to do with political issues. Going through the Hacked Team materials, Aroche found the name of a Puebla government employee who seemed to be working within the spying operation. \u201cBefore, we had been talking about ghosts,\u201d Aroche told me. \u201cNow, we could prove it. We started putting names on the actors.\u201dMore than a year later, there have been no political repercussions for the governor or his allies in Puebla. I met Aroche this fall at the Lado B offices, a small room facing a courtyard in a crumbling stone building from Puebla\u2019s colonial days. The only suggestion of Lado B\u2019s presence was a small sticker on the window. Inside, Aroche was thumbing through an envelope of documents that he had wrung out of the state government. Two redacted contracts signed by Puebla officials showed an arrangement between the state government and a company called Sym Servicios Integrales, which Aroche\u2019s reporting had identified as an intermediary for Hacking Team. The details of what had been purchased were redacted. \u201cThese contracts demonstrate that the Puebla government had a commercial relationship with this company,\u201d Aroche said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if they\u2019re a little bit stained \u2014 I dropped some coffee on them.\u201d (Sym Servicios Integrales says it \u201cnever sold H.T. technology to the state of Puebla.\u201d)In a brief written statement from Sagrario Conde Valerio, a spokeswoman, the government of Puebla denied allegations of spying and claimed that \u201cno relationship exists nor has ever existed between the government of Puebla and the company \u2018Hacking Team.\u2019\u2009\u201d The government declined to respond further to a list of questions.But a former official from Moreno Valle\u2019s administration claimed to me that more than $1 million was being diverted from the state budget each year to fund the political-espionage unit. Documents from the Hacked Team archive indicate that Hacking Team received an order from the government of Puebla for 415,000 euros in the spring of 2013, and that Hacking Team booked hotel rooms for three of its associates who traveled to Puebla in May of that year.Some of the R.C.S. training, I was told, took place in a green building on a residential street. When I visited the purported site this fall, lettering above the door said that the building was once a school. Now it had bars across the door and mirrored windows. Neighbors told me it had been abandoned for several months. \u201cPeople would come and go,\u201d one woman said. \u201cThey were very secretive. They would drop off equipment, take away equipment. Then one day, about a year ago, they came and took everything away and left.\u201d Another neighbor said that he often saw a state-police car parked in front of the house and a man with a limp entering and leaving \u2014 a former Mexican intelligence agent, according to someone who was present during the Hacking Team training.Mexico is Hacking Team\u2019s biggest export market, accounting for nearly six million euros in sales, according to leaked documents. Ostensibly, the Remote Control System is intended for fighting criminals and drug traffickers there. (\u201cThere have been reports that the software was used in the apprehension of Chapo Guzman,\u201d Rabe told me, referring to the Mexican drug lord. \u201cI can\u2019t confirm it.\u201d) The files indicate that at least seven other Mexican state governments were Hacking Team clients, but because they did not use email to the same extent as Puebla, their activities are harder to track. Multiple former Hacking Team employees told me that abuses of the software were not limited to Puebla. One former employee described having the system set up inside a mayor\u2019s office.Katitza Rodr\u00edguez, international-rights director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Mexican law allows for interception of communication, like the wiretapping of phone lines, but it does not grant precise legal authority to use new, powerful invasive tools like those created by Hacking Team. And she argues that it is much more dangerous in Mexico than in other Western countries, where checks and balances are stronger. \u201cThis is much more intrusive than the interception of a phone call,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are not only listening; they are taking over your laptop. Mexico needs to have a full debate in Congress about what legal safeguards are needed for this kind of surveillance or if the government should be using it at all.\u201dAmerican expansion by companies like Hacking Team may not face much resistance from the federal government, which is becoming more accepting of electronic surveillance as part of normal police work. Last year, the Justice Department successfully changed the rules of criminal procedure, making it easier for federal agents to hack into multiple computers with a single warrant. Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who tried to block the change, complained that it gives \u201cunlimited power for unlimited hacking.\u201d In a 2014 address, now referred to in cybersecurity circles as his \u201cGoing Dark\u201d speech, the F.B.I.\u2019s director, James Comey, argued that the encryption built into Apple products posed a threat to public safety \u2014 enabling not only terrorism but also drug trafficking, child abuse and hit-and-runs. Instead of \u201ca safe that can\u2019t be cracked,\u201d Comey wanted technology companies to lend him the combination. \u201cThe law hasn\u2019t kept pace with technology, and this disconnect has created a significant public-safety problem,\u201d Comey said. \u201cWe call it \u2018going dark.\u2019\u2009\u201dAs the United States government has argued for weaker protections around personal communications, American businesses have been spreading more powerful surveillance tools around the world. Many foreign law-enforcement agencies already buy electronic-surveillance products from SS8 \u2014 a company backed by the storied venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers \u2014 as well as from the Harris Corporation, a $13 billion company based in Florida and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. At least 25 American police departments have used Harris\u2019s Stingray device, which mimics cellphone towers and can intercept cellphone calls within 200 meters. All known sales of Stingrays to local law enforcement have been authorized by the F.B.I., which has since fought in court to keep those sales secret. In Baltimore alone, Stingrays have been used more than 4,000 times, in routine drug investigations. Much less is known about another Harris product, the advanced Hailstorm, which is also sold to local police departments. Hailstorm is reportedly capable of implanting malware that can take control of a targeted phone, much like Hacking Team\u2019s R.C.S.The Hacked Team documents that offer the most revealing view of the company\u2019s ethos happen to be the most public ones. For years, as often as two or three times a day, Vincenzetti sent mass emails to hundreds of his business contacts. The recipients included numerous members of the United States military and intelligence community, as well as government employees from the city of Cincinnati and the Internal Revenue Service. In these messages, Vincenzetti often addresses this audience collectively as \u201cgents.\u201d The news he cites is a reminder of how the geopolitical winds have been blowing in favor of Hacking Team and other self-described allies of law and order. In Vincenzetti\u2019s world, the system is always, as George Tenet famously said about pre-Sept. 11 intelligence, \u201cblinking red\u201d: the imploding Middle East; a restive, nuclear-armed Russia; battalions of ISIS-trained jihadis roaming around Europe with their encrypted thumb drives and dark-web expertise. Against this backdrop of ever-increasing danger, concerns about human rights are na\u00efve at best.Vincenzetti\u2019s emails vividly exploit this sense of danger and alarm. He writes about shadowy gangs of Iranian hackers using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag to inject malware into French laptops. He celebrates the conviction of Ross Ulbricht, a.k.a. the Dread Pirate Roberts, creator of the Silk Road website. After the arrests of two Uzbek men in Brooklyn for telling informants that they wanted to join up with ISIS, Vincenzetti writes of \u201ca very serious terrorist plot on American soil foiled.\u201dHe went on to tap out this sales pitch:The time has come for a technologically MORE SOPHISTICATED, and much more effective, internet supervision ... something capable to penetrate the core of the terrorists\u2019 HIDDEN forums. And such a (quite unique) technology EXISTS.The following day, he gave a few more hints:I am talking about a NEW technology capable of neutralizing their encryption-based protective layers in order to track them, identify them, locate them, chase them and finally bust them. Something operating on a massive scale. Something different. I am talking about a novel, superior, next-generation mass-surveillance technology.The tone of Vincenzetti\u2019s sales patter was strangely upbeat, especially considering his dire forecasts. It was almost as if he were in the business of selling microwave ovens or sandwiches, not tools through which the private lives of criminals (and whoever else) could be fully laid bare.Vincenzetti\u2019s unstated equation \u2014 privacy is secrecy, and secrecy is terrorism \u2014 is less controversial than it might appear. A supportive echo can be heard in many public statements from American officials, which Vincenzetti often cut and pasted into his mass emails. The former attorney general Eric Holder called for \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial tools that allow us to be pre-emptive.\u201d When Comey warned that \u201cencryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place,\u201d Vincenzetti forwarded it along approvingly, with the tagline: \u201cWe DO have an answer to many if not all of his concerns.\u201d And when, in May 2015, Comey warned of a \u201cthreat\u201d that had \u201cmorphed\u201d into \u201ca chaotic spider web,\u201d Vincenzetti sent word to his \u201cgents\u201d as well.One month later, an anonymous hack revealed Hacking Team\u2019s own invisible spider web, and one year later, during the run-up to Election Day, came the internal emails of the Democratic Party. By then it was clear that tools for digital burglary had spread well beyond the hands of regular police officers. Comey had argued for weaker safes; Vincenzetti was selling longer crowbars. They could be used to chase Jimmy Page, arrest Chapo Guzman, fight crime, smear a political opponent or just keep tabs on someone, anyone. To be hidden is to be a terrorist \u2014 this was the heart of his pitch. Any digital redoubt that could resist being pried open was a public risk and a private opportunity.An article on Jan. 8 about surveillance software erroneously included one company among those that sell so-called ethical malware. The Israeli company Nice no longer sells such software; it sold its intelligence division in May 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Toasts Away His Presidency With Tears and Thanks", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With just hours left in his presidency, Barack Obama toasted about 30 of his closest advisers in the private second-floor residence of the White House \u2014 one final chance for a departing president to say goodbye.Champagne flute in hand, Mr. Obama offered a rare peek at his family\u2019s quarters on Thursday night, by then already stripped of personal artwork that had hung for years. Mr. Obama showed off the Gettysburg Address and a bust of Winston Churchill, and the group lingered until about 11 p.m. on the Truman Balcony, overlooking the National Mall where thousands would gather the next morning for Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration.Those who celebrated then with Mr. Obama \u2014 and gathered again on Friday with about 2,000 political appointees at Joint Base Andrews \u2014 were the truest of the believers during eight years in which hope was repeatedly tested and change often proved difficult.\u201cFor all of you who have just done amazing, remarkable work, most of it unheralded, most of it without fanfare, most of it without you getting any word of thanks, we could not be prouder of you,\u201d Mr. Obama said before leaving for a family vacation in Palm Springs, Calif.The tears flowed freely Friday as the former president\u2019s aides waved and cheered, almost as if doing so might somehow prolong a historic moment in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 and prevent the arrival of another. Few of them wanted to make the 25-minute drive back to Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington anytime soon.But as the jet roared down the runway for takeoff, it became clear that the Obama era in America had passed, and with it an approach to public life that is unlikely to be repeated soon.\u201cThey went out the way they came in,\u201d said Cody Keenan, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief speechwriter, who attended the going-away at Andrews. \u201cIt was graceful and dignified and generous and warm to everyone who worked for them.\u201dNot everyone shares the sorrow of the people who gathered at Andrews. Many of those wearing bright red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats as they arrived in Washington for Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural were all too happy to see Mr. Obama go.Many viewed the 44th president as self-important, inexperienced and far too Hollywood for their tastes. To his rivals and critics, the eight years of Obama brought I.R.S. scandals, Benghazi, Hillary Clinton\u2019s home-brew email, too much focus on gays and immigrants, too few jobs, and a world suddenly on fire.But members of both political parties in Washington are likely to agree that the city will be a different place without the Obamas living in the White House.When the family entered their new home in 2009, they brought with them two precocious young girls, a bouncing puppy, modern art and a new swing set on the South Lawn. Michelle Obama dug a vegetable garden and sponsored a farmer\u2019s market a few blocks from the White House.Those early days were a blur, as Mr. Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress confronted global economic collapse. From the Oval Office, the president and his hard-charging staff pushed through a spending bill, an auto bailout, and a health care overhaul that would become a political albatross for years.In the years that followed, America got used to Mr. Obama\u2019s long speeches, dazzling state dinners, endless weekends at the golf course and the occasional surprise walk outside the White House gates, a moment that frustrated aides described with the phrase \u201cthe bear is loose.\u201dGridlock also followed in the nation\u2019s capital. Never one to cultivate close relationships with lawmakers, Mr. Obama found his legislative agenda largely stymied after 2010, when Republicans took control of the House of Representatives. Frustrated, Mr. Obama used the power of his office to push through his agenda.Much of that agenda is now at risk. As the helicopter carrying Mr. Obama from the Capitol lifted off after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, the new president was already signaling his intention to use those same executive powers to reverse what his predecessor had done.First, though, came the traditional tea on Friday morning among Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and their wives at the White House. Then the two men rode together in the armored presidential limousine for the brief trip to the Capitol for Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in and speech.As the handoff of power approached, Mr. Obama\u2019s supporters took to Twitter to recall his years in the White House, adding #ThankYouObamas to their remembrances. The hashtag quickly became a top trend across the nation.In a series of his own Twitter messages on Friday morning, Mr. Obama said goodbye publicly and directed followers to a video message seeking suggestions for building a foundation to create what he called a \u201cliving, working center for citizenship.\u201dMr. Obama left a private note for Mr. Trump, continuing a tradition that past presidents have followed for decades. He also left a public note for the American people on his Facebook page.\u201cWhen the arc of progress seems slow, remember: America is not the project of any one person,\u201d Mr. Obama wrote, a thinly veiled reference to his successor. \u201cThe single most powerful word in our democracy is the word \u2018We.\u2019 \u2018We the People.\u2019 \u2018We shall overcome.\u2019\u201dHe ended the note as he began his campaign, with three words: \u201cYes, we can.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Warsaw Grapples With Gloomy, Gray Smog", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byWarsaw JournalWARSAW \u2014 Michal Czekala\u2019s job chopping down trees keeps the 21-year-old out in the fresh air pretty much all day long. But after hearing news recently that the air was far from fresh, that in fact record-high smog was enveloping the entire nation, he decided to take a week off work.Warsaw city officials reacted by making all public transportation free last Monday, in an attempt to keep cars off the roads, and warned residents to stay indoors unless necessary. Pollution levels eventually dropped off toward the end of the week.The issue, though, is not just cars and coal. Warsaw\u2019s spike in air pollution was driven largely by a severe cold snap that forced thousands of private households, especially the most destitute ones, to crank up poor quality heaters that burn things like coal and garbage to beat back the winter chill.\u201cEighty percent of all households in Warsaw are connected to a district heating network,\u201d said Michal Olszewski, deputy mayor of Warsaw. \u201cThe problem is the remaining 20 percent that often use these low-tech heating systems.\u201dAccording to Poland\u2019s Central Statistical Office, this could be the case in over 150,000 households in a city with 1.7 million residents.The situation got out of hand in the first week of January after a Siberian blast poured into the region and temperatures dropped below zero Fahrenheit. People overworked their heaters, and an absence of wind caused the smog to squat gloomily over the capital.On average, readings of fine particulates in the air exceeded Polish environmental norms by fourfold, at some points reaching 1,000 percent of the norms.High smog levels, Warsaw authorities warned, could be especially dangerous for children, older residents, pregnant women and people with existing health issues.Szymon Wisniak, 33, a financial expert, left his car at home on Monday so he wouldn\u2019t \u201ccontribute to this mess of a situation.\u201dAs he was waiting for a train in the city center on Monday night, he said that more than half of his Facebook feed was about the smog.\u201cMany of my friends and I woke up to this smoky smell in our houses,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first, I thought something was on fire, but then I looked out the window and there was this scary grayness.\u201dOther regions in Poland are even worse. In the southern city of Rybnik, alarming air pollution levels led officials to offer free public transportation and shut down schools and kindergartens.Magdalena Urban, a 25-year-old marketing specialist in Warsaw, said on Monday evening that she had been suffering from a headache since last Sunday.\u201cIt hurts around the temples and I\u2019m constantly feeling nauseated,\u201d Ms. Urban said as she went grocery shopping in Zabki, a town just outside the capital. \u201cI\u2019m going out shopping because I don\u2019t know what else to do. This has all been so sudden.\u201dBeata Szydlo, the prime minister, said on Monday that her government was going to work on ways of reducing a problem that \u201cis so very burdensome for the Polish citizens,\u201d though she did not provide any specifics.Mr. Olszewski said that the mayor\u2019s office was already doing a lot to tackle the problem, but it needs \u201ctools that only the central government can provide.\u201d\u201cPoland\u2019s economy needs to be decarbonized, but the government does the complete opposite,\u201d Mr. Olszewski said. \u201cPlus, they take away our environmental competences. Only recently they lifted restrictions on tree felling in Warsaw and we can\u2019t even say no to that.\u201dMs. Jedrasik said that first of all, regulations needed to be put in place regarding the quality of fuel and furnaces people use in their houses, as well as the building insulation.\u201cAnd then,\u201d she said, \u201cwe need effective ways of executing those rules and ensuring that people comply with them.\u201dKonstanty Radziwill, the Polish health minister, caused controversy at the beginning of the year \u2014 before the pollution levels radically increased \u2014 when he called the smog \u201ca theoretical problem\u201d and said that \u201cthere are no reasons for panic,\u201d and besides \u201cour lifestyle is much more damaging.\u201d\u201cSomeone who breathes in air smoking a cigarette, with fumes and everything that comes with it, is in a position in which complaining about poor air quality is not credible at all,\u201d Mr. Radziwill told a private radio station, Tok FM.\u201cThink of your children smoking a couple of cigarettes a day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that bad.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Give Them a Hand: Puppet Artists Are Having a Moment", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 A shop vacuum became a lover; suction was involved. Feet turned into faces. A great fanged creature appeared with a man inside. Ghostly villagers assembled, silent and wreathed with smoke as their buildings burned and burned.A city where the dominant stage aesthetic for years was a kind of red-meat realism \u2014 think Steppenwolf Theater Company, which unleashed John Malkovich on the world \u2014 might not seem to be a place where puppetry would flourish. Yet the very existence of last month\u2019s festival, and the eagerness with which dozens of institutions across Chicago have embraced it since its start in 2015, is emblematic of a development long in the making on American stages.If, in theater \u2014 as in opera and dance, where it has also been making inroads \u2014 puppetry most often plays a supporting rather than starring role, it has a much greater presence than it once did.And the puppets are marching right through.You can see the shift in The New York Times, with mention of puppets now commonplace in theater reviews. But then, New York is the puppetry capital of America, where boundary-pushing directors like Lee Breuer and Julie Taymor have spent decades harnessing that hybrid art \u2014 part visual, part performance \u2014 to create fantastical worlds heavily influenced by foreign traditions.Exposing Chicago artists to international work is part of the impetus for the festival. Mr. Thomas, 54, intends to fill some of the void left by the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater, which ran in New York from 1992 to 2000, and the International Theater Festival of Chicago, which in the late 1980s ignited his love of puppetry with a visit from a Barcelona company. That event changed Chicago, Mr. Thomas said, by showing artists and audiences what the standard was elsewhere.\u201cThey\u2019re not second-class anymore,\u201d she said from Britain, where she was attending the London International Mime Festival, which routinely also includes puppetry.On my Sunday morning in Chicago, I went to the Instituto Cervantes for a children\u2019s show by the Italian company Teatro dei Piedi and watched Veronica Gonzalez, a virtuoso of the form, create a succession of joyous vignettes starring puppets made from her own costumed feet. It is astonishing how expressive toes can be.\u201cAll of that was really important to my cultural identity growing up,\u201d she said.Now 31, she has worked at Redmoon Theater, which Mr. Thomas co-founded, and has been a member of his troupe Blair Thomas & Co. She extolled the Chicago scene, noting \u201ca plethora of young companies who either explicitly do puppetry\u201d or use puppetry and object work \u201cto create moments of spectacle\u201d and effects that aren\u2019t possible to achieve onstage with human bodies.That defiance of realism, of course, is part of puppets\u2019 potency. The figures embrace metaphor, and we fill in the blanks with our willingness to believe.Last year, when the Henson Foundation raised its grant levels, applications rose about 80 percent. Meanwhile, Ms. Henson said, puppeteers have a better shot at getting financial support from general arts funders and at being included in performance festivals than they used to.But he did acknowledge \u201ca cumulative effect\u201d of \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d \u201cAvenue Q,\u201d \u201cWar Horse\u201d and the Henson festival in shaping public perception \u2014 persuading adults that puppetry isn\u2019t just kid stuff. \u201c\u2018Made in China\u2019 could not have played in the same way 25 years ago,\u201d he said.Mr. Anton performed his puppet plays for no more than 18 people at once and did not allow them to be filmed or photographed. His art is the purest of pure, and there is something sacred and beautiful about it. But also, in its hermeticism, a tinge of sadness.Because in Mr. Anton\u2019s time, in America, puppetry for grown-ups wasn\u2019t on the margins entirely by choice. There wasn\u2019t much call for it center stage.\u201cPuppetry\u2019s kind of an underdog,\u201d Mr. Thomas told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve always existed on the periphery of the dominant culture. In some ways that\u2019s our strength.\u201dIs it, though? Not everything has to be a popular art. Not everything can be. But sophisticated puppetry appears to be moving swiftly in that direction. So far, it\u2019s gaining power as it goes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Story About Fake News Is Partisanship", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byFact FreeThat seems a well-founded worry. Partisan bias now operates more like racism than mere political disagreement, academic research on the subject shows. And this widespread prejudice could have serious consequences for American democracy.The partisan divide is easy to detect if you know where to look. Consider the thinly disguised sneer in most articles and editorials about so-called fake news. The very phrase implies that the people who read and spread the kind of false political stories that swirled online during the election campaign must either be too dumb to realize they\u2019re being duped or too dishonest to care that they\u2019re spreading lies.But the fake-news phenomenon is not the result of personal failings. And it is not limited to one end of the political spectrum. Rather, Americans\u2019 deep bias against the political party they oppose is so strong that it acts as a kind of partisan prism for facts, refracting a different reality to Republicans than to Democrats.Partisan refraction has fueled the rise of fake news, according to researchers who study the phenomenon. But the repercussions go far beyond stories shared on Facebook and Reddit, affecting Americans\u2019 faith in government \u2014 and the government\u2019s ability to function.The power of partisan biasIn 2009, Sean Westwood, then a Stanford Ph.D. student, discovered that partisanship was one of the most powerful forces in American life. He got annoyed with persistent squabbles among his friends, and he noticed that they seemed to be breaking along partisan lines, even when they concerned issues that ostensibly had nothing to do with politics.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect political conflict to spill over from political aspects of our lives to nonpolitical aspects of our lives, and I saw that happening in my social group,\u201d said Mr. Westwood, now a professor at Dartmouth.He wondered if this was a sign that the role of partisanship in American life was changing. Previously, partisan conflict mostly applied to political issues like taxes or abortion. Now it seemed, among his acquaintances at least, to be operating more like racism or sexism, fueling negative or positive judgments on people themselves, based on nothing more than their party identification.Curious, Mr. Westwood looked at the National Election Study, a long-running survey that tracks Americans\u2019 political opinions and behavior. He found that until a few decades ago, people\u2019s feelings about their party and the opposing party were not too different. But starting in the 1980s, Americans began to report increasingly negative opinions of their opposing party.Since then, that polarization has grown even stronger. The reasons for that are unclear. \u201cI suspect that part of it has to do with the rise of constant 24-hour news,\u201d Mr. Westwood said, \u201cand also the shift that we\u2019ve unfortunately gone through in which elections are more or less now a permanent state of affairs.\u201dThat is a sea change in the role of partisanship in public life, Mr. Westwood said.\u201cPartisanship, for a long period of time, wasn\u2019t viewed as part of who we are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t core to our identity. It was just an ancillary trait. But in the modern era we view party identity as something akin to gender, ethnicity or race \u2014 the core traits that we use to describe ourselves to others.\u201dBut it has also made the political personal. Today, political parties are no longer just the people who are supposed to govern the way you want. They are a team to support, and a tribe to feel a part of. And the public\u2019s view of politics is becoming more and more zero-sum: It\u2019s about helping their team win, and making sure the other team loses.How partisan bias fuels fake newsPartisan tribalism makes people more inclined to seek out and believe stories that justify their pre-existing partisan biases, whether or not they are true.\u201cIf I\u2019m a rabid Trump voter and I don\u2019t know much about public affairs, and I see something about some scandal about Hillary Clinton\u2019s aides being involved in an assassination attempt, or that story about the pope endorsing Trump, then I\u2019d be inclined to believe it,\u201d Mr. Iyengar said. \u201cThis is reinforcing my beliefs about the value of a Trump candidacy.\u201dAnd Clinton voters, he said, would be similarly drawn to stories that deride Mr. Trump as a demagogue or a sexual predator.Sharing those stories on social media is a way to show public support for one\u2019s partisan team \u2014 roughly the equivalent of painting your face with team colors on game day.\u201cYou want to show that you\u2019re a good member of your tribe,\u201d Mr. Westwood said. \u201cYou want to show others that Republicans are bad or Democrats are bad, and your tribe is good. Social media provides a unique opportunity to publicly declare to the world what your beliefs are and how willing you are to denigrate the opposition and reinforce your own political candidates.\u201d\u201cThere are many, many decades of research on communication on the importance of source credibility,\u201d said John Sides, a professor at George Washington University who studies political communication.How much confidence would the participant have that the other player would give some of the money back? They found that participants gave more money if they were told the other player supported the same political party as they did.Partisanship\u2019s influence on trust means that when there is a partisan divide among experts, Mr. Sides said, \u201cyou get people believing wildly different sets of facts.\u201dBeyond fake news: how the partisan divide affects politicsThe fake news that flourished during the election is a noticeable manifestation of that dynamic, but it\u2019s not what experts like Mr. Iyengar and Mr. Westwood find most worrying. To them, the bigger concern is that the natural consequence of this growing national divide will be a feedback loop in which the public\u2019s bias encourages extremism among politicians, undermining public faith in government institutions and their ability to function.Politicians \u201chave an incentive to attack, to go after their opponents, to reveal to their own side that they are good members of the tribe, that they are saying all the right things,\u201d Mr. Iyengar said. \u201cThis is an incentive for Republicans and Democrats in Congress to behave in a hyperpartisan manner in order to excite their base.\u201dThat feeds partisan bias among the public by reinforcing the idea that the opposition is made up of bad or dangerous people, which then creates more demand for political extremism.The result is an environment in which compromise and collaboration with the opposing party are seen as signs of weakness, and of being a bad member of the tribe.\u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle,\u201d Mr. Iyengar said. \u201cAll of this is going to make policy-making and fact-finding more problematic.\u201dHe already sees it affecting politicians\u2019 partisan response to Russia\u2019s election interference, for instance: \u201cThe Republicans are going to resist the notion that there was an intervention by the Russians that may have benefited Trump, because it is an inconvenient act. Whereas the Democrats are obviously motivated to seize upon that as a plausible account of what occurred.\u201dMr. Westwood agreed. When Russia intervened in the American election, \u201cfor a lot of voters it was to help defeat Hillary Clinton, so it\u2019s not surprising that many Republicans see that as righteous.\u201d\u201cTo be clich\u00e9, the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\u201d he said.Already, partisan bias is undermining confidence in the last election. \u201cWe saw some symptoms of that in this last campaign,\u201d Mr. Iyengar said. \u201cYou begin to have doubts about the legitimacy of the election. And you begin to view the outcome as somehow contaminated or tainted. And you had all of Trump\u2019s comments about how he would not concede if the election went to Clinton, and then you had all the people demonstrating.\u201dNow, \u201cyou have quite a few people who are willing to call into question an institution for centuries that has been sacrosanct,\u201d Mr. Iyengar said.Mr. Westwood was even more pessimistic. \u201cThe consequences of that are insane,\u201d he said, \u201cand potentially devastating to the norms of democratic governance.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think things are going to get better in the short term; I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get better in the long term. I think this is the new normal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ailing Vermont Town Pins Hopes on Mideast Refugees", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byRUTLAND, Vt. \u2014 They hustled into the church on a biting winter evening, unburdened themselves of scarves and gloves, and settled into pews to sound out words in Arabic.\u201cAhlan fii Rutland,\u201d said Fran Knapp, a retiree who lives about 20 minutes away, one of two or three dozen people who have attended a class here on rudimentary Arabic.Welcome to Rutland. It was one of many preparations this remote city in central Vermont is making before 100 refugees from Syria and Iraq arrive here over the next year, with the first expected to come later this month.The plan\u2019s fiercest advocate has been the mayor of Rutland, Christopher Louras, who has cited not the moral argument for resettling refugees, but an economic one: This shrinking city, long removed from its heyday as a marble producer and regional railroad hub, needs every new resident it can get. Syrian refugees, he has said, are an opportunity.\u201cRutland\u2019s demographic condition right now is not just one of a declining population, but it\u2019s also a graying population,\u201d said Mr. Louras, who became the mayor about 10 years ago as a Republican, but has since become an independent. \u201cWe need people,\u201d he added.Immigration is part of the history of every American city. But experts say that in recent years, some towns and cities, reeling from shifts in the economy and declining populations, have focused anew on potential economic benefits from refugee resettlement, even as immigration has become a subject of partisan political battles.\u201cOver the last couple of decades, especially in the last 10 years, places have started to develop strategies to attract and retain immigrants and resettle refugees in order to boost their economic activity,\u201d said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who has studied refugee resettlement in American cities.Refugees are a small subset of immigrants, and many cities that have made a point of welcoming them say that they do so primarily for humanitarian, not economic, reasons. But as cities in the Rust Belt, like Pittsburgh and Dayton, Ohio, and in other parts of the country, like Maine and upstate New York, set up offices to connect immigrants and refugees with services and job opportunities, advocates say economic benefits have arisen as a result.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a few neighborhoods kind of turn around because of immigrants and refugees moving in,\u201d said Melissa Bertolo, the coordinator for one such support group, Welcome Dayton. She added that cities in the Rust Belt are \u201call looking at how immigrant integration plays a part in the revitalization of a city.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019re right on the beginning of the cusp of serious, serious labor problems,\u201d said Mr. Woolf, who added that the state\u2019s unemployment rate, at 3.6 percent, was a sign of more trouble to come. \u201cWe\u2019re low because there\u2019s nobody available to work.\u201dNowhere is that more pronounced, Mr. Woolf said, than Rutland County, here in the center of the state, which has lost residents since 2000. The city of Rutland has 15,824 residents, according to an estimate by the United States Census Bureau, which said the city had lost 4 percent of its population since 2010. The highest population for Rutland recorded by the Census Bureau was 19,293, in 1970.It is a striking community, lately hobbled by isolation: There are mountains on the horizon, but the city is an hour from major highways. Its status as a railroad hub and a marble powerhouse is long gone, and recent decades have seen the loss of major factory employers.\u201cIt hit a peak, it leveled off, and now we\u2019re trying to find ourselves,\u201d said Will Notte, 45, the president of the board of selectmen and a fifth-generation Rutlander who supports the refugee proposal.But city leaders are worried that population loss could make it harder for the remaining major employers, like General Electric plants that make parts for aircraft engines and the Rutland Regional Medical Center, to stay. They are putting $100,000 toward a $200,000 effort from local economic development groups to market the area and draw more residents.Syrian refugees, business leaders say, could become an integral part of that effort, both by adding to the population \u2014 if only slightly \u2014 and bringing cultural diversity that they hope will attract younger residents.\u201cI saw that as an opportunity to grow our population, bring in individuals, families, new Americans from Syria who have a strong work ethic, who were fleeing for their lives and looking to rebuild those shattered lives,\u201d Mr. Louras said.Many members of Rutland First say that they are not biased or xenophobic, as their critics have said, but that they have economic concerns about whether the city can absorb the new arrivals.\u201cWe\u2019re kind of stuck out here, with our level of economic depression, with our level of crime and drug issues,\u201d said Timothy Cook, a doctor and an Army Reserve colonel who gave Rutland First its name. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are gonna have to foot the bill for this.\u201dAnd that is what business leaders in Rutland hope will happen here.Resettlement, said Lyle Jepson, the executive director of the Rutland Economic Development Corporation, is \u201csupporting people when they need help.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cFrankly, we need help.

{"Headline": "5 Killed at BPM Festival in Mexico", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Five people were killed early Monday at a crowded nightclub in the popular Caribbean tourist destination of Playa del Carmen, Mexico, when an armed man who had been denied entry opened fire inside the club, prompting a gun battle and a stampede, officials said.Four of the victims, including three members of the security team that had blocked the gunman\u2019s entry, were hit by bullets, and the fifth victim was trampled in the resulting pandemonium, the authorities said.The shooting occurred at the Blue Parrot nightclub, which was hosting the final night of the BPM Festival, an international electronic music event that draws fans from around the world.The gunman entered the club around 2:30 a.m., but was turned away at the door because he was carrying a weapon, said Miguel \u00c1ngel Pech, the state attorney for Quintana Roo State, on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The man then opened fire, and as patrons threw themselves to the ground or rushed for the exits, security guards at the club \u201crepelled\u201d the attacker, Mr. Pech said, adding that the guards were apparently armed.The victims included two Canadians, a Colombian, an Italian and a Mexican, and at least 15 other people were injured, including at least three Americans, the authorities said.The gunman has not been captured or identified, but several people were detained soon after the shooting and were being held for questioning, officials said. Mr. Pech, speaking at a news conference on Monday morning, did not suggest why the gunman had tried to enter the club with a weapon, but he said the attack was not an act of terrorism.In an interview with Foro TV later in the day, the state attorney said that investigators had not discounted the possibility that the attack had something to do with a fight between criminal groups or with an extortion racket.Investigators at the scene have recovered 20 casings from three firearms, officials said, though it remained unclear whether some of the bullets had been fired by weapons belonging to the security personnel or, perhaps, to one or more patrons.Humera Hamad, a resident of El Paso, Tex., who was on vacation in Playa del Carmen, said she was in the club when the shooting started. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see anything,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI just heard a blast and ran out of there, then started jumping fences.\u201d She added, \u201cI never looked back.\u201dFabian Gonz\u00e1lez Camacho, 33, was standing outside the club, near the entrance, and ran for safety after the attack began. \u201cI kept thinking: \u2018This is going to be a massacre.

{"Headline": "How Davos Brings the Global Elite Together", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byHeads of state, captains of industry, prominent academics, philanthropists and a retinue of journalists, celebrities and hangers-on will descend Tuesday on Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum.For most of the year, Davos is a resort town high in the Swiss Alps with a population of just 11,000. But for two weeks each January, the town\u2019s population swells to 30,000 as the global elite meet for a series of meetings and discussions about \u201centrepreneurship in the global public interest,\u201d in what could be described as world\u2019s most expensive networking event.Beyond the events on the conference\u2019s official calendar are an even more exclusive series of parties, dinners and outings.Founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a German economics professor, the European Economic Forum began as a conference for European business leaders to discuss catching up with American management processes. Two years later, the conference had shifted its focus to global economic and social issues, and the first political leaders were invited to attend.In 1987 the organization was renamed the World Economic Forum, and its annual conference was well enough known to be referred to simply as Davos. The conference has been the site of several historic meetings, including two in 1989: the first ministerial-level meeting between North and South Korea, and another between the leaders of East and West Germany.As the prestige of the conference grew, more politicians, thought leaders and celebrities began attending the event.More than 2,500 people will attend this year\u2019s conference from 90 different countries. Most of the participants are corporate executives, but more than two dozen heads of state and government are expected to attend.Theresa May, the prime minister of Britain, and Xi Jinping, president of China, are attending the conference for the first time this year. Mr. Xi is the first Chinese president to attend the event.But even world leaders are often seen craning their heads for a glimpse at the boldfaced names in attendance. The singer Shakira and the actor Forest Whitaker are to receive awards this year. Expected attendees include Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook; the actor and activist Matt Damon; the Formula One driver Nico Rosberg; and Jack Ma, the Chinese billionaire and founder of Alibaba.Though gender equality is often discussed at the forum, just 17 percent of last year\u2019s participants were women, according to the forum.All of those dignitaries need security. During the conference, Davos transforms into a veritable fortress. Roadblocks restrict traffic on the city\u2019s main streets and checkpoints spring up outside each venue. At the Congress Center, where the main panels take place, and at each hotel that hosts parties and talks, attendees pass metal detectors, armed guards and beneath the watchful eyes of sharpshooters.In the past, the conference was targeted by protesters associated with the anticapitalist Occupy movement. In 2013, members of the Ukrainian activist group Femen were arrested after a topless demonstration.The Swiss government estimated it will spend 8 million Swiss francs, about $8 million, on security, but said that number could increase if there were a credible threat to the conference.\u201cSwitzerland is still not regarded as a priority target for jihadist terrorists,\u201d the Federal Council said on its website. \u201cOn the other hand, even on Swiss soil, the interests of states participating in the military coalition against the so-called Islamic State face an increased threat.\u201dThe annual meeting runs on a tiered system of colored badges denoting just how important one is, or is not. White badges are for attendees able to attend any official event and make full use of the forum\u2019s facilities. Orange badges are reserved for the 500 journalists who cover the forum, but are not allowed at some parties. Other badges, like purple ones, denote technical or support staff and limit their holders to a few areas.If that system were not complicated enough, local hotels like the Belvedere and the InterContinental often sell their own badges to the bankers and consultants who descend upon Davos \u2014 but not the forum itself \u2014 to strike deals and chat up clients. These souls camp out at the hotels, renting rooms for business meetings by day and soiree hopping at night.Most of the events center on talking. But beyond lectures and panel discussions, the agenda also features more esoteric attractions. One notable event is a simulation of a refugee\u2019s experience, where Davos attendees crawl on their hands and knees and pretend to flee from advancing armies.It is one of the most popular events every year.The theme of this year\u2019s conference is \u201cResponsive and Responsible Leadership.\u201d But attendees like to play as hard as they work.There are several official cocktail receptions, but the action really lies in a galaxy of events hosted by corporations. Some are small, intimate dinners that feature the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio and Bono.Others are dazzling affairs: JPMorgan Chase, for example, has previously taken over the Kirchner Museum Davos for drinks with its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister.Google\u2019s annual party at the InterContinental Hotel has become the hottest ticket in town. The investor Anthony Scaramucci, now an adviser to Donald J. Trump, for years has hosted a reception at the famed Hotel Europe featuring a sometimes eye-popping list of high-end Champagne and Bordeaux red wine.A more recent up-and-comer is hosted by Salesforce.com, a business software maker, whose chief, Marc Benioff, is one of the forum\u2019s most ardent boosters. Last year\u2019s Salesforce party included Mr. Benioff flying in scores of fresh flower leis and a band from Hawaii, as Eric Schmidt of Google and other tech notables danced in a corner.Several years ago, Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame, hosted an over-the-top gathering that featured stuffed animal heads shooting laser beams out of their eyes. And the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska has thrown opulent gatherings at a nearby villa where the Champagne flowed freelyFor a nightcap, the Davos crowd traditionally retires to the Tonic Bar at Hotel Europe, sipping cocktails while the forum fixture Barry Colson leads the crowd in Billy Joel singalongs.Michael J. de la Merced reported from San Francisco, and Russell Goldman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg, in Suit, Testifies in Oculus Intellectual Property Trial", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byDALLAS \u2014 A few years ago, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook and one of tech\u2019s shrewdest seers, made a huge bet on a new technology, virtual reality, buying Oculus VR, one of the most prominent start-ups in the industry, for more than $2 billion.That frank assessment came from Mr. Zuckerberg on Tuesday in a federal courtroom of all places, where Facebook is tangling with a games publisher that has accused Oculus of stealing technology that went into the creation of the Oculus virtual reality headset. The trial offered a window into how Mr. Zuckerberg views the progress of one of his biggest bets, and a glimpse of Facebook\u2019s approach to making deals in Silicon Valley.\u201cI don\u2019t think that good virtual reality is fully there yet,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, who wore a suit and tie while testifying, instead of his regular uniform, a T-shirt and jeans. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take five or 10 more years of development before we get to where we all want to go.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg spoke during a court appearance, in which he was questioned about the Oculus deal. He denied accusations that Oculus had taken technology it did not own, and said he had never before testified in a courtroom.While fights over ownership of prominent technologies are common, this one defied some predictions by reaching a jury trial, which started in a federal court here in early January.\u201cWe are highly confident that Oculus products are built on Oculus technology,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cThe idea that Oculus products are based on someone else\u2019s technology is just wrong.\u201dFacebook could face as much as $2 billion in damages if it loses the suit. While there is still excitement throughout the technology industry over virtual reality, most headsets, including those from Oculus, are not selling in big numbers because of high prices and limited content for them.On Tuesday, a lawyer representing Oculus and Facebook asked Mr. Zuckerberg whether he had realized his goal of creating a new computing platform. \u201cThese things end up being more complex than you think up front,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf anything, we may have to invest even more money to get to the goals we had than we had thought up front.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg added that Facebook probably will have to invest more than $3 billion in the next decade to reach its goal of providing hundreds of millions of people with a good virtual reality experience.Later, a Facebook spokeswoman said that nothing had changed about the company\u2019s commitment to virtual reality. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said for years, VR is the next computing platform, and Facebook\u2019s Oculus team is leading the way,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Tera Randall.The core of ZeniMax\u2019s case is that one of its former employees, John Carmack, shared ZeniMax virtual reality technology with Palmer Luckey, a founder of Oculus, during the company\u2019s early days, technology for which ZeniMax was never compensated. Mr. Carmack, a game industry stalwart behind games like Doom, later joined Oculus.A lawyer for ZeniMax used some of his time questioning Mr. Zuckerberg to bolster the company\u2019s argument that Facebook rushed through its review of Oculus when buying it, overlooking details about its dispute with ZeniMax.In response to questioning from the lawyer for Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg said that the company spends weeks, months or even years thinking about the issues that lead it to make acquisitions. He said Facebook \u2014 which has also acquired Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 believes that negotiating deals quickly is important in an environment where it is often competing with companies like Google, Apple and Twitter.\u201cBeing able to move quickly not only increases our chance of getting the deal done, but it keeps us from having to pay a lot more as the deal process drives out,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.For companies that waffle about selling out to Facebook, the social network is willing to deploy fear as a tactic. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to help convince people that they want to join you, helping them understand all the pain they would have to go through is a valuable tactic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s a little less of what I tend to focus on.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said that Mr. Iribe was originally asking for $4 billion for Oculus. He settled for $2 billion, though Facebook also agreed to $700 million more in compensation to retain important Oculus team members and $300 million in pay for hitting certain milestones. Facebook\u2019s code name for the Oculus deal was Inception.Unlike Facebook, ZeniMax is not household name, but many of the games it publishes, including Fallout and Elder Scrolls, have a passionate following. It also has a board of directors stacked with famous names, including the Hall of Fame baseball player Cal Ripken Jr., the director Jerry Bruckheimer, CBS chief Leslie Moonves, and Donald J. Trump\u2019s brother Robert.A lawyer for ZeniMax asked Mr. Zuckerberg about his reaction to ZeniMax\u2019s lawsuit, which was filed not long after Facebook publicly announced its intention to buy Oculus.\u201cIt is pretty common when you announce a big deal or do something that all kinds of people just kind of come out of the woodwork and claim that they just own some portion of the deal,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cLike most people in the court, I\u2019ve never even heard of ZeniMax before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, more ads are coming to the free app \u2014 this time through Instagram Stories, a successful feature it introduced in August.While people might post carefully filtered photographs of their new dogs to Instagram\u2019s regular mobile feed, the Stories feature enables them to showcase a more spontaneous collection of images and short videos, which disappear after 24 hours \u2014 say, a clip of tug of war and images of a dog\u2019s snout and eyes with silly captions and emojis.Ads will now show up between some Stories, which take up the full phone screen and otherwise seamlessly transition from one account to the next. (Snapchat, which has 150 million daily users over all, runs similar ads.) Instagram will soon begin with ads from more than 30 companies \u2014 including General Motors, Netflix, Airbnb and Capital One \u2014 before expanding to all advertisers in coming weeks. It will monitor feedback to determine how often the ads will appear, said James Quarles, the vice president of Instagram Business.\u201cWe\u2019ll watch it closely, but I think we\u2019ll introduce it and over time it will be expected just like on home feed \u2014 you see the sponsored logo and know ads are just a part of the experience,\u201d Mr. Quarles said.

If a book is on my night stand, it means I haven\u2019t read it and feel like I should. I\u2019m too embarrassed to name them, as some are written by people I know. As for the books that have come off my night stand recently, they are all forthcoming. Here are some books worthy of reading in 2017: Thi Bui\u2019s \u201cThe Best We Could Do\u201d; Charmaine Craig\u2019s \u201cMiss Burma\u201d; Don Lee\u2019s \u201cLonesome Lies Before Us\u201d; Bao Phi\u2019s \u201cThousand Star Hotel\u201d; Vaddey Ratner\u2019s \u201cMusic of the Ghosts\u201d; and Akhil Sharma\u2019s \u201cA Life of Adventure and Delight.\u201dWhat has your post-election reading looked like?I\u2019ve been reading news and opinion pieces on Facebook and Twitter. They\u2019re utterly terrifying and depressing, since my social circle basically thinks that a Trump presidency spells the end of the world. To get out of the echo chamber, I read Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed. It\u2019s utterly terrifying and depressing, and I run back into the echo chamber.I take comfort in the children\u2019s literature that I read to my 3-year-old son. He will tolerate the tales of Beatrix Potter, which I find soothing, but mostly he wants to hear about Batman, Superman, Ghostbusters and Star Wars. The moral clarity of these stories is comforting not just for a 3-year-old, but also for many adults. This is why they are relevant in our divided age, where most people identify with the rebels but so many in fact are complicit with the Empire.What\u2019s the last great book you read?What\u2019s the best classic novel you recently read for the first time?Ralph Ellison\u2019s \u201cInvisible Man\u201d on audio. I had read it a long time ago, but hearing Joe Morton\u2019s stupendous performance was like encountering the novel for the first time, again. The Morton version is absolutely riveting.What\u2019s your favorite book no one else has heard of? \u201cThe Land at the End of the World,\u201d by Ant\u00f3nio Lobo Antunes, beautifully translated by Margaret Jull Costa. This novel about an old man reflecting on his experiences as a young medic in Portugal\u2019s colonial war in Angola was my touchstone while I wrote \u201cThe Sympathizer.\u201d Every morning I would read two or three pages of its magnificent prose, dense with striking and unexpected imagery, until the moment arrived when I was so seized by the novel\u2019s spirit that I was motivated to turn to my own. I wanted to imitate Lobo Antunes, and I failed.When do you read?On a stationary bike, sweating. In my car, on audio. At the dining table or my desk, with a pen in hand. Best of all, in bed, at night, with a double of Scotch, neat. O.K., sometimes it\u2019s a triple.What moves you most in a work of literature?The sentences, which include the rhythm, word choice and images. I will put a book down if the first sentence doesn\u2019t immediately thrill me. Since I don\u2019t get to read very many books purely for pleasure, I have no time to waste on a book whose every sentence isn\u2019t a delight.Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?The genres I most enjoy reading are the ones I try and avoid, because I love them too much. As a child and teenager, those beloved genres were comic books, science fiction, fantasy and war stories, both fiction and nonfiction. As an adult, I added crime stories. The problem is that if I pick up a crime thriller by Jo Nesbo, Walter Mosley or Don Winslow, or a science fiction novel by Octavia Butler, I\u2019ll be up until the early hours of the morning to finish it, and I don\u2019t have the time. That\u2019s likewise the case with comic books when I give in to them, whether they are by the Hernandez brothers, Alan Moore, Rumiko Takahashi, Osamu Tezuka, Adrian Tomine, Gene Luen Yang, or many others.Besides the fact that these genres provide gripping storytelling, I also love them because they oftentimes have more to tell us about our larger contemporary world than so-called literary fiction (which doesn\u2019t acknowledge that it\u2019s a genre as well). Comic books long ago predicted presidents like Donald Trump, in series like Frank Miller and Dave Gibbons\u2019s \u201cGive Me Liberty.\u201d Crime fiction, which often connects low-level crime to high-level corruption, can help us understand the operations and effects of a Trump presidency that unabashedly favors strongmen of all kinds. Science fiction likewise often speculates on grand political questions. Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s \u201cRed Mars,\u201d for example, is about the colonization of that planet and the ensuing tragedy wrought by human politics, greed and ambition. It takes place in the future but is really about our eternal human strengths and weaknesses. I like it when literature gets political, and contemporary literary fiction is more often apolitical than not.How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? I love paper books, but traveling with them was a pain, because my luggage could only accommodate so many books. When the Kindle came along it solved that problem of portability and was my favored reading mode for several years. Then I published my novel and rediscovered the fetish of the physical object. I wanted to hold my book and enjoyed seeing it on bookstore shelves, and have returned to the thrill of buying and reading paper books. I still read on the Kindle, however, and also listen to books on audio. It doesn\u2019t matter how I\u2019m reading as long as I\u2019m reading. I read several books at a time, which mirrors to some extent how I always have more than one writing project that I work on simultaneously.How do you organize your books?Organize?What\u2019s your favorite book to assign to and discuss with your students?Maxine Hong Kingston\u2019s \u201cThe Woman Warrior.\u201d I find the book endlessly rewarding to teach, because it\u2019s so rich and layered and still relevant to the lives of students. In addition, it\u2019s a powerful book about the necessity and dangers of storytelling. The first line is \u201c\u2018You must not tell anyone,\u2019 my mother said, \u2018what I am about to tell you,\u2019\u201d and the rest of the book is about the author telling everyone what her mother said. Telling what must not be told is one of the writer\u2019s primary tasks. It is also a difficult and dangerous one.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?I was a lonely boy and a voracious reader who treated the library as my second home. I loved Curious George and Tintin, although I see their problems now as an adult who\u2019s more sensitive to racial and colonial connotations. I wouldn\u2019t want to reread the Hardy Boys, Tom Swift or \u201cTom Brown\u2019s School Days,\u201d but I liked them as a child. Other favorites that I have not revisited for fear of spoiling their memory are Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s \u201cTreasure Island\u201d; \u201cD\u2019Aulaires\u2019 Book of Greek Myths\u201d; Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d and \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d; Isaac Asimov\u2019s Foundation and Robot books; Frank Herbert\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d; early Robert Heinlein novels; Harper Lee\u2019s \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d; Erich Maria Remarque\u2019s \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d; Audie Murphy\u2019s \u201cTo Hell and Back\u201d; Ben\u00e9t\u2019s Reader\u2019s Encyclopedia; and many, many superhero and war comic books. A curious child can read whatever he or she wants in a good library, which has no borders and stands up for the First Amendment. That meant that by the time I was 13 or 14, I had access to lots of war books filled with sex and violence, as well as trashy, soft-core porn paperbacks featuring detectives, medieval knights and hit men. This probably goes a long way toward explaining how I became the writer that I am.If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? For President Obama, the Bible (the Old Testament, not the New). For President Trump, the Bible (the New Testament, not the Old).President Obama has a great degree of the compassion recommended in the New Testament, but many of us who admire him wish he would sometimes, like the Old Testament God, figuratively hurl fire and brimstone at his domestic political opponents (I recognize that the drone strikes he has authorized are a literal kind of fire and brimstone, but at least he\u2019s not playing with the idea of pre-emptive nuclear attacks). President Trump has no problem with loving his followers and smiting his enemies, but he needs to learn humility, generosity and self-sacrifice from the New Testament Jesus, who washed the feet of the poor, fed the hungry, respected women and rejected the corruption of the establishment.You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?Haruki Murakami, since it seems unlikely I\u2019ll ever meet him. He can curate the music and cook spaghetti. Carrie Fisher, for her wit and bravura. Lastly, John Berger. I love that Berger gave half his Booker Prize money in 1972 to the Black Panthers, and used the other half to fund the research for his next book on migrant laborers. Berger was the kind of writer we need more of \u2014 politically committed, aesthetically serious, always curious.What do you plan to read next?Roland Barthes\u2019s \u201cWriting Degree Zero,\u201d which I sadly have not read yet. Paisley Rekdal\u2019s forthcoming \u201cThe Broken Country: On Trauma, a Crime, and the Continuing Legacy of the Vietnam War.\u201d Jeff Chang\u2019s \u201cWe Gon\u2019 Be Alright: Notes on Race and Resegregation,\u201d since I want to learn what we need to do to make everything alright. Linh Dinh\u2019s \u201cPostcards From the End of America,\u201d which chronicles a declining America through the author\u2019s travels among the down and out. Perhaps many liberal and leftist writers think they should reach out to this part of our country, but Linh Dinh is one of the few to do it. Solmaz Sharif\u2019s \u201cLook,\u201d a work of poetry that is about war and language, drawing partially from the Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (I\u2019ve been reading a bit at the intersections of war and poetry, most recently the excellent volumes \u201cNight Sky With Exit Wounds,\u201d by Ocean Vuong, and \u201cHardly War,\u201d by Don Mee Choi). Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d because the character and the author are an awesome combination. Perhaps I\u2019ll find inspiration for the comic book I would love to write someday about Agent Orange, an anti-imperialist crime-fighter who is simultaneously superhuman and disabled, born as a result of the dioxin that the United States sprayed in Vietnam. I promise it will be funny.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google, in Post-Obama Era, Aggressively Woos Republicans", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Few companies have been as intimately tied to the Democratic Party in recent years as Google. So now that Donald J. Trump is president, the giant company, in Silicon Valley parlance, is having to pivot.The shift was evident a day after Congress began its new session this month. That evening, about 70 lawmakers, a majority of them Republicans, were feted at the stately Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building, where they clinked champagne and bourbon glasses and posed for selfies with the 600 guests assembled in their honor.The event\u2019s main host was not from the Republican establishment. Instead, the party was primarily financed and anchored by Google.Now, the tech giant is scrambling to forge ties with Mr. Trump\u2019s new administration and to strengthen its relationship with a Republican-dominated Congress. Most important, Google is trying to change the perception that it is a Democratic stronghold.\u201cGoogle has a target on its back because it is fundamentally viewed as a Democratic company,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser to Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. \u201cEven though it has reached out to Republicans, it can\u2019t shake the image.\u201dGoogle said it had long had Republican lobbyists and had not changed its strategy.\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with both Republicans and Democrats for over a decade, advocating policies to encourage economic growth, innovation and entrepreneurialism,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to do exactly that.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Schmidt added, \u201cEric has a long record of working constructively and energetically on important technology issues with American and world leaders across the political spectrum.\u201dOther Silicon Valley tech companies, like Facebook, are in a similar predicament. The perception is that they lean left and their executives backed Mrs. Clinton. Many are now also pledging to work with Mr. Trump and paid court to the new president at a December tech summit meeting.One week into the administration, Google and other tech companies began to push back, criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration bans. The company said an estimated 187 employees were affected by the order and it urged any of those employees who were abroad to work with the company to return safely to the United States.\u201dIt\u2019s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in a memo to employees over the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ve always made our views on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.\u201dNow warning shots against Google have been fired by those in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle. Some of the president\u2019s advisers have debated whether the tech behemoth deserves more antitrust scrutiny, according to two people briefed by the new administration\u2019s transition team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Mr. Trump\u2019s team is particularly wary of one Google executive \u2014 Mr. Schmidt \u2014 who has been allied with Democrats. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Mr. Schmidt counseled Mrs. Clinton on strategy. A photo of him wearing a staff badge at her election-night party circulated widely in the conservative media.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, including his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, have complained about Mr. Schmidt\u2019s funding of a start-up called the Groundwork, which provided data and other technology for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. They also suspected Google was skewing search results in favor of Mrs. Clinton, said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201cMr. Schmidt spent millions and millions of his personal money to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cIt takes a particular amount of gumption to pretend that never happened.\u201dFor many years, Google\u2019s support of Democrats was plain. Google\u2019s political action committee and employees ranked third in all donations to Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign at $804,240, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2008, Google\u2019s PAC and employees were sixth with $817,855. The company did not rank in the top 20 for donations to Mr. Obama\u2019s Republican opponents in either of those elections.About five years ago, Google began diversifying its bets. The company forged ties with the Republican-dominated House of Representatives and started addressing the beginning of an antitrust investigation into whether the company was using its search dominance to suppress competing travel, map and restaurant sites.During his presidency, Mr. Obama also repeatedly supported proposals backed by Google, including net neutrality in 2015 and cable set-top box reforms last year.\u201cGoogle was very much treated as the golden child by the Obama administration,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, which has been critical of Google for privacy policies.At the party, several Republican lawmakers were positive about their tech host, brushing off questions about the company\u2019s heft and power.\u201cWhen I think of technology and Google, I don\u2019t think of dominance,\u201d said Representative Bradley Byrne, a Republican from Alabama. \u201cI think of innovation.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from Washington and Dai Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Morocco Said to Ban Sale of Burqas, Citing Security Concerns", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byMorocco, a majority-Muslim country and former French protectorate where the influence of Western secularist ideals remains, has been trying to foster more moderate expressions of Islam and subtly warn Islamists not to go too far, though acts of extremism remain rare.The Interior Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. It also has not yet published an official statement on the specifics of the ban, and it is unclear what kind of religious full-body veils have been specifically targeted. Morocco\u2019s official religious authorities have not taken a position on the issue.Hammad Kabbadj, a conservative preacher and member of the Justice and Development Party who was not allowed to run in last fall\u2019s legislative elections in which his party prevailed because he was deemed too \u201cextremist,\u201d denounced the ban on Facebook.He said he thought the ban was meant to create tensions that would ultimately hurt his party, which has been trying unsuccessfully to form a coalition government since October.\u201cIt is unacceptable,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a perverted behavior by the public authorities.\u201dThe ban has spurred a fierce debate between Moroccans who see the move as repressing the religious freedom of women and those who applaud it as a liberation for women.\u201cI am against the culture of banning in principle,\u201d Ali Anouzla, a Moroccan journalist, said on his Facebook page. \u201cBut just to be clear, the Interior Ministry didn\u2019t ban the hijab or niqab but banned the burqa, and the burqa isn\u2019t part of Morocco\u2019s culture.\u201dStephanie Willman Bordat, a founding partner at Mobilizing for Rights Associates, a Morocco-based nongovernmental organization, said many Moroccans saw the burqa as a neocolonial import from the Gulf states.\u201cObviously the government\u2019s interest is first and foremost security rather than women\u2019s rights,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unsurprising given the current security context and the concern the government has with maintaining security and stability and cracking down on the terrorists\u2019 networks.\u201dFarah Ch\u00e9rif D\u2019Ouezzan, the founder of the Center for Cross Cultural Learning in Rabat and an expert in comparative religion with a focus on women and Islam, said that there was a great deal of confusion and that a confirmed ban would be difficult to implement.\u201cIf it is true that there is a ban, to me, the ban is justified for security reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, there is not evidence for associating the burqa with security threats. I would like to know how many people they have arrested.\u201d\u201cI believe that men or women should have the right to choose how to dress,\u201d she added. \u201cThe number of women who wear the burqa in this country is still insignificant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byWhat is it about President-elect Donald J. Trump that appeals to so many Americans? One is a native of Minneapolis, now working at a tech start-up in Mountain View, Calif. Another is a gay man from Massachusetts. But they are all glad he won. They say they are waiting to see how he governs before drawing any conclusions. These interviews have been condensed.Mr. Youngquist flew to Washington from California this week and was walking around the capital on Thursday with a friend, taking\u00a0in the sights and watching as the police put up metal barricades.\u00a0\u201cWhen he started running, it felt like a joke. I got a T-shirt and hat. I thought, years from now, it will be amazing to have these. He said some very outlandish things, but the root of what he was saying, I could see the point he was trying to make. None of the other guys really spoke to me. \u201cI consider myself a Republican, but I was never really that political. I didn\u2019t take Trump that seriously. But in some ways I did connect with him. It was definitely a process for me. \u201cWe knew what we were getting with Hillary. She\u2019d be an extension of Obama. I voted for Romney. If Romney had had a little more spine, like Trump, he would have been a lot more successful. Now Trump is the leader of this country. He makes people cringe, but I don\u2019t mind that. We need a tough guy up there.\u201cI don\u2019t think he is as bad as the media portrays him. I am waiting for him to be in office to see what he does. If he makes awful decisions, I won\u2019t support him.\u201cThe staunch Hillary supporters could never admit she was a flawed candidate. They saw her as a saint. That drove me to Trump even more.\u201dA sitter was coming to stay with Ms. Rudd\u2019s two cockapoo dogs and her cat, and she and her fianc\u00e9 set off driving to Washington on Tuesday night. She voted for Mr. Trump and even sent him a check during the campaign. Her father, who died in 1998, was a Democrat.\u201cTrump reminds me of my daddy in a way. He would tell it like it is. He was bold. He was very colorful. He played steel guitar. Even acted in several movies. My daddy would just fill a room with his personality. He was funny. He had this sense of humor. Much like Donald Trump.\u201cHe\u2019s always kind of been interesting to me. When this election started, he was saying what I was thinking. No one else had the guts to say it. Sometimes I cringed. Like when he said \u2018nasty woman\u2019 about Hillary. I thought: \u2018Donald, don\u2019t say that. You should have some manners.\u2019 But then on the other hand, it was a little funny. My daddy might have said something just like that.\u201cI\u2019m thinking this guy is coming straight out of nowhere, going to jump in here real quick and then get out. I myself was a highway commissioner. I lived on this road. It was so horrible. All the neighbors hated it. The road department would not maintain it. I\u2019d go to the road department meetings. There were all these guys sitting around in John Deere hats laughing me out of the room because I was a woman. Well, election time came up, and I thought why not. I won in a landslide. I had a four-year term. It was a paid position, through county government. I was the only woman ever on the road board at that point, as far as I know. I said, heck, I\u2019m gonna get this road fixed. And I got it fixed. People would stop me on the street and say, \u2018Lady, I don\u2019t know you, but thank you for that road.\u2019 So I\u2019m seeing Donald Trump being a total outsider. He\u2019s got the confidence and the guts to go in there and get it done. And get out quick.\u201dMr. Moran was flying to Washington on Thursday from Boston to attend the inauguration. He would be meeting up with some other Trump supporters from Massachusetts.\u201cI\u2019ve supported Republicans for years. I\u2019m also gay. That puts me in a unique situation. It goes against the grain of what we\u2019re told by liberals we\u2019re supposed to believe.\u201cDonald Trump has been more pro-gay than Hillary. She was against gay marriage until the math showed it would help her with votes. He called Islamic terrorism for what it is, and no one was willing to do that. He is the ultimate outsider in a very broken system. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of president that our founding fathers intended \u2014 someone who stepped away from his professional life to serve the country. Not someone who has had a lifelong career in politics.\u201cDecades of handouts from the government have only hurt the poor. The belief that our government is our salvation is not what our founding fathers intended. I really believed that Obama and his policies would bring people together. But they didn\u2019t. I tried to watch his speech and I just laughed. Obama just doesn\u2019t get it.\u00a0\u201cConservatives have been doing a terrible job connecting with young people. It might be a short window for Trump and conservatives to get their points across if they don\u2019t do more to attract younger people. This could be a last stand.\u201dMs. Farrar is going to Washington for the inauguration with her parents and her brother. It will be her first visit to the capital.\u201cI voted for Trump because I liked the idea of a radical shake-up and change. He is going into a pretty broken system of politics, and something crazy might be needed. \u201cI heard someone describe it that Trump is like chemotherapy. Sometimes a little poison can be good to cure the broader disease. I\u2019m a moderate Republican in fiscal matters, but I\u2019m liberal on cultural matters like gay marriage. My gay friends have just as much right to get married as I do. I grew up in a moderately conservative home. But it was a household that embraces diversity. I went to a small private Christian liberal arts college.Mr. Bowens is the co-host of a show on a Fox News Radio affiliate in Albuquerque. He ran Marco Rubio\u2019s national student grass-roots campaign as a volunteer. He eventually switched to supporting Mr. Trump.\u201cI was on the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 train. But one of my closest friends said, \u2018Listen, just go to a rally.\u2019 He didn\u2019t give any argument. He just said go. \u201cSo I went to one. And I did a total 180. It was like professional wrestling. You think, oh, wrestling is dumb, you know it\u2019s fake when you watch it on TV. But when you go, you suddenly feel this whole vibe. He\u2019s interacting with the crowd. They\u2019re chanting stuff. He\u2019s saying, \u2018I love you, too, you beautiful people.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s like sales. I worked in car sales. In sales, you are not weaving a lie, but you show part of the picture, in order to connect with the person you are talking to.\u00a0Trump is like that. The drain the swamp thing. He tried it out as a line. The crowd responded well, so he said it again and again. It was a sales tactic he used to get the crowd involved. I thought there was a mutual understanding on all sides that this was only rhetoric. To have some fun.\u201cI\u2019m very conscious of race. I believe that there is significant police brutality against blacks. I believe my community is suffering. But I believe people are confusing nationalism with racism. I think people are misunderstanding what Trump is saying. It feels racist, but it\u2019s not. \u201cLimiting Muslim immigration. It\u2019s discriminatory, but it\u2019s not racist. It waters down the word racist. There are real racists out there. There are real people who think our race is inferior and wouldn\u2019t hire us. But when we talk about racism all the time like this, it diminishes the weight of that word.\u201cI think it\u2019s less that Hillary was a woman and more that Trump was an alpha male.

{"Headline": "SpaceX Launches Rocket, Its First Since Explosion on Launchpad", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byBut financial details disclosed this past week about the company overshadowed the successful liftoff, raising questions about the viability of Mr. Musk\u2019s long-range plans for SpaceX and his vision of sending people to Mars.SpaceX also repeated its feat of recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, landing it on a floating platform named \u201cJust Read the Instructions\u201d in the Pacific. Less than 90 minutes later, mission control received confirmation that all 10 satellites had been successfully deployed.Over the next 14 months, the company plans six additional Falcon 9 launches to deploy 60 more Iridium satellites that will completely replace the constellation.In the short-term, the successful launch helps put SpaceX back on track. The explosion and subsequent four-month grounding created a backlog of launches, including cargo missions for NASA to the International Space Station. September\u2019s explosion was SpaceX\u2019s second failure in 15 months; a Falcon 9 rocket carrying NASA cargo disintegrated in flight in June 2015.Company officials did not dispute the numbers reported in The Wall Street Journal article, but portrayed a rosy future.\u201cSince 2002, we have been at the forefront of revolutionizing space technology, with a solid track record of success, strong customer relationships and more than 70 future launches on our manifest, representing over $10 billion in contracts,\u201d Bret Johnsen, SpaceX\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a statement. \u201cFurthermore, with over $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt, the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth.\u201dSpaceX hopes to launch its larger Falcon Heavy this spring. The Heavy, years behind schedule, would become the world\u2019s most powerful rocket since NASA retired the Saturn 5 more than 40 years ago.SpaceX also plans to refly one of its recovered boosters this spring. By reusing instead of throwing away rocket boosters, SpaceX hopes to significantly reduce the cost of launches.Also on the schedule is an in-flight abort test of SpaceX\u2019s Dragon 2 capsule, a crucial safety prerequisite that it must conduct before the company can begin ferrying NASA astronauts to the space station next year.By applying Silicon Valley entrepreneurial practices to aerospace, SpaceX has undercut prices and disrupted the rocket launch business. That brought in many customers like Iridium, which is paying more than $450 million for the seven launches. The next-lowest bid from one of SpaceX\u2019s competitors was $1.2 billion, said Matthew J. Desch, Iridium\u2019s chief executive.Without SpaceX\u2019s lower costs, Iridium could not have afforded to replace its group of satellites, Mr. Desch said. \u201cThe Falcon 9 is perfect for what we want to do,\u201d he said.But the lower costs make it difficult to see how SpaceX could earn enough profit to finance its grand ambitions.SpaceX has described plans to offer satellite internet services with more than 4,000 satellites. The forecasts described by The Wall Street Journal, which were produced in early 2016, show how much the company is depending on this new business.SpaceX projected that current rocket launching business would quintuple in revenue, to $5 billion, in 2025. Satellite internet services, still in the early planning stages, were projected to bring in more than $30 billion in revenue and generate the bulk of more than $20 billion in profit for the company.During the September announcement, Mr. Musk spoke of \u201ca huge public-private partnership\u201d to get to Mars, but did not describe what kind of partnership he foresaw. The incoming Trump administration has not outlined in detail its plans for NASA, although some of the president-elect\u2019s advisers, including Newt Gingrich, are pushing for a greater reliance on commercial companies like SpaceX.Other Republicans, however, have been strong defenders of the Space Launch System, the big, expensive rocket that NASA is developing for a Mars mission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cubans Newly Blocked at U.S. Border Place Hopes in Trump", "Date": "2017-01-22", "News": "Supported byNUEVO LAREDO, Mexico \u2014 She spent weeks hiking through the Amazon, crossing a crocodile-filled river. She scaled border walls, escaped from immigration detention in Panama and slept in a church. Broke, hungry and exhausted, she found refuge with indigenous people in the jungle who took her in and fed her for a week.Finally, six months after fleeing Cuba on a tortuous journey to the United States, Marleni Barbier, a dental assistant from Havana, made it to the border with Texas \u2014 about 12 hours too late.The abrupt change is a profound one for Cubans, who fled their country by the tens of thousands in the last year to take advantage of a decades-old policy that permitted them to enter the United States.\u201cI have faith that Trump will change it,\u201d said Ms. Barbier, 44, who arrived at the Texas border right after President Barack Obama announced the end of special rights for Cubans. \u201cTo take away a law at the last minute like that, it\u2019s so unjust.\u201dSome of the Cubans stuck in limbo here at the Texas border arrived on Jan. 12, the same day the Obama administration eliminated the so-called wet foot, dry foot rule. The rule, which dated to 1995, allowed Cubans who reached the United States to enter the country.About 150 Cubans are parked only 50 steps from the pedestrian bridge that connects Nuevo Laredo, in Mexico, to Laredo, Texas. Bewildered and deflated, they are being fed by Mexican strangers, and they pray.\u201cEverybody was racing to get here before the inauguration on the 20th,\u201d said Yamila Gonz\u00e1lez Cabeza, 44, a teacher from Cuba, saying many migrants thought the Trump administration would be the one to shut the border. \u201cThe reverse was true. We did not expect this surprise on the 12th.\u201dThe Cuban government has long abhorred the special immigration privileges, saying the policy bleeds the island of its citizens and lures waves of migrants into dangerous journeys by land and sea.That decision could now put Mr. Trump in an awkward position: He campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, vowing not to let migrants slip through American borders. But he has also threatened to overturn Mr. Obama\u2019s executive orders and get tough on the Cuban government.Mr. Trump has in the past said the wet foot, dry foot policy, which sent back Cubans caught at sea but allowed those who reached land to enter, was unfair. Still, the Cubans here hope he will show humanitarian compassion for people who undertook arduous voyages to escape Communism and extreme poverty.Ms. Barbier said she had spent all of the $8,000 she made from the sale of her house in Cuba to make it this far. \u201cThat money is gone, gone, gone,\u201d she said.About 41,000 Cubans made similar trips across the Americas last year. But because she got to the border a little too late, Ms. Barbier and other Cubans like her may be sent back unless they can prove they endured individual persecution, not just poverty or lack of opportunity, on the island.\u201cI certainly have sympathy for them, but the policy has been changed, and the moment they changed it, the policy was eliminated,\u201d said Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat who represents Laredo. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say anyone in the pipeline can come in. By luck, some got in and some did not.\u201dEliannes Matos Salazar, 32, said she had been at the border station here all day on Jan. 12, and had already been photographed and fingerprinted, when she was forced to leave after the announcement. Yet her husband got through and is now in Las Vegas, she said.Alberto Ram\u00edrez Balmaseda said he had turned back because border agents told him that he would face long periods of incarceration for a chance at presenting proof of persecution to a judge.\u201cWhat evidence do we have? That there\u2019s been a Castro regime in power for about 60 years?\u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez said. \u201cIf you are a political prisoner in Cuba, they don\u2019t put \u2018political prisoner\u2019 on your criminal record. They say you stole a pig.\u201dSeveral of the Cubans interviewed said that even if they had not had political problems before they left, they would if they were sent back.Yenier Echevarr\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, 31, who worked as a baker in the tourism industry, said state security agents had seen a photo he posted from Brazil on Facebook, so they showed up at his house in Cuba and demanded that his wife sign his employment resignation papers. He had been gone just a week and had not officially emigrated.\u201cFirst of all, if I\u2019m deported I will probably have to serve two months in jail,\u201d Mr. Echevarr\u00eda said. \u201cAnd I will never again have a job, a car or a house \u2014 ever.\u201dThe Cuban government promised in the 1995 migration accords with Washington not to retaliate against Cubans who were turned back, said Holly Ackerman, a Duke University librarian who studies Cuban migration. To qualify for residency in the United States, Cubans will now have to show they would be personally persecuted back home.\u201cBeing pinched and limited and controlled by the Cuban government isn\u2019t enough to satisfy the U.S. authorities any more,\u201d she said. \u201cCubans who are thinking about exiting will undergo a profound reframing of their identity as a result of these changes.\u201dSilvia Pedraza, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan, argued that while the prior policy had been flawed, it was na\u00efve to treat Cubans as economic immigrants.\u201cOne has to distinguish people who leave totalitarian countries,\u201d she said. \u201cFor sure, the weight of the economic circumstances is very strong in their lives, because the daily stuff of life in Cuba is so difficult that when Cubans talk, that\u2019s what they begin talking about. But it does not seem right not to recognize the political nature of this.\u201dJos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn Carmona Flores, who runs a state agency in Mexico that offers humanitarian assistance to migrants, said that about 200 Cubans were currently in Nuevo Laredo, and that an additional 1,100 were waiting in other cities until they decided what to do.According to the International Office of Migration, about 250 Cubans were being processed at the southern Mexico border when the announcement was made. Scores who arrived since then are being sent back to Cuba.More than 11,000 Cubans arrived in Mexico in just the last three months of 2016, meaning that thousands more along the migrant route across the Americas could still flood Mexico in the weeks to come. On Friday morning, the Mexican government deported 91 of them who had entered along the southern border.\u201cI am very worried for them,\u201d Mr. Carmona said. \u201cThey have no plan. They have no backup plan if their original plan fails. They are truly vulnerable to illness, an epidemic, extortion. In many ways they are much more vulnerable than the Central American migrants we are accustomed to dealing with.\u201dMr. Carmona\u2019s agency was created after 78 migrants were massacred in his state by a drug cartel in 2010. Central Americans are regularly kidnapped and extorted, a fate Cubans have largely escaped in the past because they did not linger long.\u201cI think they are going to have to reach some kind of amnesty or truce and be returned to their country; Mexico will have to do it, because they are here,\u201d Mr. Carmona said. \u201cWho is going to be the executioner? Who is going to return these people to a place where they are likely to be \u2018sanctioned\u2019 \u2014 to put a friendly word to it?\u201dKirk Semple contributed reporting from Tijuana, Mexico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Know About CES 2017", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byTo average people, the name of the International CES, formerly known as the International Consumer Electronics Show \u2014 one of the largest tech conventions, taking place in Las Vegas this week \u2014 will seem dated, if not highly misleading.Tech companies often use the annual trade show as a marketing mechanism to bombard people with news about products that will have little, if any, impact on consumers. And the word \u201celectronics\u201d is awkward in an era when tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook are focusing innovations on areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Yet there are a few product categories worth following this week: high-definition television sets, smart-home accessories and drones. Here is a briefing on things you might want to know as the show unspools this week.But this week, CES will make it clear that buying a 4K television set finally makes sense. TV makers will announce a host of improvements to 4K features, including color technologies like high dynamic range, a software feature that enhances the contrast and color profile of a picture, and wide color gamut, a technology that shows a wider range of colors. Some TV manufacturers, like LG, will introduce TVs that are only a few millimeters thick and easily mountable on a wall. Toward the holiday season, prices on many high-quality TVs with these features will probably drop significantly, as they have in previous years, to roughly $800 to $1,300. In addition, there are now many devices capable of playing 4K content, including 4K Blu-ray players, Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 Pro console and Roku\u2019s higher-end streaming devices.For consumers, voice assistants have broken down the complexity of interacting with smart-home devices, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst for Creative Strategies, which was among the first market research firms in Silicon Valley. (It\u2019s easy for anyone to say \u201cAlexa, turn on the lights.\u201d) And for companies that sell home accessories like locks and thermostats, it has never been easier to make a convenient smart-home product because the companies can now team up with the tech giants. \u201cNow there\u2019s an ecosystem to plug into and build support around, and I think that\u2019s going to help a lot,\u201d Mr. Bajarin said.What that means is that in the next year or two, shopping for a smart-home accessory will be as simple as looking up a type of product and finding one that matches up with your Apple, Google or Amazon device. That\u2019s a lot simpler than with older accessories, which required you to install extra hubs and download additional apps to work with your smartphone.\u201cWhen you go to Amazon.com or the Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s to buy a connected dead bolt from us, what you can expect from us is we want to make sure that lock is going to work with whatever platform you choose,\u201d said Rob Martens, a futurist at the lock company Schlage. Remember that annoying drone buzzing around and taking pictures of people at the beach? That problem is only going to get worse: Drones are getting cheaper, and lesser-known Chinese companies are increasingly getting into the drone business to drive prices down even further. Cheaper drones are expected to have a strong presence at C.E.S., and some popular drones representing well-known brands have already dipped in price. DJI\u2019s Phantom 4, for example, is now $999, down from about $1,400 last year. Mr. Bajarin of Creative Strategies said consumers should also expect to see drones made in China by lesser-known brands that cost as little as $600. Also in store, he said, are drones with smarter tracking abilities and extra photography angles, among other features.Advertisement"}

A direct message was sent through Facebook or another social network from an unknown woman to an Israeli soldier\u2019s smartphone. Then, according to Israeli military officials, it developed into a chat in flawless Hebrew, heavily peppered with millennial slang.\u201cGood morning (smiley emoji),\u201d one typical chat began.\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Do we know each other?\u201d the soldier replied.Alluring photos soon followed. Only the correspondents were apparently not who they said they were.Instead, senior Israeli intelligence officials said on Wednesday, they were Hamas operatives who set up fake profiles and trawled social networks, befriending na\u00efve soldiers and enticing them to download applications that effectively turned their cellphones into tracking devices and tools for spying.The assertions of the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under Army rules, could not be independently verified. Hazem Kassem,a spokesman for Hamas, the Islamic militant group that holds sway in the Gaza Strip, declined to comment. \u201cWe do not want to respond to what some Israelis say about us,\u201d he said.Ibrahim Madhoun, a writer for Al-Resalah, a Hamas newspaper, said that Hamas would not stoop to such levels. \u201cCreating women\u2019s profiles to attract soldiers is against our Islamic values and teachings,\u201d he said by telephone.Briefing reporters on Wednesday at military headquarters in Tel Aviv, the intelligence officials said the technology was relatively simple.One correspondent, \u201cAlbina Goren,\u201d sent a photo of herself in a skimpy dress, blue sea in the background. \u201cAmit Cohen\u201d sent one of herself wearing red lipstick and shades, her brown mane flowing. Some of the fake friends gained the confidence of several administrators of closed social network groups used by soldiers and were invited to join.They then sent links to an apps store with instructions to download what they said were video chat apps, like YeeCall and Wowo Messenger. When the soldiers tried to install and use the apps, they would not open, and the new \u201cfriends\u201d would cut off contact. But the supposed app was actually a virus that gave Hamas access to the soldiers\u2019 contacts, locations, apps, photos and files, the military said, and allowed Hamas operatives to stream video from the cellphone\u2019s camera and audio from the microphone.Dozens of phones were targeted in the past few months, most of them belonging to low-ranking combat soldiers carrying out their obligatory service, the military officials said. Though the Hamas operation had the potential to cause serious damage to state security, the officials said, the military intelligence directorate\u2019s information security branch, in cooperation with other Israeli security agencies, caught on and acted to shut the operation while the damage was minimal.Suspicions arose when a female Israeli soldier reported that her profile photo and identity had been stolen and were being used to befriend other soldiers. Some male soldiers became suspicious when their new \u201cfriends\u201d asked about their military activities.After working secretly for several months to find the cyberspies, the military said it had decided to publicize the operation to raise public awareness and encourage soldiers to report suspicious behavior on social networks. The military is asking soldiers to turn off the GPS on their phones when not in use, to make themselves harder to track. It is also recommending that soldiers avoid downloading apps from unfamiliar sources.\u201cThis time, their weapon isn\u2019t a bomb, gun or vehicle,\u201d the military officials said of the Hamas cyberoperatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple friend request.\u201dMajd Al Waheidi contributed reporting from GazaAdvertisement"}

FLEMINGANN ARBOR, MICH.\u2b25To the Editor:It was frustrating that \u201cThe Year in Reading\u201d gave such short shrift to science: no scientist-authors among the avid readers who contributed and almost nothing on science among the books listed. While popular science books may occupy a small niche in the pantheon of books published every year, it usually contains very good ones written by excellent scientists. By excluding any scientist-authors, the editors seem bent on perpetuating the conditions described long ago by C.P.

For example, when the request went out from Washington during our Civil War for battlefield nurses, many nuns responded. One mother general answered that she would accept only volunteers who would be willing to treat wounded from both North and South. The church hierarchy did not deter her.These consecrated women also built many schools and hospitals, often with little assistance from their bishops. Mother Seton conducted a pitched but honest and respectful difference of opinion with her bishop. Too often have these women been categorized as helpless. Those who thought and felt that way left, especially in the 1960s. And yes, the church has not always treated them well.Those who served the military are recognized as veterans. In \u201cNuns of the Battlefield,\u201d Ellen Ryan Jolly ably documents the names of religious orders, their members, native countries and missions. In November, Smithsonian magazine featured a member of the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, Sister Blandina Segale, whose cause for canonization is pending.

{"Headline": "Parents View New Peanut Guidelines With Guilt and Skepticism", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byWhen Nicole Lepke\u2019s son was born, she listened to her pediatrician and kept peanuts away until the age of 2, but the toddler still developed a severe peanut allergy when he finally tried them.Now, 12 years later, health experts have reversed their advice on peanuts, urging parents to begin feeding foods containing peanut powder or extract during infancy in hopes of reducing a child\u2019s risk for allergy.The about-face on peanuts has stunned parents around the country who are coping with the challenges of severe peanut allergies. Like many parents, Ms. Lepke is now plagued with guilt. By restricting peanuts early, did she inadvertently cause the very allergy she was trying to prevent?\u201cThere is this constant guilt that you have as a parent,\u201d said Ms. Lepke, a mother of three who lives outside Milwaukee. \u201cAnd then if the recommendation changes the next year, you feel it even more.\u201dSince the new guidelines were announced last week, many parents, alarmed by the recommendation that peanut-containing foods be deliberately fed to infants, have lashed out at the medical community in social media posts.A new parent who gives peanuts to a baby \u201ccould be sentencing them to death,\u201d said Peggy Cottle, of Dayton, Ohio, who has a child with a peanut allergy.Ms. Cottle said that it often seems like every year a new study comes out that negates an earlier study. \u201cThere is no definitive proof on what causes food allergies,\u201d she said.Jennifer Urso Doggart, a mother of four from Jefferson, Ohio, said she feared babies would be used as \u201cguinea pigs\u201d to test the new allergy prevention guideline.\u201cYou follow advice and then find out years later that it was the wrong advice,\u201d Ms. Doggart posted on the Facebook page of kidswithfoodallergies.org.\u201c\u2018Oh no. Wait. We were mistaken. It\u2019s actually the opposite thing you should be doing!\u2019\u201dBut others reacted with sadness, wondering whether better information earlier on might have prevented their children\u2019s allergies. \u201cIt is a bit disheartening and frustrating,\u201d Heather Eslinger, a physical therapist in Colorado Springs whose children have nut allergies, said in an interview. \u201cIt is hard to accept that things may have been different had we known then what we know now.\u201dWhile national health officials have a track record of reversing medical advice from time to time \u2014 menopause hormones and trans fats are two examples \u2014 few topics are as fraught as food allergies. For starters, food allergies disproportionately affect children, and the risk of making the wrong decision about a food is immediate and potentially deadly. As a result, parents are particularly fearful about following the advice.\u201cI gave my 5-month-old a bit of my toast and peanut butter and we ended up in the emergency room,\u201d said Lori Dombek, 58, a web developer in Gorham, Me., whose son is now 22. \u201cPeanut allergies are nothing to fool with.\u201dBut scientists say the new guidelines are based on the latest science. A large clinical trial studied hundreds of British children at risk for peanut allergies, giving them either peanut-containing food regularly from infancy or withholding all foods with peanuts.By the age of 5, the trial found, those who had been given peanut-containing food early in life had an 80 percent reduced risk of developing a peanut allergy.\u201cThe trial\u2019s results were very very unambiguous,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Greenhawt, chairman of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology\u2019s food allergy committee and one of the authors of the new guidelines. The fact that the guidelines changed over time makes them more credible, not less, he said.\u201cYou want them to change over time if there is better data available that can make a more informed statement \u2014 that\u2019s progress,\u201d Dr. Greenhawt said. \u201cThat\u2019s why taxpayer dollars fund N.I.H. research \u2013 to push the envelope, to build a better mousetrap, to find a better answer to a question.\u201dThe shift in recommendations was not as abrupt as some may think, experts said. As recently as 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics told parents to withhold peanuts from children at high risk for allergies until the age of 3. But in 2008, the academy backed away from the recommendation, said Dr. Scott H. Sicherer, a spokesman for the academy and one of the authors of the new guidelines. Although the recommendation against withholding nuts from children under 3 was rescinded, that message didn\u2019t catch on.By 2008, the message was \u201cYou don\u2019t need to avoid peanuts till age 3, feed the baby as you wish, there\u2019s no evidence that delaying is going to be helpful,\u201d Dr. Sicherer said. But by then, \u201cIt was stuck in people\u2019s minds and wasn\u2019t easily forgotten \u2014 it had become the gospel.\u201dDr. Sicherer said he understands the resistance to the new message, and the fear that the advice might change again. In addition, he noted that giving your children peanut foods at a young age doesn\u2019t guarantee they will be allergy-free. \u201cIt\u2019s not foolproof. Even in the study, some still developed an allergy or had it when they started,\u201d he said.The new policy also leaves a lot of unanswered questions about allergies and other foods. When should other allergenic foods like eggs, dairy, fish and shellfish be introduced to young children? And what about eating peanuts during pregnancy and lactation? Experts said research about introducing other allergenic foods is ongoing, and that studies on eating peanuts during pregnancy and while breast-feeding are weaker observational studies, and the results are mixed.There are social implications as well. Parents of children with allergies often feel that they are subtly accused of causing allergies by being overprotective or of being neurotic and exaggerating the risks. They worry that the new guidelines will encourage those stigmas. Doctors say no one should be blamed for peanut allergies or feel guilty about them. \u201cThere is no peanut-allergic child right now who is peanut allergic because of something their mother or father did,\u201d Dr. Greenhawt said. \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault.

It was clear they knew him as a regular but, judging from their conversation, not at all as the author of 21 highly distinguished works of fiction and nonfiction or as a MacArthur genius who was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters or, for that matter, as one of the first three African-Americans to ever earn a Rhodes Scholarship.If they knew any of that about Wideman the writer, they would also have to know this about Wideman the person: He is the older brother of a man convicted of murder, serving a life sentence without the chance of parole; the uncle of a young man shot execution-style in his own home; the father of a boy who, at age 16, woke up one night while traveling with a group of campers, got out of bed and stabbed his roommate to death while he was sleeping. The drama of Wideman\u2019s personal history can seem almost mythical, refracting so many aspects of the larger black experience in America, an experience defined less by its consistencies, perhaps, than by its many contradictions \u2014 the stunning and ongoing plurality of victories and defeats.Now 75, Wideman is noticeably gentler-looking than the severe ice-grill that has glared from dust jackets for so many years. After Bahaj left, he confessed to me that he had been reading reviews of his newest book, \u201cWriting to Save a Life,\u201d published in November. He noted that critics tend to write about him as an isolated and haunted figure, an idea he has resisted but has been coming to accept about himself. \u201cI mean, if everyone tells you your feet stink, after a while, you may think you washed the boys, but everybody can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d He laughed at himself but then soberly conceded, \u201cI always felt extremely isolated.\u201d That loneliness Wideman speaks of is twofold: both peculiar to him and quintessentially black, especially for more talented men of his era. I have seen this loneliness, too, in my father, a man of Wideman\u2019s generation and the first in his family to break out of the segregated South and get a college education, a dual triumph that simultaneously freed him and left him a consummate outsider.For Wideman, who spent much of his working life in places like Wyoming and Western Massachusetts and rural Maine, this solitude has been further compounded by cold mathematics. Not only is mainstream publishing overwhelmingly white, it is also nearly bereft of black writers like him: American men of letters descended from Southern slaves, who position themselves as part of a grand and omnivorous intellectual and artistic tradition. Though we live in the most racially fraught period in at least a generation, much of what we read on the subject comes from pundits, journalists and internet think-piece writers whose experiences and perspectives are rooted more in the language of critical theory than in anything resembling literary mastery.\u201cWriting to Save a Life: The Louis Till File,\u201d about 10 years in the making, is a slim but powerful volume, an account of the brief and terrible life of Louis (Saint) Till, the largely forgotten father of Emmett Till, the Chicago boy whose horrific lynching in Mississippi in 1955 shamed the nation. It feels in many ways like an apotheosis, a project that combines and distills all the various obsessions of a brilliant half-century investigation into the existential predicament of, as Wideman once put it to The Paris Review, \u201ca person who\u2019s still scarred and outraged and mystified by the experience of Europe and Africa and slavery and the relationship between those continents.\u201d It is the late-phase masterwork of a man still trying desperately to figure out how America works at a time when his perennial concerns \u2014 freedom and confinement, policing, fatherhood, the inheritance of trauma and ontological stigma \u2014 feel as pertinent as ever.Yet, thus far at least, both black and white audiences engaged in the perpetual national conversation on race have mostly ignored it. (Critics less so: It was recently named a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in general nonfiction). Perhaps this is because Wideman\u2019s layered and sometimes contradictory insights resist abbreviation and easy dissemination in short bursts of epiphany on social media. His disposition is to bypass blunt polemic and make his case through description and story, which is by necessity inventive, conditional and ambiguous. Simplicity sells, but the truth is seldom simple.And the truth, as Wideman put it to me at one point during lunch, his food an afterthought, his eyes locked on his hands as if he could somehow manipulate his words with his fingers, is that whatever existential pain separates black America from the world, \u201cit ain\u2019t nothing to do with our blood, it ain\u2019t nothing to do with our history, it is essentially a recognition, the most profound and basic human recognition that you are alone. I am alone.\u201dWhen he was 12, Wideman\u2019s family relocated to middle-class Shadyside, where he attended high school and became valedictorian and captain of the basketball team. The University of Pennsylvania came calling and offered an academic scholarship. He was an excellent student in college, and before he graduated in 1963, Gene Shalit wrote an article about him in Look magazine titled \u201cThe Astonishing John Wideman.\u201d This was both an incredible individual honor and a damning acknowledgment of the scarcity of black faces at places like Penn. It could not have been easy, but Wideman evinced the polar opposite of a sense of victimization. \u201cTo me, being Negro is only a physical fact,\u201d he told Shalit. \u201cIf there were something I wanted very badly that being Negro prevented me from doing, then I might have the confrontation of a racial problem, and I would be driven to do something about it. I\u2019m sure I would. But so far, the things that I\u2019ve wanted to do haven\u2019t been held back from me because of my being a Negro.\u201dAfter Penn, Wideman studied 18th-century narrative technique at Oxford, married a white Penn graduate named Judith Goldman and eventually became one of Penn\u2019s first black tenured professors. He quickly wrote three well-received novels that failed to find large audiences and that he has since described as operating on the apprentice level. It was not until 1981, with the publication of his story collection \u201cDamballah,\u201d that Wideman grew into his mature style, a learned and distinctively black register that switches naturally between the sublime and the profane, an earthy vernacular and a high literary mode with which he spins tales both true and untrue that overlap and accumulate, like 3-D printing, into tangible landscapes and characters.\u201cDamballah,\u201d along with the novels \u201cSent for You Yesterday\u201c and \u201cHiding Place,\u201d formed what has since become known as the Homewood Trilogy and marked Wideman\u2019s emergence as one of the premier novelists in the country. But even as Wideman\u2019s career was on the rise, his family life back home had been ravaged.His brother Robby was arrested in 1976 after participating in a botched robbery that ended with the victim dying of a gunshot wound to the shoulder. He was convicted and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Wideman spent years interviewing him during soul-crushing visits to Western Penitentiary. In the course of these conversations, he got to know his brother more intimately there than he ever had on the outside, and in 1984, he published \u201cBrothers and Keepers,\u201d a collaborative nonfiction attempt to come to grips with how their two life trajectories had parted so drastically: how he had become the friend of someone like Senator Bill Bradley, while his brother had developed \u201cprison arms.\u201d It was at once a book about Robby\u2019s obvious guilt and grim history leading up to the crime and also about the extremity of his punishment. The victim, who was white, was himself a criminal, Wideman told me, but \u201cnobody ever said anything about him having criminal genes.\u201d What\u2019s more, it was one of Robby\u2019s accomplices who pulled the trigger.In the summer of 1986, two years after the publication of \u201cBrothers and Keepers\u201d and 10 years after Robby\u2019s arrest, Wideman\u2019s middle child, Jacob, a tawny, blond-haired black boy who displayed serious developmental problems, accompanied a small group of teenagers on a tour across the West. At a stopover at the University Inn motel in Flagstaff, Ariz., inexplicably, he twice buried a six-inch blade in the chest of his sleeping white roommate, Eric Kane. It was a horrific crime \u2014 it took hours for Kane to bleed to death \u2014 and prosecutors routed Jacob into the adult system, though he was just a teenager. Like his uncle Robby, Jacob was sentenced to life in prison, but he was granted the possibility of parole. The salacious story of the great black writer\u2019s homicidal son was quickly picked up in newspapers across the country and given lengthy treatment in respectively compassionate and vicious pieces that ran in Esquire and Vanity Fair.Wideman himself has never written about Jacob, at least never directly. \u201cMy son doesn\u2019t like me to talk about his situation,\u201d he told The Paris Review, \u201cso I don\u2019t. Period.\u201d This was very much on my mind as I prepared to ask Wideman about this aspect of his biography. A friend had alerted me in early November \u2014 on Election Day, actually \u2014 that Jacob, now almost 47, had been granted release from prison. Wideman confirmed that his son is currently living in a halfway house after serving 30 years in prison and having been denied parole on six previous occasions. This unexpected turn of events, he confided, has left him somehow optimistic. \u201cIt kind of put all the other news in perspective.\u201d He recently recorded a segment on NPR and found himself tongue-tied, trying to make sense of the current political upheaval. \u201cThe idea that my son was out. ...\u201d he told me, his voice trailing off. \u201cHey, nothing else mattered.\u201dI asked Wideman whether, given the specificity of Jacob\u2019s own personal demons, the level of his parents\u2019 education and social capital and the sheer fact that he could pass for Caucasian, it made sense to think of his collision with the criminal-justice system in the same terms we keep for poor and more conventionally black men like Till or Robby Wideman. He replied that Jacob\u2019s defense lawyers, with whom he has since become friends, came to believe that the state was looking to make an example of Jacob. In Arizona at the time, Wideman said, \u201cthere were more and more immigrants, black people, street crime, drugs,\u201d and the lawyers told Wideman in confidence that they believed the state had plans to seek the death penalty.The family instead accepted a plea deal. Wideman maintains that he has never argued for Jacob\u2019s innocence \u2014 it was he and Judy who took him to the police station \u2014 though he does insist on pointing out an uncomfortable truth: Jacob was a natural and appropriate candidate for juvenile imprisonment, but he instead nearly became an opportunity to expand the reach of capital punishment, because, Wideman believes, his victim was white. This was \u201cstrange,\u201d he told me, but it was not for lack of precedent. I both understood and sympathized with his point, but it was one of the few moments in speaking with him that I found myself questioning the accuracy of mapping a tragedy so specific onto one so universal.But Wideman\u2019s cerebral sensibility is one that resists easy consumption. Even his longtime friend and agent, Andrew Wylie, describes his work as probably destined for \u201ca fairly select audience, as is the case with many of the best writers in the world.\u201d He is, in other words, a writers\u2019 writer. One of his many admirers is Mitchell S. Jackson, the author of \u201cThe Residue Years,\u201d a 2013 semi-autobiographical account of his experience selling drugs in college and going to prison. One line of Wideman\u2019s has stuck with Jackson for years: \u201cThe facts speak for themselves, but never speak for us.\u201d If you were to look at the facts of Jackson\u2019s own life, he says, you would see a guy who sold drugs, went to prison and made a success of himself writing about it. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s what\u2019s between that that\u2019s who we are.\u201d\u201cWriting to Save a Life\u201d chronicles Wideman\u2019s attempt to fill in some of those gaping blanks between the rock-hard facts of Louis Till\u2019s life and the files relating to his court-martial, which seem to suggest the American military systematically railroaded the young soldier into a practically predetermined guilty verdict. Stationed in Civitavecchia, Italy, during the twilight of World War II. Till, along with two other black servicemen, was accused of the rape of two Italian women and the murder of another, on purely circumstantial evidence and despite enormous amounts of contradictory testimony. \u201cNo, all witnesses agree: Too dark to tell what color clothing the attackers wore,\u201d Wideman writes. \u201cYes, all witnesses agree: We could see the color of the invaders\u2019 skin.\u201d A military court sentenced Till and one other man to death by hanging.There is not a whole lot Wideman or any of his readers can know for sure about Till, but what we do learn is often unattractive. He beat his wife, Mamie, who took out a restraining order. He squandered the family\u2019s income. Presented by a judge with the dubious choice of prison or the military, he opted for the latter and ended up in the former anyway, in a distant Mediterranean cell near Ezra Pound of all people. He is not Rosa Parks by any stretch of the imagination, and Wideman makes no attempt to sanctify his character. Yet there is undeniably something in him that the author not only relates to but also admires, and it has to do with the fact that Till does not ever beg or plead but keeps quiet, even stoic, in the face of a system that \u201cprovides agents ample, perhaps irresistible, opportunities for abuse.\u201dWhat unsettles Wideman about the Till case is not only that it was flagrantly flawed but that everything had the veneer of propriety about it. \u201cEvery T crossed, every I dotted,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut seamless, careful, by-the-book performance provides no evidence of what the spider\u2019s thinking about the fly enmeshed in its web.\u201d Even participants in an unjust system can be blind to the ways they sustain it. It\u2019s a jarring idea when taken to its logical conclusion, that, independent of any willful bigotry, the person on the jury or in the voting booth may not even know why she decided the way that she did. For Wideman, this means that transcendent racial harmony may permanently lie on the horizon, just beyond our reach. Which is also why, in his view, storytelling takes on the dimensions of a battle royal, a \u201cnever-ending struggle\u201d to make sense of the world, which implies a kind of \u201cultimate democracy\u201d but also \u201ca kind of chaos.\u201dIn a 1990 Esquire profile he wrote of Michael Jordan, Wideman observed that \u201ca great artist transforms our world, removes scales from our eyes, plugs from our ears, gloves from our fingertips, teaches us to perceive reality differently. Proust said of his countryman and contemporary, the late-19th-century Impressionist Auguste Renoir: \u2018Before Renoir painted there were no Renoir women in Paris, now you see them everywhere.\u2019\u2009\u201d Wideman has, with this book, achieved a similar feat. The most disturbing argument he makes in \u201cWriting to Save a Life\u201d is that, whether guilty of any particular actions in Italy or not, Till\u2019s one true offense is something that can be accurately described only as a crime of being: In the logic of the criminal-justice system, people like Till, people bound to the wrong side of that stubborn fiction of race, often seem to necessitate \u201ca pre-emptive strike.\u201dI had never once thought of nor seen Louis Till before Wideman painted him so exquisitely, and now I have to acknowledge that he is all around me. Walter Scott? He\u2019s Louis Till; so is Eric Garner. Michael Brown, unsympathetic as he appears on that convenience-store video \u2014 I can no longer see him without conjuring Emmett\u2019s father. Seventeen-year-old Laquan McDonald, wandering through the Chicago night until his body jumps and jerks from 16 shots? Louis (Saint) Till. Poor Philando Castile \u2014 pulled over at least 49 times in 13 years before the final and fatal interaction that left him bleeding in front of his girlfriend and her daughter and all the rest of us on Facebook Live \u2014 is a high-tech Louis Till. Ditto Alton Sterling down in Baton Rouge, Freddie Gray up in Baltimore and \u201cbad dude\u201d Terence Crutcher out in Tulsa: all these men are Louis Tills. Trayvon Martin and 12-year-old Tamir Rice are something else altogether, heart-rending combinations of both Tills, p\u00e8re and fils, doomed man-children in the fretful, trigger-happy imagination of American vigilantes and law enforcement. Whatever other crimes may or may not have been committed, may or may not have potentially been on the brink of being committed, these were all crimes of being before they were anything else. That is one true story, whatever other stories there may be, and Wideman has told it masterfully.I had come to join him on one of his favorite walks, a cinematic back and forth across the Williamsburg Bridge into Brooklyn, \u201can old habit\u201d he once fictionalized in a short story for Harper\u2019s. He arrived promptly, in a pair of black New Balance running shoes and a smart black Nike Dri-Fit ensemble that surprised me. Whatever he had done with the elderly gentleman I talked to just days earlier, I couldn\u2019t tell you. He seemed 10 to 15 years younger and even to stand several inches taller. As we wove through traffic and up the ramp to the pedestrian walkway, he initiated then maintained an outlandish stride that left me, 40 years his junior, struggling to keep up.Wideman has written repeatedly of his lifelong love for the game of basketball, both the organized kind that provided a haven of rules and order and got him out of Pittsburgh but also the pickup kind that he gave up, with great sadness, only when he hit 60. He still lifts weights and runs occasionally and, in talking with him, I began to suspect, could also drink me under the table. As we walked, the wind whipping off the East River and the metal-on-metal of J, M and Z trains rattling beside us and the whir of microfiber generated by the swinging of his arms combined to nearly drown out his voice, which hadn\u2019t grown one decibel louder.The truth is, I told him, he has written a hell of a book at the age of 75. I wanted to know if it was in any way harder for him than it had been earlier in his career. \u201cEverything is gravy now,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time I finished playing basketball, I used to be, you know, the star, the go-to guy for whomever I played for. But at the end of the time on the playground, to make a layup, you know, to steal the ball once \u2014 it\u2019s gravy. You don\u2019t have to worry about carrying the team, your rep. You\u2019re just out there, and anything you can get is good.\u201d He had finally given up his last teaching post at Brown, because, he explained, when he can no longer perform a task to his standards, he has no choice but to walk away. The writing still works, though, even he agreed, and he mentioned a new story he just completed for Harper\u2019s.We walked along the waterfront before warming up over steak and eggs and bloody marys at a Polish restaurant Wideman likes on Bedford Avenue. When we finally headed back to Manhattan, I asked him about the ending of \u201cWriting to Save a Life,\u201d a mystifying passage in which he is standing over Till\u2019s bleak, half-size grave near F\u00e8re-en-Tardenois, France, 75 miles east of Paris, on an ignominious plot of land where all 96 soldiers (83 of them black) who were executed by the U.S. military during World War II are buried.Wideman imagines himself talking in down-home, midcentury black slang to the dead young man as if he were a brother or a comrade, telling him a fable about a tenacious swarm of honeybees. When a muscular grizzly bear rampages their hive for honey, \u201cevery damn mama bee, daddy bee and every little jitterbug bee jump Brer Bear\u2019s burly ass,\u201d Wideman says to Till. And as the bear gets mad and starts swatting and growling, some of \u201cthe wildest, meanest bees,\u201d the crazy Kamikazes, \u201cdives down the bear\u2019s big mouth.\u201d The bear starts thrashing about in pain, but the craziest bees sting him deep inside his throat and stomach until he vomits blood and honey and all those bees back up, hurting so bad that, he wishes \u201che ain\u2019t never been born.\u201d The beehive is obliterated, but the strange thing is, out of all that gratuitous destruction, \u201cnot all the Kamikaze bees dead in there. A few crawls out the mess.\u201d They\u2019re sticky and banged up, \u201cbut a couple few alive. Alive and just as wild, mean and crazy as ever.\u201d If the bear comes back, \u201cthey gone bust his big chops wide open again.\u201d What, I asked him, does that all mean? He paused to consider my question. Then he said he thought it meant that \u201cwe need [expletives] like Till.\u201dI nodded and said goodbye to him in front of his building on the cold and windswept corner of Grand Street, mulling over his words as I walked back to the subway. Was he really saying that oppressed people need people, even bad people, to take the fight to the beast of American racism, a conflict in which almost any retaliatory act might find justification? It seemed far too simplistic a story for Wideman to tell, and it left me underwhelmed, turning the image over and over in my mind as I descended to the platform and headed back to Brooklyn.Then slowly, somewhere under the river, I began to wonder if he was saying something else, a much more complicated and interesting story. I began to wonder if he was saying that people like Till \u2014 people who do actual wrong and veer off course and go and get smashed down the hardest \u2014 aren\u2019t antiheroes so much as sacrificial explorers who have ventured quite literally into the belly of the furious beast, exposing for the rest of us the very extent of the danger within, and how lucky we may have been to escape it.Thomas Chatterton Williams is the author of a memoir, \u201cLosing My Cool.\u201d His work has appeared in The London Review of Books, Harper\u2019s and The Virginia Quarterly Review, in which he wrote about his experience as the black father of a white-looking baby in Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Face of Trump\u2019s Order, Some Muslim Nations Are Conspicuously Silent", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 The Germans criticized it. The British voiced their discomfort. The French, the Canadians and even some Republican senators in Washington stood in open opposition.King Salman of Saudi Arabia, home of Islam\u2019s holiest sites, spoke to Mr. Trump by telephone on Sunday but made no public comment. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whose capital, Cairo, is a traditional seat of Islamic scholarship, said nothing.Even the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a group of 57 nations that considers itself the collective voice of the Muslim world, kept quiet.Will he move the American Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem? Designate Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization? Fall in line with Russia in dealing with the conflict in Syria?\u201cTrump has promised to do all kinds of things, but it\u2019s not clear what he will move on immediately,\u201d said Nathan J. Brown, a Middle East expert at George Washington University. \u201cNobody seems to know. It\u2019s not even clear if Trump knows.\u201dThe lack of unity stems from an old problem: Muslim leaders pay lip service to the \u201cummah,\u201d or global community of Muslims, but are more often driven by narrow national interests \u2014 even when faced with grave actions seen as an affront to their own people.\u201cThey don\u2019t have a strong basis of legitimacy at home,\u201d said Rami G. Khouri, a senior fellow at the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut. \u201cThey are delicately perched between the anger of their own people and the anger they might generate from the American president.\u201d\u201cI thought in America, there were institutions and democracy,\u201d said Fuad Sharef, 51, an Iraqi Kurd bound for New York who was turned away from the Cairo airport with his wife and three children on Saturday morning. \u201cThis looks like a decision from a dictator. It\u2019s like Saddam Hussein.\u201dIn fact, a majority of the Islamic State\u2019s victims have been Muslims, many of them shot, burned or beheaded. Among the Muslims who managed to escape Islamic State territory are the refugees Mr. Trump has now excluded.In a phone conversation with Mr. Trump on Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany cited the 1951 Refugee Convention, which calls on signatories to take in people fleeing war, according to Steffen Seibert, Ms. Merkel\u2019s spokesman. Yet in much of the Middle East, Mr. Trump is less likely to get such a scolding.He has drawn close to Mr. Sisi of Egypt, whom he called a \u201cfantastic guy,\u201d and is considering designating the Muslim Brotherhood, Mr. Sisi\u2019s sworn enemy, a terrorist organization. In a call last week, the two leaders discussed a possible visit to the White House by Mr. Sisi, whose administration faces accusations of human rights abuses \u2014 an unthinkable prospect during the Obama administration.In his order on Friday, whose stated aim is to keep extremists out of the United States, Mr. Trump invoked the Sept. 11 attacks three times. Yet Saudi Arabia, which was home to 15 of the 19 attackers, was not included on the list of countries whose citizens would be shut out. That reflects the deep economic and security ties between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Mr. Trump also has a personal financial link: In August 2015, just as his campaign was gathering steam, the Trump Organization registered eight companies in Saudi Arabia that were linked to a hotel development in the city of Jidda.Pakistan, another country whose citizens have carried out attacks in the United States, also ducked Mr. Trump\u2019s list. Although Mr. Trump had a chummy phone call with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif shortly after the election in November, Pakistanis are nervously waiting to see if Mr. Trump will pull American troops from neighboring Afghanistan.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern,\u201d said Zahid Hussain, a political analyst in Islamabad, Pakistan. \u201cFor now, they want to keep quiet and see how things go.\u201dOn Monday, King Abdullah II of Jordan is scheduled to meet in Washington with members of the Trump administration and Congress, the first Arab leader to do so since the executive order was issued.Muslim solidarity once existed. As recently as the early 2000s, most Muslim-majority countries agreed on issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and sanctions against Iraq. Now, after several regional wars and a surge in sectarian strife, that consensus has been shattered.Multinational organizations that represent Muslims are viewed as toothless entities. The head of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, which has headquarters in Saudi Arabia, was forced to quit last fall after he made a joke at the expense of Mr. Sisi of Egypt.In the early days of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the Islamic scholars at Al Azhar, the ancient seat of Islamic learning in Cairo, spoke out against the \u201csmear campaigns being launched against Muslims in America.\u201d But the scholars have yet to weigh in on Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, and even if they do, few observers expect them to stray from official Egyptian government policy.For many citizens of those countries, the docility of their leaders is frustrating. Samer S. Shehata, of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies in Qatar, said that many of his students had already canceled their plans to study in the United States. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is under any illusion that if you are a Muslim or an Arab, you\u2019re going to be treated different in this Trump presidency,\u201d he said.Mr. Khouri, of the American University of Beirut, said the disconnect between rulers and civilians in some countries spoke to the underlying anger that fueled the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. \u201cEven when this American move is insulting Muslims and Islam, they do nothing about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to create more anger, and more pressure, in the Arab world. It\u2019s terrible.\u201dAn article on Jan. 30 about the conspicuous silence from some Muslim nations after President Trump decided to bar millions of refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from the United States gave an outdated position for Rami G. Khouri, who said some Muslim leaders \u201cdon\u2019t have a strong basis of legitimacy at home.\u201d He is a senior fellow at the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut, and no longer its director.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Black Suspects Charged in Videotaped Beating of White Teenager in Chicago", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 A white teenager cowers in a corner, his hands bound with orange cords and his mouth covered with tape. Four African-Americans kick and hit him and slash at his scalp. As a cellphone camera captures their blurry images and broadcasts the ordeal on Facebook, the attackers hurl racial insults and denounce President-elect Donald J.

Kevin Duffin of the Chicago Police said of the four defendants. \u201cThey made him drink toilet water.\u201dPolice officials said the victim knew one of the suspects, several of whom seemed intoxicated.While it was one instance of violence in a city where young people are killed almost every day, the attack, particularly on social media and conservative news outlets, turned into a test of how the country views race.It also seemed to tap into the very issues that have grown the rawest around the nation of late: a divisive political climate, a painful racial split and an increasingly fierce and polarized social media universe.\u201cIf this had been done to an African-American by four whites, every liberal in the country would be outraged, and there would be no question it is a hate crime,\u201d Newt Gingrich, a Republican and former speaker of the House, said on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201dA hashtag linking the assault to the Black Lives Matter movement exploded on social media, prompting a leader of the movement, DeRay Mckesson, to respond on Twitter, \u201cIt goes without saying that the actions being branded by the far-right as the \u2018BLM Kidnapping\u2019 have nothing to do w/ the movement.\u201dPat Brady, a former chairman of the Illinois Republican Party and a former prosecutor, said the attack should not be viewed as having some larger meaning.\u201cTo be fair, we can acknowledge that we\u2019ve had some really bad political discourse in this election, but this is about four sick kids who probably can\u2019t even spell Trump let alone know anything about the election,\u201d Mr. Brady said.The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said he had been urgently trying to reach the victim\u2019s family. \u201cWe want to do whatever we can do to help, to show our love for the child,\u201d he said.Of the attack itself, he said, \u201cThis is an ethical collapse, not an ethnic affirmation.\u201dIn Washington, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said the beating demonstrated \u201ca level of depravity that is an outrage to a lot of Americans.\u201dPolice officials said they had sought the hate crime charges because of comments about the victim\u2019s race and diminished mental capacity. Commander Duffin said the police did not know whether the victim had voted in November, or whether that had influenced the attack. But the invocation of Mr. Trump\u2019s name, and the simmering racial tensions after a contentious election season, convinced many on social media that it was an act of racial hatred with political overtones.In Chicago, city officials and black leaders condemned the attack and offered support to the victim.Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the assault \u201csickening,\u201d adding, \u201cThere is more to our city than that.\u201dThe police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, called the beating \u201cdeplorable\u201d and praised the officers who spotted the victim walking on the street and called for an ambulance.People of all races, Ms. Runner said, had been \u201cvery outraged here in Chicago that anybody would do these things.\u201dThe victim, who has not been identified by the Chicago police, had been reported missing days earlier by his parents. The police said he had met up with Jordan Hill, whom he considered a friend, at a suburban McDonald\u2019s on New Year\u2019s Eve. Mr. Hill, 18, from nearby Carpentersville, Ill., stole a vehicle, the police said, drove to the West Side with the victim and had been visiting friends for a couple of days before the beating.But what started as a playful fight on Tuesday between the victim and Mr. Hill, the police said, escalated into an hourslong beating.Mr. Hill was charged along with three Chicago residents: Tesfaye Cooper, 18; Brittany Covington, 18; and Tanishia Covington, 24. All four were accused of aggravated kidnapping, hate crimes, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon; they were scheduled to appear in bond court here on Friday.Mr. Hill was also charged with robbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and residential burglary. Mr. Cooper and Brittany Covington were also charged with residential burglary.A roughly 30-minute video clip shared widely online appeared to show a Facebook livestream of the assault. A group can be seen taunting and physically assaulting a man amid cursing and laughing. Much of the video focuses on one woman as she rambles, at times incoherently. The women, police officials said, were both smoking what they described as marijuana.The video begins with a shot of one woman before turning to the victim, who is seated in the corner of a room with his mouth covered. The woman laughs as two men cut the sleeve of the victim\u2019s shirt. One of the men yells epithets about Mr. Trump and \u201cwhite people.\u201d Later, a man is seen cutting a patch of hair from the victim\u2019s head, appearing to draw blood in the process.Officers found the victim wandering bloodied and in distress with Mr. Hill on Tuesday in a dangerous part of the West Side. The police were eventually able to link the victim to a nearby report of a battery. The victim was treated at a hospital and had been released by Wednesday night.In a Chicago suburb, a brother-in-law of the victim, who identified himself as David, briefly addressed reporters late Thursday. He expressed gratitude for an outpouring of support. \u201cWe\u2019re happy that everyone\u2019s concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should never have happened.\u201dThe beating in the video comes at a time of increased violence in Chicago. The city had 762 homicides in 2016, the most since the 1990s, a grim milestone that drew the attention of Mr. Trump this week.At the Rev. Marshall Hatch\u2019s church, not far from where the victim was found, ministers met after getting calls from concerned residents, many of whom said they wanted to help raise money for the victim.\u201cPeople don\u2019t want this to be the face of our neighborhood,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cAnd more than that, they have a very genuine concern about the victim.\u201dOf suggestions that a black victim in such an attack might draw more outrage and concern, Mr. Hatch said that he had not sensed a racial dimension to the response in his mostly black neighborhood.\u201cNobody is making excuses for the behavior of these young people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople really just feel for this victim.\u201dNiraj Chokshi contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Welcome to the Great National Cute Animal Tweet-Off of 2017.Over the past two days, zoos and aquariums have dominated the conversation on Twitter with photo after photo of adorable animals. And the world cracked a smile.The Smithsonian birth announcement set off a ripple online, and generated a hashtag \u2014 #CuteAnimalTweetOff \u2014 which grew into a viral phenomenon as zoos posted photos of cute and fuzzy pandas, otters, orangutans and tiger cubs. There is even a baby turtle, as well as a pun or two, in the fray.The postings have gone international, suggesting that maybe, just maybe, we can find common ground across borders by looking at cute animals. The ZSL London Zoo raised the bar with a few seconds of video of its tiger cubs Karis and Achilles, born in June.Sarah Janet Hill, a host at Radio Free Radio in Hampton, Va., has been credited with giving the Smithsonian announcement the online bump it needed to spread.The viral response to the pup\u2019s birth announcement has been a pleasant surprise for the Smithsonian Zoo. Annalisa Meyer, a spokeswoman, said on Thursday that the seal pup had not yet been given a name, a process that includes taking suggestions from the public or giving a sponsor the opportunity to come up with one.\u201cWe have never set off a cute animal challenge,\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cWill it be the last? Maybe not. We are open to more cute tweet-offs.\u201dBut to what end?

And does it matter?The proliferation of fake and hyperpartisan news that has flooded into Americans\u2019 laptops and living rooms has prompted a national soul-searching, with liberals across the country asking how a nation of millions could be marching to such a suspect drumbeat. But while some Americans may take the stories literally \u2014 like the North Carolina man who fired his gun in a Washington pizzeria on Sunday trying to investigate a false story spread online of a child-abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton \u2014 many do not.The larger problem, experts say, is less extreme but more insidious. Fake news, and the proliferation of raw opinion that passes for news, is creating confusion, punching holes in what is true, causing a kind of fun-house effect that leaves the reader doubting everything, including real news.That has pushed up the political temperature and increased polarization. No longer burdened with wrestling with the possibility that they might be wrong, people on the right and the left have become more entrenched in their positions, experts say. In interviews, people said they felt more empowered, more attached to their own side and less inclined to listen to the other. Polarization is fun, like cheering a goal for the home team.\u2014 Where do you get most of your news? Are these sources trustworthy?

{"Headline": "Video of Fatally Wounded Teenager Sparks Palestinian Rage", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 A Palestinian teenager was lying motionless on the ground in an olive grove after being shot \u2014 fatally, it would turn out \u2014 by Israeli security forces.It started as a routine clash: Israeli forces arrived on Monday afternoon in military jeeps at Tekoa, a Palestinian village in the Bethlehem district of the occupied West Bank, and were confronted by residents hurling stones. There was nothing particularly remarkable about the clash that led to the death of the teenager, Qusai Al-Amour, 18.Mr. Amour was given emergency treatment by army medics, the military said, but was soon declared dead. The video also showed a woman and a man who approached the jeeps quickly turning and limping away, apparently having been hit in the legs, perhaps by rubber-coated bullets. The footage was shown on Palestinian television and spread quickly on Palestinian social networks, stoking popular outrage.\u201cQusai was shot with six bullets during these clashes, four times in the chest and one bullet in each of his legs,\u201d Yousef Al-Amour, the teenager\u2019s uncle, said on Tuesday. The soldiers then carried him off \u201cand started throwing his body around as if he wasn\u2019t a human being,\u201d his uncle said, speaking by telephone from the wake in Tekoa, hours after his nephew\u2019s funeral.The Palestinian Authority\u2019s governor of the Bethlehem district, speaking on Palestinian radio, described the teenager\u2019s death as an \u201cexecution.\u201dThe Israeli military said in a statement that \u201chundreds of violent rioters\u201d had confronted the security forces, who fired on and wounded \u201ca main violent instigator.\u201d In the process of evacuating him, the military said, the forces came under a barrage of rocks, which caused them to remove him hastily. The military added that the episode was under review.Hisham Abu Shaqrah, a Palestinian photojournalist working for Anadolu, the Turkish news agency, filmed the video in Tekoa. Mr. Abu Shaqrah told Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, that he had initially considered running to help the wounded teenager. Once the soldiers arrived, he said, he began to document the scene instead. \u201cThe video showed the crime in all its details,\u201d he said.Yousef Al-Amour, the dead teenager\u2019s uncle, who works in the governor\u2019s office, said Israeli forces frequently raided Tekoa, which is near Israeli settlements, and detained youths for a few days of interrogation. He described Qusai, a high school student, as a popular and talented soccer player who played for local teams and was always well groomed, with \u201cthe latest haircut\u201d kept in place with copious amounts of shiny gel.Rami Nazzal contributed reporting from Ramallah, West Bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does a Protest\u2019s Size Matter?", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byThis has to mean something, right?After studying protests over the last two decades, I have to deliver some bad news: In the digital age, the size of a protest is no longer a reliable indicator of a movement\u2019s strength. Comparisons to the number of people in previous marches are especially misleading.A protest does not have power just because many people get together in one place. Rather, a protest has power insofar as it signals the underlying capacity of the forces it represents.Consider an analogy from the natural world: A gazelle will sometimes jump high in the air while grazing, apparently to no end \u2014 but it is actually signaling strength. \u201cIf I can jump this high,\u201d it communicates to would-be predators, \u201cI can also run very fast. Don\u2019t bother with the chase.\u201dProtesters are saying, in effect, \u201cIf we can pull this off, imagine what else we can do.\u201dBut it is much easier to pull off a large protest than it used to be. In the past, a big demonstration required months, if not years, of preparation. The planning for the March on Washington in August 1963, for example, started nine months earlier, in December 1962. The march drew a quarter of a million people, but it represented much more effort, commitment and preparation than would a protest of similar size today. Without Facebook, without Twitter, without email, without cellphones, without crowdfunding, the ability to organize such a march was a fair proxy for the strength and sophistication of the civil rights movement.The Women\u2019s March, on the other hand, started with a few Facebook posts and came together in a relatively short amount of time. The organizers no doubt did a lot of work, and the size and the energy of the gathering reflected a remarkable depth of dissent. However, as with all protests today, the march required fewer resources and less time spent on coordination than a comparable protest once did.In 2011, I attended the global Occupy protests, which were held in about 1,000 cities in more than 80 countries \u2014 again, likely the biggest global protest ever, at that point. Thanks in part to digital technology, those protests, too, had been organized in just a few weeks. I was optimistic that I would soon see political and economic changes in response to this large-scale expression of resistance to economic inequality. I was wrong, then, too.Two enormous protests, two disappointing results. Similar sequences of events have played out in other parts of the world.This doesn\u2019t mean that protests no longer matter \u2014 they do. Nowadays, however, protests should be seen not as the culmination of an organizing effort, but as a first, potential step. A large protest today is less like the March on Washington in 1963 and more like Rosa Parks\u2019s refusal to move to the back of the bus. What used to be an endpoint is now an initial spark.More than ever before, the significance of a protest depends on what happens afterward.Consider the Tea Party protests of 2009, which also brought out hundreds of thousands of people in cities throughout the United States, and which also were organized with the help of digital communication. Like any other protest, including the Women\u2019s March, these were symbolic expressions of support, and they also functioned as events where like-minded individuals could find one another. But the Tea Party protesters then got to work on a ferociously focused agenda: identifying and supporting primary candidates to challenge Republicans who did not agree with their demands, keeping close tabs on legislation and pressuring politicians who deviated from a Tea Party platform.Last Saturday, as I participated in the Women\u2019s March in North Carolina, I marveled at the large turnout and the passion of those who marched. But if those protesters are not exchanging contact information and setting up local strategy meetings, their large numbers are unlikely to translate into the kind of effectiveness the Tea Party supporters had after their protests in 2009.The Tea Party, of course, is not the only model for moving forward. But there is no magic power to marching in the streets that, on its own, leads to any other kind of result.The march I attended in North Carolina ended with everyone singing along to a song called \u201cLet\u2019s Get to Work.\u201d For today\u2019s protests, more than ever, that\u2019s the right message.Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, is the author of the forthcoming \u201cTwitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
