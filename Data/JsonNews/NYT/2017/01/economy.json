{"Headline": "With Guilty Plea, Takata Clears Way for a Likely Global Rescue", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 With a $1 billion fine and a criminal guilty plea, Takata, the Japanese auto parts maker, took a major step on Friday toward putting the scandal over its deadly airbags behind it.Next up: a sale of the financially hobbled company. And in a turnabout for Japan, Takata\u2019s new owners could be from abroad \u2014 underlining a shift in the country\u2019s once-hostile attitude toward outside buyers.The unexpected charges against the executives were a rare escalation by American prosecutors pursuing a company, a reminder that Takata and its executives could still be dealing with the scandal for some time to come.The guilty plea will hurt the company\u2019s ability to defend itself against lawsuits brought by shareholders and consumers. The fines and costs associated with the scandal have also taken a heavy financial toll.Still, the deal announced on Friday goes a long way toward resolving a crisis that has been looming over Takata. The company\u2019s airbags have been linked to at least 11 deaths and more than 180 injuries in the United States. They also led to the largest recall in automotive history, affecting more than 40 million vehicles in the United States alone, and undermined Japan\u2019s reputation for turning out safe, impeccably manufactured products.\u201cThis puts Takata in a position to regain momentum,\u201d said Yoshio Tsukuda, the founder of the Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry research firm.A rescue is also critical for carmakers. As troubling as Takata\u2019s failures have been for automakers, who have borne the huge costs of the recalls, they would suffer more if the company went under. Takata remains the second-largest producer of airbags globally, with a market share around 20 percent, and is also a major supplier of seatbelts. Carmakers would struggle to find alternatives if it suddenly stopped producing.A short, mostly global list of companies is said to be interested in Takata. The white knight would probably buy a majority stake in the company, worth several billion dollars, effectively taking it over.Defective airbags made by Takata have been tied to 12 deaths and more than 180 injuries in the United States alone. The ensuing recall \u2014 the largest in automotive history \u2014 has turned out to be messy, confusing and frustrating for car owners.The list of potential buyers includes the Swedish car parts company Autoliv, the world\u2019s biggest airbag manufacturer; Key Safety Systems, an American subsidiary of Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corporation of China; and Flex-n-Gate, a maker of bumpers and other car components that is owned by the Pakistani-American billionaire Shahid Khan, who also owns the Jacksonville Jaguars franchise in the National Football League. The lone Japanese candidate is Daicel, a chemical company that supplies raw materials to Takata. That bid is only partly homegrown, however, as Daicel has teamed with Bain Capital, an American investment fund.The preponderance of international names represents a departure for corporate Japan. In the past, close-knit business networks and a protective government have helped keep control of Japanese companies in local hands, and foreign direct investment is low relative to the size of the economy. Politicians and bureaucrats have often cajoled businesses to rally around failing competitors rather than letting them fail or be sold to foreign buyers.The Japanese news media had speculated that a \u201cRising Sun alliance\u201d of Japanese carmakers might bail out Takata, led by Honda, Takata\u2019s largest customer. But carmakers have pushed back against the idea, fearing ballooning legal liabilities and anger from their shareholders.\u201cThese days, car companies procure parts around the world now as a matter of course,\u201d said Mr. Tsukuda, the industry analyst. \u201cThe important thing is to find a sponsor who can restore Takata\u2019s reputation, which won\u2019t be easy, and to do it quickly.\u201dMore broadly, global companies are having an easier time making deals in Japan. They struck $25.4 billion in deals there in 2015, according to the most recent numbers from Thomson One Banker, a data firm \u2014 the most in a decade. Spending may have been even higher last year, in part because of Foxconn\u2019s $3.5 billion deal for Sharp.And as more businesses expand abroad, said Richard Kramer, who heads the Japan practice at the law firm Simmons & Simmons, defending the home market from foreigners becomes less important and more difficult.Takata had hoped to secure a rescue by last summer. But the deadline has been pushed back several times, under a cloud of complexity and uncertainty for potential buyers. Friday\u2019s deal provided some clarity.Under its deal with the Justice Department, Takata agreed to pay a $25 million fine and provide $125 million in compensation to victims and $850 million to automakers, which have borne the cost of replacing tens of millions of Takata-made airbag inflaters. An independent monitor appointed by the Justice Department will oversee Takata\u2019s initiatives to improve safety.Thorny issues remain, though. Any potential buyers will need to figure out a legal framework for restructuring the company.One idea that has been floated is to put Takata\u2019s operations in the United States through Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But whether a similar procedure should be used for the Japanese parent is more contentious. Yoichiro Nomura, Takata\u2019s chief financial officer, argued in November that doing so could disrupt production because it could make it harder for Takata to pay its own component suppliers.Advertisement"}

It will have articles in English and Spanish to appeal to the state\u2019s large Hispanic population, and it will start publishing on Jan. 17, just weeks before the Nevada\u2019s biennial legislative session opens on Feb. 6.It might seem an odd time to start a news organization, given the significant challenges facing the news media industry. Beyond the financial headwinds, the public\u2019s perception of journalism has plummeted after an election campaign in which traditional news media largely failed to predict the success of Donald J. Trump.Mr. Ralston, 57, acknowledged the difficult environment.\u201cI have to tell you I think there was a real appetite out there for this,\u201d Mr. Ralston said. \u201cAnd I think people are thrilled to support something like this.\u201dKeith Moyer, The Review-Journal\u2019s top editor, disputed the idea that there were gaps in the coverage of the state; he pointed out that his paper had added about 50 positions to its newsroom in 2016.\u201cWe have yet to see the product,\u2019\u2019 he said in an email, referring to The Independent. \u201cBut if it is heavy on politics and business news, the R-J already covers all of those areas in depth daily.

Ralston\u2019s site will be another source of information and, frankly, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201dFor Mr. Ralston, the new venture could also be viewed as a denouement.Those who have worked with Mr. Ralston describe him as aggressive and confrontational.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economy Grows Strongly, Yet Central Bank Eases Policy", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s economy firmly hit its growth target last year and even accelerated a bit at the end. In most countries, that would be seen as unequivocally good news.But this is China, where figures are sometimes doubted and where economists look for signs of strain underneath the numbers. Indeed, Chinese officials who released the economic data on Friday faced questions about the country\u2019s mounting debt. And in an unusual move, its central bank on Friday took an extra step to inject more money into the economy over the next month.China\u2019s economy grew 6.7 percent last year after accelerating slightly to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the government\u2019s statistics bureau announced on Friday morning.The strong economic growth in 2016 came after a weak start last year, when China\u2019s currency and stock market were tumbling and many foreign investors fretted that the country\u2019s three decades of robust economic expansion might be ending.The Chinese government appears to have delayed an economic reckoning, but at a high cost. The central bank and state-owned banks shoveled trillions of renminbi into a surge of credit, putting aside longstanding worries about a deeply indebted corporate sector and signs of a real estate bubble. The government borrowed and spent heavily, continuing oversize projects like the construction of world-class highways and high-speed rail lines to cities that are increasingly remote from the main hubs of economic activity near the coast.But Ning Jizhe, the commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics, dismissed concerns about rising debt.\u201cI don\u2019t think this worry is necessary,\u201d he said at a news conference.Hours after the data release, the central bank said on its official Weibo microblog account that it was providing temporary help to \u201cseveral large commercial banks\u201d that have been distributing large sums of cash ahead of China\u2019s Lunar New Year celebrations, which begin at the end of next week.But after Mr. Zhou\u2019s remarks, state-owned banks were instructed to step up mortgage lending, and the results were spectacular. Sales of commercial buildings rose 34.8 percent, and residential sales climbed 36 percent as prices leapt higher and higher. The steel, cement and glass industries \u2014 all suffering from overcapacity in recent years \u2014 benefited as they supplied builders, and electricity production to power those factories rose. Municipal governments in Shanghai and elsewhere began imposing administrative controls this winter to limit further real estate price increases.More mortgages were part of a big expansion in the overall credit moving through the Chinese economy. To achieve its 6.7 percent growth last year, the Chinese government allowed total credit to rise at nearly two and half times that pace, according to a calculation by Louis Kuijs, an economist at Oxford Economics. Credit used to grow at the same pace as the economy, but debt has been accumulating faster than the economy\u2019s output since the global financial crisis.The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, said on Friday afternoon that it was providing liquidity assistance for 28 days to several large commercial banks. It did not identify the banks. The central bank also did not provide details except to say that it was using a market mechanism to make sure the extra money entered the country\u2019s financial system.The People\u2019s Bank of China did not respond to requests for clarification. Stock markets were up on Friday in China, and short-term interest rates were only slightly higher \u2014 two signs that while money may be fairly tight in China ahead of the holidays, any difficulty has not yet become severe enough to alarm investors.Many concerns have been raised about the quality of Chinese economic data. Western economists have suggested that Chinese government statisticians underestimate growth in boom years and overestimate growth during busts to present a smoother overall picture of the Chinese economy. Worries about data quality increased after the state-run People\u2019s Daily quoted Chen Qiufa, the governor of the northeastern province of Liaoning, as saying on Tuesday that local governments had inflated growth data from 2011 to 2014.But many economists say last year\u2019s growth appears to have been real \u2014 although bringing additional debt that could burden the economy for years to come. Mr. Ning insisted on Friday morning that national economic data was reliable, and he added that if local officials were caught fabricating data, \u201cwe will show no leniency.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wanted: Factory Workers, Degree Required", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byWhen the German engineering company Siemens Energy opened a gas turbine production plant in Charlotte, N.C., some 10,000 people showed up at a job fair for 800 positions. But fewer than 15 percent of the applicants were able to pass a reading, writing and math screening test geared toward a ninth-grade education.\u201cIn our factories, there\u2019s a computer about every 20 or 30 feet,\u201d said Eric Spiegel, who recently retired as president and chief executive of Siemens U.S.A. \u201cPeople on the plant floor need to be much more skilled than they were in the past. There are no jobs for high school graduates at Siemens today.\u201dDitto at John Deere dealerships, which repair million-dollar farming machinery filled with several dozen computers. Fixing tractors and grain harvesters now requires advanced math and comprehension skills and the ability to solve problems on the fly. \u201cThe toolbox is now a computer,\u201d said Andy Winnett, who directs the company\u2019s agricultural program at Walla Walla Community College in Washington.Even if those jobs returned, a high school diploma is simply no longer good enough to fill them. Yet rarely discussed in the political debate over lost jobs are the academic skills needed for today\u2019s factory-floor positions, and the pathways through education that lead to them.Many believe that the solution is for more Americans to go to college. But the college-for-all movement, which got its start in the 1970s as American manufacturing began its decline, is often conflated with earning a bachelor\u2019s degree.Many high school students rush off to four-year campuses not ready for the academic work or not sure why they are there. Government data show that 44 percent of new graduates enroll directly in a four-year college, but based on recent trends, less than half of them will earn a degree within four years. And though two-year colleges have long been identified as the institutions that fill the job-training role, some 80 percent of community college students say they intend to go on for a bachelor\u2019s degree, or they leave with generic associate degrees that are of little value in the job market.\u201cThe bachelor\u2019s degree is the gold standard, but the higher education system has to create ways for students to choose training and education in their own time and sequence,\u201d said Anthony P. Carnevale, the director of the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University. \u201cHigher ed,\u201d he said, \u201cneeds to respect the dignity of labor.\u201dFaced with a skills gap, employers are increasingly working with community colleges to provide students with both the academic education needed to succeed in today\u2019s work force and the specific hands-on skills to get a job in their companies. John Deere, for example, has designed a curriculum and donated farm equipment to several community colleges to train technicians for its dealer network. About 15 to 20 students come through the program at Walla Walla each semester. Because they are sponsored by a John Deere dealership, where the students work for half the program, most graduate in two years with a job in hand. Technicians start at salaries just shy of $40,000, on average.Dr. Carnevale\u2019s research has found that 40 percent of middle-skills jobs pay more than $55,000 a year; some 14 percent pay more than $80,000 (by comparison, the median salary for young adults with a bachelor\u2019s degree is $50,000).Jobs like the ones John Deere offers are still associated in people\u2019s minds with students who performed poorly in high school, those considered \u201cnot college material.\u201d But to succeed in programs like those at Walla Walla, students need to take advanced math and writing in high school, academics typically encouraged only for those going on to four-year colleges.Persuading students and their parents to consider the apprenticeship track is a tough sell, especially because companies want students who have a strong academic background.\u201cThese are not positions for underachievers,\u201d said Roger Collins, who recruits apprentices for Siemens at 15 Charlotte-area high schools.Chad Robinson was one of those students. Ranked in the top 10 of his high school\u2019s senior class, with a 3.75 grade-point average, he had already been accepted to the engineering school at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte when he told his parents he wanted to shift course and apply for the Siemens apprenticeship.\u201cThey were very against it,\u201d he said, until they went to the open house. \u201cA lot of my friends who majored in engineering in college told me they wish they had done the apprenticeship because my work experience will put me ahead of everyone else.\u201dIT is not uncommon to find executives in Europe who got their start in apprenticeships, which are seen as a respected path to a profession in a variety of fields, from hospitality to health care, retail to banking.In the decades after World War II, registered programs expanded in number and type, with the addition of fields like firefighting and medical technician. But apprenticeships never caught on, relegated to a second-class career track as college enrollment ballooned in the 1960s and \u201970s, and more recently mirroring the falloff in the influence and membership of labor unions.The Department of Labor\u2019s registry now lists 21,000 programs with about 500,000 apprentices, which sounds impressive but represents only 1.5 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds in this country and is far short of demand. Still, participation is up 35 percent and the number of programs by 11 percent since 2013.\u201cApprenticeship is the other college, except without the debt,\u201d said Mr. Perez, who had a goal of doubling the number by 2018. Advocates are hopeful that the trend will continue with new leadership in Washington, given President Trump\u2019s familiarity with construction.1. Which lever would be the easiest to lift the wooden box with?\u00a0A, B or C? There is no difference. None of these.While the building trades still dominate, the types of occupations offering internships have expanded to include jobs like pharmacy technician, I.T. project manager and insurance adjuster. Aon, the insurance and financial services company, last month announced a program in Chicago in which high school graduates get training in account management, human resources, financial analysis and information technology while earning an associate degree from Harold Washington College or Harper College.\u201cApprenticeships can start with a job and end with a Ph.D.,\u201d said Noel Ginsburg, who heads up the program and is president and founder of Intertech Plastics in Denver. The initiative was inspired by a visit that Mr. Ginsburg and dozens of politicians and business and education leaders made to Switzerland in 2015. Although German apprenticeships are often held up as the model, Mr. Ginsburg preferred the Swiss approach, which involves a wider range of fields.Beginning in 10th grade, students rotate among employers, industry organizations and school for three to four years of training and mentoring. Learning is hands-on, and they are paid. Switzerland\u2019s unemployment rate for the young is the lowest in Europe and about a quarter that of the United States\u2019.Here in the United States, most students are offered a choice between college or a dead end. The college-for-all movement, it seems, has closed off rather than opened up career options. For working-class voters who feel left out in this economy to be able to secure meaningful jobs, educational pathways must be expanded and legitimized \u2014 in the process redefining and broadening what is meant by higher education.\u201cThe silver bullet comes by adding more training opportunities during and after high school,\u201d said Dr. Carnevale. \u201cAnd whatever you do with training, you need to call it college. You want to make people feel good about the path they choose.\u201dJeffrey J.

{"Headline": "Study Finds Lower, but Still High, Rate of C-Sections in China", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byGlobal HealthChina, which has long been criticized for soaring C-section rates, actually has rates lower than previously reported, although they are still quite high, according to a large new study done jointly by Chinese and American scientists.The C-section rate varies widely by regions. In urban, wealthy Shanghai, it was recently as high as 68 percent, while in remote Tibet it is now about 4 percent.China\u2019s extraordinarily high rate is a result of its former one-child policy, changing medical care conditions and its increasingly capitalist economy.According to the study\u2019s authors, many parents and grandparents demand C-sections to assure that births take place on a lucky day in the astrological calendar, or because they believe that a surgically removed infant is more likely to be perfectly formed.More than 99 percent of all women in China now give birth in hospitals \u2014 30 years ago, only about half did. But they typically have gone through labor in open wards with no husband or family present, too few nurses and no pain relief. C-sections are an attractive alternative, said Dr. Susan C. Hellerstein, a Harvard Medical School obstetrician and one of the authors.Doctors made more money from fees and \u201ctips\u201d from families if they operated, the researchers found. And if they performed scheduled surgeries rather than risk vaginal births, doctors felt they were less likely to be accused of malpractice, which is a criminal offense in China, or to face angry families demanding compensation.Vaginal births can quickly go wrong if, for example, the cord wraps around the baby\u2019s neck.The study was led by doctors from China\u2019s national statistics office, Peking University, Harvard Medical School and New York University\u2019s Wagner School of Public Service.The 2010 W.H.O. survey erred by relying on figures from just 21 hospitals, mostly in cities, said Dr. Jan Blustein, a health policy specialist at N.Y.U. and co-author. The new study tallied 90 percent of the country\u2019s births over seven years.While a few cities like Shanghai had astronomical rates, half of all Chinese still live in rural areas where home births are more common and distances to hospitals are greater, so actual rates are closer to the ideal 10 to 20 percent range.In Tibet, however, C-sections are so rare that mothers and children who could be saved from death are undoubtedly not getting the operations, Dr. Hellerstein said. C-sections save lives in breech or multiple births, for example, or when a mother has dangerously high blood pressure or a fetal heartbeat fails.But babies born by C-section are more likely to hospitalized for breathing problems and more likely to suffer asthma and obesity later in life, possibly as a result of not getting microbes present in the birth canal. Mothers who have had C-sections also are more likely to hemorrhage or to have a uterine rupture in the next pregnancy.Since 2009, China has been trying to control medically unnecessary cesareans by educating patients, doctors and midwives, and by warning individual hospitals when their rates are too high, said Dr. Jianmeng Liu, director of the Office for National Maternal and Child Health Statistics of China and a study co-author.\u201cAll these older women wanting a second baby after a C-section is going to be a big challenge,\u201d Dr. Hellerstein said.Advertisement"}

So the best way you help workers is by ensuring that they are flexible \u2014 that they have the skills, safety nets, health care and lifelong learning opportunities to make those leaps and that they live in cities open to innovation, entrepreneurship and high-I.Q. risk-takers.Businesses signal to schools and colleges, in real time, the skills they need to thrive in the global economy, and philanthropies fund innovative programs for supplemental education and training. Schools also serve as adult learning and social service centers \u2014 and local and state governments support them all, including reaching out globally for investors and new markets.Eric Beinhocker, executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking at Oxford, calls this the \u201cnew progressive localism.\u201d For too long, he argues, \u201cprogressives have been so focused on Washington, they\u2019ve missed the fact that most of the progress on the issues they care about \u2014 environment, education, economic opportunity and work-force skills \u2014 has happened at the local level. Because that is where trust lives.\u201d Trust is what enables you to adapt quickly and experiment often, i.e., to be flexible. And there is so much more trust on the local level than the national level in America today.When Trump strong-arms a company to retain jobs, but kills Obamacare without a credible alternative, he is saving jobs but hurting workers, because he is making workers less secure and less flexible.Another of Trump\u2019s jobs fallacies is that regulation always holds companies back. In some cases it does, and thoughtful deregulation can help. But Trump\u2019s argument that we must ignore climate science because steadily upgrading clean energy standards for our power, auto and construction companies kills jobs is pure nonsense.Fact: California has some of the highest clean energy standards for cars, buildings and electric utilities in America. And those standards have kept California one of the world\u2019s leaders in clean-tech companies and start-ups, and its jobs and overall economy have grown steadily since 2010.\u201cThe Golden State has more than half a million advanced energy jobs,\u201d says Energy Innovation C.E.O. Hal Harvey. \u201cThat\u2019s 10 times more \u2014 in this state alone \u2014 than total U.S. coal jobs.\u201d Trump\u2019s strategy is to \u201cmake America last\u201d on clean energy and to double down on coal. Insane.In sum, Democrats should and can take the language of \u201cstrength\u201d away from Trump and own it themselves. They should be for strong workers, not strong walls; for building strong communities, not relying on a strongman to strong-arm employers; and for strong standards to create strong companies. Those would be my fightin\u2019 words.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Political Crisis Engulfs Samsung, a Firm Tied to South Korea\u2019s Success", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Samsung, the giant maker of products as varied as cargo ships and smartphones, is one of the driving forces of the South Korean economy. Now, the fate of its leadership could be tied to the sprawling investigation of a corruption scandal involving the nation\u2019s president.The crisis is particularly difficult not only for the company, but for South Korea\u2019s relatively young democracy. One of the country\u2019s most important companies might be wounded, and the nation\u2019s leadership has been thrown into disarray.Suave and mellow, Mr. Lee has often been portrayed as the right leader for a vast, stodgy business empire needing to refocus.The bribery crisis has dominated the news for days in South Korea, where Samsung and other huge \u201cchaebols,\u201d or family-controlled industrial empires, are embedded in politics and in the national identity. Samsung alone accounts for about 20 percent of South Korea\u2019s exports.The country\u2019s largest chaebols have faced legal battles and convictions in recent years, but these episodes often end with the industrialists receiving pardons.Mr. Lee might not be arrested at all. That will be decided this week.Prosecutors say Samsung made payments in exchange for a decision by the government-controlled National Pension Service to support a contentious 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates. Analysts say the merger helped Mr. Lee inherit control of Samsung from his father.In a statement on Monday, Samsung denied any bribery or making \u201cimproper requests related to the merger of Samsung affiliates or the leadership transition.\u201d But the move by prosecutors casts Mr. Lee in a different light, as a leader similar to his father, who was convicted of white-collar crimes but pardoned twice. It also could raise questions about Mr. Lee\u2019s pledge to make Samsung more transparent and more responsive to shareholders.Mr. Lee, who goes by Jay Y. Lee in the West, is part of the third generation of the Lee family to lead the conglomerate. While his father was widely seen as old-fashioned, Mr. Lee has been painted by Samsung as equally comfortable in Silicon Valley and in the boardroom, as a leader who could open up the clannish business and reinvigorate Samsung\u2019s flagging reputation for innovation in consumer technology. Samsung is the world\u2019s biggest maker of cellphones.\u201cBeyond the arrest itself, this is going to be a big blow to the narrative they\u2019ve been building,\u201d said Geoffrey Cain, the author of a coming book on Samsung. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convince shareholders and partners they are a hip Silicon Valley-style company when these charges show them to be a company run like a feudal dynasty.\u201dSamsung is in effect a collection of widely disparate companies, each with an autonomous, professional management team. Samsung Electronics, the most important of those companies, is broken into high-functioning business units. Because of that, some observers say that the company could continue to run smoothly without Mr. Lee.Important matters that require Mr. Lee\u2019s imprimatur could be delayed amid the distractions, said Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Company. \u201cI think that\u2019s the thing you need to worry about: big decisions,\u201d he said.Mr. Lee\u2019s role at Samsung is not necessarily imperiled. South Korea has a long history of pardoning the leaders of its largest family-run companies. Because of Samsung\u2019s size, past efforts to penalize the company or its executives have been met with worries about the effect on South Korea\u2019s economy.But Mr. Lee\u2019s problems could influence the company\u2019s strategic decisions at a time of major challenges, such as how to bounce back from the debacle over its Galaxy Note 7. A spate of fires last year forced Samsung to recall and then cease production of the phone, tarnishing the company\u2019s name and making it the object of airline safety announcements and jokes on American late-night talk shows.Analysts highlighted two executives who run large parts of the company\u2019s operations who they said could take on more responsibility. One is Kwon Oh-hyun, who helped Samsung become a leader in memory and semiconductor operations. The other, Choi Gee-sung, was crucial in building the company\u2019s television unit, which eclipsed Sony\u2019s a decade ago.Mr. Lee, 48, is vice chairman of Samsung, but he has been widely considered the company\u2019s de facto leader since his father, Lee Kun-hee, had a heart attack in 2014. The elder Mr. Lee led Samsung from its roots as a components supplier to a maker of consumer products, establishing a global brand and shedding a reputation for cheap goods. In one example of his drive, two decades ago he gathered 150,000 Samsung phones that failed quality tests and set them on fire.Under the younger Mr. Lee, Samsung has focused again on components, a sector that has benefited from companies wanting to add features to their phones. Late last year, the company struck an $8 billion deal to buy Harman International to make smart components for cars.But Mr. Lee has also pledged to make changes to ensure that Samsung\u2019s corporate governance meets international standards. As a family-controlled group with dense links among its units, the corporation has a structure that has drawn criticism from some investors.Samsung has also pressed for cultural changes to foster innovation and a start-up-style environment, and Mr. Lee has been portrayed as a part of that shift. At Samsung, he is credited with negotiating an important deal with Steve Jobs to help make the Apple iPod.Despite such efforts, Samsung has not followed up with a next act in the wake of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, and prominent projects like creating an operating system have largely been considered failures.Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In America\u2019s Heartland, Discussing Climate Change Without Saying \u2018Climate Change\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byGLEN ELDER, Kan. \u2014 Doug Palen, a fourth-generation grain farmer on Kansas\u2019 wind-swept plains, is in the business of understanding the climate. Since 2012, he has choked through the harshest drought to hit the Great Plains in a century, punctuated by freakish snowstorms and suffocating gales of dust. His planting season starts earlier in the spring and pushes deeper into winter.To adapt, he has embraced an environmentally conscious way of farming that guards against soil erosion and conserves precious water. He can talk for hours about carbon sequestration \u2014 the trapping of global-warming-causing gases in plant life and in the soil \u2014 or the science of the beneficial microbes that enrich his land.In short, he is a climate change realist. Just don\u2019t expect him to utter the words \u201cclimate change.\u201d\u201cIf politicians want to exhaust themselves debating the climate, that\u2019s their choice,\u201d Mr. Palen said, walking through fields of freshly planted winter wheat. \u201cI have a farm to run.\u201dHere in north-central Kansas, America\u2019s breadbasket and conservative heartland, the economic realities of agriculture make climate change a critical business issue. At the same time, politics and social pressure make frank discussion complicated. This is wheat country, and Donald J. Trump country, and though the weather is acting up, the conservative orthodoxy maintains that the science isn\u2019t settled.So while climate change is part of daily conversation, it gets disguised as something else.Mr. Palen \u2014 he plays his politics close to his vest but allows that he didn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton \u2014 and others here in Glen Elder and across the state illustrate the delicate dance.Farmers like him focus on practical issues like erosion or dwindling aquifers. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t get the rainfall, it\u2019s tough times,\u201d he said.Regional politicians and business leaders speak of pursuing jobs that clean energy may create, rather than pressing the need to rein in carbon emissions. A science teacher at a community college \u2014 whose deeply religious students sometimes express doubts about the trustworthiness of science that contradicts biblical teachings \u2014 speaks to his class about the positives of scientific discovery (electricity) in order to ease into more contentious subjects (global warming).And an editor for a closely followed agriculture magazine, Successful Farming, recently made a controversial move, drawing a flurry of angry letters: He broke with longstanding policy to address climate change head-on.\u201cSome readers thanked us,\u201d the editor Gil Gullickson said. \u201cBut some wondered whether we\u2019d been hijacked by avid environmentalists.\u201dMuch of that consensus has broken down, in no small part because of a well-financed push by fossil-fuel interests, together with influential Republican allies, to attack well-established research on topics like global warming and push back on environmental regulation. That push began in earnest during the George W. Bush administration as attempts to undercut the Clean Air Act, and since then, the divide has widened.The fact that the climate-change discourse has also become dominated by liberals has alienated some conservatives, including Mr. Palen. Many people here in particular resent how, in the polarized political landscape of recent years, conservative Americans have been painted as hostile to the environment.Still, \u201cit would be a huge mistake to think people voting for Trump were voting against the environment,\u201d Ms. Horn said. If Trump follows an aggressive anti-environment agenda, she said, \u201cthere will be a big backlash in the heartland.\u201dIn many ways, Mr. Palen sees himself as the ultimate conservationist. His great-grandfather, the son of an immigrant from Luxembourg, was the first to farm in this stretch of north-central Kansas.Mr. Palen grew up on the farm, took it over in his 20s, and looked to make his mark. In college, he learned of a farming technique called \u201cno till,\u201d which is intended to more closely mimic the natural prairie ecosystem, and was intrigued by its promise to protect his family fields from Kansas\u2019 relentless winds and sudden downpours. The idea behind no-till farming, he now explains to anyone who will listen, is that plowing the soil destroys its natural structure, causing it to lose its precious moisture and nutrients. That makes it vulnerable to erosion.Mr. Palen\u2019s fields aren\u2019t tilled. There are no neat furrows. The residue of plants from previous plantings still carpets the earth, offering a layer of protection, and his fields are never bare even after harvest. He alternates wheat and other crops with what he describes as a cocktail of grasses and leafy plants, like grain sorghum, sunflowers and alfalfa, a gesture toward the diversity of the wild prairie. \u201cThey say there\u2019s more organisms in a handful of soil than people on the planet,\u201d Mr. Palen said, making his way through a field between plantings. He stooped his tall frame down, dug up a clump of earth, and rolled it between his fingers. He is soft-spoken, yet when he talks of the earth, his excitement is obvious.\u201cSee how it\u2019s firm and holds together?\u201d he said. \u201cSee how it doesn\u2019t break down into goo?\u201dDespite his conservationist streak, Mr. Palen has no affinity for environmentalists. He feels vilified, he says, for his continued use of chemical herbicides and pesticides. (Some organic farmers control weeds by tilling the soil, which Mr. Palen argues causes more ecological harm.) And he remains suspicious of any expansion of government regulations that ignore realities of rural America.\u201cWe want to be left alone,\u201d Mr. Palen said. He singled out the Clean Water Rule, an E.P.A. regulation designed to protect streams and other waterways, as regulatory overreach. Washington types wanted to dictate what he could do with every creek, every puddle, on his farm, he said, putting impossible burdens on farmers.And most of them had probably never spent any time on a farm, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones working to protect the environment. We\u2019re the ones whose lives are tied to the earth.\u201dSince a particularly contentious debate in class \u2014 a student threw a book bag at him, he said \u2014 Mr. Priesendorf has taken a step back to focus on the everyday positives of science. \u201cI ask: \u2018Do you like the light bulb? Do you like electricity?\u2019 That\u2019s science,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I ease into more contentious topics, like climate change.\u201dAnd conservatives have been pushing back against classroom standards adopted by the state of Kansas that treat evolution and climate change as scientific concepts. Last year, the United States Supreme Court declined to review a nonprofit group\u2019s lawsuit that claimed that those standards promote atheism.But now, under a Trump administration, Mr. Priesendorf felt science itself was under fire. \u201cIf even your government starts telling your country that scientists are lying to you, it\u2019ll be even tougher for science teachers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to focus on keeping my students\u2019 minds open to the possibility that the science is correct.\u201dAnnie Kuether, a Democrat and clean-energy advocate in the Republican-controlled Statehouse and a member of the State Utilities Committee, has for years pushed for more renewable energy. One obstacle, though, is that the committee\u2019s chairman does not believe in climate change.A St. Louis native who landed in Topeka as a young bride four decades ago, Ms. Kuether is used to working alongside adversaries. Her county voted for Mr. Trump, along with all but two counties in the state.\u201cI remember being horrified,\u201d Ms. Kuether said.Still, over the years, she has forged powerful business alliances by focusing, in her arguments, on jobs and the economy. She has also found increasing support from farmers and landowners who count on wind turbines and solar panels they host on their property for income.\u201cJust like grain, cattle, airplanes, wind\u2019s another valuable resource Kansas can export,\u201d he said, referring to Kansas\u2019 sizable agricultural industry, as well as the Cessna Aircraft Company, which is based in Wichita, Kan. \u201cKansas has a lot of pragmatic folks here, and we recognize benefits.\u201dKansas\u2019 dwindling water sources have been another issue that Ms. Kuether has found strikes a nerve among voters here, whatever their beliefs on climate change. That has helped to build some support for measures to save the state\u2019s shrinking aquifers, a lifeline for communities in western Kansas, though not yet any decisive action.In fact, her focus on the practical is a big part of what has kept getting her elected, she said, in a State Legislature where she is outnumbered by Republican lawmakers, two to one. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that families have always been concerned about water \u2014 whether they\u2019re Democratic, Republican or independent,\u201d she said.Mr. Gullickson of Successful Farming, who usually writes about topics like pigweed, gypsum and runoff, has started to push the envelope on debates over climate change. An 11-year veteran of the magazine, where he is the crops technology editor, Mr. Gullickson said he had long been on the fence about climate change. But that began changing five years ago, when he attended a workshop where a University of Kentucky professor gave a convincing argument, backed by data.\u201cI started looking at the evidence, at the data and what farmers were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear: The weather has become more extreme these days. And I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve never heard of any successful business publication that stayed in business by withholding information.\u2019\u201dSo for the first time in the storied magazine\u2019s 115-year-old history, a cover story squarely addressed the science of climate change. The October 2014 piece was published under the headline, \u201c@#$*% Weather!\u201d\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking: Climate change is just some figment of Al Gore\u2019s imagination adopted by liberal tree-huggers who want to tank the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Gullickson wrote.\u201cStill, think back over some rough weather you\u2019ve endured in recent years and ask yourself these questions,\u201d he continued. \u201cAre springs getting wetter? Are droughts increasing in severity? Are rainstorms increasing in intensity?\u201d The clear answer, he said: \u201cYes.\u201dMr. Gullickson said that he and his editor had held lengthy discussions leading up to the article\u2019s publication. His editor in chief, Dave Kurns, was supportive, he said, but also warned that the piece could generate backlash.Mr. Kurns spoke candidly over concerns of a backlash in an editor\u2019s note that led the issue. When he became the magazine\u2019s editor two years earlier, he said, he had been warned, \u201cNever use the words \u2018climate change.\u2019\u201d\u201cI was told: \u2018Readers hate that phrase. Just talk about the weather,\u2019\u201d he wrote.The response to the magazine\u2019s take on the issues has been split.\u201cWhen you start quoting \u2018climate scientists\u2019 and the United Nations,\u201d wrote in one reader, Bill Clinger, a farmer based in Harpster, Ohio, \u201cyou are as nutty as Al Gore.\u201d Measures to control emissions, he said, \u201care just seductive names for socialist programs intended to micromanage people and businesses.\u201dMr. Gullickson said some readers thanked him. \u201cFinally, a farming magazine comes to terms with what is going on with the weather,\u201d wrote Paul Jereczek of Dodge, Wis.Reached by phone, Mr. Jereczek, who runs a dairy farm, expressed exasperation at people\u2019s inability to speak openly. \u201cThe phrase has become so politicized, it\u2019s just hard to talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we talk about everything else. Even round here, protecting soil is such a hot topic right now. But we talk about the soil, saving fertilizer, that sort of thing.\u201dKnown for its shock of yellow hair and bright orange cheeks, the lesser prairie-chicken once roamed the Great Plains. Today, though, the grouse is under threat \u2014 its populations reduced to isolated pockets in western Kansas, Colorado and the Texas-New Mexico border as its habitat succumbs to climate-induced drought, farming, drilling and other human activity.The group has been petitioning the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The bird found itself taken off the list after a lawsuit in 2014 backed by the oil and gas industry, which argues that any protective measures would mean added costs for energy developers.Mr. Salvo has found that to gain allies it doesn\u2019t always help to start with the role climate change plays in harming the bird\u2019s habitat. Instead, his movement has tried to find common ground, highlighting the historical heritage of the lesser prairie-chicken. In the \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d novels, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote about eating prairie-chicken mush.Mr. Salvo also stresses how grouse-friendly practices can be good for farming, too, backing a federal program that provides financial aid to private landowners who adopt those practices. Leaving corn stubble standing after harvest gives the birds food and places to hide, for example, while also helping farmers protect the soil.\u201cSometimes, to gain allies, it helps to focus on issues of common concern, to support local economic development as well as species conservation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps everybody come to the table.\u201dAnd yes, Mr. Palen says, he is on board with saving the lesser prairie-chicken. \u201cI often think of ways I can protect their habitat,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoy wildlife.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Presidents Have Less Power Over the Economy Than You Might Think", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byInvisible HandPresidential reputations rise or fall with gross domestic product. The state of the economy can determine if presidents are re-elected, and it shapes historical memory of their success or failure.But the reality is that presidents have far less control over the economy than you might imagine. Presidential economic records are highly dependent on the dumb luck of where the nation is in the economic cycle. And the White House has no control over the demographic and technological forces that influence the economy.Even in areas where the president really does have power to shape the economy \u2014 appointing Federal Reserve governors, steering fiscal and regulatory policy, responding to crises and external shocks \u2014 the relationship between presidential action and economic outcome is often uncertain and hard to prove.It\u2019s this quirk in how we think that unfairly enhances the reputation of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton while unfairly diminishing the presidencies of Jimmy Carter and both George Bushes.And if you think of the financial markets as the hyperactive cousin of the economy itself, this mental framework can cost you money.We all have a tendency to think that a president whose policies we disagree with will be bad for the economy and the stock market. But looking at markets in such starkly political terms can lead to bad decisions. Ask a conservative who refused to invest in stocks while they notched a 182 percent gain during the Obama presidency \u2014 or a liberal who shorted stocks after Donald J. Trump won in November.So what tools does a president actually have to shape economic outcomes? Fewer than you might think. Let\u2019s walk through the factors that determine economic results \u2014 from those that are more purely luck to those that do reflect a president\u2019s skill at overseeing the economy.When George H.W. Bush took office in January 1989, the unemployment rate was 5.4 percent and the roaring 1980s expansion was near its peak. When Bill Clinton succeeded him in January 1993, the unemployment rate was 7.3 percent and falling, as the United States was finally shaking off the damage of a recession.That bit of timing alone \u2014 taking office at the trough of the business cycle versus the peak \u2014 can help explain much of how we perceive a president. Mr. Bush, of course, was a one-term president, while Mr. Clinton was handily re-elected.President Obama\u2019s luck on this front was somewhere between those extremes; he took office in the middle of a steep downturn. But some simple math shows just how much the timing of the 2008-9 recession relative to Inauguration Day mattered. Mr. Obama is set to leave office with cumulative job growth of 8.4 percent over his eight years in office.But if he had taken office 13 months earlier in December 2007, he would have presided over a putrid 3.4 percent growth. If he had taken office in February 2010, when employment hit rock bottom, he would be on track to see blockbuster 14 percent job growth in eight years (assuming 2017 job creation turns out to be equivalent to 2016).Put simply, when you take office at the bottom of a recession and with unemployment high, you can \u201cachieve\u201d a lot of growth just from the natural healing of the economy. When you take office at the top, there is nowhere to go but down. This may presage bad news for Mr. Trump, given that the jobless rate was a relatively low 4.7 percent in December.Consider one of the big economic forces of the post-World War II economy: women entering the labor force on a mass scale. In 1948, only 33 percent of American women between 25 and 54 worked or sought work. By the time George W. Bush took office in January 2001, that had risen to about 77 percent.That means that throughout the second half of the 20th century, the economy had a huge tailwind, as millions of women joined the work force and stated contributing to G.D.P. Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton didn\u2019t create that trend; broader social forces did. But the fact that it happened made their economic records look better.Expand the idea to other elements of demographics: the baby boom generation entering the labor force from the 1960s through the 1980s and now retiring; the large millennial generation coming into the work force. You see that a big part of the economic growth that might take place during a given presidency is determined by forces not under any politician\u2019s control.It\u2019s worth noting that these forces are part of the story behind slow growth during the Obama administration and will \u2014 unless something surprising changes \u2014 continue in the Trump administration. The labor force has grown an average of 0.4 percent a year during the last eight years, and the Congressional Budget Office projects an average of 0.5 percent a year during the coming four.By contrast, the labor force grew by an average of 1.2 percent a year during the 1990s, the last period of blockbuster growth.Now we\u2019re getting to areas where the president really does have some control over the economic cycle. Too bad it\u2019s so indirect.The Federal Reserve raises and lowers interest rates in an effort to prevent recessions and maintain low inflation. The president appoints its seven-member board of governors, including the chair.The president can select appointees who align in terms of philosophy and instincts, and may select Fed governors who are more competent \u2014 or less. But the Fed system is designed to maintain independence from the administration once the appointments are made.Beyond that, terms are staggered such that a president won\u2019t necessarily get to appoint a majority of Fed leaders, especially right off the bat (Fed governors\u2019 terms are 14 years, though lately few have served that long; the Fed chair has a four-year term).So when a president appoints Fed officials who are effective stewards of monetary policy, achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices and financial stability, it helps a president\u2019s odds of having an impressive economic record. It just isn\u2019t a very direct exertion of power.This is often what we think of when we talk about a president\u2019s economic policy. The occupants of the Oval Office can steer policy around taxing and spending priorities. But they can\u2019t do it alone.It\u2019s certainly true that tax and spending policy carries a president\u2019s imprint. President Obama\u2019s election victories enabled him to enact a major fiscal stimulus in 2009 and increase taxes on the wealthy starting in 2013. President Reagan\u2019s election brought a sharp cut in tax rates. Different election results would have made for different fiscal policy.But Congress has, if anything, greater power than the president over how the government taxes and spends. It\u2019s almost a punch line that when a president issues a proposed budget each winter, congressional opponents call it \u201cdead on arrival.\u201dAnd while Mr. Obama had fiscal policy wins, he also met stiff resistance. The spending cuts known as \u201csequestration\u201d happened because Republicans took control of Congress in 2010.So to the degree that taxes and spending shape the course of the economy \u2014 and there\u2019s no doubt they do \u2014 presidents can set direction, but not steer the ship themselves. It is a lesson Mr. Trump will soon learn.There\u2019s a broad range of other areas in which presidential action affects the economic future. Name a field, and the president exerts power over it: health care, energy, technology innovation, financial regulation, labor policies, trade, transportation infrastructure, agricultural policy. The list is endless. Even foreign policy matters; stable geopolitics is generally good for business.The problem is that all of these big policy areas affect the nation\u2019s economic prospects over the long run. The downsides of regulating banks poorly might show up as a crisis a decade down the road. The benefits of better infrastructure will tend to show up over many years. The payoffs of well-designed education policies come to fruition as young people enter the labor market with better skills years later.Likewise, from a more conservative vantage point, the cost of environmental restrictions limiting energy production may not show up in the price of fuel for years. Burdensome, outdated regulations tend to show up as a modest drag on business year after year, not as an acute, clear crisis.For example, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Affordable Care Act would reduce the labor supply by 2.3 million because more people would choose not to work. (The thinking being that they were working mainly so they could have employee-sponsored health insurance.) It said this would happen not immediately, but by 2021, a full 11 years after the law was passed and four years after the president who signed it would be out of office.And that\u2019s a case where independent economists manage to create an estimate of economic consequences. Often these economic impacts are so slow-building, diffuse and subject to partisan interpretation that it\u2019s hard to estimate them with any precision. We all want to assume that it is our preferred policies that make the economy rev more strongly, even if it\u2019s hard to prove definitively.None of this means that presidents can\u2019t do a lot to make the United States economy more dynamic and productive. It\u2019s just that doing so could take a great while. It\u2019s hard to prove that this or that policy was the source of the good times.In the short run, all those other factors have a more direct, measurable effect in shaping whether a moment in political history produces an economy we remember fondly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Un-American Refugee Policy", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPresident Trump\u2019s executive order suspending the entire resettlement program for 120 days and banning indefinitely the arrival of Syrian refugees is a repudiation of fundamental American values, an abandonment of the United States\u2019 role as a humanitarian leader and, far from protecting the country from extremism, a propaganda gift to those who would plot harm to America.The order also cuts the number of refugees scheduled for resettlement in the United States in the fiscal year 2017 from a planned total of about 110,000 to just 50,000. Founded on the myth that there is no proper security screening for refugees, the order thus thrusts into limbo an estimated 60,000 vulnerable refugees, most of whom have already been vetted and cleared for resettlement here. The new policy urgently needs rethinking.Refugees coming to the United States are fleeing the same violent extremism that this country and its allies are fighting in the Middle East and elsewhere. Based on recent data, a majority of those selected for resettlement in America are women and children. Since the start of the war, millions of Syrians have fled not just the military of President Bashar al-Assad but also the forces of Russia, Iranian militias and the Islamic State.There are also thousands of Afghans and Iraqis whose lives are at risk because of assistance they offered American troops stationed in their countries. Of all the refugees that my organization, the International Rescue Committee, would be helping to resettle this year, this group, the Special Immigrant Visa population, makes up a fourth.The order also suggests that the resettlement program should make persecuted religious minorities a higher priority, implying that they have been neglected in the past. This is incorrect; existing law already places strong emphasis on religious persecution among the criteria for resettlement. For example, most of the refugees from Iran \u2014 a Muslim-majority country \u2014 who are resettled by my organization are not Muslim.The United States can be proud of its wide network of refugee champions, for good reason: Refugee resettlement is an American success story. And this is true not just on the coasts but across the country. In the 29 cities where the Rescue Committee has resettlement offices, elected officials like the mayor of Boise, Idaho, and the governor of Utah, along with police officers, school principals, faith leaders and small-business owners, actively welcome refugees. They do so out of a sense of a moral obligation, of course, but also because they have witnessed the myriad ways refugees have enriched their communities over the years.Historically, the United States has welcomed the \u201chuddled masses yearning to breathe free,\u201d and this has helped cement America\u2019s leadership of the international order. But why should others continue to bear their heavy burdens when the United States won\u2019t? Support for refugees is not charity; it is a contribution to the global stability on which all nations depend \u2014 and this is especially important at a time when the world faces a heightened threat of terrorism.Terrorists are strategic in their work and their messaging. The civilized world must be equally strategic in its response. Where extremists seek to foster a clash of civilizations, democratic governments should not play into their hands.That is what a ban on specific nationalities does. It is not right, it is not needed and it is not smart.In 1980, when Congress passed the Refugee Act with bipartisan support, President Carter\u2019s secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Joseph A. Califano Jr., said the refugee issue required the United States to \u201creveal to the world \u2014 and more important to ourselves \u2014 whether we truly live by our ideals or simply carve them on our monuments.\u201dThat still resonates today. Expert review of the resettlement vetting process is part of good government. Hasty dismissal of carefully developed systems is harmful in and of itself. It is also a distressing departure from fact-based policy making.The world looks to America for enlightened leadership. Its citizens seek the same from their government. Refugee policy is a telling test for every nation. The United States passed that test for so many years, so it is a tragedy for it now to fail when its commitment is needed more than ever.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "His Predecessor Gone, Gambia\u2019s New President Finally Comes Home", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byBANJUL, Gambia \u2014 A week after he was inaugurated in another country, Adama Barrow landed in Gambia on Thursday afternoon, setting foot inside his own national borders for the first time as the new president.Throngs of supporters, some holding Gambian flags, lined the roads to greet Mr. Barrow, who had flown in from Dakar, Senegal, where he had fled more than a week earlier out of security concerns after his predecessor, Yahya Jammeh, refused to step down. As he entered Banjul, the capital, Mr. Barrow, dressed in all white, poked out of a white Land Cruiser surrounded by military vehicles and waved to onlookers.\u201cToday is freedom day,\u201d said Mariama Bah, a nurse from Serekunda, a town nearby, who came to the airport to welcome President Barrow. \u201cWe now have a president that we can be proud of.\u201dMr. Barrow defeated the longtime president, Mr. Jammeh, in a surprising outcome to an election in December. Mr. Jammeh, who had been in power since 1994, when he led a successful coup, initially accepted defeat. A few days after the vote, he changed his mind, declared the election results invalid and vowed to use the power of his military to stay in charge.It took repeated personal overtures from West African presidents and finally a regional coalition of troops that crossed into Gambia to persuade Mr. Jammeh, known for human rights abuses, to step down. He flew out of the country on Saturday, accompanied by a cargo plane containing his Rolls-Royce and other luxury automobiles, and has settled in Equatorial Guinea, which has its own record of human rights violations.But Mr. Jammeh still has supporters left in Gambia, and some residents worry that divisions could lead to problems in the new administration. Mr. Barrow has dismissed his predecessor\u2019s supporters as a minority. Most of all, many residents said they were weary of the regional troops who were still roaming the capital. They had arrived at the statehouse to search it and make sure all was safe for Mr. Barrow\u2019s return, but their presence on the streets was unsettling to many. Mr. Barrow\u2019s aides said the soldiers were likely to remain in Gambia for weeks as the new administration makes the transition.Some Gambians worried that it was still too early for Mr. Barrow to come home.\u201cYahya Jammeh was not acting alone,\u201d said Ishmael Ceesay, 24, a mobile phone salesman in Serekunda. \u201cHis people are still around.\u201dMr. Barrow\u2019s aides said the president would stay at a private residence until the regional troops finished securing the statehouse.Mr. Jammeh\u2019s rule penetrated the psyche of many Gambians who feared him, so much so that thousands fled years ago. Their departure further damaged an already shaky economy that Mr. Barrow has said will be a priority for him.Mr. Jammeh jailed journalists and his opponents, some of whom died in prison, carried out hunts for people believed to be witches and forced patients to stop taking medication so he could test what he said was his homemade cure for AIDS \u2014 herbs, prayers and a banana.Residents of Gambia talked about Mr. Jammeh only in hushed tones, and rarely in public, and even some members of the diaspora said they were convinced he was monitoring their communications.Mohamed Jalloh, who sells fabric at the entrance to the statehouse, said he had spent the past two decades praying a bullet would not come flying toward him.\u201cYahya Jammeh brought so much fear in us,\u201d Mr. Jalloh said.The paranoia was evident even this week, with Mr. Jammeh hundreds of miles away, when a Gambian newspaper reported that he had left toxins in the vents in the statehouse to poison his successor. Mr. Barrow\u2019s team said the report was false.For many Gambians, the pain of Mr. Jammeh\u2019s rule was all too real. Some residents said part of Mr. Barrow\u2019s new job would be comforter in chief. Mr. Barrow has vowed to create a truth and reconciliation commission to look into injustices during Mr. Jammeh\u2019s more than 22-year administration.On Wednesday afternoon in Brikama, the region where Mr. Barrow received the most votes, three women sat on a long wooden bench. They wore yellow #GambiaHasDecided T-shirts, a motto adopted by the opposition that wanted Mr. Jammeh to leave. Like many others across Gambia, each of the women said a relative had been killed by security forces loyal to Mr. Jammeh. As they sold sugar at the market, the three spoke of their losses.It was during the 2011 presidential election campaign that Nyima Jabang\u2019s father, an ambulance driver, was tortured and killed while in custody at the National Intelligence Agency. His crime: driving two men to a hospital who had been wounded at a rally in a clash between Mr. Jammeh\u2019s party and the main opposition party, the United Democratic Party.The next day, the brother of Nyima Sanyang, another of the friends selling sugar, was arrested by security forces in connection with the campaign clash and was beaten to death.The third woman, Bintu Sonko, 30, described the long, speeding motorcades that carried Mr. Jammeh and his aides, who would toss packets of cookies to supporters.In 2013, Ms. Sonko\u2019s son, Lamine, 7, heard Mr. Jammeh\u2019s cars approaching. He ran out with his friends to wave to the passing president. Lamine darted into the street to catch a cookie and was struck and killed by a car in the motorcade.\u201cThey did not even stop,\u201d Ms. Sonko said. \u201cThey kept going and throwing cookies at the rest of the kids. We can\u2019t even report the matter to the chief or the police.\u201d\u201cThat was my only child.\u201dJaime Yaya Barry reported from Banjul, and Dionne Searcey from Dakar, Senegal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Author of \u2018The Vegetarian\u2019 Takes On Korea\u2019s Violent Past", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byFictionIn early 1980, after the assassination of the authoritarian South Korean president Park Chung-hee (father to current president Park Geun-hye, now under impeachment), the nation \u2014 which had been living under limited martial law \u2014 seemed destined for change. The economy was declining. Demonstrations were on the rise. Students, professors, artists and laborers \u2014 ordinary unarmed citizens \u2014 protested and demanded a fair and free election and the lifting of martial law. Park\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Gen. Chun Doo-hwan saw an opportunity to maneuver himself into the Blue House. Chun seized power and, using the North Korea card, declared full martial law throughout the nation. He shut down universities, banned political activity and arrested student leaders as well as political rivals. Order was established in most of the country, but not in Gwangju.In Gwangju, a city located some 160 miles south of Seoul, troops brutally and indiscriminately assaulted not only protesters but bystanders too. Gwangju, however, fought back. Arming themselves any way they could, Gwangju residents forced out the military, and for five days in May the city practiced self-governance. Mothers cooked meals for the community, taxi drivers shuttled pro-democracy rebels wherever they needed to go. Some residents stood in long lines to donate blood, and some, as young as middle schoolers, helped care for and identify the bodies.\u201cThere was nothing technically difficult about the tasks you\u2019d been assigned. Seun-ju and Eun-sook had already done most of the heavy work, which involved covering plywood or Styrofoam boards with plastic, then lifting the corpses on top of these boards. They also washed the necks and faces with a cloth, ran a comb through the matted hair to tidy it a bit, then wrapped the bodies in plastic in an effort to combat the smell. In the meantime, you made a note in your ledger of gender, approximate age, what clothes they were wearing and what brand of shoes, and assigned each corpse a number. You then wrote the same number on a scrap of paper, pinned it to the corpse\u2019s chest, and covered them up to the neck with one of the white cloths.\u201dBy focusing on the logistics of cataloging the bodies, Han lulls us into the horror, and before we know it, we are there, inside the gymnasium, awe-struck by the amount of pain humans can inflict on one another and, in the obverse, the dignity with which the volunteers wash and care for the dead. In essence, we witness the impossibly large spectrum of humanity, and wonder how it is that one end could be so different from the other.To explore that spectrum, the book\u2019s polyphonic structure comes across as necessary and natural. Each chapter offers a piercing psychological portrait of a character affected by the Gwangju massacre: There\u2019s Dong-ho, labeling the dead in the gymnasium; Dong-ho\u2019s dead friend, who has been killed by troops (\u201cOur bodies are piled on top of each other in the shape of a cross\u201d); an editor facing censorship; a prisoner who has been tortured for his involvement in the uprising; a factory girl activist; Dong-ho\u2019s mother; and finally, the author of \u201cHuman Acts\u201d herself, Han Kang, who provides her own testimonial on how she was personally, though indirectly, affected by those 10 days in May 1980, when she was 9 years old.\u201cWhat is humanity?\u201d the book asks. \u201cWhat do we have to do to keep humanity as one thing and not another?\u201d This question made me rethink \u2014 and retranslate \u2014 the Korean greeting, and realize how hasehyo could be taken as a more forceful verb, insinuating a command. Instead of \u201cAre you at peace?,\u201d it could also be, \u201cAre you doing peace?\u201d Or \u201cAre you practicing peace?\u201d As in, peace comes not with passivity but with participation. As in, peace requires action, just like violence. And only now do I see yet another aspect of the novel\u2019s English title: \u201cHuman Acts,\u201d the tacit verb suggesting that, in the end, perhaps our actions are what matter.\u201cHuman Acts\u201d is, in equal parts, beautiful and urgent. Though it might not have been Han\u2019s intention, her novel reads not only as a lyrical post-mortem on violence but also a call to counter that violence. So, how do we keep humanity \u201cas one thing and not another\u201d? If humanity is under assault, and violence, oppression and authoritarianism rise to the surface, then is it not our human responsibility to act and resist, however forcefully, with everything in our power?Nami Mun is the author of \u201cMiles From Nowhere.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Scandal Roils South Korea, Fingers Point to Mixing of Politics and Business", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The heir apparent to the Samsung empire, Jay Y. Lee, was trying to push through a corporate merger seen as critical to his plans to succeed his father as chairman.The court has never before ousted a president, though seven of the last eight have left office tainted by allegations of corruption. Whatever the court decides, the Park scandal has already put recurring collusion between big business and government in South Korea under intense scrutiny and could reshape the nation\u2019s flawed, young democracy.\u201cChaebol are accomplices!\u201d protesters have chanted, carrying effigies of their leaders dressed in blue prison uniforms. Damning new details emerge weekly.Prosecutors allege that Ms. Choi conspired with Ms. Park to force 53 companies to donate more than $69 million to the two foundations under Ms. Choi\u2019s control.The National Assembly went further in its impeachment motion, describing the donations as bribes personally benefiting Ms. Choi and paid in return for favors for the companies, ranging from lucrative licenses to presidential pardons.Ms. Park has denied the charges. At an extraordinary parliamentary hearing, Mr. Lee and eight other chaebol leaders also denied receiving or seeking special treatment for the donations. But they appeared to acknowledge that the payments were not entirely voluntary.\u201cIt was difficult to go against the government\u2019s wishes,\u201d testified Koo Bon-moo, the chairman of LG, the multinational electronics company.Mr. Lee called Samsung\u2019s contribution \u201cnot voluntary\u201d but \u201cinevitable.\u201dThe meeting with Mr. Lee was one of eight that Ms. Park held with top chaebol executives in July 2015. Her lawyers have acknowledged that she asked for contributions to the two foundations in the meetings but deny that she promised any favors. Little is known about what else was discussed in these one-on-one sessions.But there is no doubt the chaebol have benefited from government support for decades.These companies eventually grew into industrial conglomerates, fueling the export-driven growth that lifted South Korea out of postwar poverty and made it one of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies.Some of the firms, such as Samsung, Hyundai and LG, are now global brands with publicly listed shares. But the founding families still dominate almost all the conglomerates, in part, critics say, because of lax enforcement of corporate governance and tax laws.In return for their support, Park and many of his successors as president expected the chaebol to contribute to government projects. And the chaebol did more than that, sometimes channeling money to the presidents\u2019 personal coffers or those of their relatives and associates.The chaebol also face competition from China, which has begun producing many of the same goods, like petrochemicals, more cheaply. Some have angered the public by shifting manufacturing abroad even as their tentacle-like grip on the economy at home is blamed for squeezing start-ups and stifling innovation.Yet the conglomerates still enjoy some of the benefits that Park Chung-hee conferred on them more than four decades ago. They are taxed at lower effective rates than most companies or individuals, and receive more tax breaks. Businesses also pay lower electricity rates than individual consumers in South Korea.The benefits of such policies, Professor You said, \u201cis a very different order of magnitude compared to the sums of money that were donated to the foundations.\u201d\u201cAll decisions are made with the interests of the chaebol in mind,\u201d he added of policy-making in recent decades. Politicians and the chaebol, he said, \u201chave been relying on each other to maintain their power.\u201dFew South Koreans believe the chaebol are innocent victims in the unfolding case. But while Ms. Choi and Mr. Ahn, the president\u2019s economic adviser, have been arrested, the authorities have not taken action against executives at any of the businesses.Historically, the chaebol titans have not been immune from prosecution. On the contrary, several have been convicted of bribery, tax evasion and embezzlement \u2014 yet remained at the helm of their businesses.That is because they are often granted suspended sentences or presidential pardons. At least six of the nation\u2019s top 10 chaebol, which generate revenue equivalent to more than 80 percent of gross domestic product, are led by men with criminal records.Since taking office in 2013, Ms. Park has granted two such pardons. Chey Tae-won, chairman of the SK Group, which spans chemicals, petroleum, telecommunications and semiconductors, received one in the summer of 2015. The other went this past summer to Lee Jae-hyun, the chairman of the CJ Group, which comprises businesses in foods, pharmaceuticals, entertainment and media.Both men had been imprisoned on corruption charges. Representatives of both men met with Ms. Park in 2015. And both the SK Group and the CJ Group made donations to Ms. Choi\u2019s foundations at the president\u2019s request, prosecutors said. The impeachment motion cites the pardons in accusing Ms. Park of selling favors.Lawmakers have also noted that the money for the foundations was collected through the Federation of Korean Industries, which lobbies on behalf of the chaebol.The prosecutor is investigating reports that Ms. Choi used funds donated by Samsung to buy a house and motel in Germany, as well as to cover her daughter\u2019s personal expenses, including accessories for her pet dogs.Some of the payments made by the chaebol occurred while the government was weighing important decisions concerning the companies. For example, the SK Group and the retail conglomerate Lotte had lost valuable licenses to run duty-free shops in 2015 and lobbied to regain them last year. Lotte won back its license in December.While Mr. Shin was under investigation, prosecutors say, Ms. Park and Mr. Ahn pressured Lotte into donating $6 million for a sports complex to be built and managed by a company founded by Ms. Choi. The money was later returned.Prosecutors say other chaebol, including Hyundai, directed millions of dollars\u2019 worth of contracts at Mr. Ahn\u2019s request to companies owned by Ms. Choi and her associates.The chaebol all wrote checks, prosecutors say, usually after Mr. Ahn uttered the magic words: \u201cThe president is interested in this.\u201d\u201cWhat we need is a great national cleanup,\u201d said Moon Jae-in, an opposition leader who is the leading candidate to succeed Ms. Park. \u201cWe must sternly punish politics-business collusion, a legacy of the dictatorial era, and take this as an opportunity to reform chaebol.\u201dThis is a recurring promise among presidential aspirants in South Korea. Almost every candidate in recent elections \u2014 including Ms. Park \u2014 has vowed to end government collusion with the chaebol. But the culture remains entrenched.Some lawmakers are calling for constitutional revisions to shift some of the president\u2019s authority to the prime minister, or even to abolish the presidency and introduce a parliamentary government.Another problem is the news media, which can be hesitant to confront the government and the chaebol, who are major advertisers. The president effectively handpicks the heads of the two biggest television stations, and the government can revoke the licenses of cable news channels.Journalists who tried to investigate Ms. Choi suffered a vicious official backlash.As early as 2014, the Segye Ilbo newspaper reported on an intelligence document alleging influence-peddling by Ms. Choi\u2019s family. Ms. Park attacked the leak, and her office pressed the newspaper to fire its president, according to the impeachment motion.Instead of investigating the allegations in the document, prosecutors interrogated Segye journalists on possible defamation charges, and reporters at the newspaper said the tax authorities had begun investigating businesses owned by the paper\u2019s parent company.A police officer accused of leaking the document killed himself. \u201cListen, journalists!\u201d Lt. Choi Kyong-rak wrote in his suicide note. \u201cThe people\u2019s right to know is what you live and exist for. Please do your job.\u201dGiven the authority of the presidency, relatives and close friends often operate as rainmakers. In the past, the presidents\u2019 siblings and sons, while holding no official titles, often wielded enormous power as \u201cjunior presidents.\u201dMs. Park is unmarried, childless and estranged from her siblings, a status that she said would free her from nepotism and break the pattern. But she had Ms. Choi, whose family befriended her after the assassination of her mother in 1974.Prosecutors did not aggressively investigate the allegations against Ms. Choi until after Ms. Park delivered her first televised apology in October, a day after a local cable channel reported that Ms. Choi had edited the president\u2019s speeches.The story emboldened the press, prompting a flood of other damaging disclosures and then the huge street protests that eventually led prosecutors to conclude it was no longer politically tenable to do nothing.Cho Eung-cheon, a former prosecutor who is now an opposition lawmaker, said the authorities had moved too late.\u201cThe prosecutors we see now,\u201d he wrote on his Facebook page, \u201care nothing more or less than a pack of hyenas attacking a crippled lion.\u201dAn article on Jan. 3 about concern in South Korea over the mixing of business and politics amid the impeachment case against President Park Geun-hye misspelled, in some editions, the surname of the chairman of the SK Group, who was pardoned by Ms. Park in 2015 after his imprisonment on corruption charges. He is Chey Tae-won, not Choi Tae-won.Advertisement"}

He noted the details of each transaction on the backs of his \u201cBoggs bills,\u201d which were blank, and sold the receipts to collectors. It was up to them to track down the merchant \u2014 for a fee, Mr. Boggs would assist \u2014 and negotiate purchase of the note.Mr. Boggs never sold his bills. He only spent them.The assembled elements were, in the opinion of Mr. Boggs and his admirers, artworks, exhibited as such in galleries around the world and included in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington.\u201cI create images that say things and ask things,\u201d Mr. Boggs said in the 2013 Discovery Channel documentary \u201cSecret Life of Money.\u201d \u201cI take them out into the real world and try to spend them, not as counterfeits, but as works of art that ask us about the nature of money.\u201dLaw enforcement agencies in several countries took a different view. They regarded Mr. Boggs as a forger. They expressed this opinion, on several occasions, by seizing the notes or putting Mr. Boggs on trial.\u201cThey said I was a counterfeiter,\u201d an indignant Mr. Boggs told The Associated Press in 1992, when agents in the counterfeiting division of the Secret Service raided his apartment near Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where he was an artist in residence, and took possession of more than 100 of his artworks. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the difference between art and crime.\u201dThe Tampa police discovered Mr. Boggs\u2019s body on Sunday in a motel near the Tampa airport. He was 62. Robert Salmon, manager of operations for the Hillsborough County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, said the cause of death had not been determined.He was born Stephen Litzner in Woodbury, N.J., on Jan. 16, 1955. (He later added the names James and George.) His mother, the former Marlene Dietrich Hildebrandt, divorced his father when Stephen was an infant, and nothing is known about him.She joined a carnival, performed as \u201cMargo, Queen of the Jungle,\u201d and in 1961 married a Tampa businessman, Jim Boggs, with whom she ran the Brahman Lounge, a bar and package store. She later wrote a neighborhood column for The Tampa Tribune, reporting on the doings in Brandon, the Tampa suburb where she lived.Mr. Boggs attended Brandon High School but was expelled in his junior year. \u201cI was accused of starting a riot in the auditorium, but it was somebody else who threw the book at the principal,\u201d he told the journalist Lawrence Weschler, who wrote a profile of Mr. Boggs for The New Yorker in 1988 that evolved into a book, \u201cBoggs: A Comedy of Values,\u201d published in 1999.He took courses at Miami University in Ohio, Hillsborough Community College in Tampa and Columbia University, pursuing, vaguely, a career in accountancy. In the late 1970s, he decided to study art and moved to London.He enrolled in the Camden Arts Center there and began producing conceptual paintings \u2014 some consisting of repeated versions of his signature, others filled with elaborately embellished numbers.After his fateful visit to Chicago, for the International Art Exposition at Navy Pier, he returned to London and pursued the money trail with little success until he exhibited \u201cPined Newt,\u201d an oversize pound note, at the International Contemporary Art Fair in London in 1986. It sold for 1,500 times its face value and attracted the attention of Rudy Demenga, a Swiss art dealer, who invited him to Art Basel.The Swiss turned out to be ideal customers. Wherever he went, Mr. Boggs found that his handcrafted bank notes, executed with a fine pen on expensive paper, were, so to speak, legal tender. He began dining in fine restaurants and moved into a five-star hotel.\u201cAll money is art,\u201d Mr. Boggs told The Orlando Sentinel in 1997. \u201cIf you look at a dollar, it\u2019s portraiture, it\u2019s landscape art, it\u2019s abstract designs.\u201cI think people need to think more about money. If they did, they\u2019d think more about what they do to make it and what they do with it once it is made.\u201dThe British were less accommodating. As he was preparing to exhibit four bank notes at the Young Unknowns Gallery in London in 1986, three constables raided the gallery and hauled Mr. Boggs off to jail. He was charged with four counts of violating the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act.The civil-rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson mounted a successful defense. Mr. Boggs paid him in Boggs notes. In his book \u201cThe Justice Game\u201d (1998), Mr. Robertson wrote that the Bank of England, in response to the Boggs case, added a copyright notice to its paper currency.Three years later, Mr. Boggs was arrested in Sydney, Australia. This time the judge dismissed the case and awarded him $20,000 in damages.While in residence at Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Boggs planned to photocopy $1 million in Boggs bills and release them into the local economy, relying on others to keep them in circulation.\u201cI\u2019ve been spending this money for eight years,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much. I wanted to share the experience.\u201dSecret Service agents made it clear to local merchants that anyone using the bills as currency would face prosecution, and the grand experiment ended.Mr. Boggs filed suit to regain possession of his notes \u2014 he had lost more than 1,300 artworks in raids between 1990 and 1992 \u2014 and to win legal recognition of his work as art. In 1993, Federal District Judge Royce Lamberth dismissed the suit.\u201cThis court accepts Mr. Boggs\u2019s belief that money is valued, in part, because of our trust in political institutions,\u201d Judge Lamberth wrote in his ruling. \u201cTo that end, these political institutions should be given the means by which to establish and maintain the value of United States currency.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt is often said that \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words.\u2019 Unfortunately, Mr. Boggs\u2019s works are often worth a thousand dollars.\u201d Further appeals were unavailing.\u201cIt\u2019s all an act of faith,\u201d Mr. Boggs told Mr. Weschler for his New Yorker profile. \u201cNobody knows what a dollar is, what the word means, what holds the thing up, what it stands in for. And that\u2019s what my work is about. Look at these things, I try to say. They\u2019re beautiful. But what the hell are they? What do they do? How do they do it?\u201dOver the years, Mr. Boggs, who leaves no immediate survivors, traded his bills for goods and services, from candy bars to motorcycles, whose worth he estimated at several million dollars.In the mid-1990s, when Worth magazine asked him to design a note using the Treasury Department\u2019s new guidelines, Mr. Boggs produced a $100 bill with the image of Harriet Tubman as a young girl, anticipating by 20 years the announcement that Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson as the new face of the $20 bill. In 2001, he ran off a series of 100,000 plastic Sacagawea dollars, stamped with his own mint marks and paid for with a $5,000 Boggs bill.Speaking to ARTnews after Mr. Boggs\u2019s death, Mr. Weschler said, \u201cHe was just short of being a con man, but no more than anyone in the art world, or for that matter in the world of finance \u2014 which, of course, was his whole point.\u201dAn obituary on Sunday about the artist J.S.G. Boggs misidentified a 2013 Discovery Channel documentary in which he appeared. It is \u201cSecret Life of Money\u201d \u2014 not \u201cMoney Man,\u201d which is a 1992 documentary about Mr. Boggs directed by Philip Haas.Advertisement"}

IBM\u2019s Watson is co-writing pop hits. Uber has begun deploying self-driving taxis on real city streets and, last month, Amazon delivered its first package by drone to a customer in rural England.Add it all up and you quickly realize that Donald Trump\u2019s election isn\u2019t the only thing disrupting society today. The far more profound disruption is happening in the workplace and in the economy at large, as the relentless march of technology has brought us to a point where machines and software are not just outworking us but starting to outthink us in more and more realms.Once scientific methods became enshrined, we used science and reason to navigate our way forward, he added, so much so that \u201cthe French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes crystallized this age of reason in one phrase: \u2018I think, therefore I am.\u2019\u201d Descartes\u2019s point, said Seidman, \u201cwas that it was our ability to \u2018think\u2019 that most distinguished humans from all other animals on earth.\u201dThe technological revolution of the 21st century is as consequential as the scientific revolution, argued Seidman, and it is \u201cforcing us to answer a most profound question \u2014 one we\u2019ve never had to ask before: \u2018What does it mean to be human in the age of intelligent machines?\u2019\u201d\u201cIt will be all the things that the heart can do,\u201d he explained. \u201cHumans can love, they can have compassion, they can dream. While humans can act from fear and anger, and be harmful, at their most elevated, they can inspire and be virtuous. And while machines can reliably interoperate, humans, uniquely, can build deep relationships of trust.\u201dTherefore, Seidman added, our highest self-conception needs to be redefined from \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d to \u201cI care, therefore I am; I hope, therefore I am; I imagine, therefore I am. I am ethical, therefore I am. I have a purpose, therefore I am. I pause and reflect, therefore I am.\u201dWe will still need manual labor, and people will continue working with machines to do extraordinary things. Seidman is simply arguing that the tech revolution will force humans to create more value with hearts and between hearts. I agree. When machines and software control more and more of our lives, people will seek out more human-to-human connections \u2014 all the things you can\u2019t download but have to upload the old-fashioned way, one human to another.Seidman reminded me of a Talmudic adage: \u201cWhat comes from the heart, enters the heart.\u201d Which is why even jobs that still have a large technical component will benefit from more heart. I call these STEMpathy jobs \u2014 jobs that combine STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) skills with human empathy, like the doctor who can extract the best diagnosis from IBM\u2019s Watson on cancer and then best relate it to a patient.Economies get labeled according to the predominant way people create value, pointed out Seidman, also author of the book \u201cHow: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything.\u201d So, the industrial economy, he noted, \u201cwas about hired hands. The knowledge economy was about hired heads. The technology revolution is thrusting us into \u2018the human economy,\u2019 which will be more about creating value with hired hearts \u2014 all the attributes that can\u2019t be programmed into software, like passion, character and collaborative spirit.\u201dIt\u2019s no surprise that the French government began requiring French companies on Jan. 1 to guarantee their employees a \u201cright to disconnect\u201d from technology \u2014 when they are not at work \u2014 trying to combat the \u201calways on\u201d work culture.Leaders, businesses and communities will still leverage technology to gain advantage, but those that put human connection at the center of everything they do \u2014 and how they do it \u2014 will be the enduring winners, insisted Seidman: \u201cMachines can be programmed to do the next thing right. But only humans can do the next right thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pe\u00f1a Nieto Faces Unrest in Mexico as Gas Prices Climb and Trump Ascends", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Amid nationwide marches, highway blockades and looting stemming from widespread outrage over an increase in gas prices, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico went on national television to appeal for understanding.With international oil prices rising and Mexico dependent on gasoline imports, he argued in the speech on Thursday, the government had no alternative but to raise prices at the pump. \u201cHere I ask you,\u201d he said, gesturing at the camera, \u201cwhat would you have done?\u201dIt did not take long for him to get an answer, as social media erupted with suggestions and disgust.Combat corruption and impunity. Eliminate gasoline vouchers for elected officials. Collect more taxes from multinational corporations. Cut the salaries and benefits of high-level government officials. Sell the presidential plane. Reduce the first lady\u2019s wardrobe spending. Resign.It was a tough week for the president, who seems to be trapped in a slow, downward spiral of unpopularity, with two more years left in his term and Mexico reeling from myriad problems including rampant corruption, resurgent homicide rates, a thriving drug trafficking industry, a sluggish economy and a plummeting peso.The few voices of support for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2014 in political circles and among news commentators \u2014 have been drowned out by his detractors, and no more so than in the past week, when discontent over the gas price increase boiled over into protests and looting, setting off clashes with security forces that left several dead around the country.The unrest comes as Mexico braces for the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has threatened to introduce far more restrictive immigration and trade policies, including canceling the North American Free Trade Agreement, increasing deportations and building a wall on the southern border of the United States.Concern in Mexico about Mr. Trump\u2019s planned tack on trade has been so great that he has been able to move the markets on the basis of his Twitter posts.Mexico\u2019s Economy Ministry issued a brief statement in response saying the government \u201crejects any attempt to influence investment decisions by companies based on fear or threats.\u201dBut in general the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration seems to be struggling to figure out how to respond to Mr. Trump. Mexicans have been clamoring for a full-throated, chest-out defense of their country and sovereignty against Mr. Trump\u2019s threats, but many say they have yet to hear it.Confidence in Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto is so low \u2014 approval ratings have sunk below 25 percent \u2014 that he appears to be struggling to sell anything to the public, most recently the gas price increase last week.\u201cSuch a low level of popularity reduces his capacity to gather support or his margin for action to reactivate the economy,\u201d said Ignacio Marv\u00e1n, a political analyst at CIDE, a Mexico City university.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s efforts have been handicapped, analysts say, by a seeming disconnect from the public mood.The government looked unprepared for the violent responses to the price increases, which took effect on New Year\u2019s Day, when most officials were on vacation. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto himself was in the middle of a golfing trip. And as bloody unrest swept across the country, the president kept silent, finally making a public statement on the issue on Wednesday.The administration\u2019s detached response to the upheaval contributed to the impression of a president out of touch with the population, analysts said, and gave a sense of a leadership that is adrift, blindsided by events.The gas price increases of about 20 percent are part of a broad overhaul that ends the state\u2019s monopoly over the energy industry. The government has long controlled and subsidized gasoline prices, but by the end of the year it will allow gas prices to fluctuate according to the market, a move intended to attract foreign investment to compete with the state oil company, Pemex.The government has argued that ending fuel subsidies will help the country avoid spending cuts to social programs, and that the subsidies have disproportionately benefited wealthier Mexicans who own cars. But many fear that higher gasoline prices will increase costs for food and public transportation, hitting the pocketbooks of even the poorest Mexicans.Though Mexico\u2019s opposition parties are now condemning the price increase, most of them voted for it as part of the budget approved in October. But Mexico imports more than half of its gasoline from the United States, and Mr. Trump\u2019s election sent the peso to a historic low, raising the price of imported gasoline in pesos greater than anybody expected.Analysts said the government could have forestalled the fallout by designing measures that would have softened the blow for poorer Mexicans, or by creating subsidies for truck drivers or owners of older vehicles.\u201cThey didn\u2019t think about it,\u201d said Vidal Romero, a political analyst at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cThere is no compensation for citizens.\u201dIgnited by the gas price increase, but fueled by broader discontent with the government and uncertainty about the country\u2019s direction, citizens took to the streets, staging marches throughout the country and blocking key highways.Criminals also used the cover of the protests to break into stores and malls to strip shelves bare of home appliances, electronics, food and toys.By last weekend, hundreds of stores had been looted around the country and more than 1,000 people detained, the authorities said, and at least six people had been killed in clashes between looters and the police.The administration has rejected calls to rescind the price increase, and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party traded accusations with opposition groups about responsibility for fomenting the disorder.With Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s credibility so diminished, it will be impossible for the president to accomplish much before the 2018 presidential election, analysts said. He is not eligible to run again.The contrast with the early days of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidency is remarkable. When he took office four years ago, his sharp political instincts helped push a bold reform agenda through Congress with support from the opposition. The reforms included the opening of the traditionally closed energy sector to foreign investment, an exceptional political accomplishment given the Mexican public\u2019s view of the oil industry as a bedrock of the national patrimony.But now those instincts appear to have been eroded by scandal and mismanagement, and perhaps by an insulation from emotions on the street.\u201cHe has lost his feeling for politics,\u201d Mr. Romero said.The president\u2019s perceived weaknesses and his low approval ratings have opened up space for opposition groups and cast the future of his party\u2019s influence into doubt. Even the Institutional Revolutionary Party\u2019s longstanding dominance in the president\u2019s home state, the populous State of Mexico surrounding Mexico City, has been thrown into question, with the state\u2019s governorship up for grabs this summer.Perhaps the biggest political beneficiary of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s declining popularity has been the populist politician Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City, who is leading in polls of potential candidates for the 2018 presidential contest. With each misstep of the president, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador seems to become even more popular; some political observers refer to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto as Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201ccampaign manager.\u201dThe looting and criminal unrest across the country had subsided by the weekend, but protests continued, with thousands taking to the streets in largely peaceful marches.\u201cWe don\u2019t want this corrupt country any more,\u201d said Alicia Rios, 32, a receptionist who joined thousands of protesters for a march through downtown Mexico City on Saturday. \u201cThe legislators get 10,000 pesos in gasoline vouchers when the people can\u2019t afford to fill up their tanks.\u201dShe added, \u201cIf gasoline goes up, everything goes up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

W. Bush and Barbara Bush being admitted to the hospital this morning. They have not only dedicated their lives to this country.Second thing I want to do is to thank all of you. Some of you have been covering me for a long time. Folks like Christie (ph) and Lynn (ph). Some of you I\u2019ve just gotten to know. We have traveled the world together. We did a few singles, a few doubles together. I\u2019ve offered advice that I thought was pretty sound, like don\u2019t do stupid stuff.(LAUGHTER)And even when you complained about my long answers, I just want you to know that the only reason they were long was because you asked six-part questions.(LAUGHTER)But I have enjoyed working with all of you. That does not, of course, mean that I\u2019ve enjoyed every story that you have filed, but that\u2019s the point of this relationship. You\u2019re not supposed to be (inaudible) fans, you\u2019re supposed to be skeptics, you\u2019re supposed to ask me tough questions. You\u2019re not supposed to be complimentary, but you\u2019re supposed to cast a critical eye on folks who hold enormous power and make sure that we are accountable to the people who sent us here, and you have done that.And you have done it for the most part in ways that I could appreciate for fairness, even if I didn\u2019t always agree with your conclusions. And having you in this building has made this place work better. It keeps us honest, it makes us work harder. You have made us think about how we are doing what we do and whether or not we\u2019re able to deliver on what\u2019s been requested by our constituents. And for example, every time you\u2019ve asked why haven\u2019t you cured Ebola yet or why is there still that hole in the Gulf, it has given me the ability to go back and say, \u201cWill you get this solved before the next press conference?\u201d(LAUGHTER)I spent a lot of time on my \u2014 in my farewell address talking about the state of our democracy. It goes without saying that essential to that is a free press. That is part of how this place, this country, this grand experiment of self-government has to work. It doesn\u2019t work if we don\u2019t have a well-informed citizenry, and you are the conduit through which they receive the information about what\u2019s taking place in the halls of power.So America needs you and our democracy needs you. We need you to establish a baseline of facts and evidence that we can use as a starting point for the kind of reasoned and informed debates that ultimately lead to progress. And so my hope is is that you will continue with the same tenacity that you showed us, to do the hard work of getting to the bottom of stories and getting them right and to push those of us in power to be the best version of ourselves and to push this country to be the best version of itself.I have no doubt that you will do so, I\u2019m looking forward to being an active consumer of your work, rather than always the subject of it. I want to thank you all for your extraordinary service to our democracy.And with that, I will take some questions and I will start with Jeff Mason, whose term is apparently not up.(LAUGHTER)I thought, you know, we\u2019d be going out together, brother, but you\u2019ve got to hang around for a while.And related to that, Julian Assange has now offered to come to the United States. Are you seeking that? And would he be charged or arrested if he came here?It has been my view that given she went to trial; that due process was carried out; that she took responsibility for her crime; that the sentence that she received was very disproportional \u2014 disproportionate relative to what other leakers had received; and that she had served a significant amount of time, that it made sense to commute and not pardon her sentence.And, you know, I feel very comfortable that justice has been served and that a message has still been sent that when it comes to our national security, that wherever possible we need folks who may have legitimate concerns about the actions of government or their superiors or the agencies in which they work, that they try to work through the established channels and avail themselves of the whistleblower protections that have been put in place.I recognize that there\u2019s some folks who think they\u2019re not enough. And, you know, I think all of us when we\u2019re working in big institutions may find ourselves at times at odds with policies that are set. But when it comes to national security, we\u2019re often dealing with people in the field whose lives may be put at risk or, you know, the safety and security and the ability of our military or our intelligence teams or our embassies to function effectively.And that has to be kept in mind. So, with respect to WikiLeaks, I don\u2019t see a contradiction. First of all, I haven\u2019t commented on WikiLeaks generally. The conclusions of the intelligence community with respect to the Russian hacking were not conclusive as to whether WikiLeaks was witting or not in being the conduit through which we heard about the DNC e-mails that were leaked. I don\u2019t pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange\u2019s tweets, so that wasn\u2019t a consideration in this instance. And I\u2019d refer you to the Justice Department for any criminal investigations, indictments, extradition issues that may come up with him.You know, I \u2014 what I can say broadly is that in this new cyber age, we\u2019re going to have to make sure that we continually work to find the right balance of accountability and openness and transparency that is the hallmark of our democracy. But also recognize that there are adversaries and bad actors out there who want to use that same openness in ways that hurt us, whether that\u2019s in trying to commit financial crimes or trying to commit acts of terrorism or folks who want to interfere with our elections.And we\u2019re going to have to continually build the kind of architecture to make sure our \u2014 the best of our democracy is preserved; that our national security and intelligence agencies have the ability to carry out policy without advertising to our adversaries what it is that we\u2019re doing, but do so in a way that still keeps citizens up to speed on what their government is doing on their behalf.But with respect to Chelsea Manning, I looked at the particulars of this case the same way I have the other commutations and pardons that I\u2019ve done. And I felt that in light of all the circumstances, that commuting her sentence was entirely appropriate.Margaret Brennan?The president-elect has said that he would consider lifting sanctions on Russia if they substantially reduced their nuclear stockpile.At the beginning of my term, I did what I could to encourage Russia to be a constructive member of the international community and tried to work with the president and the government of Russia in helping them diversify their economy, improve their economy, use the incredible talents of the Russian people in more constructive ways.I think it\u2019s fair to say that after President Putin came back into the presidency, that an escalating anti-American rhetoric and an approach to global affairs that seem to be premised on the idea that whatever America\u2019s trying to do must be bad for Russians, so we want to try to counter act whatever they do. That returned to an adversarial spirit that I think existed during the Cold War, has made the relationship more difficult.And it was hammered home when Russia went into Crimea and portions of Ukraine. The reason we imposed the sanctions, recall, was not because of nuclear weapons issues, it was because the independence and sovereignty of a country, Ukraine, had been encroached upon by force, by Russia. That wasn\u2019t our judgment, that was the judgment of the entire international community.And, Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory and meddle in Ukrainian affairs and support military surrogates who have violated basic international laws and international norms. What I\u2019ve said to the Russians, is as soon as you stop doing that, the sanctions will be removed. And I think it would probably best serve, not only American interests, but also the interests of preserving international norms if we made sure that we don\u2019t confuse why these sanctions have been imposed with a whole set of other issues.On nuclear issues, in my first term we negotiated the START II Treaty and that has substantially reduced our nuclear stock piles, both Russia and the United States. I was prepared to go further, I told President Putin I was prepared to go further. They have been unwilling to negotiate.If President-elect Trump is able to restart those talks in a serious way, I think there remains a lot of room for our two countries to reduce their our stock piles. And part of the reason we\u2019ve have been successful on our non-proliferation agenda and on our nuclear security agenda, is because we were leading by example. I hope that continues.But I think it\u2019s important just to remember that the reason sanctions have been put in place against Russia, has to do with their actions in Ukraine. And it is important for the United States to stand up for the basic principal that big countries don\u2019t go around and invade and bully smaller countries.I\u2019ve said before, I expect Russia and Ukraine to have a strong relationship. They are historically bound together in all sorts of cultural and social ways, but Ukraine is an independent country and this is a good example of the vital role that America has to continue to play, around the world, in preserving basic norms and values. Whether it\u2019s advocating on behalf of human rights, advocating on behalf of women\u2019s rights, advocating on behalf of freedom of the press.But I can tell you that in every multilateral setting in the United Nations, in the G-20, in the G-7, the United States typically has been on the right side of these issues and it is important for us to continue to be on the right side of these issues because if we, the largest, strongest country and democracy in the world, are not willing to stand up on behalf of these values, then certainly China, Russia and others will not.Kevin Corke.And if I could follow, I wanted to ask you about your conversations with the president-elect previously. And without getting into too much of the personal side of it, I\u2019m just curious, were you able to use that opportunity to convince him to take a fresh look at some of the important ideas that you will leave this office with; maintaining some semblance of the Affordable Care Act, some idea of keeping DREAMers here in the country without fear of deportation? Were you able to use personal stories to try to convince him? And how successful were you?I can\u2019t tell you how convincing I\u2019ve been. I think you\u2019d have to ask him whether I\u2019ve been convincing or not. I have offered my best advice, counsel about certain issues both foreign and domestic. And you know, my working assumption is that having won an election, opposed to a number of my initiatives and certain aspects of my vision for where the country needs to go, it is appropriate for him to go forward with his vision and his values. And I don\u2019t expect that there\u2019s going to be, you know, enormous overlap. It may be that on certain issues, once he comes into office and he looks at the complexities of how to in fact provide healthcare for everybody, something he says he wants to do, or wants to make sure that he is encouraging job creation and wage growth in this country, that may lead him to some of the same conclusions that I arrived at once I got here. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know until he has an actual chance to get sworn in and sit behind that desk. And I think a lot of his views are going to be shaped by his advisers, the people around him, which is why it\u2019s important to pay attention to these confirmation hearings.I can tell you that \u2014 and this is something I have told him \u2014 that this is a job of such magnitude that you can\u2019t do it by yourself. You are enormously reliant on a team. Your Cabinet, your senior White House staff, all the way to fairly junior folks in their 20s and 30s but who are executing on significant responsibilities. And so, how you put a team together to make sure that they\u2019re getting you the best information and they are teeing up the options from which you will ultimately make decisions.And as I indicated in some of my previous remarks, reality has a way of biting back if you\u2019re not paying attention to it.With respect to the inauguration, I\u2019m not going to comment on those issues. All I know is I\u2019m going to be there. So is Michelle. And I have been checking the weather and I\u2019m heartened by the fact that it won\u2019t be as cold as my first inauguration.(LAUGHTER)Because that was cold.Janna Rodriguez (ph)?And what did you mean when you said you would come back? Would you lobby Congress? Maybe explore the political arena again?And if I may ask a second question: Why did you take action on (inaudible) a week ago?I want to do some writing. I want to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much. I want to spend precious time with my girls.So those are my priorities this year. But as I said before, I\u2019m still a citizen. And I think it is important for Democrats or progressive who feel that they came out on the wrong side of this election to be able to distinguish between the normal back-and-forth, ebb-and-blow of policy. Now, are we going to raise taxes or are we going to lower taxes? Are we going to, you know, expand this program or eliminate this program? You know, how \u2014 how concerned are we about air pollution or climate change?Those are all normal parts of the debate. And as I\u2019ve said before, in a democracy sometimes you\u2019re going to win on those issues and sometimes you\u2019re going to lose. I\u2019m confident about the rightness of my positions on a lot of these points, but we\u2019ve got a new president and a Congress that are going to make their same determinations.And there will be a back-and-forth in Congress around those issues. And you guys will report on all that.But there\u2019s a difference between that normal functioning of politics and certain issues or certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake. I put in that category if I saw systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion. I put in that category explicit or functional obstacles to people being able to vote, to exercise their franchise.It doesn\u2019t mean that I would get on the ballot anyway.With respect to wet foot, dry foot, we underwent a monumental shift in our policy towards Cuba. My view was after 50 years of a policy not working, it made sense for us to try to reopen diplomatic relations, to engage a Cuban government, to be honest with them about the strong disagreements we have around, you know, political oppression and treatment of dissenters and freedom of press and freedom of religion, but that to make progress for the Cuban people, our best shot was to suddenly have the Cuban people interacting with Americans and seeing the incredible success of the Cuban-American community and engaging in commerce and business and trade, and that it was through that process of opening up these bilateral relations that you would see over time serious and significant improvement.Given that shift in the relationship, the policy that we had in place with wet foot, dry foot, which treated Cuban immigrants completely different from folks from El Salvador or Guatemala or Nicaragua or any other part of the world, one that made a distinction between whether you got here by land or by foot. You know, that was a carryover of a old way of thinking that didn\u2019t make sense in this day and age, particularly as we\u2019re opening up travel between the two countries.And so, you know, we had very length think consultations with the Department of Homeland Security, we had some tough negotiations with the Cuban government, but arrived at a policy which we both think is both fair and appropriate to the changing nature of the relationship between the two countries.Nadia (inaudible).How worried are you about the U.S. leadership in the Arab world and beyond as (inaudible)? With this ignite (inaudible) protect Israel? And in retrospect, do you think that you should have held Israel more accountable, like President Bush Senior did with (inaudible)? Thank you.In light of all the dangers that have emerged in the region and the understandable fears that Israelis may have about the chaos and rise of groups like ISIL and the deterioration of Syria, in light of all those things, what we at least wanted to do, understanding that the two parties wouldn\u2019t actually arrive at a final status agreement, is to preserve the possibility of the two-state solution because we do not see an alternative to it.And I\u2019ve said this directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu, I\u2019ve said it inside of Israel, I\u2019ve said it to Palestinians as well. I don\u2019t see how this issue gets resolved in a way that maintains Israel as both Jewish and a democracy. Because if you do not have two states, then in some form or fashion you are extending an occupation, functionally you end up having one state in which millions of people are disenfranchised and operate as second class residents.You can\u2019t even call them citizens necessarily. And so - so the goal of the resolution was to simply say that the settlements, the growth of the settlements are creating a reality on the ground that increasingly will make a two-state solution impossible. And we\u2019ve believed consistent with the position that has been taken with previous U.S. administrations for decades now that it was important for us to send a signal, a wakeup call that this moment may be passing.And Israeli voters and Palestinians need to understand that this moment may be passing. And - and hopefully, that then creates a debate inside both Israeli and Palestinian communities that won\u2019t result immediately in peace but at least will lead to a more sober assessment of what the alternatives are. So, the president-elect will have his own policy. The ambassador or the candidate for the ambassadorship obviously has very different views than I do.That is their prerogative, that\u2019s part of what happens after elections, and I think my views are clear. We\u2019ll see how - how their approach plays itself out. I don\u2019t want to - I don\u2019t want to project today what could end up happening but obviously it\u2019s a volatile environment. What we\u2019ve seen in the past is when sudden unilateral moves are made that speak to some of the core issues and sensitivities of either side, that can be explosive.And what we\u2019ve tried to do in the transition is just provide the context in which the president-elect may want to make some of these decisions.But if you\u2019re going to make big shifts in policy, just make sure you\u2019ve thought it through and understand that there are going to be consequences and actions typically create reactions. And so you want to be intentional about it. You don\u2019t want to do things off the cuff when it comes to an issue this - this volatile.How do you think LGBT rights will rank in terms of your accomplishments in your life? And how confident are you that progress will endure or continue under the president-elect?And, that opened people\u2019s minds and opened their hearts. And, eventually, laws caught up. But, I don\u2019t think any of that would have happened without the activism, in some cases loud and noisy, but in some cases just quiet and very personal. And \u2014 and I think that what we did as an administration was to help to \u2014 the society to move in a better direction, but to do so in a way that didn\u2019t create an enormous backlash and was \u2014 was systematic and respectful of the fact, you know, in some cases these issues were controversial.I think the way we handled, for example, don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell, being methodical about it, working with the joint chiefs, making sure we showed this would not have an impact on the effectiveness of the greatest military on Earth. And then to have Defense Secretary Bob Gates and Chairman Mike Mullen and joint chiefs who were open to evidence and ultimately worked with me to do the right thing.I am proud of that, but again, none of that would have happened without this incredible transformation that was happening in society out there. You know, when I gave Ellen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, I meant what I said. I think somebody that kind and likable, projecting into, you know, living rooms around the country. You know, that changed attitudes. And that wasn\u2019t easy to do for her. And that\u2019s just one small example of what was happening in countless communities all across the country.So \u2014 so I\u2019m proud that in certain places we maybe provided a good block down field to help the movement advance. I don\u2019t think it is something that will be reversible because American society has changed, the attitudes of young people, in particular, have changed. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t going to be some fights that are important, legal issues, issues surrounding transgender persons. There\u2019s still going to be some battles that need to take place.(CROSSTALK)Long before today, you\u2019ve been considered a (inaudible) president. Under your watch, people have said that you have expanded the rubber-band of inclusion. And with the election and the incoming administration, people are saying that the rubber-band has recoiled and maybe is even broken.And I\u2019m (inaudible) back to a time on Air Force One going to Selma, Alabama, when you said your job was to (inaudible). With that, what gaps still remain when it comes to rights issues on the table? And also, what part will you play in fixing those gaps after \u2014 in your new life?And lastly, you are the first black president. Do you expect the country to see this again?I \u2014 I think I\u2019ve used this analogy before. We \u2014 we killed it in the Olympics in Brazil. And Michelle and I, we always have our \u2014 the Olympic team here. And it\u2019s a lot of fun, first of all, just because, you know, anytime you\u2019re meeting somebody who\u2019s the best at anything, it\u2019s impressive.And these mostly very young people are all just so healthy looking and they just beam and exude fitness and health. And so we have a great time talking to them. But they are of all shapes, sizes, colors. You know, the genetic diversity that is on display is remarkable.And if you look at Simone Biles, and then you look at a Michael Phelps, they\u2019re completely different. And it\u2019s precisely because of those differences that we\u2019ve got people here who can excel at any sport.And by the way, more than half of our medals came from women. And the reason is is because we had the foresight several decades ago with something called Title IX to make sure that women got opportunities in sports, which is why our women compete better, because they have more opportunities than folks in other countries.So, you know, I use that as a metaphor and if in fact we continue to keep opportunity open to everybody, then yeah, we\u2019re going to have a woman president. We\u2019re going to have a Latino president. And we\u2019ll have a Jewish president, a Hindu president. You know, who knows who we\u2019re going to have.I suspect we\u2019ll have a whole bunch of mixed up presidents at some point that nobody really knows what to call them.(LAUGHTER)And that\u2019s fine.Now, what do I worry about? I \u2014 I obviously spent a lot of time on this, April, at my farewell address on Tuesday. So I won\u2019t go through the whole list.I worry about inequality because I think that if we are not investing in making sure everybody plays a role in this economy, the economy will not grow as fast and I think it will also lead to further and further separation between us as Americans \u2014 not just along racial lines. I mean, there are a whole bunch of folks who voted for the president-elect because they feel forgotten and disenfranchised.They feel as if they\u2019re being looked down on. They feel as if their kids aren\u2019t going to have the same opportunities as they did.And you don\u2019t want to \u2014 you don\u2019t want to have an America in which a very small sliver of people are doing really well, and everybody else is fighting for scraps, as I said last week. Because that\u2019s oftentimes when racial divisions get magnified, because people think, well, the only way I\u2019m going to get ahead is if I make sure somebody else gets less; somebody who doesn\u2019t look like me or doesn\u2019t worship the same place I do.That\u2019s not a good recipe for our democracy. I worry about, as I said in response to a previous question, making sure that the basic machinery of our democracy works better. We are the only country in the advanced world that makes it harder to vote rather than easier. And that dates back. There\u2019s an ugly history to that that we should not be shy about talking about.The reason that we are the only country among advanced democracies that makes it harder to vote is \u2014 it traces directly back to Jim Crow and the legacy of slavery and it became sort of acceptable to restrict the franchise (ph). And that\u2019s not who we are. That shouldn\u2019t be who we are. That\u2019s not when America works best. So I hope that people pay a lot of attention to making sure that everybody has a chance to vote. Make it easier, not harder.This whole notion of election \u2014 voting fraud, this is something that has constantly been disproved, this \u2014 this is fake news. The notion that there are a whole bunch of people out there who are going out there and are not eligible to vote and want to vote. We have the opposite problem. We have a whole bunch of people who are eligible to vote who don\u2019t vote. And so the idea that we put in place a whole bunch of barriers to people voting doesn\u2019t make sense. And then the \u2014 you know, as I said before, political gerrymandering that makes your vote matter less because politicians have decided you live in a district where everybody votes the same way you do so that these aren\u2019t competitive races and we get 90 percent Democratic districts, 90 percent Republican districts, that\u2019s bad for our democracy too. I worry about that.I think it is very important for us to make sure that our criminal justice system is fair and just, but I also think it\u2019s also very important to make sure that it is not politicized, that it maintains an integrity that is outside of partisan politics at every level. I think at some point, we\u2019re going to have to spend \u2014 and this will require some action by the Supreme Court, we have to re- examine just the flood of endless money that goes into our politics, which I think is very unhealthy.So there are a whole bunch of things I worry about there. And as I said in my speech on Tuesday, we\u2019ve got more work to do on race. It is not \u2014 it is simply not true that things have gotten worse. They haven\u2019t. Things are getting better and I have more confidence on racial issues in the next generation than I do in our generation or the previous generation. I think kids are smarter about it. They\u2019re more tolerant. They are more inclusive by instinct than we are, and hopefully, my presidency maybe helped that along a little bit.But you know, we \u2014 when we feel stress, when we feel pressure, when we\u2019re just fed information that encourages some of our worst instincts, we tend to fall back into some of the old racial fears and racial divisions and racial stereotypes, and it\u2019s very hard for us to break out of those and to listen and to think about people as people and to imagine being in that person\u2019s shoes.And by the way, it\u2019s no longer a black and white issue alone. You got Hispanic folks and you got Asian folks, this is not just the same old battles that \u2014 we\u2019ve got this stew that\u2019s bubbling up from people everywhere and we\u2019re going to have to make sure that we in our own lives and our own families and work places do a better job of treating everybody with basic respect and understanding that not everybody starts off in the same situation and imaging what would it be like if you were born in an inner city and had no job prospects anywhere within a 20 mile radius or how does it feel being born in some rural county where there\u2019s no job opportunities within in a 20 mile radius and seeing those two things as connected as opposed to separate.So, you know, we got work to do, but overall, I think on this front, the trend lines, ultimately, I think will be good.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)The first lady put the stakes of the 2016 election in very personal terms, in a speech that resonated across the country. And she really spoke the concerns of a lot women, LGBT, people of color, many others. And \u2014 so I wonder now, how you and the first lady on talking to your daughters about the meaning of this election and how you interpret it for yourself and for them?(LAUGHTER)But man, my daughters are something. And \u2014 and they just surprise and enchant and impress me more and more every single day as they grow up. And, so these days when we talk, we talk as parent to child, but also we learn from them. And, I think it was really interesting to see how Malia and Sasha reacted. They were disappointed.They paid attention to what their mom said during the campaign and believed it because it\u2019s consistent with what we have tried to teach them in our household and what I\u2019ve tried to model as a father with their mom and what we\u2019ve asked them to expect from future boyfriends or spouses. But what we\u2019ve also tried to teach them is resilience and we\u2019ve tried to teach them hope and that the only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world.And so, you get knocked down, you get up, brush yourself off and you get back to work. And that tended to be their attitude. I think neither of them intend to pursue a future of politics and in that, too, I think their mother\u2019s influence shows.(LAUGHTER)But, both of them have grown up in an environment where I think they could not help, but be patriotic to love this country deeply, to see that it\u2019s flawed, but see that they have responsibilities to fix it. And that they need to be active citizens. And they have to be in a position to talk to their friends and their teachers and their future co-workers in ways that try to shed some light as opposed to just generate a lot of sound and fury. And I expect that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do. They do not \u2014 they don\u2019t mope.And \u2014 and what I really am proud of them, but what makes me proudest about them, is that they also don\u2019t get cynical about it. They \u2014 they have not assumed because their side didn\u2019t win or because some of the values that they care about don\u2019t seem as if they were vindicated that automatically America has somehow rejected them or rejected their values. I don\u2019t think they feel that way.I think they have in part through osmosis, in part through dinner time conversations appreciated the fact that this is a big complicated country and democracy is messy, it doesn\u2019t always work exactly the way you might want. It doesn\u2019t guarantee certain outcomes. But if you \u2014 if you\u2019re engaged and you\u2019re involved, then there are a lot more good people than bad in this country and there\u2019s a core decency to this country and \u2014 that they got to be a part of lifting that up. And I expect they will be.And in that sense, they are representative of this generation that makes me really optimistic. I\u2019ve been asked \u2014 I had \u2014 I\u2019ve had some off-the-cuff (ph) conversations with some journalists where they said, \u201cOK, you seem like you\u2019re OK, but really, what are you really thinking?\u201d(LAUGHTER)And I\u2019ve said, \u201cNo, what I\u2019m saying really is what I think.\u201d I \u2014 I believe in this country. I believe in the American people. I believe that people are more good than bad. I believe tragic things happen. I think there\u2019s evil in the world, but I think at the end of the day, if we work hard and if we\u2019re true to those things in us that feel true and feel right, that the world gets a little better each time. That\u2019s what this presidency has tried to be about. And I see that in the young people I\u2019ve worked with. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of them.And so, this is not just a matter of no drama Obama, this is \u2014 this is what I really believe. It is true that behind closed doors, I curse more than I do publicly...(LAUGHTER)... and sometimes I get mad and frustrated like everybody else does, but at my core, I think we\u2019re going to be OK. We just have to fight for it, we have to work for it and not take it for granted and I know that you will help us do that. Thank you very much, Press Corps, good luck.ENDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking for Sales, Watch Brands Extend Warranties", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported bySome watch brands, searching in a down market for ways to attract new buyers and retain the ones they already have, are improving their warranties.After all, what better way to assert confidence in your product?Traditionally, watch warranties are good for two to three years after purchase, covering manufacturer defects affecting the performance of the movement and the watch\u2019s reliability in timekeeping. Normal use and damage caused by the wearer usually are excluded.Rolex, long known for the reliability of its products, has led the way in strengthening warranties. The brand announced in 2015 that all Rolexes purchased through official retailers would be covered for five years, rather than just two. And the warranty is attached to the watch, not the owner, so resales won\u2019t affect the guarantee.A Rolex representative said the extension was intended to demonstrate the brand\u2019s \u201cconfidence in the quality of its products\u201d and its commitment to customers.For other brands, however, changing the fine print is taking a back seat to reshaping the after-sale interaction with clients.HYT announced last year that warranties on all new watches were extended to five years (from three years) and that repairs would be handled through its new Complete Experience department.The idea came to Mr. Dourde when he heard about the experience of a Tesla car owner who had called in for emergency repair.\u201cTesla\u2019s service people made a house call, were able to repair the car on the spot and turned the experience into a brilliant marketing coup for Tesla,\u201d Mr. Dourde said. \u201cWe in the watch industry need to look for new benchmarks on how to deal with clients.\u201dSimilar house calls and invitations to visit the HYT factory in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland, where the brand makes its hydromechanical watches, are now part of a customer\u2019s post-sale benefits.\u201cRecently, we picked up one client\u2019s watch at home,\u201d Mr. Dourde said. \u201cHe wanted to see how repairs would be done, so we invited him to the manufacturer, where he spent a full day and discovered our microfluidic technology at work.\u201d\u201cDropping off a watch for repair can become a hospitality experience,\u201d Mr. Dourde said. \u201cOf course there is a cost to us, but we view it as a marketing expenditure. It is a dimension of our business we are looking to expand strategically, because our clients are our best ambassadors. \u201d\u201cA watch is easier to sell or buy if it has a warranty,\u201d said Charris Yadigaroglou, a representative of MB&F. \u201cThe new warranty was primarily a way for us to support the secondary market for our watches.\u201dThe offer applied to all MB&F timepieces, so even those purchased at auction were included. \u201cA healthy secondary market ultimately helps our brand,\u201d Mr. Yadigaroglou said. \u201cWe do not view auctions as taking away from sales of new watches. We are telling all MB&F watch owners that we stand behind them.\u201dWorking with auction houses, MB&F also provides free repairs. \u201cThese services cost money and tie up manpower, but they are worthwhile because they protect the value of our watches,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are an unconventional brand with an exotic product. We must do a little more.\u201d\u201cTwo years ago, a client was looking to buy one of my watches in auction but had reservations,\u201d Mr. Journe said in an interview. \u201cHe suggested that I buy it in auction and he buy it from me.\u201d Now the company buys and fully restores some limited-edition watches, offering them for resale with statements of provenance, new boxes and three-year warranties.\u201cClients sometimes fear that a watch in auction would be in poor condition,\u201d Mr. Journe said. \u201cBut they would not hesitate to buy the same watch from me with warranty attached.\u201dIt is still unclear how many brands will embrace warranty extensions, but several experts believe such action is part of the industry\u2019s growth.\u201cTimes have changed and we must be more creative with what have generally been negative client experiences,\u201d said Mr. Dourde of HYT. \u201cBeyond the product itself, we must bring modernity into the watchmaking economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Beijing, and Washington, a Breath of Foul Air", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported byWhen friends cautioned me about Beijing\u2019s notorious air pollution recently, ahead of my first visit there, I brushed it off. It was an old story, and having grown up in northern New Jersey in the era of unregulated industrial air pollution and open garbage burning on the Meadowlands, I figured I could handle it. But I began to have second thoughts on the flight in from the north, when we crossed a mountain ridge and the clear air turned instantly to dense smog. It was still 20 minutes to touchdown.After a day or two in the city, I felt as if I had taken up cigarettes. Same burned-out feeling at the back of the throat, with bits of airborne grit catching on the epiglottis. Same clearing of the throat by soft coughing. It got worse over the weekend, when regulations limiting cars on the road don\u2019t apply. Coming back into the city on a Sunday afternoon was like a slow apocalypse. The air was a filthy brownish gray, and pedestrians, many of them wearing white face masks, walked hunched over as if through a rainstorm. Buildings emerged ghostlike from the haze a half-mile ahead and vanished again behind.But I was a novice. It turned out that this was a relatively normal winter day for Beijing, with the air quality index at just 269. That\u2019s rated \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d by the World Health Organization, and many times worse than the maximum safe exposure level, but nowhere near those headline-making, sky-darkening days when the Beijing index has topped 700.Back in New Jersey, the air quality index was generally under 50, and it reminded me how lucky we are to have relatively strong laws and regulations to protect our air. These are the same protections that President Donald J. Trump loudly promised during his campaign to undo on his first day in office. Indeed, the new Republican-dominated House of Representatives this month passed a Regulatory Accountability Act, which will give the new president power to roll back an array of governmental regulations, including 50 years of environmental protections \u2014 with as little public notice as possible. It could undermine even the Clean Air Act of 1972 and for the first time oblige regulators to put corporate profits ahead of public health.In fact, the first five-year phase of the cleanup cost less than $2 billion a year \u2014 and produced benefits of more than $118 billion a year, largely in improved human health and productivity. That\u2019s because scrubbing acid-rain pollutants from smokestacks also removes large quantities of fine particle pollution, which otherwise penetrates deep into people\u2019s lungs. The cleanup reduced the incidence of asthma and other illnesses, improved school and workplace attendance rates, and avoided thousands of premature deaths. What Mr. Trump denounced during a campaign speech to West Virginia coal miners as \u201cthese ridiculous rules and regulations that make it impossible for you to compete\u201d actually kept Americans alive and made the country more competitive.E.P.A. regulations make economic sense for two important reasons industry lobbyists (and their hired politicians) overlook when they stage their sky-is-falling complaints about cost. First, the new rules typically drive advances in technology and efficiency, making cost-effective what formerly seemed impossible. The result isn\u2019t a job exodus; it\u2019s a reshuffling, with productivity falling at coal-fired power plants, for instance, but rising at gas-fired power plants. Second, antipollution regulations move us away from the illogical idea that the unsuspecting public at large should pay the cost of pollution. Instead, that cost gets shifted onto the polluters themselves and into the price of the polluting product, exactly where it belongs.At the airport, a billboard depicted an improbably healthy young woman, ponytail flying in the breeze, eyes smiling over her face mask. A corrugated plastic tube connected the face mask to a portable oxygen machine strapped to her arm, as she jogged through a city choking on its own growth-at-any-cost philosophy.My flight home took me in over northern New Jersey, and glancing out the window, I was startled by how clear the air seemed and how even Newark seemed to glitter in the night. Maybe there were people below willing to risk their health for better jobs, and no doubt there were people yearning for a better economy. But the lesson from China is that wrecking the environment is precisely the wrong way to get there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Health Secretary Pick\u2019s Longtime Foes: Big Government and Insurance Companies", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byROSWELL, Ga. \u2014 It was 1 in the morning, and the orthopedic surgeon on call was preparing to operate on a woman whose foot had been shattered in a car wreck, after hours of tending to other patients. The woman\u2019s husband, Jeff Anderson, asked him, \u201cAre you too tired to do this?\u201d\u201cHe looked me straight in the eye \u2014 very quiet guy \u2014 and said, \u2018I was born to do this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Anderson recalled.The surgeon that night more than 20 years ago was Representative Tom Price of Georgia, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, the cabinet official who will lead the new administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.Since then, the assuredness that defined Mr. Price as a surgeon has carried into his political career. He has always listened politely to other viewpoints but never swerved from his policy mission to protect his former profession from what he views as heavy-handed government intrusion.Many who knew Mr. Price as a doctor here in Atlanta\u2019s affluent northern suburbs praise his commitment to his patients. But his legislative record shows that over eight years in the Georgia Senate and 12 years in Congress, he has advocated at least as much for physician groups and health care companies \u2014 seeking to limit damages in malpractice cases, for instance, and voting against legislation that would have required the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries.Mr. Price has routinely argued that patients are the driving force behind his efforts. Still, his positions have often coincided with the financial interests of groups whose donations have helped advance his political career.Doctors themselves are sharply divided over his nomination, and some are particularly galled by Mr. Price\u2019s enmity for the Affordable Care Act and opposition to abortion rights. Some of his positions even clash with those of Mr. Trump, who wants to pressure pharmaceutical companies on drug prices, for example, and has pledged to largely leave Medicare alone.Last year, Mr. Price bought stock in a company that makes orthopedic implants shortly before introducing legislation that could have protected the company, Zimmer Biomet, from financial losses due to a new federal regulation. The regulation sought to rein in spending on joint replacements for Medicare patients; Mr. Price\u2019s legislation would have delayed its implementation. After he introduced it, Zimmer\u2019s political action committee contributed to his re-election campaign; the string of events was first reported Monday by CNN.Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said Mr. Price \u201chad no knowledge or input into the purchase\u201d of the Zimmer stock, which he said was made by a broker. Asked why Mr. Price had not directed his broker to avoid buying health-related stocks while he wrote and voted on health legislation, Mr. Blando said, \u201cWe know that other members of Congress, including Democrats, have holdings in health care stocks and vote on health-related legislation.\u201dIn a letter to an ethics lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services last week Mr. Price said he would divest himself of holdings in 43 health-related and other stocks to avoid conflicts of interest. Noting that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an \u201cexhaustive review\u201d of Mr. Price\u2019s financial holdings, Mr. Blando said last week that Mr. Price \u201ctakes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously.\u201dAlthough not among the billionaires whom Mr. Trump has tapped for his cabinet, Mr. Price has profited from medicine, both as a doctor and as an active investor in health care-related companies including Aetna, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Zimmer Biomet, which makes artificial joints and other medical devices. He has an estimated net worth of $13.6 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with assets that include real estate. He has also been an effective fund-raiser: Even in his first run for office in 1996, his war chest of $173,000, much of which came from doctors and medical companies, led his poorly financed Democratic opponent to call him \u201cDr. Dollar.\u201dMr. Price, who declined to be interviewed, was engaged in a number of pitched partisan battles even before coming to Washington in 2005. In the Georgia Legislature, he voted against a new state flag that minimized the Confederate battle cross and supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. In Congress, he has taken stances seen as antithetical to public health, opposing regulating tobacco as a drug and favoring legislation that would make it easier to sell bullets that can pierce armor.He has also written a fairly detailed plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act. It would repeal the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and provide tax credits to help with the cost of coverage based on age instead of income, with older people getting higher credits.Mr. Price grew up in Dearborn, Mich., the son and grandson of doctors who heavily influenced his career choice. He has publicly recalled making house calls with his grandfather, who practiced medicine into his 90s. After medical school at the University of Michigan, he moved to Georgia, completing his residency at Emory and setting up practice in Roswell, a relatively affluent, conservative suburb of Atlanta.In the 1990s, his practice, Compass Orthopedics, was among seven in the Atlanta area that merged into a large group that became known as Resurgens Orthopaedics. It became the largest orthopedic practice in Georgia, and now has 100 doctors and 1,000 employees spread over 21 locations.Dr. Steven B. Wertheim, another founding partner of Resurgens, said one goal of the consolidation was to gain bargaining power with insurance companies and to provide M.R.I.s, physical therapy and even certain outpatient operations in-house rather than referring patients to other providers or operating at hospitals. More leverage with insurers often allows doctors to extract higher rates.\u201cHis overall gist was, \u2018Look, if all we did was practice good medicine, we\u2019d be broke by tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Dr. Wertheim said of Mr. Price. \u201cHe understood the need to run a business.\u201dAs a physician, Mr. Price was constantly frustrated by having to seek insurance companies\u2019 approval for his patients to get an expensive diagnostic test or physical therapy \u2014 a common complaint among specialists. Similarly, he resented when federal health regulators intervened in something he and his partners thought they were already doing well, like using electronic medical records.\u201cThose are the things that drove him crazy,\u201d Dr. Wertheim said.His resentment of government intervention in medicine drove Mr. Price to become involved in the Medical Association of Georgia early in his career, and his work there led him to run for office in 1995, when the House seat in his district opened up. But by 2002, as his legislative duties increased, he traded his suburban practice for a job at Grady Memorial Hospital, a vast, chaotic, aging complex, just a few blocks from the State Capitol.For the next two years, Mr. Price was the medical director of Grady\u2019s orthopedic clinic, seeing a vastly different population than the well-off, privately insured patients he was used to. Most of Grady\u2019s patients are poor and black, and many lack any form of insurance. Long waits for care are the norm, and trauma, including gunshot wounds, is a big part of the caseload.\u201cHe called me and asked if there was a position,\u201d said Dr. James R. Roberson, the chairman of the orthopedics department at Emory University School of Medicine, whose residents train at Grady. \u201cHe needed some flexibility \u2014 that was most of his impetus to want to return to Grady, because he was really very interested in pursuing a political career.\u201dDr. Roberson said that Mr. Price played a \u201cunique role\u201d at the clinic, training residents and overseeing patient care but also seeking to address inefficiencies \u2014 long wait times, for example \u2014 and representing the clinic at hospital administrative meetings. Although he saw patients, he did not perform surgery or need to be on call at night \u2014 an unusual arrangement, Dr. Roberson said.In the Legislature, Mr. Price spent his first six years in the powerless minority, although he quickly rose to the position of minority whip.His fortunes changed in 2003, after Sonny Perdue became the first Republican governor since Reconstruction and persuaded enough Democrats to switch parties to put the Senate into Republican hands.As the majority leader, Mr. Price\u2019s intimate knowledge of procedural rules and maneuvers, gleaned from assiduous research, helped advance his party\u2019s agenda.In the state Legislature, he was the leader who delivered bad news, the no-nonsense tactician to some of his Southern-born colleagues\u2019 more backslapping style. His sense of humor, when he used it, was dry. Colleagues often wondered if he slept.\u201cHe\u2019s a machine,\u201d said Russell K. Paul, a Republican who served in the State Senate with Mr. Price.During his two years in the majority, Mr. Price\u2019s top priority was curbing the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance, which he said was forcing hospitals and nursing homes to close and forcing doctors to limit which procedures they performed.\u201cHe was very bright, articulate, and smart enough to be able to see the different sides,\u201d said Tom Bordeaux, a former Democratic state lawmaker and trial lawyer who negotiated with Mr. Price over a package of bills Mr. Price introduced to limit doctors\u2019 liability in malpractice cases. \u201cBut he was just totally unwilling. He was very gracious and he was completely inflexible.\u201dUltimately, Mr. Price failed to persuade even his Republican colleagues to accept a provision that would have capped pain-and-suffering damages for malpractice victims at $250,000.Mr. Paul, now the mayor of Sandy Springs, Ga., said Mr. Price had become more partisan during his last few years in the Legislature, when the Republicans saw an opportunity to tip the balance of power in their favor for the first time since Reconstruction.\u201cThere was not a lot of bipartisan collegiality when it came to trying to control the government in Georgia,\u201d Mr. Paul said, \u201cand that environment was the crucible that began to turn Tom into a hardened political warrior.\u201dMr. Price has also supported proposals to overhaul Medicare \u2014 potentially putting him at odds with his new boss, Mr. Trump, who has pledged not to \u201ctouch\u201d the program. Speaking to a student group at the University of Michigan in 2015, Mr. Price expressed concern that Mr. Trump would not listen to others, including Congress, if elected.Katie Thomas contributed reporting from Chicago, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aravind Adiga\u2019s Novel Is About the Game of Cricket \u2014 and Sexual Awakening", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.After a year that has shattered so much received wisdom on both sides of the Atlantic, perhaps there\u2019s some comfort to be taken in one nailed-down certainty: The chances of cricket ever displacing baseball, basketball or football in the bosom of the American public are close to zero.How different things are in Aravind Adiga\u2019s homeland, India, a nation of cricket obsessives. There, devotion to the sport is an enthusiasm that unites 1.3 billion people, propels its finest exponents to a status of semi-divinity and seems to offer a shot at transformative victory to every slum kid with the physical gifts and stubbornness to master the game. It\u2019s this possibility that powers Adiga\u2019s \u201cSelection Day,\u201d a novel about the bewitching dream of athletic glory.For Mohan Kumar, an impoverished chutney seller from a village in Karnataka who has joined the tide of humanity seeking its fortune in Mumbai, his sons\u2019 cricketing ability is a ticket to salvation. His hope is that the boys will become lucky flotsam in the \u201cfiltration system that sucks in strong wrists, quick reflexes and supple limbs from every part of the city, channels them through school teams, club championships and friendly matches for years and years, and then one sudden morning pours them out into an open field where two or maybe three new players will be picked for the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team.\u201d Beyond this lie the vertiginous heights of sporting superstardom, sponsorship deals and lifelong adulation.Mohan\u2019s sons, Radha Krishna and Manjunath, who are 14 and 13 when the novel opens, are blessed with the balance and coordination to be outstanding sportsmen. Mohan is determined that his boys will win a place on Mumbai\u2019s elite team. Once a year, he renews his blood contract with Kukke Subramanya, the god of cricket, at a temple outside Mangalore. And each day of their young lives, the boys are forced to sacrifice their childhoods in grueling practice, bizarre lessons in personal hygiene, exploitative sponsorship arrangements and a constricting determinism about what their lives must amount to.The boys\u2019 narrow world is peopled with lost and obsessive men who project \u2014 as so many men do \u2014 visions of their own redemption onto the raw potential of young athletes. One such is Tommy Sir, the coach of the Mumbai youth team, who dreams of unearthing a once-in-a-lifetime sporting genius. And there is Anand Mehta, the unsuccessful businessman who buys a share in the boys\u2019 future, raising them up from their squalid slum but entangling them in debt. The boys\u2019 mother has vanished from their lives, leaving them even more vulnerable to their father\u2019s fixation. A lone female presence is Sofia, a schoolmate of Radha Krishna, who expresses a skeptical view about cricket that\u2019s likely to strike a chord with American readers: \u201cNothing that stops for lunch can be called a sport.\u201dThe novel tracks the boys over the years leading up to the selection day of the title. In this, it replicates one of the things that attract fans to sport in the first place: the seemingly simple trajectory, the clear successes and failures, the dates with destiny that blowhard commentators dress up as modern parables of character and courage.\u201cSelection Day\u201d casts a beady eye on these specious myths. It\u2019s one of many commendable things about this book that it both relishes the brothers\u2019 talents and presents them within a bigger picture, revealing the many varieties of corruption and damaging obsession that surround such endeavors. This story, after all, is a universal one. On the scrubby soccer pitches of Cameroon, in the batting cages of the Dominican Republic or in the ice rinks of provincial Russia, sporting success seems like the last, best chance for the world\u2019s also-rans to join the global elite. Where there are big dreams, there are big delusions; where there are fortunes to be made, there are people to be exploited.By having two brothers at the center of the novel, Adiga is able to play variations on his subject. Radha Krishna is picked out early as the golden boy and has an initially uncomplicated relationship with his apparent destiny. Manjunath is a more complex and unusual character, pining for his absent mother, obsessed with the television show \u201cCSI.\u201d Outside the family circle, another perspective is offered by a rich young Muslim cricketing talent named Javed Ansari, whose ambivalence about the game awakens Manjunath\u2019s doubts about his imposed destiny.Adiga invests even his minor characters with pathos and depth. The selfishness that drives the boys\u2019 father is rooted in credible pain. We perceive him as his sons do: part monster, part clown, all bumpkin: \u201cThe boys saw their father use his cellphone as if it were two parts of a walkie-talkie, placing it in front of his mouth when he spoke, and transferring it back to his ear to listen.\u201dThe novel possesses the breadth readers will recall from its Booker Prize-winning predecessor, \u201cThe White Tiger.\u201d One minute we\u2019re among members of Mumbai\u2019s deracinated upper classes, pining for Manhattan, the next we\u2019re present at harvest time in a Karnatakan village, and a single detail \u2014 the absence of rice on the plate \u2014 is enough to persuade us of the scene\u2019s authenticity. The book also vividly captures a present-tense sense of India\u2019s social anxiety as hoopla over the country\u2019s much touted economic opportunities has toppled over into a general desperation, a fear of missing out.Most passionately of all, \u201cSelection Day\u201d is a novel about awakening sexuality. In this, cricket also resembles every other sport: It claims a statistically risible number of openly gay players. (My brief trawl through the internet revealed two.) It seems brave and important to address the subject of homosexuality not only within the sport, but within the context of India\u2019s penal code, which, like cricket, is a legacy of British rule. Adiga writes feelingly about the adolescent confusion over acknowledging one\u2019s sexual orientation and the responses \u2014 condemnation, abuse, patronizing sympathy \u2014 it elicits.This is a novel with broad sweep, accomplished with commendable economy and humor, in a sinewy, compact prose that has the grace and power of a gifted athlete. And it pulses with affection for Mumbai itself; the effortless sociological dissection of that exasperating city recalls Katherine Boo\u2019s \u201cBehind the Beautiful Forevers.\u201d The book\u2019s sporting themes, the salty, eccentric dialogue and the vivid characters who also become perfect archetypes made me think of \u201cThe Natural.\u201d Ultimately, like Malamud\u2019s baseball novel, \u201cSelection Day\u201d transcends sport. This is a book about choice and destiny, smothering family ambition and the pull of a young person\u2019s nascent identity. You\u2019re just going to have to trust me that the cricket is worth it.Marcel Theroux\u2019s most recent novel is \u201cStrange Bodies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: What Is the Real Cost of the Wage Increase?", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Houman Salem ran the numbers on his garment business and reached an inescapable conclusion. He had to leave California.The reason: the rising minimum wage.Other departures would follow, he said by phone. \u201cThe industry will not exist as we know it.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s minimum wage increased to $10.50 an hour this year, up from $10. It is scheduled to rise to $15 by 2022.Supporters argue that higher pay is essential to improving the lives of the working poor.But leaders of low-wage industries say many companies will be forced to fire workers, leave the state or simply close.\u201cYou know that in the entire country: You raise the minimum wage, you will have less employees,\u201d said Ilse Metchek, president of the California Fashion Association.Among economists, the question is contested.David Neumark, an economics professor at U.C. Irvine, said job losses were likely to mount, but in subtler ways than Mr. Salem\u2019s case.A restaurant, for example, would make do with 10 employees instead of 11.\u201cIf 100 restaurants do that, that\u2019s 100 employees.

{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio Scrambles to Curb Homelessness After Years of Not Keeping Pace", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byDuring Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s first year in office, the Department of Homeless Services created 16 new shelters across New York City to house more than a thousand families and hundreds of single adults.The decision to halt shelter openings for much of 2015 was the mayor\u2019s, made after neighborhood complaints about homeless shelters, as Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, was beginning to wrestle with what has become one of the most visible and vexing issues of his mayoralty.He calls it the \u201cNo. 1 frustration\u201d of his first three years in office.\u201cI\u2019m very dissatisfied when it comes to a lot of strategies we put into place to address homelessness that still haven\u2019t gotten us where we want to go,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said last month during an end-of-year news conference. \u201cMy job is to get it right.\u201dBut the growth in New York City\u2019s homelessness has been sharper, and the inadequate shelter capacity has made it all the more apparent. The stop in shelter openings came just as the homeless population was surging in early 2015, and the de Blasio administration was relying on optimistic estimates of how quickly new rental subsidy programs would slow the flow of people needing emergency shelter.The result has been a scramble to address the crisis and recurrent questions about the mayor\u2019s handling of it. Indeed, as he seeks re-election for a second term, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s record on homelessness has become a political vulnerability. Potential opponents from within his own party, including the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, and Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign rival, Christine C. Quinn, have seized on the issue.Outside City Hall on Thursday, elected leaders and advocates for homeless people called on the administration to do more in the short term to help those in shelters, such as making available more public housing units and Section 8 rental vouchers to homeless New Yorkers.The number of people in the 274 shelters operated by the homeless services agency has continued to climb. Last year it topped 60,000 for the first time, even as the city\u2019s economy has grown, with new jobs, a booming real estate sector and record tourism \u2014 successes that were not early priorities of the administration but have since been embraced by Mr. de Blasio.The seeds of the current housing and homelessness crises stretch back many years and cross many layers of government. Federal and state aid have declined significantly. The public housing system, which relied heavily on federal funding, has not expanded along with the city\u2019s population and is straining just to keep its facilities in good repair.And the ending of a state-funded rental assistance program in 2011, called Advantage, was devastating, said Steven Banks, commissioner of the Department of Social Services overseeing homeless services. Without that aid, the city for three years all but stopped trying to provide rent for people who were slipping into homelessness. The result, he said, was a predictable surge in the number of people in shelters.Since the city resumed opening shelters, in August 2015, 13 have been opened, eight of them in 2016. But its failure to keep pace with the demand for shelter beds has had lasting effects. The city has been paying roughly $400,000 per day for hotel rooms, which lack kitchens and have fewer on-site services to help people find permanent housing.Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, who was the deputy mayor overseeing social services early in the de Blasio administration, said the mayor \u201cwanted to be part of the decision-making process for opening shelters.\u201d His predecessors had not usually been involved in such decisions, said Ms. Barrios-Paoli, who led city agencies in the administrations of Michael R. Bloomberg, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Edward I. Koch.A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio said that in his discussions in late 2014 about shelter openings, he was pushing for a \u201ccomprehensive vision\u201d that took account of his long-term affordable housing plan. \u201cAny understanding other than that the mayor asked for a comprehensive vision was a misunderstanding of his directive,\u201d the spokeswoman, Aja Worthy-Davis, said.Mr. Banks said the city was revamping its rental assistance programs and would unveil the changes this year.The current array of rental-assistance programs, aimed at replacing Advantage, are a jumble of acronyms, like LINC (Living in Communities) and SEPS (Special Exit and Prevention Supplement), and have been confusing to desperate applicants and reluctant landlords alike. Most of the planned housing has yet to come online, and some housing experts say that when it does, over the next few years, it will not adequately provide for the poorest New Yorkers.The administration\u2019s optimism is evident not only in its talk but also in its fiscal projections, which one budget watchdog has called unreasonably rosy.In a report last month, the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office found that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s financial plan had continued to underestimate the impact of shelters, finding the cost of homeless services to be $231 million more than his plan had budgeted for the 2018 fiscal year.Advocates leading nonprofits that are pushing for affordable housing for very low-income residents say the biggest miscalculation for the de Blasio administration is in its affordable housing plan.But the agencies in charge of homelessness and housing have long had disparate missions, said Ms. Barrios-Paoli, who resigned as a deputy mayor in August 2015. The city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which oversees the affordable housing plan, \u201cdoes not see its mission as necessarily providing housing for homeless families,\u201d she said.Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said homelessness was a piece of a much broader and equally stubborn problem of rising rents and stagnating wages that threatened to drive out middle-class New Yorkers. In the administration\u2019s internal system for tracking its progress on policy promises, homelessness appears as one element in the broader approach to housing.\u201cYou can\u2019t just say every single unit should be for homeless families, or every single unit should be for fixed incomes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not pitting people against each other. I\u2019m saying these are the choices that as policy makers you have to be cognizant of, and you have to be willing to confront head on.\u201dThrough the end of last year, work had begun on 3,423 new apartments for those making less than $24,500 as part of the mayor\u2019s plan, which calls for a total 16,000 such units at that income level to be either built or preserved as affordable by 2024. The number is far below the need, advocates say.Ms. Glen emphasized that the construction of new housing takes several years, a long-term solution whose effect on homelessness could not yet be evaluated.She said advocates were missing the point that the city had \u201can obligation to build housing for the working low-income moms and dads who are trying every single day to put food on the table for their kids.\u201dMany units being built or preserved as affordable are set aside for households making 60 percent of area median income, or $38,100 for a single person. That represents earnings of more than $18 an hour in a full-time job, or almost twice the current minimum wage.For some, that is still not affordable.\u201cThe units that are being built for poor people are not being built for these poor people,\u201d said Catherine Trapani, executive director of Homeless Services United, a coalition of nonprofit providers.Joshua Goldfein, a staff lawyer at the Legal Aid Society, said the New York City Housing Authority also was not setting aside enough units in public housing for homeless people. \u201cThey should be, for at least this crisis, ramping it up,\u201d he said.City officials said they had already restored set asides that were abandoned in the Bloomberg administration, but noted that the authority also had a lengthy waiting list of people who were not homeless.The Coalition for the Homeless, in a report released on Thursday at the news conference with elected leaders, said that for a decade ending in 2014, 32,000 households were denied placement in public housing or through Section 8 that would have otherwise been received, and more needed to be done to reverse the trend.Renters can call 311 to locate so-called Homebase offices, where they can apply for assistance. In the Bronx, the entrances for a Homebase office and housing court are mere feet from each other, creating a beeline of tenants hoping to stay in their homes.Michelle Isaroon was able to obtain $1,691 from the city to pay off back rent after she used her rent money on repairs, including the removal of lead paint. But she is still locked in a dispute with her landlord over other problems, which had brought her back to court.The city has a gentrification problem, Ms. Isaroon said, and she urged city officials to get tougher on landlords who she says are \u201ctrying to push us out.\u201dLandlords have their own complaints.Some have had to hire additional staff members to wade through rental assistance voucher programs, said Joe Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents city landlords.Mr. Strasburg said mistrust of vouchers began with collapse of the Advantage program in 2011. Landlords were stuck with nonpaying tenants, and they fear that new voucher programs could bring similar problems.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Zimbabwe, a First Lady Exerts Her Power", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byMASVINGO, Zimbabwe \u2014 The first lady of Zimbabwe\u2019s display of power was unspoken, though clear, during the governing party\u2019s annual congress, as she focused her speech on new party regalia featuring a teacup-shaped image of her country.\u201cWe all drink from the teacup,\u201d Grace Mugabe, the first lady, said, explaining that she had designed the regalia herself.Not surprisingly, the next morning in Masvingo, the small town in southern Zimbabwe where the congress of the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, President Robert Mugabe\u2019s party, was held recently, nearly all officials wore clothes adorned with Ms. Mugabe\u2019s teacup design.Ms. Mugabe \u2014 known mostly for her lavish overseas shopping trips until she entered politics just two years ago \u2014 has emerged as one of the main actors in the fierce maneuvering to succeed Mr. Mugabe that has engulfed Zimbabwe in the last year, as the president\u2019s visible decline presages the end of an era.The signs of Ms. Mugabe\u2019s growing stature are unmistakable. On stage at the party congress, she sat closest to her husband, who, a couple of months shy of 93 years old, dozed through most speeches. Party leaders invariably praised her also \u2014 \u201cForward with President Mugabe! Forward with Dr. Amai Grace Mugabe!\u201d \u2014 before others officially higher in the party hierarchy. A choir that usually sings the president\u2019s praises composed a song for the first lady for the first time.1\u201cBe pleased to follow Mrs. Mugabe, a mother who has love, mother of the nation, the one who takes care of orphans,\u201d the Mbare Chimurenga Choir sings in its new song, \u201cFollowing Mother Mugabe.\u201dThough visibly asleep during most of the congress, Mr. Mugabe, the world\u2019s oldest head of state and the only leader Zimbabwe has known since its independence in 1980, was selected as his party\u2019s candidate in the 2018 presidential election. He would be 94 by then and, should he win, 99 by the end of his term.But if she succeeds in grabbing power, it would most likely be a continuation of her husband\u2019s government. Changes critical to reviving Zimbabwe\u2019s crumpled economy, including land reform, are thought politically impossible under Mr. Mugabe and would remain so under Ms. Mugabe, whose legitimacy derives from her husband\u2019s legacy. Her elevation could also intensify tensions in Zimbabwe\u2019s small political class by upsetting Mr. Mugabe\u2019s lieutenants, many of whom have been waiting decades to take over.Confident of their grip on power, the Mugabes flew out of Zimbabwe a few days after the end of the congress in mid-December for their annual extended holiday in Asia, where Mr. Mugabe is thought to have received medical care in Singapore and Malaysia, and where the first family owns real estate in Hong Kong.Ms. Mugabe left for her latest holiday even though she was embroiled in a dispute with a Lebanese diamond dealer over a $1.35 million ring. According to a court document, Ms. Mugabe ordered the diamond from the dealer; issued the payment from a bank in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital; then canceled her purchase after the diamond had already been prepared. Ms. Mugabe demanded that the dealer refund the money to a bank account in Dubai, according to the court document.The dealer, Jamal Ahmed, said he had refused to transfer the money to Dubai because it would be considered money laundering, but agreed to reimburse the first lady in installments, according to an affidavit submitted to the High Court of Zimbabwe. Men associated with Ms. Mugabe and her son from a previous marriage subsequently seized and occupied three of the dealer\u2019s properties in Harare.Wilson Manase, Ms. Mugabe\u2019s lawyer, did not return calls and messages to his cellphone.Ms. Mugabe had picked the diamond as her husband\u2019s 20th wedding anniversary present to her.The president and Ms. Mugabe became involved when she worked as a typist in the president\u2019s secretarial pool. The president\u2019s first wife \u2014 Sally, a much-loved figure in Zimbabwe although she was from Ghana \u2014 was terminally ill at the time and approved of the affair, Mr. Mugabe has said in the past.To some who have long known Mr. Mugabe, the marriage to Grace changed the president\u2019s priorities.\u201cMugabe did change automatically \u2014 it was so dramatic,\u201d said Margaret Dongo, a former ZANU-PF official now in the opposition, adding that Mr. Mugabe had never shown interest in money before his second marriage. \u201cBut Grace knew that it was the time to make money. Whatever she did, she made sure she benefited more out of it.\u201d\u201cWe believe Grace has little or no political influence over her husband,\u201d the officer wrote.Ms. Mugabe formally entered politics in 2014, becoming leader of ZANU-PF\u2019s women\u2019s league. She was awarded a doctorate after only two months at the University of Zimbabwe. Supporters have engaged in the kind of mythmaking that had been reserved for the president, who is often described as walking on water and in other Christlike terms.Namatirai Chivhanga, a top women\u2019s league official, said the first lady\u2019s loving embrace of the country\u2019s orphans was so moving that one couldn\u2019t help crying.\u201cSomehow she\u2019s putting on Pampers and all the children are calling her Mama, Mama,\u201d Ms. Chivhanga, a delegate to the congress, said, adding that she had seen Ms. Mugabe personally change the diapers of many orphans. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201dMs. Mugabe has also systematically secured support by using her wealth or access to state funds.\u201cShe gave us thousands and thousands of chickens in all the provinces,\u201d said Angeline Muchemeyi, the chairwoman of the women\u2019s league in the Mashonaland West Province. \u201cAnd the new cars \u2014 we got Ford Rangers. She\u2019s good, she\u2019s very good to us, that lady.\u201dSupporters of Mr. Mnangagwa said Ms. Mugabe was being used by more experienced politicians to undermine their candidate.\u201cShe\u2019s soft and inexperienced,\u201d said Douglas Mahiya, spokesman of the National Liberation War Veterans Association, which supports Mr. Mnangagwa. \u201cEven if she becomes president, it will be easier for these people to push her aside and take over.\u201dMs. Dongo, the former ZANU-PF official, said the first lady\u2019s political rise was part of the president\u2019s plan to build a family dynasty. \u201cThe kids are too young and don\u2019t have the capacity,\u201d she said.None of the Mugabes\u2019 three children \u2014 the oldest is 28 \u2014 have shown any interest in politics. Mr. Mugabe has spoken of his disappointment in his two sons\u2019 poor academic performance. The older son, Robert Jr., who is studying in Dubai, often posts photos on social media of himself partying with different women.\u201cIt has proved to be rough waters,\u201d he said, \u201cbut she can cope with it. She is a rough swimmer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Pick on Trade Could Put China in a Difficult Spot", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 As a top trade official, he limited the Japanese cars and steel coming into the United States. He halted talks with China on a deal that would encourage investment between the two countries. And he tried to give American exporters an edge with special tax breaks.It is a philosophy that he developed in the 1980s as a deputy United States trade representative and fine-tuned in the decades-long career that followed as the main trade lawyer for the American steel industry. Now he appears ready to train that focus sharply on China.\u201cIt seems clear that the U.S. manufacturing crisis is related to our trade with China,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said in testimony to a congressional commission in 2010.Over the years, Mr. Lighthizer has consistently taken the position that foreign countries are subsidizing their exporters while quietly but systematically blocking imports to protect jobs in their own countries. His answer is to pursue a long list of trade measures limiting America\u2019s imports \u2014 even if those actions may be barely permissible, if at all, under World Trade Organization rules.\u201cTo attack a problem as large as our trade deficit with China, U.S. officials must be prepared, at a minimum, to consider very aggressive positions at the W.T.O.,\u201d he said.We annotated testimony that Robert Lighthizer gave to Congress in 2010 about China, the W.T.O. and trade with the United States.The timing is bad for China.The Chinese economy is slowing despite vast amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus. Big manufacturers in most industries are struggling with overcapacity, pushing them to sell goods overseas at cut-rate, even money-losing prices, just to cover their operating costs. Mr. Lighthizer has argued for years that the United States should keep out goods made with government subsidies or sold below the full cost of making them.\u201cTrump naming him makes me worry the U.S. will carry out more rigid measures on trade and investment,\u201d said Wei Jianguo, a former vice minister of commerce.Exports are important for China. It consistently sells $4 worth of goods to the United States for each $1 of imports. That mismatch has produced a bilateral trade surplus for China equal to about 3 percent of the country\u2019s entire economy, creating tens of millions of jobs.The benefits to China from that surplus have been increasing rapidly in the past few years. Many exporters have stopped importing components and switched to increasingly capable local suppliers for everything from high-quality steel to advanced computer chips. Multinationals have moved entire supply chains to China, and transferred the technology to run them.If Mr. Trump goes even further in that direction, Mr. Lighthizer will bring a long background in such actions.When he was in the Reagan administration, Mr. Lighthizer was the deputy United States trade representative overseeing industrial policy in old-economy industries like cars and steel. Since then, Mr. Lighthizer has mainly been filing anti-subsidy and anti-dumping trade cases against imports on behalf of the American steel industry.\u201cHe\u2019s the best negotiator I\u2019ve ever worked with on policies involving trade or tax policy,\u201d said Timothy Regan, Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s chief of staff in the Reagan administration and now the senior vice president of global government affairs at Corning.Mr. Lighthizer led successful efforts in the 1980s to force Japan to accept curbs on exports of cars and steel to the United States. Both were bold moves, particularly given that President Reagan at times espoused free trade. But when the W.T.O. was created the next decade, member nations agreed, with a few exceptions, to renounce imposing such export limits on other countries.The auto industry could be ripe for action again. China is an enormous exporter of auto parts to the United States. Under President Obama, trade tensions over automotive trade have already risen, and the Obama administration has won two W.T.O. cases. The cases forced China to abandon certain anti-dumping and anti-subsidy taxes on American autos and to dismantle a few, fairly narrow subsidies.\u201cHe was squarely in the trade talks with Japan,\u201d said He Weiwen, a former commerce ministry official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, an influential Beijing research group, \u201cso maybe Donald Trump wants him to do something similar on China.\u201dThe intersection of tax and trade is a specialty of Mr. Lighthizer, who was an architect of a Reagan administration initiative to cut corporate taxes for exporters. He was previously chief of staff at the Senate Finance Committee, overseeing tax policy.In the Reagan administration, he pushed the limits of what is permissible under international trade rules. His plan allowed many American exporters to reduce their taxes by setting up overseas companies to manage their foreign sales. But the W.T.O. eventually torpedoed the effort after a challenge by the European Union in the late 1990s.Republicans now appear to be taking a similar \u2014 albeit more ambitious \u2014 tack. They are exploring how to raise corporate taxes for importers and use the extra revenue to reduce taxes for all other companies.China, as the biggest exporter to the United States, would face a major blow. But it would also affect American retailers, electronics companies and other multinationals that depend on supplies from anywhere overseas.A big obstacle for Republicans is whether the W.T.O. would declare such a tax to be a trade barrier. China and Europe effectively penalize imports by imposing a type of national sales tax, an approach the W.T.O. has approved. It is a steep 17 percent in China.But House Republicans, leery of imposing any new national taxes, want to change existing corporate tax laws instead. W.T.O. rules discourage, although they do not necessarily prohibit, modifying corporate taxes in ways that penalize imports.The W.T.O. review process, though, is lengthy. So Mr. Lighthizer and Congress could well go ahead with the tax plan, lightening the tax burden for American manufacturers as well as inflicting plenty of damage on China and the global supply chain.And the W.T.O.\u2019s response \u2014 if it found the plan invalid \u2014 would not have much heft. Mostly, the global trade group could authorize Beijing to impose trade restrictions on the United States\u2019 much smaller exports to China.That prospect does not scare Mr. Lighthizer very much, as he made clear in his 2010 testimony.\u201cW.T.O. commitments are not religious obligations,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said, and violations \u201care not subject to coercion by some W.T.O. police force.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Strikes a Bold Pose as Vanguard of the Resistance", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In the months since the election of Donald J. Trump, California has turned into a laboratory of resistance \u2014 championing legal, legislative and political strategies to counter Republican policies while pressing the kind of new Democratic policies that presumably will not be coming out of Washington anytime soon.\u201cAn earned-income tax credit,\u201d said Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the Assembly. \u201cHuge infusions for early-childhood education. Those types of things are certainly things that we are interested in doing.\u201dDemocratic members of the California delegation to Congress are lining up to announce they will not attend the inauguration of Mr. Trump. And in Los Angeles, Sheila Kuehl, a member of the powerful county board of supervisors, has started what she has called \u201cOperation Monkey Wrench,\u201d urging people, including state and federal government workers, to systematically disrupt Trump policies that run counter to California laws and policies.\u201cI am encouraging people to engage in any way they can to slow down anything that might come from the federal departments and Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just be dormant when fascism is growing.\u201d\u201cWe will definitely not sit by idly as the Trump administration tries to deport immigrants, throw people off health care, ignore climate change and steal our water,\u201d said Scott Wiener, a former member of the San Francisco board of supervisors who was just elected to the State Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s about playing defense to whatever the administration throws at us \u2014 but also offense in terms of continuing California\u2019s push for progressive social change.\u201dAntonio R. Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles who is running for governor, said threatening to actually secede was the wrong response to what he described as policies that could be devastating for this state.\u201cI hear a lot of talk about Calexit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last time a state tried to leave the union there was a civil war. I think it would be a lot more productive for us just to double down on what we do well.\u201dFor all the talk of defiance, and political considerations are certainly at play in the early war footing taken by leaders in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, there are great risks to assuming this confrontational stance from the outset.For one thing, it could invite retribution from Mr. Trump, who has not seemed inclined to turn the other cheek.For another, California could find itself at the end of the line should Mr. Trump proceed with the extensive infrastructure program he has pledged. It might also find itself in a difficult position in the event of the kind of natural disaster where states need to turn to the federal government for assistance; some Republicans in Congress opposed giving federal aid to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to paint yourself into a corner where you lose your ability to negotiate,\u201d said Ted Gaines, a Republican senator who represents a rural district east of Sacramento. \u201cThey\u2019d be better off offering an olive branch rather than setting down a pathway that may make it difficult to back off.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s premature,\u201d Mr. Gaines said. \u201cIf they want to come out fighting, I think that hurts the relationship in the long term.\u201dBill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former aide to Pete Wilson, a Republican governor, said that he thought Democrats were \u201cplaying to the crowd.\u201d But he described the approach as a short-term strategy with risky long-term implications.\u201cTrump likes to bully. He does not like to be bullied. And he likes to have the last word,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are going to be millions of dollars to be spent across the country on infrastructure. Why would you want to end up on Donald Trump\u2019s blacklist? You could end up on that list anyway. But why pick a fight?\u201dAll of this has unnerved some in the business community.\u201cThis is all based on the president-elect\u2019s campaign messaging,\u201d said Allan Zaremberg, the chief executive of the California Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how that is going to manifest in action.\u201dJimmy Gomez, a Democratic assemblyman running for Congress, said he was not worried about any kind of retribution. \u201cThat would be an overreach for one president to punish one state,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they do political payback not based on policy, but based on whether you are with them or against them, we will use that against them. If California doesn\u2019t do well economically, the country doesn\u2019t do well economically.\u201dThere are parts of this state, however, that showed considerable support for Mr. Trump, and that would applaud efforts, for example, to roll back air pollution regulations.The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District \u2014 which regulates air quality in one of the dirtiest areas of the nation \u2014 is looking to President Trump\u2019s transition team to amend the federal Clean Air Act, said Mark Keppler, a professor of public affairs at the California State University in Fresno, noting one example.And there are limits to what the state can do. Mr. Brown, in a budget he presented last week, projected a $1.6 billion shortfall by next summer, which means it will be difficult for California to promote the kind of spending program lawmakers want to make up for cuts in Washington, particularly on health care. The legal efforts being threatened \u2014 by Mr. Holder for the legislature and by Xavier Becerra, whom Mr. Brown just tapped to be attorney general \u2014 could delay some actions by the Trump White House, but won\u2019t necessarily block them.Still, Democrats overwhelmingly control California, and the thinking about Mr. Trump appears to be uniform: The state is entering rough waters. Mr. Trump could move to cut off funds for so-called sanctuary cities accommodating illegal immigrants, such as San Francisco; sharply cut federal aid that was part of President Obama\u2019s health care program; or use regulatory powers to try to halt this state\u2019s aggressive policies to reduce carbon emissions.\u201cThe impact of anything coming out of Washington is going to be so difficult for California that we are almost thrown into survival mode,\u201d said Ms. Kuehl, who has been in public office since 1994. She said she had urged people \u2014 \u201ceveryone: local and state governments, staff of federal agencies, nonprofits, neighborhood groups\u201d \u2014 to aggressively try to impede any policies pushed by Mr. Trump that undercut California laws or policies.\u201cI said \u2018If you have to lie, cheat and steal, do it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Kuehl said. \u201cTake federal money and just tell them you are going to do whatever they want.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What can we expect from Mr. Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office? And as the months progress and students keep an eye on the news, how many of their predictions will turn out to be accurate?Below, we suggest activities and resources to help students better understand the implications of inaugurating a new president. What will a President Trump mean for domestic policy, foreign policy and the office of the president itself? Students will have a chance to make evidence-based predictions, to voice their opinions and to take action to help create the country and world they want to see._________Warm UpWhat are your hopes and fears for the new president? Why?After, you may want to hold a brief discussion to give students the opportunity to share their ideas with the class.ActivityExplain to students that our hopes and fears are based on our predictions of what we think might happen in the future. They come from our impressions of Mr. Trump, derived from both the statements he has made and the actions he has taken during his campaign and his time as president-elect.The goal of this activity is to help students ground their predictions in fact, as much as that is possible. What has the president-elect said he wants to do? What about his cabinet picks? What is he more likely to accomplish? What will be more difficult?The following articles can also provide context to deepen students\u2019 understanding of the forces that will be at work in Washington:Using Evidence from the TransitionSecretary of State \u2014 Rex W. TillersonThe former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil would oversee a department that has centered on alliance building and globalism, which Mr. Trump has said he would dismantle.Attorney General \u2014 Jeff SessionsThe senator from Alabama supports strict immigration enforcement and measures tough on crime. He would be responsible for carrying out Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d platform and could change how civil rights laws are enforced.Education \u2014 Betsy DeVosThe former chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party and an activist for school choice would oversee a department that Mr. Trump has said he wants to drastically shrink by shifting responsibilities to state and local governments.In her highly partisan hearing, Ms. DeVos was criticized by Democrats for wanting to \u201cprivatize\u201d public education but praised by Republicans for her support of charter schools and vouchers.The Germans are angry. The Chinese are downright furious. Leaders of NATO are nervous, while their counterparts at the European Union are alarmed.Just days before he is sworn into office, President-elect Donald J. Trump has again focused his penchant for unpredictable disruption on the rest of the world. His remarks in a string of discursive and sometimes contradictory interviews have escalated tensions with China while also infuriating allies and institutions critical to America\u2019s traditional leadership of the West.Students can select one or more of the topics above to research further. Then they can make predictions with even more detail and a more thorough understanding of these complex issues.Take Action (As an Extension to the Lesson)Dear Future President,Now that you are president, will you make America great again? Will you secure America? I think that is something you should have asked yourself even before you thought about running. Me personally, I am tired of having a president for four years that doesn\u2019t live up to the changes they were supposed to make. I wish to see different. Can you actually make child care and college affordable? Can you build a good economy for us? America is corrupted, and we need someone who is dependable and determined to make it better again.

{"Headline": "Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Crisis Signals Problems at Korea Inc.", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byBut for many of the company\u2019s critics, the most interesting part of the presentation was what Samsung did not say: How could such a technologically advanced titan \u2014 a symbol of South Korea\u2019s considerable industrial might \u2014 allow the problems to happen to begin with?The answer to that question gets to deep shortfalls that former employees, suppliers and others who watch the company say may have contributed to the incident. Samsung, like South Korea as a whole, fosters a top-down, hidebound culture that stifles innovation and buries festering problems, they say.\u201cThe Korean economy as a whole has reached a kind of limit,\u201d said Park Sang-in, a Seoul National University economics professor who thinks that the cozy relationship between the government and business is stifling innovation in South Korea.Though Samsung did not address its corporate culture directly in its discussion of the Note 7, it apologized and detailed new steps it would take to stop future problems, including naming a board of battery advisers.\u201cTo produce an innovative Galaxy Note 7, we set the goals on battery specifications,\u201d D. J. Koh, Samsung\u2019s mobile chief, said on Monday. \u201cWe now feel a painful responsibility for failing to test and confirm that there were problems in the design and manufacturing of batteries before we put the product out to the market.\u201dDespite the troubled handset, the company said on Tuesday that profit more than doubled in the last three months of 2016, to about $7.93 billion. The increase was driven by chip sales, and gave Samsung the financial firepower to announce a nearly $8 billion share buyback program.Over the past decade Samsung and South Korea have been widely viewed as a model of forward-thinking, technological prowess. In Asia it was viewed as the exception to the sluggish economic growth of nearby Taiwan and Japan, whose once world-beating electronic makers have been in decline.But as with the rest of the country, a shake-up has been slow to come. In recent years the company has run initiatives to push back against what is widely described as a rigid, top-down management system. Samsung engineers and midlevel managers are seldom allowed to second-guess management goals set by top bosses, former employees say.Pressures rose after Mr. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, its chairman, suffered a stroke in 2014 and fell into a coma. One engineer in the United States who works with Samsung suppliers on projects, including the Note 7, said Samsung\u2019s no-questions-asked corporate culture had grown more inflexible in recent years.\u201cIn the Samsung culture, managers constantly feel pressured to prove themselves with short-term achievements,\u201d said Kim Jin-baek, who worked at Samsung until 2010 before becoming a professor at the business school of Chung-Ang University in Seoul. \u201cExecutives fret that they may not be able to meet the goals and lose their jobs, even when they know the goals are excessive.\u201dWith the Note 7, Samsung pushed its business model, as well as its technology, to the limit, according to Samsung officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity while the Note 7 investigation was being completed. Driven by the desire to prove it was more than a fast follower of Apple, Samsung rushed the Note 7 to market ahead of Apple\u2019s iPhone 7. To fend off Chinese competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi, it packed the phone with new features, like waterproof technology and iris-scanning for added security.But battery scientists, including those who spoke at the announcement, said aggressive decisions in designing the batteries made problems more likely. Pushing to make the battery thinner and more powerful, Samsung opted for an exceptionally thin separator in its battery. As the critical component that separates the positive and negative electrodes in a battery, separators can cause fires if they break down or contain flaws.UL, a safety science company contracted by Samsung to investigate the battery, said the thin separator offered poor protection against defects. It also said that the high energy density of the battery could increase the severity of failures when they occurred.Samsung\u2019s insistence on speed and internal pressures to outdo rivals in part signal a breakdown in the ability to truly innovate and push out new ideas, critics say. In place of big new ideas, Samsung focused on maxing out the capability of components like the battery. That philosophy, which worked to keep Samsung on the heels of the likes of Apple, simply is not as effective as Samsung tries to push ahead, they argue.A similar strain can be felt in other parts of South Korea\u2019s economy. Even the symbols held up as signs of the country\u2019s forward thinking, like speedy internet and eye-popping creative mobile apps, come in part from the support of the government. While that has helped create new companies, workers in the tech industry argue that approach also ensures start-ups do not challenge the country\u2019s biggest companies.\u201cThe government is trying to pick the next Steve Jobs,\u201d said Mr. Park, the Seoul National University professor. \u201cYou cannot pick the next Steve Jobs. You need to allow somebody to achieve that.\u201dTim Chae, a venture capital investor in South Korea and partner at 500 Startups, a venture fund, cites another government program called TIPS. The government program is designed to support new companies with funding. Yet with the money come rules, he said, such as funding that can be used to pay only certain types of employees \u2014 engineers are included, but sales personnel are not.While he acknowledged that the government should keep checks on taxpayer money, Mr. Chae said it should lean toward more freedom: \u201cJust give them the money and trust them to use it right.\u201dMr. Chae highlighted other problems. Many of South Korea\u2019s most talented workers are sucked up into companies like Samsung, where they imbibe its corporate culture, making it harder for them to work elsewhere or develop the right mentality to start their own company, he said.That top-down culture that pervades both Samsung and South Korea hints at a deeper question embedded in the accusations about the company\u2019s involvement in the unfolding graft scandal: Would Samsung itself not be better off if South Korean regulators treated it more harshly?In October, at Samsung\u2019s request, the Korea Testing Laboratory investigated a Note 7 that had caught fire. Within a few hours, it issued a report indicating the fire was due to an \u201cexternal shock.\u201dIts chief, Lee Won-bok, now regrets that decision, calling it \u201ctoo hasty.\u201d\u201cThey did the test for Samsung and produced the findings that Samsung wanted,\u201d Woo Won-shik, an opposition lawmaker, said during a parliamentary hearing. \u201cThis Republic of Samsung phenomenon actually hurts its international credibility.\u201dChoe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul and Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018Brexit\u2019 Speech, Theresa May Outlines Clean Break for U.K.", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 \u201cGet on with it.\u201dWith the address, Mrs. May began the jockeying that will lead to a break after more than four decades of tight integration, and define Britain\u2019s relations with its neighbors for decades to come.She confirmed that Britain is determined to regain control of migration from the European Union and rejected the supremacy of the European Court of Justice. That stance is anathema to the European Union, which has made the free movement of people \u2014 as well as goods, capital and services \u2014 a bedrock principle and which relies on the court to arbitrate.\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Mrs. May said, acknowledging the differences. \u201cWhat I am proposing cannot mean remaining in the single market.\u201dShe said that she hoped to complete a final deal with the European Union by March 2019 and that it would be voted on by both houses of Parliament. She was not clear about what would happen if Parliament rejected the deal, though some speculated that a rejection would result in the sort of chaotic, \u201ccliff edge\u201d breakup that she and Britain\u2019s bankers and business leaders hoped to avoid.Mrs. May struck a diplomatic note, including an appeal for a new partnership with Continental Europe, but not at all costs.\u201cWe seek a new and equal partnership \u2014 between an independent, self-governing, global Britain and our friends and allies in the E.U.,\u201d Mrs. May said. \u201cNot partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half in, half out.\u201dAnd she appealed to Britons, especially to those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to unite behind the government and stop refighting the referendum that backed leaving the bloc, which she had opposed.The reaction among her opponents in the \u201cremain\u201d camp was predictably harsh and seemed to herald a long and bruising process.\u201cTheresa May has confirmed Britain is heading for a hard Brexit,\u201d said Tim Farron, the leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats. \u201cShe claimed people voted to leave the single market. They didn\u2019t. She has made the choice to do massive damage to the British economy.\u201dThe speech, which provided some degree of substance, gained a warmer reception in the markets, with the pound seeming to stabilize after several jittery days. It rose as much as 1 percent against the dollar during her speech, while stocks on the London exchange fell.Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobbying group, welcomed the greater clarity provided by Mrs. May but worried that \u201cruling out membership of the single market has reduced options for maintaining a barrier-free trading relationship between the U.K. and the E.U.\u201dKallum Pickering, senior Britain economist at Berenberg Bank in London, was more blunt, writing in an analysis that \u201cas we do not expect the E.U. to compromise its principles, the U.K. is set to face significant economic consequences from Brexit.\u201dFew analysts expect the negotiations to go as smoothly or as quickly as Mrs. May seemed to say in her speech. In recognition of the troubles that may lie ahead, Mark Boleat, the policy chairman for the City of London Corporation, the heart of Britain\u2019s financial services industry, urged Mrs. May to swiftly secure a transition deal that would provide the certainty that businesses crave.Charles Brasted, a partner at Hogan Lovells, an international law firm, cautioned that the deal Mrs. May wanted was likely to be seen by the European Union as \u201cprecisely the cherry picking that they have warned against.\u201d He added: \u201cThe objectives are now clear. The path towards them is uncharted.\u201dBut he warned that \u201cevery one of the aspirations expressed by the U.K. government today will demand exceptional political skill to negotiate and will be complex to implement legally and commercially.\u201dMrs. May\u2019s speech, delivered in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House in London, was the most closely watched statement on European policy since January 2013, when the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, promised to hold a referendum on European Union membership.The prospect that Britain would remain part of the single market has been fading since Mrs. May said in October that she would demand complete control of migration from the European Union and release from the European Court of Justice.The extent to which Mrs. May would be willing to compromise to maintain some access to the single market and to the customs union for goods was less clear. Membership in the customs union limits the ability of member countries to strike individual free-trade deals with non-European nations. So she said she wanted a deal that would allow Britain to trade freely with the world, but still have as much tariff-free trade as possible with European Union countries.While European nations are expected to be stingy with market access, Mr. Pickering says he believes they will eventually bend.In the final deal, he wrote, he still expects Britain and the European Union to agree to a deal in which \u201cthe U.K. maintains a good level of access to the E.U.\u2019s goods markets and limited access to the less-developed services markets.\u201d\u201cCrucially, we expect the U.K. to lose its E.U. financial services passport,\u201d Mr. Pickering wrote, referring to a system that allowed banks based in Britain to offer financial services throughout the bloc. \u201cThis follows from the U.K. raising some modest barriers to migration from the E.U.\u201dMany European Union countries have backed taking a hard line against Britain to send a message to other member states that might consider leaving. Anticipating that, Mrs. May said that Britain wanted a successful European Union and a friendly partnership, but that \u201cno deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about a speech by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain in which she charted the country\u2019s course toward a clean break with the European Union misstated the timing of her call to \u201cget on with it.\u201d It came late in the speech, not early.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin, and James Kanter from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nightclub Massacre in Istanbul Exposes Turkey\u2019s Deepening Fault Lines", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported byISTANBUL \u2014 When a lone gunman murdered dozens of New Year\u2019s revelers early Sunday, he targeted a symbol of a cosmopolitan Istanbul that is increasingly under threat: a dazzling nightclub where people from around the world could party together, free from the mayhem and violence gripping the region.It was there, at the Reina nightclub on the Bosporus \u2014 a hot spot for soap opera stars and professional athletes, Turks and well-heeled tourists \u2014 that those hoping to move past a particularly troubled year died together.With the gunman still on the loose Sunday night and a nationwide manhunt underway, the killings brutally highlighted a dilemma for Turkey\u2019s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan: Even though he has cracked down on opponents and put in place security measures to bring stability to his rattled country, the attacks keep mounting.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d said Zeynep Ozman, whose brother, Ali, was wounded in the attack. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything political, but this can\u2019t be accepted as the new norm. Terrorism is everywhere now, and the government has no control. Something needs to be done. There is no life left in Istanbul.\u201dRelatives of victims of the attack at an Istanbul nightclub mourned on Sunday.The attack on Sunday morning \u2014 a strike on the Western, urbane face of Istanbul \u2014 is likely to further diminish Turkey\u2019s democracy by giving Mr. Erdogan a freer hand to expand his crackdown on opponents, which accelerated after the coup attempt. It is also likely to erode the country\u2019s economy, which has already suffered because of a decline in tourism and foreign investment.\u201cNothing that the government is doing is helping make Turkey more secure,\u201d said Asli Aydintasbas, a prominent Turkish writer and a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe crackdown on domestic dissidents is further destabilizing the country, and when it is not destabilizing, it is increasing the dangerous polarization here.\u201dOn Sunday, Mr. Erdogan vowed in a statement that the fight against terrorists would bring the country together.\u201cThey are working to destroy our country\u2019s morale and create chaos by deliberately targeting our nation\u2019s peace and targeting civilians with these heinous attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will retain our coolheadedness as a nation, standing more closely together, and we will never give ground to such dirty games.\u201dAs it had after other recent attacks, the government imposed a news blackout, saying news outlets should report only official statements.No group claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed at least 39 people, including at least 25 foreigners, according to Turkey\u2019s state news agency. But threats against Turkey from the Islamic State and its supporters have increased, and a senior United States official said on Sunday that the emerging assessment of both the American and Turkish authorities was that the Islamic State was responsible for the attack, or had at least inspired the gunman.Still, the Islamic State, which Turkey is fighting against in Syria, is just one of many threats the country faces.Even before the Arab Spring revolutions six years ago, Turkey sought to set itself apart and shape events around the region with its so-called zero problems with neighbors foreign policy.Now, all that has changed. Turkey, a member of NATO, has been engulfed by the dark and destabilizing forces gripping the Middle East and the surrounding regions, where everything seems to converge: terrorism, the migrant crisis, the rise of authoritarianism.And less than two weeks before Sunday\u2019s attack, an off-duty police officer assassinated the Russian ambassador to Turkey at an art gallery in Ankara, saying he was exacting revenge for Russia\u2019s role in bombing civilians in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. The killing came amid a rapprochement between Turkey and Russia, which had indicated that Mr. Erdogan, instead of continuing to push for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, was now leaning on Russia, Mr. Assad\u2019s most important ally, to bring peace to Syria.The assassination and the deadly nightclub attack have raised questions about how able Turkey\u2019s intelligence forces are to keep the country safe.With such a harrowing year coming to a close, many Turks were eager for New Year\u2019s Eve, as if turning the page on the calendar might signal a fresh start.In Istanbul, where a video on social media before the shooting showed well-dressed partyers at Reina ringing in the new year with sparklers, Champagne and confetti, the gaiety lasted just a little over an hour.Around 1:15 a.m., the gunman, armed with a rapid-fire rifle, killed a police officer guarding the club before going on a shooting rampage. In the ensuing panic, some clubgoers jumped into the Bosporus, which separates Europe from Asia.Ms. Ozman, who visited her wounded brother in the hospital, said: \u201cHe was covered in blood. I barely recognized him at first. He is in complete shock.\u201dA timeline of recent terrorist attacks in Turkey.She said her brother had told her that when the shooting started, he threw himself on the floor and felt things falling on him: bodies, tables, glass. She said he might have been saved by bodies that acted as shields against further shots.The gunman\u2019s identity and motives remain unclear, but one witness said he had heard the man shout \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic.Even with so much uncertain, the attack on Reina, which is perhaps Istanbul\u2019s most famous nightclub, seemed to symbolize one of Turkish society\u2019s deepest divides, between the secular and the pious \u2014 a fissure that has grown deeper under Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist who has expanded religious schooling and sought to restrict alcohol sales.Some on social media were quick to point out the rhetoric against New Year\u2019s celebrations that had come from Islamist corners of Turkey. A recent Friday sermon prepared by the government\u2019s religious authority said that New Year\u2019s revelry belonged to \u201cother cultures and other worlds.\u201dAnother passage of the sermon read, \u201cWe shall not forget that it is never suitable for a believer to forget himself and his aim of creation after a year passes from the stock of life, to exhibit illicit manners and behaviors that don\u2019t comply with our values.\u201dEmre Eytan Can, 34, an investment banker from Istanbul, said he was a regular at Reina, although he was not there on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201cI guess it is a target because it\u2019s full of high-class Turks and foreigners,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a place where people let their hair down and drink, which is not in line with Islam.\u201dBy Sunday afternoon, the by-now familiar rituals of grief that follow terrorist attacks were in full swing, with consulate officials and grieving families converging at an Istanbul morgue, where local officials had set up tea stands outside in the bitter cold.A Lebanese woman, Stephanie Deek, was there with her husband to identify a friend from Lebanon, Haykal Mousallem, a newlywed who had been celebrating the holiday in Istanbul with his wife.The wife was safe, but Mr. Mousallem, who had jumped into the Bosporus to escape the killer, was dead.\u201cI am so sad,\u201d Ms. Deek said. \u201cI cannot describe how I feel. I did not expect to find him here. I thought he was just missing.\u201dReporting was contributed by an employee of The New York Times from Istanbul; an employee of The New York Times from Nevsehir Province, Turkey; Sewell Chan from London; and Eric Schmitt from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Confirms Deal to Close Indian Point Nuclear Plant", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe Indian Point nuclear power plant north of New York City has been supplying low-cost electricity to the metropolitan area for more than 50 years. But to hear Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo tell it, New Yorkers will hardly miss Indian Point.Mr. Cuomo announced on Monday that the state had reached an agreement with the plant\u2019s operator, Entergy, to shut it down by April 2021. He minimized the effects the closure would have on the power grid, electric bills, workers and the regional economy.In his State of the State address in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo characterized the deal as a hard bargain he had driven to rid the region of a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d less than 30 miles from Midtown. He said the state would bear no costs in the shutdown or decommissioning of the plant\u2019s two operating nuclear reactors.\u201cI have personally been trying to close it down for 15 years,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. He added that the proposed closing \u201celiminates a major risk, provides welcome relief, and New Yorkers can sleep a little better.\u201dAn Entergy executive said the company had financial motives in making the decision. Still, other company executives and energy experts were left wondering how the state would replace the plant\u2019s capacity of 2,000 megawatts, or about one-fourth of the power consumed by New York City and Westchester County. The state will have to do that while trying to meet Mr. Cuomo\u2019s goal of having renewable energy account for half of the electricity delivered by utilities in New York by 2030.\u201cThere is currently not enough carbon-free energy in the pipeline to replace Indian Point,\u201d said Robert Freudenberg, the director of energy and environmental programs for the Regional Plan Association. \u201cWe feel that now the most urgent priority is that the state take all the steps necessary to ramp up the state\u2019s renewable energy supply.\u201dMr. Cuomo said the state would invest in wind farms and other renewable energy sources and add transmission lines to carry hydropower from Quebec.Bill Mohl, the president of Entergy Wholesale Commodities, said \u201cthere\u2019s a practical challenge there of replacing\u201d the power generated by Indian Point. But he said Entergy had agreed to close the plant in four years because the growing supply of less expensive natural gas had made nuclear power less profitable.Mr. Mohl said the company had spent $200 million over the past decade battling New York State over the renewal of licenses to operate the reactors. The state\u2019s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, and Riverkeeper, a nonprofit environmental group, joined the governor\u2019s office in challenging the renewals and permits that Entergy needed to keep the Indian Point running.In his speech, Mr. Cuomo thanked Mr. Schneiderman for his office\u2019s efforts in negotiating the settlement with Entergy. The agreement involves the withdrawal of the state\u2019s challenges and is expected to clear the way for Entergy to renew the licenses with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Mr. Mohl said Entergy intended to shut one of the reactors by April 2020 and the other by April 2021. (A third reactor at Indian Point, the first to operate there, was shut down in 1974.) But he said the company planned to seek renewals of the licenses until 2024 and 2025 in case the operator of the state\u2019s power grid determined that the plant must keep running longer to ensure reliability.Mr. Mohl disputed any suggestion that Entergy had been pressured into agreeing to the shutdown, repeatedly asserting in an interview that the decision was made for economic reasons.\u201cWe certainly respect the governor,\u201d he said later at a news conference. \u201cHe\u2019s entitled to say what he wants to say. We know what the facts are, and the facts are we made this decision based on the economics of the plant.\u201dEntergy, which is based in New Orleans, has been withdrawing from nuclear power generation in the North and focusing on its regulated utility business in the South. Mr. Mohl said the company would provide incentives to the workers at Indian Point to stay on through the shutdown. The company will offer displaced workers the chance to relocate to one of the company\u2019s other facilities.State officials said the impact on ratepayers would be negligible, adding that the governor\u2019s office had estimated that, at most, the proposed shutdown would add $3 a month to electric bills in the New York City area. Utility customers in the city already pay rates that are higher than anywhere in the United States, except Hawaii.James T. Slevin, the president of Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America, which represents about 350 workers at Indian Point, said: \u201cIndian Point provides clean, affordable energy in abundance, which helps stabilize rates for ratepayers. New Yorkers are going to get hit hard in their pocketbooks when this shakes out.\u201dLocal and county officials in Westchester complained that they had been excluded from the discussions between the state and Entergy and said that they had expressed concerns about the potential loss of jobs and tax revenue in their communities. The plant employs nearly 1,000 full-time workers; about 550 are union members.A state official who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the issue said there would be time to adjust to those losses. He said Entergy estimated that its work force would shrink by about 20 percent, or about 200 jobs, in 2021 and again in 2022. After the shutdowns, about 190 workers would stay on for the decommissioning process, he said.Decommissioning, which can take decades, involves dismantling reactors and removing the used fuel from them. That fuel is stored in casks until it can be safely removed from the site. The fuel from the reactor that was shut down in 1974 has been stored at Indian Point since the mid-1970s.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Basic Economy\u2019 Airline Service Squeezing Business Travelers", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byItinerariesAs more airlines embrace \u201cbasic economy,\u201d many business travelers are feeling the pinch.Bevan Lindsey doesn\u2019t mind trying to save his company money when he flies for work. But lately he has been getting squeezed \u2014 literally.Mr. Lindsey, an industrial salesman who is more than six feet tall, says he already pays out of his own pocket to get a seat with a little more legroom, at an average of $50 per flight. He worries that he soon might have to start self-subsidizing even more of his business travel, as airlines continue to add fees to even the most basic features of economy class while his employer wants him to find the lowest fares available.Like many other work travelers whose bosses will not spring for business-class tickets, or even economy-plus fares, Mr. Lindsey is caught between corporate travel managers who want to save money and airlines that want to wring every last dollar from the least expensive seats on the plane.\u201cThe company is definitely trying to move toward the cheapest option, and if not, you have to get approval,\u201d Mr. Lindsey said of his employer.The bind for business travelers like Mr. Lindsey may seem an unintended consequence of the airline industry\u2019s race to the bottom in economy class. But travel consultants say it is partly a deliberate strategy by airlines, which are trying to nudge \u2014 or maybe shove \u2014 more passengers into paying business-class or economy-plus fares.\u201cThe basic economy fares have the added restrictions, which the airlines have created to make them deliberately unattractive to business travelers,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a founder of Atmosphere Research Group, an airline industry consulting firm.For Mr. Lindsey, the choice is either pressing his knees into the seat in front of him or spending his own money to secure bulkhead or similarly roomier seats.\u201cThey\u2019ve taken every single thing and just nickel-and-dimed consumers,\u201d he said of the airlines. \u201cThey have done some upgrades as far as entertainment, but I\u2019d rather pay for that and not get squished.\u201dThe mainstream airlines, aiming to compete with low-fare carriers like Spirit and Frontier, have adopted \u201cbasic economy\u201d fares that strip out options like choosing seats and using the overhead bins.United Airlines said in November that it would begin selling basic economy fares in the first quarter, starting with flights for the second quarter of the year. Initially, the airline announced last week, travelers will be able to buy basic economy tickets on routes between United\u2019s seven domestic hubs and Minneapolis.The trade-off for passengers with those bare-bones tickets will include having no choice in seat assignment, being last to board and not being allowed to stow a carry-on bag in the overhead bins, although the airline won\u2019t impose these last two restrictions on some loyalty program members or holders of some United-affiliated credit cards. (Passengers will be able to check their carry-on bags for a fee, and an airline spokesman said passengers would be alerted at check-in about the carry-on regulations. Passengers will still be able to bring a personal item like a handbag that fits under the seat in front of them.)These ticket holders also will not earn frequent-flier miles that count toward their totals for premier status. Nor will they be eligible for free or even paid upgrades. And they will not be able to rebook or otherwise change flights.American Airlines also announced last week that it would start selling its own version of basic economy fares in 10 domestic markets next month. The terms are similar to United\u2019s, with some of the more onerous restrictions \u2014 such as not being allowed to use the overhead bins and having to board last \u2014 waived for elite loyalty members and holders of some airline-affiliated credit cards.Delta Air Lines was the first legacy carrier in the United States to adopt a basic economy fare, in 2012, and it has revised it slightly since then. As with United\u2019s and American\u2019s planned ticket tier, Delta\u2019s basic economy option prohibits ticket changes, seat selection and upgrades, although Delta travelers can still use the overhead bins and earn frequent-flier miles that count toward their status requirements.Peter Ooi, an information technology engineer who travels regularly for work, said that his employer\u2019s policy required him to book tickets within $50 of the lowest fare available. He is unhappy about the prospect of not being able to use overhead bins or accrue as many \u2014 or any \u2014 frequent-flier miles.\u201cAs a business traveler, that\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Mr. Ooi said.Those in the business of corporate travel say they have been scrambling to address the changing fare restrictions and the complications they can pose in booking.\u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a surprise to a lot of travel managers in terms of: What does this entail, what does this include?\u201d said Jeremy Quek, the air practice line lead of the Global Business Consulting division of American Express Global Business Travel.\u201cAs we look forward into 2017, as both United and American are looking to introduce theirs, it\u2019s very important to remember that not all basic economy fares are going to be the same,\u201d he said.While travel managers can, and often do, choose not to include low-fare carriers like Spirit in their booking engines \u2014 because of contractual relationships with full-service carriers, for instance \u2014 that is not an option when the cut-rate tickets are being offered by full-service airlines.\u201cIt\u2019s going to become more difficult for companies,\u201d said Bob Neveu, the chief executive of Certify, a provider of travel and expense-management software. \u201cIf it\u2019s really important to them, they\u2019re going to have to put the fare class categories into the search parameters.\u201dSome travel professionals see merit in enabling employees to view all fare options. A traveler taking a one-day trip, for instance, might not need to tote more than a laptop bag.\u201cWe try to include all fares whenever possible; we want people to see all the fares that can be booked,\u201d said Eric Bailey, the director of global travel and payments at Microsoft.In Microsoft\u2019s case, employees are not required to base their bookings on price alone. \u201cWe\u2019re really looking for people to fly based on value,\u201d Mr. Bailey said. \u201cWe leave that up to the traveler\u2019s judgment.\u201dMany travel managers also know that there can be false economy in insisting on basic economy tickets.Rock-bottom fares have additional, indirect costs \u2014 especially if they do not contribute toward travelers\u2019 attaining frequent-flier status, said Greeley Koch, the executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives.\u201cI think the better travel programs out there realize it\u2019s in their best interest to have travelers be able to earn status,\u201d Mr. Koch said, noting that travelers with status often get fees waived for perks like checked bags, and that they are more likely to be eligible for the upgrades that let them sleep or be more productive in-flight.And if a basic economy fare means that a flight cannot be changed or rebooked, the employee might end up with a worthless ticket.If the employee with the nonrefundable ticket misses the flight \u2014 maybe because a client meeting ran late \u2014 there may be no choice but to pay the last-minute, walk-up fare price.\u201cThe risk of nonrefundability is a very big piece here,\u201d said Mr. Quek of American Express. \u201cThose fares are basically use-it-or-lose-it fares.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Heir Faces Arrest on Charges of Bribing South Korea\u2019s President", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The sprawling investigation into President Park Geun-hye of South Korea took a dramatic turn on Monday with word that prosecutors were seeking the arrest of the de facto head of Samsung, one of the world\u2019s largest conglomerates, on charges that he bribed the president and her secretive confidante.Mr. Lee is accused of instructing Samsung subsidiaries to make payments totaling 43 billion won ($36 million) to the family of Ms. Park\u2019s confidante, Choi Soon-sil, and to two foundations that Ms. Choi controlled, in exchange for help from Ms. Park in facilitating a father-to-son transfer of ownership control of Samsung.The special prosecutor, Park Young-soo, said that the money represented bribes from Samsung, and that Mr. Lee embezzled some of the money from his companies. Mr. Park said he had asked a Seoul court to issue an arrest warrant for Mr. Lee; it usually takes a few days for a court to decide whether to grant such a warrant.\u201cWe have enough evidence to establish President Park and Choi Soon-sil as co-conspirators sharing profits\u201d in the bribery scheme, Lee Kyu-chul, a spokesman of the special prosecutor, said during a news briefing on Monday.If Mr. Lee is arrested, it will be a milestone in South Korea\u2019s efforts to fight corruption involving the country\u2019s powerful family-controlled conglomerates, known as chaebol. It could also disrupt Mr. Lee\u2019s efforts to inherit management control of Samsung, whose tentacles in consumer electronics, shipbuilding and a range of other industries reach throughout South Korea\u2019s economy.Although Samsung has often been investigated on corruption allegations, neither Mr. Lee nor his father has spent time in jail. The elder Mr. Lee was convicted of bribery in 1996, and of tax evasion and breach of trust in 2009, but in each case, he was not arrested, and his prison terms were suspended. Each time, his criminal record was later erased in presidential pardons, and he soon returned to Samsung\u2019s leadership.The South Korean government and the judiciary have been similarly lenient toward other business tycoons convicted of white-collar crimes, deepening public mistrust of the justice system and raising doubts among foreign investors who want tighter corporate governance in South Korea.Corruption scandals in the chaebol often stem from maneuvers to transfer wealth control from one generation of the dominant family to the next, and the trouble at Samsung is no exception.The special prosecutor said that Mr. Moon acted on behalf of Ms. Park.The national pension fund\u2019s support was crucial for the merger, which analysts said helped Mr. Lee inherit control of Samsung from his father. Elliott Management, an American activist hedge fund, and other investors in Samsung had campaigned to block the merger, saying that it wronged minority shareholders by grossly undervaluing the shares of one of the two Samsung companies, Samsung C&T.Samsung issued a statement on Monday denying that it paid bribes or made \u201cimproper requests related to the merger of Samsung affiliates or the leadership transition.\u201dAllegations that Ms. Park helped Ms. Choi extort millions in bribes from Samsung and other companies are at the heart of the corruption scandal that led to the impeachment vote. Ms. Park\u2019s powers have been suspended while the Constitutional Court decides whether to end her presidency.Mr. Lee testified at a National Assembly hearing last month that he was not involved in the decision by Samsung to make the payments. He also said that they were not voluntary donations, suggesting that the company was a victim of extortion, not a participant in bribery.But the special prosecutor\u2019s team accused Mr. Lee on Monday of perjuring himself during the parliamentary hearing. The prosecutors said they had evidence that Mr. Lee personally ordered the payments after receiving a request from Ms. Park.Some conservative South Koreans, as well as some pro-business newspaper editorials, have warned that an arrest of Mr. Lee could hurt the national economy by disrupting Samsung\u2019s management. Lee Kyu-chul, the special prosecutor\u2019s spokesman, responded, \u201cWe determined that establishing justice is far more important.\u201dDespite the case\u2019s high profile, its impact on Samsung\u2019s day-to-day operations will probably be subdued at first, according to analysts. Samsung Electronics, which makes microchips, screens and smartphones, is run by professional managers who are used to operating on their own without Mr. Lee\u2019s direct involvement.Still, Mark Newman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, a research and brokerage firm, said that Mr. Lee\u2019s legal issues could ultimately slow down larger strategic decisions at Samsung.\u201cBig things, like restructuring or a new big multibillion-dollar investment, things like that might be tricky for him to get to,\u201d he said.He likened the company\u2019s clout to that of large, organized special interests in Washington.\u201cIn the U.S., there are a lot of powerful lobbies, like the gun lobby, but in Korea the equivalent is the Samsung lobby or the Hyundai lobby,\u201d Mr. Newman said. \u201cThey\u2019re very powerful, but they\u2019re being found out.\u201dPaul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Cites Israel\u2019s \u2018Wall\u2019 as Model. The Analogy Is Iffy.", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 President Trump has invoked Israel\u2019s \u201cwall\u201d as a model for the barrier he has vowed to build along the United States\u2019 border with Mexico. His wall, he says, will keep out illegal immigrants who bring drugs and crime into America.It is not immediately clear which \u201cwall\u201d Mr. Trump was referring to. Israel has built fences along its borders with Egypt; along its northern border with Lebanon; and along its boundary with the Gaza Strip.But Israel\u2019s best-known barrier is the one built along and inside the West Bank after a surge of terrorist attacks. It was intended to regulate Palestinian movement into Israel.That barrier \u2014 a system of fences and some sections of concrete wall \u2014 was constructed under very different circumstances, and with different goals, than Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, raising questions about whether the president\u2019s analogy between the United States and Israel is sound.Israel began constructing this system of fences and concrete walls in 2002, at the height of the second Palestinian uprising when suicide bombers were detonating themselves in cafes and buses in Israeli cities.Ariel Sharon, then Israel\u2019s prime minister, was reluctant to put down any marker that could be interpreted as a future border between Israel and the territories it won in the 1967 war, but which are claimed by the Palestinians for an independent state. After the particularly bloody month of March 2002, in which 130 Israelis were killed, the Israeli military re-entered the major Palestinian cities of the West Bank, which it had evacuated under the peace accords of the 1990s. At the same time, Mr. Sharon gave in to mounting popular pressure and experts, who viewed a barrier as a security imperative.As planning of the route got underway, however, it became increasingly political. Israel made great efforts to loop the barrier around settlements and strategic areas of the West Bank that it wished to keep on its side under any future peace deal. Most of the barrier ended up east of the pre-1967 line, inside West Bank territory, prompting international criticism and creating humanitarian problems for thousands of Palestinians trapped in enclaves between the barrier and Israel proper.Some areas proved so problematic, legally or politically, that after years of construction, the barrier was never entirely completed.To emphasize the stated security purpose of the barrier, some Israeli officials refer to it as an \u201cantiterror obstacle.\u201d Palestinians routinely refer to it as a \u201cracist separation\u201d or \u201capartheid\u201d wall.Since March 2002, there has been a sharp decline in the number and scope of terrorist attacks by West Bank Palestinians in Israel. Security officials say that the barrier has undoubtedly helped, but that there are several other important factors.As the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, waned around 2004, Hamas, the militant group that now controls Gaza, put a moratorium on suicide bombings. Furthermore, the Israeli military still operates on the other side of the West Bank barrier, carrying out nightly raids in Palestinian towns, villages and refugee camps to arrest people suspected of being militants. Israel also benefits from continuing security cooperation with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which has an interest in suppressing Hamas and other militants in the West Bank and preventing attacks against Israel.The barrier was never meant to stop all Palestinian movement into Israel. Palestinian laborers apply for permits and more than 50,000 people legally cross daily through a series of checkpoints that puncture the winding 400-mile route of the barrier.Israel has been lax in clamping down on illegal workers, usually just sending them back if they are caught. Unemployment in the Palestinian territories is high and wages are low relative to earnings in Israel, and the Israeli military argues that the economic well-being of Palestinians contributes to stability and security. In Israel, the illegal workers are generally accepted as part of the economy. Few Palestinians are looking to immigrate, since home is typically no more than a few hours\u2019 drive away.About 60,000 Africans, mainly from Sudan and Eritrea, surreptitiously crossed from Egypt into Israel from 2005 to 2012. The fence has proved effective. After about 200 asylum seekers were smuggled from Egypt in 2015, some sections of the fence were made higher. In 2016, only about a dozen were reported to have crossed.Israel also built a security fence along its border with the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian coastal territory from which Israel withdrew all its forces and settlers in 2005. Some Palestinians manage to cross it, often looking for work in Israel, but the border is intensively monitored and patrolled by the Israeli military, and many of them are caught.The fence has hardly solved Israel\u2019s problems with Gaza. Hamas has developed rockets and tunnels to bypass the barrier, and Israel has fought three wars there in the past decade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Israel, Energy Boom Could Make Friends Out of Enemies", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byABOARD THE ATWOOD ADVANTAGE \u2014 In the ship\u2019s control room, facing four video screens, a driller from Mississippi in dark shades and a black baseball cap with a skull on it held what could be the future of Israel in his hands.If all goes according to plan, Israel will not only become largely energy-independent, it will also supply neighbors that will have new reason to be friends.But optimists see cause for confidence as once-stalled drilling in the Mediterranean resumes, additional tenders are issued and new customers sign up \u2014 or at least talk about it. The government in Jerusalem envisions building pipelines that could transport Israeli gas as far away as Europe.\u201cSuddenly we are an energy player,\u201d Yuval Steinitz, the energy minister, said as he toured the Atwood Advantage a few weeks ago.\u201cWe were in a very negative course with the Turks,\u201d Mr. Steinitz said. \u201cTwo or three years ago, some in Israel even thought we might have armed conflict. Now we have opened relations with one of the strongest countries in the Middle East. So we already see diplomatic benefits.\u201d\u201cWe are in the middle of a revolution,\u201d said Nati Birenboim, an owner of the Tamuz Group consulting firm advising one company in the current tender. \u201cIf we were talking 10 years ago, 15 years ago, and I said Israel would find a big amount of energy and be almost totally independent when it comes to energy, you would think that I am crazy. We were the country of milk and honey but when it came to oil, we left it to our neighbors.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we can compete with Gazprom,\u201d he said, referring to the Russian energy giant. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Turkish government is waiting for us with open arms.\u201dBeyond the geopolitics are market complications. With natural gas resources more abundant globally and prices falling, Israel may find it difficult to attract the international investment it seeks to take its fledgling energy sector to the next level.\u201cInvestors are not beating down the doors of any country as they did in the last decade, and they have to be competitive to attract investment because companies are going to be very selective in this new world of lower prices and oversupply,\u201d said Daniel H. Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit, an energy consulting firm in Washington.Israeli gas now produces more than half of the country\u2019s electricity and has bolstered its economy. Leo Leiderman, the chief economic adviser for Bank Hapoalim, estimated that along with the broader decline in energy prices, the influx of natural gas translated to an additional 2 percent of gross domestic product. And that is with only a part of the reserves currently being tapped.Leviathan, which is more than twice the size of Tamar, has yet to be developed. Exploration stalled because of disputes over how the government should regulate the potential boom. Critics like Shelly Yachimovich, a Labor leader in Parliament, complained that corporate \u201cpigs\u201d would profit off resources that belonged to the Israeli people. The Noble partnership resisted what it called changing the rules after it took the risks and invested considerable money in the project.A government committee led by Eytan Sheshinski, an economics professor, put forward a new scheme to tax profits after exploration and development costs were recovered. But even after that was resolved, antitrust authorities determined that the companies represented a cartel.Still, some western industry representatives harbor doubt. \u201cThe Netanyahu government has made courageous efforts to restore regulatory certainty and attract high-quality entrants to offshore Israel,\u201d said Jonathan Baron, an American consultant who has advised energy companies, including, at one point, Noble. \u201cYet the reputational damage as a result of the Sheshinski commission remains a serious problem.\u201dThe Atwood Advantage arrived in the eastern Mediterranean in October fresh from the Gulf of Mexico to drill the first new well in years. \u201cWe\u2019re the only ship doing this now in Israeli waters,\u201d said Myles Barrett, Noble\u2019s drilling engineering manager for the eastern Mediterranean, who relocated to Tel Aviv from Texas.The 781-foot-long ship is a floating construction platform guided by the latest technology. Satellites and computers keep it within inches of where the crew intends it to be so the drill it sends deep into the sea remains steady. On a calm day, the ship feels remarkably solid, like an artificial island, with slightly noticeable rocking.With about 160 crew and drillers on board, the ship extends the drill through layers of salt and rock. Workers add new segments of drill as it disappears into the water. Every day or two, an unmanned submarine heads down to check on the situation below.The well is to begin pumping gas soon and the Atwood Advantage plans to move on to another field by the end of next month.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s like a dream, because one year ago everybody thought it was entirely impossible that Israel would be able to resume drilling,\u201d said Mr. Steinitz, the energy minister. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s taking place.

{"Headline": "House Clears Path for Repeal of Health Law", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House cleared the way on Friday for speedy action to repeal the Affordable Care Act, putting Congress on track to undo the most significant health care law in a half-century.With a near party-line vote of 227 to 198, the House overcame the opposition of Democrats and the anxieties of some Republicans to approve a budget blueprint that allows Republicans to end major provisions of President Obama\u2019s health care law without the threat of a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.Republicans have argued that Americans have been crushed by soaring premiums and other unintended effects of the law, which was adopted without any Republican votes.\u201cThis is a critical first step toward delivering relief to Americans who are struggling under this law,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, adding, \u201cThis experiment has failed.\u201dDemocrats warned that repeal of the health law would cause hardship for millions of Americans and create chaos in insurance markets and in the health care system, which accounts for about 18 percent of the nation\u2019s economy.\u201cIf we go down this path, we won\u2019t have repeal and replace,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. \u201cWhat we\u2019ll have is repeal and repent because we\u2019re going to owe a huge apology to the American people for the damage that we cause.\u201dRepresentative Suzan DelBene of Washington, a Democrat, said, \u201cThere\u2019s still no plan for what comes next, threatening massive disruption to the entire health care system.\u201dIn the days before the House vote, some conservative Republicans, as well as moderates, expressed discomfort about signing off on the budget blueprint without having a clearer picture of how and when Republican leaders planned to replace the health care law. Nine House Republicans ended up voting against the budget measure on Friday. No Democrats voted for it.The Times would like to hear from Americans who are signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.In the coming weeks, they say, they will try to devise a replacement, working closely with Mr. Trump and his choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Representative Tom Price of Georgia.Four committees \u2014 two in the Senate, two in the House \u2014 will write language repealing major provisions of the 2010 health law. The resulting legislation can be passed with simple majorities in both chambers, and will be immune to a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.Then, Republicans say, they will pass one or more free-standing bills to replace selected provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats, they will need help from Democrats to reach the 60 votes necessary to approve such legislation.Mr. Trump voiced support this week for repealing and replacing the health care law \u201cessentially simultaneously,\u201d though it remained to be seen if Republicans in the Senate can win enough Democratic support to adopt a replacement for the existing health care law, given the need to reach 60 votes.In the House debate on Friday, Republicans and Democrats offered wildly differing views of health care and health insurance.Representative Jason Lewis of Minnesota, a first-term Republican, said he had firsthand experience with the Affordable Care Act.\u201cMinnesotans have seen their health insurance choices shrink while their premiums, co-pays and deductibles skyrocket,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cI should know. For the last, in fact, over five years, I\u2019ve been in the individual market, and my own insurance premiums have nearly tripled, and I\u2019ve gone through three insurers. Minnesotans have seen a 50 to 67 percent increase in the premium cost this year alone.\u201dThe House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who helped engineer passage of the health law, defended it on Friday, saying that every American benefited.\u201cThe Republicans are feeding their ideological obsession with repealing the A.C.A. and dismantling the health and economic security of hard-working families,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. For six years, she said, Republicans have had the chance to put forth an alternative, but \u201cwe\u2019ve seen nothing.\u201dEchoing their colleagues in the Senate, Democrats asked how Republicans planned to go about replacing the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a complex, arduous task, as Democrats know from their own experience developing and passing the health law in the first place.\u201cWhen you put pen to paper, all hell is going to break loose on your side,\u201d said Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont.Democrats also tried to draw attention to what they said would be the devastating consequences of repealing the health care law.Over and over, after a Republican member spoke out against the law, Mr. Yarmuth offered several data points specific to the member\u2019s home state, including how many people would lose their health coverage.Republicans, though, were eager to deliver on a central campaign promise. \u201cThe public has rendered judgment on this health care law,\u201d said Representative John Shimkus of Illinois.The differing views among House members on Friday foreshadowed the acrimony that is all but certain in the weeks to come, as Republicans press ahead with their repeal efforts over Democrats\u2019 strenuous objections.So far, lawmakers have shown some creativity in trying to explain the wisdom \u2014 or lack of wisdom \u2014 in moving forward with a repeal.On Friday, Representative Drew Ferguson of Georgia, a freshman Republican, likened the health care law to a goat that had been let loose in a person\u2019s home.\u201cNow for six years, that goat has been messing in and destroying my house,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to renovate my house, but before I can, I have to get the goat out of the house before it does any more damage. It makes no sense to start fixing up my house until we get the goat out.\u201dVoting for the measure on Friday, Mr. Ferguson said, would get rid of the goat.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ride-Hailing Drivers Are Slaves to the Surge", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byEvery weekday at 5:30 a.m., Uziel Santos, 48, leaves for work. Like most drivers for ride-hailing apps in New York, he is drawn by early-morning surge prices, and those closest to his home in Astoria, Queens, are on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where children and parents book short, lucrative rides to school and work.He simultaneously signs on to Uber, Lyft and Juno, three of the most prominent ride-hailing apps currently operating in the city, to determine the highest-paying fares in town that day.Having already memorized the promotions that various apps announce at the beginning of each week, Mr. Santos quickly scans for daily or even hourly surges and determines which app has the most profitable deal. Uber would bring him nearly twice the fare that a yellow cab would charge on a recent morning.\u201cIt\u2019s like a weather forecast,\u201d Mr. Santos said. \u201cYou learn to predict when people need rides, and where.\u201dRide-hailing apps established surge prices to lure drivers to areas with more requests than available cars. Capitalizing on New York\u2019s hypersensitive surge market, drivers use two or three phones per app, or even supplementary apps like Driver Bar and Uber Partner that are designed to help them find the best rates offered among the various apps and to log off apps when accepting rides on others.Mr. Santos became the sole earner for his family of four when he began driving for Uber two years ago. Uber Technologies Inc. arrived in the city in 2011, promising drivers flexible scheduling and high wages, intending to disrupt \u201cthe most sophisticated and complicated transportation market out there.\u201dLyft and Juno soon followed, and by January last year, there were more than 60,000 cars registered with ride-hailing apps, far outnumbering the city\u2019s 13,000 yellow cabs. Uber leads the market with over 226,000 unique trips per day, over 150,000 more than any of its competitors.For some longtime cabbies like Domingo Batista, who has been driving a yellow taxi in Manhattan for 20 years, Uber did not seem like a big deal at first. But surge pricing \u201cchanged everything,\u201d he said, pointing to his fare meter.\u201cIn the cab, that number\u2019s not going up; Uber can surcharge what they want,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYes, it\u2019s very unfair.\u201dMr. Santos switched to Uber after seeing ads on buses, betting that his profits could soar if he rose through the app\u2019s algorithm to achieve a perfect five-star rating from customers. (He is currently at 4.98.)To achieve this, he packs his squeaky-clean Honda Odyssey minivan with refreshments, snacks and magazines. He wears a suit and opens the door for each passenger, as if he were a chauffeur. He has become his own boss, adding Lyft, Juno and Via to his roster of apps for when Uber surges are not high enough. His maintenance routine, which includes gas and weekly wash for the van, costs from $300 to $400 each week, he estimates.Within five months, the app upgraded Mr. Santos to Uber V.I.P., meaning more rides, priority airport bookings and better promotions for him every week. He said he had been earning about $6,000 a month since.And with some apps doubling or nearly tripling the commission they take from drivers for each trip, drivers have to work longer and often during less-convenient times to make up the difference. (Uber took 10 percent when it was introduced; now it takes 25 percent, as does Lyft.)\u201cMy friends don\u2019t like their corporate jobs because there\u2019s no flexibility,\u201d Mr. Santos said. \u201cSo they say, \u2018Maybe we\u2019ll do Uber part-time instead.\u2019\u201dHe said he discouraged the change: \u201cI tell them, \u2018No way. You\u2019ll lose money. There are so many expenses \u2014 maintenance, insurance, liability, the T.L.C. license, gas. And the only time you make real money is on surge \u2014 so you will miss family dinner and putting the kids to bed.\u2019\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s the only way,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to treat it like an intense full-time job.\u201dSohail Rana, 48, who drives for Uber and joined the guild in July, said he thought apps had made drivers \u201cslaves to the surges.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re like sitting ducks,\u201d said Mr. Rana, who started driving for UberBlack, the company\u2019s high-end service, after business slowed for the private black car company he worked for, a downturn he attributed to the ride-hailing apps.\u201cThey really just messed up the industry by saturating it so much,\u201d he said. \u201cIt used to be that booking a black car would cost $100, $200 per hour.\u201dDrivers for UberBlack, which account for 6 percent of all Uber business in the city, by contrast, now earn about $33 per hour, he said. After expenses, Mr. Rana added, that amount was closer to $15 per hour.According to James Conigliaro Jr., a founder of the guild, the 45,000 Uber drivers represented in the city are the victims of a \u201cglobal bait-and-switch,\u201d in which apps like Uber lure drivers with attractive fares only to extract ever-larger commissions and invest in driverless technology.A 36-year-old single mother of three, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a volatile domestic situation, said she had yet to see the $1,000 per week that Uber advertised when she signed on to drive. She misses surges because she has to drop off one child at school and take care of a younger one all day as she cannot afford day care. Driving overnight, when her 18-year-old is at home, she earns about $600 to $700 most weeks.\u201cWhat else can I do if I have to take care of my kids and still make money?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for something more stable and secure. For now, it\u2019s just a decent way to survive.\u201dFor the moment, though, an app driver is forced to chase the surge. On New Year\u2019s Eve, usually the most bankable time for a driver in the city, Mr. Santos was home with the flu. He had missed two weeks of driving to take care of his children, then himself and his wife.\u201cIn times like these, we pull out of the savings,\u201d his wife, Ana, said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to work a lot more nights to make it up. The kids cry. They ask me, \u2018Where\u2019s Daddy?\u2019 because he\u2019s not there in the mornings when they wake up and at night when they go to bed.\u201cBut if he can pick them up from school, if he can stay home when they get sick \u2014 that flexibility is insurance in itself. For us as a family, it\u2019s worth it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Cybersecurity Role Reflects Diminished Place in Trump World", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For a brief moment, it looked as if America\u2019s mayor just might become America\u2019s diplomat.But for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the bombastic former mayor of New York City, a wild year of being one of President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s most passionate surrogates did not, in the end, land him the high-profile administration job he has long coveted.Instead, Mr. Trump announced on Thursday that he would enlist Mr. Giuliani to share his \u201cexpertise and insight as a trusted friend\u201d on the issue of cybersecurity. Mr. Giuliani, who has spent the last 16 years as a private security consultant, will \u201cfrom time to time\u201d assemble meetings between Mr. Trump and corporate executives who face cyberthreats, the transition team said.\u201cWe\u2019ve let our defense fall behind,\u201d Mr. Giuliani told reporters on Thursday during a conference call. \u201cOur offense is way ahead of our defense.\u201dMr. Giuliani put on a happy face during the call, declaring it a \u201cgreat privilege\u201d to be taking on the role.He remains a close friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, according to associates. But he will not be moving to Washington, as he once hoped, and instead of having his political career rejuvenated after his failed run for president in 2008, he will continue to run his consulting firm.From the start of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, Mr. Giuliani was there: loudly defending the candidate against scandals, attacking Hillary Clinton and President Obama, lashing out at the news media, and boldly asserting that Mr. Trump would be the solution to the nation\u2019s problems on race, terrorism, the economy, gender issues, health care and just about everything else.At the Republican National Convention, where Mr. Trump secured his party\u2019s nomination, Mr. Giuliani waved his arms, shouted, clenched his fists and thundered against Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent. \u201cHillary Clinton is for open borders,\u201d Mr. Giuliani claimed, warning ominously of \u201coperatives who are terrorists, who are going to come to Western Europe and here and kill us.\u201dMr. Trump rewarded that loyalty by seriously considering Mr. Giuliani for a series of posts in the administration. Transition officials informally discussed with Mr. Giuliani the positions of attorney general, secretary of homeland security, and director of national intelligence. Mr. Giuliani wanted none of them.What he did want was secretary of state, and his decision to make that plain as day to anyone who asked might have helped scuttle his chances. Some transition officials were also concerned that Mr. Giuliani, 72, might not have the stamina for the globe-trotting job.In the end, Mr. Giuliani removed his name from consideration in mid-December after the drawn-out public audition, shortly before Mr. Trump announced he had chosen Mr. Tillerson.Now, the ill-defined cybersecurity post may be Mr. Giuliani\u2019s best hope of adding some Trump administration luster to his private security business. But his previous forays into the national and international security arena have been less than a success.After leaving the mayor\u2019s office, he received a multimillion-dollar signing bonus to join a Houston-based law firm with oil industry connections, but spent a majority of his time working on a fast-growing international security business called Giuliani Partners.In 2004, Mr. Giuliani pushed President George W. Bush to choose Bernard Kerik, his former police commissioner and an associate at Giuliani Partners, as homeland security secretary. Mr. Kerik\u2019s nomination was abruptly pulled after it was revealed that he had employed an unauthorized immigrant as a nanny. Mr. Giuliani\u2019s influence with the Bush team evaporated, and Mr. Kerik was later sentenced to four years in prison on federal tax charges.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "San Francisco Asks: Where Have All the Children Gone?", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In a compact studio apartment on the fringes of the Castro district here a young couple live with their demanding 7-year-old, whom they dote on and take everywhere: a Scottish terrier named Olive.Raising children is on the agenda for Daisy Yeung, a high school science teacher, and Slin Lee, a software engineer. But just not in San Francisco.\u201cWhen we imagine having kids, we think of somewhere else,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to feel like a no-kids type of city.\u201dA few generations ago, before the technology boom transformed San Francisco and sent housing costs soaring, the city was alive with children and families. Today it has the lowest percentage of children of any of the largest 100 cities in America, according to census data, causing some here to raise an alarm.\u201cEverybody talks about children being our future,\u201d said Norman Yee, a member of San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors. \u201cIf you have no children around, what\u2019s our future?\u201dAs an urban renaissance has swept through major American cities in recent decades, San Francisco\u2019s population has risen to historical highs and a forest of skyscraping condominiums has replaced tumbledown warehouses and abandoned wharves. At the same time, the share of children in San Francisco fell to 13 percent, low even compared with another expensive city, New York, with 21 percent. In Chicago, 23 percent of the population is under 18 years old, which is also the overall average across the United States.California, which has one of the world\u2019s 10 largest economies, recently released data showing the lowest birthrate since the Great Depression.As San Francisco moves toward a one-industry town with soaring costs, the dearth of children is one more change that raises questions about its character. Are fewer children making San Francisco more one-dimensional and less vibrant? The answer is subjective and part of an impassioned debate over whether a new, wealthier San Francisco can retain the allure of the city it is replacing.Many immigrant and other residential areas of San Francisco still have their share of the very young and the very old. The sidewalks of some wealthy enclaves even have stroller gridlock on weekends. But when you walk through the growing number of neighborhoods where employees of Google, Twitter and so many other technology companies live or work, the sidewalks display a narrow band of humanity, as if life started at 22 and ended somewhere around 40.\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll be walking through the city and I\u2019ll see a child and think, \u2018Hey, wait a second. What are you doing here?\u2019\u201d said Courtney Nam, who works downtown at a tech start-up. \u201cYou don\u2019t really see that many kids.\u201dThere is one statistic that the city\u2019s natives have heard too many times. San Francisco, population 865,000, has roughly the same number of dogs as children: 120,000. In many areas of the city, pet grooming shops seem more common than schools.In an interview last year, Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor and a co-founder of PayPal, described San Francisco as \u201cstructurally hostile to families.\u201dProhibitive housing costs are not the only reason there are relatively few children. A public school system of uneven quality, the attractiveness of the less-foggy suburbs to families, and the large number of gay men and women, many of them childless, have all played roles in the decline in the number of children, which began with white flight from the city in the 1970s. The tech boom now reinforces the notion that San Francisco is a place for the young, single and rich.\u201cIf you get to the age that you\u2019re going to have kids in San Francisco and you haven\u2019t made your million \u2014 or more \u2014 you probably begin to think you have to leave,\u201d said Richard Florida, an expert in urban demographics and author of \u201cThe Rise of the Creative Class.\u201dMr. Florida sees a larger national trend. Jobs in America have become more specialized and the country\u2019s demography has become more segmented, he says. Technology workers who move to San Francisco and Silicon Valley anticipate long hours and know they may have to put off having families.\u201cIt\u2019s a statement on our age that in order to make it in our more advanced, best and most-skilled industries you really have to sacrifice,\u201d Mr. Florida said. \u201cAnd the sacrifice may be your family.\u201dMr. Yee, the supervisor, is urging his colleagues to hold hearings next month on the issue of children.\u201cFor me it\u2019s part of the fabric of what a city should have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes us all care more.\u201dThe city has also invested millions in upgrading parks, according to Phil Ginsburg, the general manager of the city\u2019s Recreation and Parks Department.\u201cWe are trying to do our part to send a very strong message that San Francisco is an awesome place for kids,\u201d Mr. Ginsburg said. The city has increased its offerings for summer programs, many of which were fully enrolled last summer.Yet even those with the means to stay find themselves looking elsewhere when children come along.Liz Devlin, a senior manager at Twitter, which like other technology companies offers generous parental leave, took 20 weeks off at full pay when her second child, Jack, was born in 2014.Living in a three-bedroom apartment in the Marina district, Ms. Devlin said, she considered San Francisco a \u201cphenomenal place to raise kids.\u201dBut last July when the energetic Jack turned 2, she and her husband decided it was time to leave.\u201cIn terms of cost of living, space and schools I think it\u2019s definitely attractive for people to look outside the city,\u201d said Ms. Devlin, who moved across the Golden Gate Bridge to Marin County.Those who make it work in San Francisco speak of the compromises.Jean Covington, a San Francisco resident who works as a public defender in Contra Costa County, said she noticed a \u201cpilgrimage\u201d of her friends out of the city when children reached school age. When she decided to stick it out, she was confronted with what she described as a bewildering public school selection system governed by an algorithm that determines where children in the city are placed \u2014 sometimes miles from home.When her daughter turned 5, Ms. Covington applied to 14 public kindergartens, but her child ended up being placed in another. She chose a private school instead, along with the strain on the family budget that it entailed.\u201cEveryone starts off with the same dreams: \u2018I\u2019m going to make it work in the city, and I\u2019m going to be the family that sticks it out,\u2019\u201d Ms. Covington said of her friends. \u201cAnd suddenly the one bathroom in their flat becomes two or three too few. And the school system is too daunting.\u201dSan Francisco\u2019s public school system has around 53,000 students, a sharp drop from 90,000 in 1970.The decline is a reflection both of families leaving the city and wealthier parents sending their children to private schools. Around 30 percent of San Francisco children attend private school, the highest rate among large American cities.Opinion is divided on whether having fewer children in the city is something San Francisco should worry about.Mr. Florida, the expert in urban demographics, said a lack of children made a city \u201ca little bit more of a colder or harder place.\u201dMr. Lee, the software engineer, said he loved San Francisco \u2014 the weather, the food, the friends he has made. But the city, he said, feels somewhat detached from the life cycle.\u201cIt\u2019s similar to when you go to college and you are surrounded by people who are in the same life stage or who have the same attitude about what their priorities are,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cThat\u2019s all you see: people who are exactly like you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will a \u2018Slap in the Face\u2019 From Voters Revive Davos Agenda, or Daze It?", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byNEW YORK \u2014 In the battle for global economic supremacy, is Davos Man any match for Donald J. Trump?Coined by the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, the term \u201cDavos Man\u201d refers to an economic elite who built unheard-of fortunes on the seemingly high-minded notions of free trade, low taxes and low regulation that they championed. And they were not the only beneficiaries, according to their reasoning. What benefited them would benefit men and women on the lower rungs of economic life around the globe.But the Great Recession, and the years of slow growth that followed, put an end to that kind of blue-sky optimism across the economic spectrum.Indeed, the populist surge of 2016 is seen by many as a repudiation of the economic policies advocated for decades by global executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and by political leaders from both sides of the aisle, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama in the United States, and David Cameron and Tony Blair in Britain.It is an issue that is sure to be front and center as the 2017 conference begins on Tuesday.\u201cA slap in the face, a wake-up call \u2014 whatever you want to call it \u2014 the people left behind by globalization feel abandoned by the political elite,\u201d said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at the research firm IHS Markit.In terms of real economics, however, things are more complicated. Despite dire warnings of the financial panic a Trump victory would bring and the economic fallout that could attend Britain\u2019s decision to exit the European Union, neither has come to pass \u2014 at least not yet.Wall Street rallied 6 percent after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November, and the Dow Jones industrial average is flirting with a record 20,000. Consumer confidence is high in the United States, and other economic signals, like hiring and retail sales, are also pointing in the right direction.In the meantime, after initially predicting a steep drop in growth after the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in June, the Bank of England reversed course in November and raised its outlook for the British economy in 2017. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has risen 14 percent since the vote.Even in Mexico, a prime target of Mr. Trump\u2019s, the stock market has recovered some of its losses since Election Day. And Japan\u2019s Nikkei index has jumped 13 percent since then.Of course, positive investor reaction does not mean that Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda is smart policy, or that the Brexit vote was the right call. Wall Street has a long history of assuming that the worst will never come to pass, as anyone who worked at Lehman Brothers can attest.But the resilience of the economy in the United States and abroad suggests that there is more underlying strength than many may believe.\u201cThe most recent era of globalization has hit a brick wall, but the wall is political, not economic,\u201d said Josh Green, chief executive of Panjiva, a data analysis firm that tracks global trade. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the end of global trade.\u201dInstead, Mr. Green said, the task for policy makers and Davos types alike is to see to it that the benefits of globalization and free trade spread more widely.\u201cI have to say I continue to be an optimist,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the volatility, we will look back on this as the beginning of a new era of politically and economically sustainable globalization.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect between how people are voting and how people are shopping,\u201d he added. \u201cThe holiday season was strong, and people are going to the mall or online and buying products from all over the world.\u201dWhether or not Mr. Green is right, it is true that when Mr. Trump takes over from President Obama on Friday \u2014 the final day of the Davos conference \u2014 he will inherit an economy that is fundamentally solid.If anything, the outlook for the American economy is better than it was at this time last year. Most experts expect growth to surpass 2 percent on an annual basis this quarter, more than twice as fast as the pace in the first quarter of 2016.While a stronger dollar and the interest rate increases that the Federal Reserve has signaled will come in 2017 could be a drag, both result from more economic strength, not less.\u201cIn terms of how to evaluate the global economy, we reserve a special place for the business cycle in the U.S.,\u201d said Ben Mandel, global strategist with J. P. Morgan\u2019s Multi-Asset Solutions unit. \u201cAnd we\u2019re fairly comfortable with the outlook.\u201dSentiment is high among businesses and consumers in the United States, he said, and if Mr. Trump follows through on his plans to raise infrastructure spending, that could serve as an important stimulus after years of slow growth.Mr. Behravesh, who will attend the Davos conference this year, said the fallout from the voter backlash against globalization would depend on just what kind of populist policies were implemented in its wake.\u201cIt all depends on whether it\u2019s pro-growth populism or more protectionist populism,\u201d Mr. Behravesh said.The protectionist variety would mean stiff tariffs on goods imported into the United States, and retaliatory action by major trading partners like Mexico and China. That would hold down growth throughout the global economy, he said.Pro-growth populism would amount to moderate tax cuts and deregulation, along with an infrastructure investment plan big enough to actually move the economic needle.That combination \u2014 minus the tariffs and trade wars \u2014 could boost estimated annual economic growth to 2.6 percent or more in 2018 from 2.3 percent this year and 1.6 percent in 2016.Over the long term, there is more to worry about economically, especially if other nations in Europe follow Britain\u2019s lead in moving away from a common market, or if the Trump administration prompts a global re-evaluation of the benefits of free trade.\u201cIt feels good to rebel when things are going badly, but Europeans and Americans are going to be worse off for the destruction of trade,\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford. \u201cBut Brexit is even more worrying than Trump. Brexit is permanent, but Trump could be out in four years.\u201dStill, Professor Bloom said, he understands why the Davos economic agenda has fallen so far out of favor. \u201cI was astounded that for so long rising inequality hadn\u2019t affected politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, much like the Arab Spring, things suddenly snapped.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Data Could Be the Next Tech Hot Button for Regulators", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byWealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on.Now data \u2014 gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations \u2014 is increasingly a focus of technology competition. And academics and some policy makers, especially in Europe, are considering whether big internet companies like Google and Facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation.In recent years, Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion, privacy or antitrust investigations. But in the coming years, who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in American tech giants.As government regulators dig into this new era of data competition, they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make. Using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit, for example. And higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services.The competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990s about software and Microsoft. The worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers, and gather more data, a powerful \u201cnetwork effect\u201d effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform, like Google in search or Facebook in consumer social networks.Evidence of the rising importance of data can be seen from the frontiers of artificial intelligence to mainstream business software. And certain data sets can be remarkably valuable for companies working on those technologies.Microsoft is betting LinkedIn, combined with data on how hundreds of millions of workers use its Office 365 online software, and consumer data from search behavior on Bing, will \u201cpower a set of insights that we think is unprecedented,\u201d said James Phillips, vice president for business applications at Microsoft.IBM estimates that 70 percent of the world\u2019s data is not out on the public web, but in private databases, often to protect privacy or trade secrets. IBM\u2019s strategy is to take the data it has acquired, add customer data and use that to train its Watson artificial intelligence software to pursue such tasks as helping medical researchers discover novel disease therapies, or flagging suspect financial transactions for independent auditors.\u201cOur focus is mainly on nonpublic data sets and extending that advantage for clients in business and science,\u201d said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s Watson and cloud businesses.At Google, the company\u2019s drive into cloud-delivered business software is fueled by data, building on years of work done on its search and other consumer services, and its recent advances in image identification, speech recognition and language translation.For example, a new Google business offering \u2014 still in the test, or alpha, stage \u2014 is a software service to improve job finding and recruiting. Its data includes more than 17 million online job postings and the public profiles and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of more than 200 million people.Its machine-learning algorithms distilled that to about four million unique job titles, ranked the most common ones and identified specific skills. The job sites CareerBuilder and Dice are using the Google technology to show job seekers more relevant openings. And FedEx, the giant package shipper, is adding the service to its recruiting site.That is just one case, said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google\u2019s cloud business, of what is becoming increasingly possible \u2014 using the tools of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, to sift through huge quantities of data to provide machine-curated data services.\u201cYou can turn this technology to whatever field you want, from manufacturing to medicine,\u201d Ms. Greene said.Fei-Fei Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is taking a sabbatical to become chief scientist for artificial intelligence at Google\u2019s cloud unit. She sees working at Google as one path to pursue her career ambition to \u201cdemocratize A.I.,\u201d now that the software and data ingredients are ripe.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have the current era of A.I. without the big data revolution,\u201d Dr. Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s the digital gold.\u201dIn the A.I. race, better software algorithms can put you ahead for a year or so, but probably no more, said Andrew Ng, a former Google scientist and adjunct professor at Stanford. He is now chief scientist at Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant, and a leading figure in artificial intelligence research.Rivals, he added, cannot unlock or simulate your data. \u201cData is the defensible barrier, not algorithms,\u201d Mr. Ng said.Advertisement"}

He was 91.Mr. Nakamura began making a business of amusement in 1955. A decade after Japan\u2019s calamitous defeat in World War II, the country\u2019s economy was springing back to life, and the somber mood of the first postwar decade was retreating. Japanese were ready to embrace fun and games again.His first venture \u2014 installing two wooden horses for children to ride on the roof of a department store \u2014 was simple, and turned into a modest success.Rooftops gave him more success as time went on. In the early 1960s, he secured a deal with Mitsukoshi, a leading Japanese department store chain, to install another children\u2019s ride, this one using small replica automobiles running on tracks, on the roof of its flagship Tokyo location. The attraction, Roadway Rides, proved popular, and Mitsukoshi commissioned it for all of its stores.Real fame and fortune came later, with the rise of video games.It was conceived by a 25-year-old Namco employee, Toru Iwatani, who later said that he was inspired by the shape of a pizza with a slice missing. The \u201cPac\u201d came from the Japanese onomatopoeic word \u201cpakku,\u201d equivalent to the English \u201cgobble\u201d or \u201cmunch.\u201dAnd as fast as Pac-Man could gobble up pellets in his maze, players gobbled up Pac-Man.In the 36 years since its release, it is estimated to have been played more than 10 billion times. The Smithsonian Institution and the Museum of Modern Art have Pac-Man machines in their collections.Despite that habit \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014 he warned against what today would be called screen addiction.\u201cI am a little concerned about the way some young people play it so much,\u201d he said at the height of the Pac-Man craze. \u201cOnce it goes beyond a certain level, it is not good for young people.\u201dNamco continued to develop video games, though none could top Pac-Man\u2019s success. The company expanded into other businesses, including a chain of food-themed amusement parks in Japan, most of which have closed or been sold off. In 1993, it bought the bankrupt Japanese film studio Nikkatsu, known for output like samurai epics and soft-core pornography.Mr. Nakamura led Namco until 2002, when he took on a more ceremonial role. When Namco merged with a rival toy and game maker, Bandai, in 2005, public tax records indicated that Mr. Nakamura was Japan\u2019s 68th-richest person.Born in Yokohama, Japan, on Dec. 24, 1925, Mr. Nakamura attended what is now Yokohama National University. He studied shipbuilding, according to a short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 provided by Bandai Namco.The company did not release information on survivors, citing what it said was his family\u2019s wish for privacy.Daniel E.

But the move frustrated some automakers that had asked for more time to contest the government\u2019s target for fuel economy in 2025, and it will most likely make it more difficult for a Trump administration to dial it back.In a statement, the departing administrator of the E.P.A. said the industry had proven it could consistently improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gases since the current rules were adopted five years ago.\u201cAt every step in the process, the analysis has shown that the greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and light trucks remain affordable and effective through 2025,\u201d said Gina McCarthy, the E.P.A. administrator.Government officials had been conducting a midterm review of the standards, negotiated with automakers in 2012, since last summer.Automakers have argued that the current goals \u2014 which the E.P.A. said translate to an average fuel-economy sticker of 36 miles per gallon \u2014 were too stringent given the market shift away from passenger cars toward trucks and sport utility vehicles.\u201cThe Environmental Protection Agency has still failed to state a compelling reason for rushing its final determination,\u201d said John Bozzella, the group\u2019s director and chief executive.Ms. McCarthy said the industry had already been adopting fuel-saving technology at a rate that could achieve the current goals.But automakers are expected to ask the incoming Trump administration to review the decision. \u201cIt merits a serious look,\u201d Mr. Bozzella said.\u201cAutomakers\u2019 efforts to weaken the E.P.A. standard, to which they agreed, will deny Americans the benefits of higher-tech cars,\u201d said Daniel Becker, the director of Safe Climate Campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protecting Birth Control Access in Oregon", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byEditorialIf the Affordable Care Act is repealed, coverage of birth control with no co-payment is one of many benefits that Americans could lose. Now legislators in Oregon have introduced a bill intended to protect access to birth control in the state, along with a broad range of other reproductive health care services, including abortion.The bill also includes a provision that would prohibit insurers from discriminating against patients based on gender identity \u2014 for example, by refusing to cover gynecological exams for transgender women.By codifying the protections of the Affordable Care Act, the bill would protect Oregonians\u2019 access to birth control and other preventive health care in the event of a repeal.But the Oregon bill would go beyond the Affordable Care Act by establishing a comprehensive list of essential reproductive health services that must be covered without a co-payment. Its sponsors recognized that people need access to the full range of reproductive health care in order to participate fully in society and the economy. Especially for patients with high-deductible health plans, abortion can be prohibitively expensive even if it is covered.Oregon\u2019s bill is a powerful defense, at the state level, of necessary reproductive health care.An earlier version of this editorial mistakenly said the Oregon reproductive health care bill requires insurers to cover the full cost of all F.D.A.-approved contraceptive drugs and devices. It allows some exclusions if an equivalent treatment is available and covered.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Yorkers Rediscover Activism in the Trump Presidency Era", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byBig CityThe group had been larger in the afternoon but a core remained, undeterred by the weather, to denounce a government that would in a short time, presumably, be run by the banking class that Mr. Trump, while the Republican nominee, had enthusiastically maligned. One of the participants in the action, a Vietnam veteran named Richard Robinson who had flown in from Utah, voted for Mr. Trump but became quickly disillusioned by his reliance on Wall Street to supply his cast of advisers.Outside the hotel, hundreds of protesters gathered in the name of preserving the A.C.A. A mother and two daughters, all of them in health care practice and with little history of activism among them, had come out because they were moved by the plight of their patients who feared losing coverage. Some parents came with small children, despite the cold and wind. Some carried signs that read \u201cCats and Kids Against Capitalism.\u201d Some expressed a sense of conflict over wanting to go after so many issues, subject to so much possible peril, all at once. \u201cWhat do you do when you care about seven things?\u201d Lisa Guido, one of the marchers asked. \u201cI care about clean water. As a middle-aged woman I\u2019m not going to need an abortion, but I do care.\u201dScholars have long maintained that change of the kind movements generate is largely driven by the \u201cbiologically available,\u201d which is to say by the young and unencumbered or the old and idle. What is striking about the universe of Trump resistance, at least in New York, is how visibly active the biologically unavailable actually are. At one meeting of several hundred people in a synagogue in Brooklyn on Monday, I met a woman named Lisa Raymond-Tolan, a mother and occupational therapist who has recently made activism a second job. \u201cPrior to Nov. 8,\u201d she told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t activate one day in my life.\u201dThe Tea Party coalesced in the aftermath of the 2008 elections amid widespread distress on the political right. Discussion groups formed with a hyperlocal focus, a practice that the new guidebook preaches to progressives. It proposes a strategy that is completely defensive (since trying to execute an alternative policy agenda would be impossible), allowing for virtually no conciliation with the other side and the near constant barraging of one\u2019s congressional representatives with requests and grievances in the regular, and very low-tech, form of letters and phone calls. What is the value of this? \u201cCongressional offices have limited time and limited people,\u201d the guidebook explains. \u201cA day they spend worrying about you is a day they\u2019re not ending Medicare, privatizing public schools or preparing a Muslim registry.\u201dOutside Mr. Schumer\u2019s prewar building on Prospect Park West in Brooklyn, there have been two actions this month in which hundreds of ordinary people convened, letting the senator, who is the minority leader, know that they are keeping watch, and, by implication, that they will work to install some other Democrat in his place if he concedes, or gets lazy.Despite the city\u2019s long history of radicalism \u2014 during the Progressive movement of the 19th century, in the Communist fervor leading up to World War I, or the social upheavals of the 1960s and \u201970s \u2014 there is always a strain of skepticism that greets the expression of certain political ideals. Cynicism animates the city as much as hope and conviction. To what extent are activists engaging in self-soothing? To what extent are they merely trying to establish their own relevance? It is always tempting to see the absurdity in theatrical gestures. One woman I met, who had been part of a group devising possible boycotts, announced that the group had come up with the idea of a Dump Trump event. A trash bin would be placed in Grand Army Plaza, in the heart of Park Slope, where people could dispose of their Trump merchandise \u2014 shoes by Ivanka, say \u2014 which accumulate in brownstone Brooklyn the way collected volumes by Max Weber pile up at Disney World.The new wave of activism taking hold in New York and perhaps around the country owes a debt to the Occupy Wall Street movement even as its success continues to be debated. Since the emergence of the New Left in the 1960s, which reoriented the focus of social reform away from its historical roots in Marxism and labor and toward what we have come to call (and criticize as) identity politics, the relationship between college-educated activists and union members, who often have dissimilar agendas, has hardly been seamless.\u201cLabor isn\u2019t going to stand by the wayside,\u201d Mr. Khan, of Strong Economy for All, observed. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen already is that they are going to support grass-roots groups that are small and nimble. Once labor felt comfortable with Occupy, they helped it to grow and expand.\u201dWhen members of the Occupy movement first took over Zuccotti Park in fall 2011, it was easy to make fun of the drumbeating and the dancing, the sense of carnival-like anarchy and lack of direction. What the movement was asking for wasn\u2019t clear. But Occupy Wall Street created a foundation upon which politicians and causes have flourished, and built, and demanded power. And power, in the words of Frederick Douglass, concedes nothing without a demand.Advertisement"}

He also addresses less critical social issues, like the obsession with selfies.The use of art as an artificial reef is meant to raise awareness of the destruction of ocean reefs around the world. He uses concrete, fiberglass rods and other materials to make his installations both resistant to corrosion and pH neutral.\u201cSculptures are normally seen as static and monumental, while these are always living in the moment,\u201d Mr. Taylor said during a recent interview in his seaside studio. \u201cThe more texture the pieces have, the more they transform\u201d underwater.One striking piece looks like President Trump playing on a seesaw. But the life-size concrete figure is actually sitting on an oil pump. Businessmen have been \u201ctreating the world like a playground,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.The resemblance to Mr. Trump was accidental, he said, since the statues were cast from residents or visitors to the island.Another installation is a 100-foot-long fence with a gate that seems pointless, since a diver can easily swim above it.Though Mr. Taylor started his Lanzarote project before Mr. Trump promised to build a wall on the Mexican border, he said Mr. Trump \u201cseems to be very much about protectionism and divisions, the kind of ideas that I wanted this wall to show as being absurd.\u201dHe added, \u201cOur attitude is to build borders and claim ownership of the world and its natural resources, when the three-dimensional natural world really doesn\u2019t work like this.\u201dScuba divers pay an entrance fee of 12 euros, about $12.80, and are accompanied by guides certified by the museum, which is about 1,000 feet offshore. Snorkelers can also get access, but they have limited visibility because the statues are so far below the surface.Since the political turmoil in the Arab world began in 2011, Lanzarote and the other Spanish islands of the Canary archipelago off the coast of Morocco have attracted visitors who previously traveled to countries like Egypt and Tunisia during Europe\u2019s winter months. Over all, Spain welcomed a record 75.3 million tourists last year, 10 percent more than in 2015.Manrique started to transform Lanzarote in the final decade of Gen. Francisco Franco\u2019s dictatorship, when the regime used tourism to improve Spain\u2019s economy and end its international isolation. Yet Manrique was a staunch environmentalist, opposed to mass tourism projects like hotel resorts.Many of his works were inspired by local people like Elo\u00edno Perdomo Placeres, who grew more than 2,000 varieties of cactuses around his home and donated seeds to help Manrique build his own cactus garden nearby.Mr. Perdomo, 86, grows cactuses as a hobby, in a village that was once economically reliant on cochineal. Cochineal, an insect that grows on cactuses, produces carmine, a red pigment used to dye food, beverages and cosmetics.\u201cTourism has brought vitality to an island that, apart from cochineal, really used to have nothing except desert and poverty,\u201d Mr. Perdomo said.Manrique died in a traffic accident in 1992 on one of the roads where he had successfully campaigned for the banning of advertising billboards that could spoil Lanzarote\u2019s landscape.\u201cManrique brought ideas that perhaps seemed crazy and elitist, since there was then not even running water around here,\u201d said Marci Acu\u00f1a, the mayor of Har\u00eda, a village where Manrique designed his final home and work studio. \u201cBut we now have to thank him for preserving Lanzarote\u2019s natural beauty.\u201dThe underwater museum is off the south coast of the island, close to most of Lanzarote\u2019s cruise ship and package tourism infrastructure, including an animal park that has generated opposition from environmentalists after it took in dolphins from German aquariums in November. Dolphins can also be viewed in open waters around Lanzarote.Mr. Taylor, 42, studied arts in London, but his underwater work has also drawn on his other skills. He worked as a diving instructor and underwater photographer, as well as a stage rigger, which, he said, taught him how to anchor statues on a seabed.As a teenager, he sprayed graffiti on subway cars, which would then be wiped clean the next day.Urban graffiti is \u201ca lot of labor that can then be gone forever,\u201d he said, just like statues once they lie at the bottom of the ocean. \u201cYou learn the idea of change, lack of control and not being precious about your work.\u201dMr. Taylor has completed similar projects on the other side of the Atlantic. In 2010, he opened an underwater museum off Canc\u00fan, Mexico, where, he said, the warmer water and larger natural reef are allowing more marine life to develop than in Lanzarote.\u201cI\u2019m here because of tourism, as is almost everyone else working in Lanzarote,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there is also no point pretending that attracting more people doesn\u2019t normally disturb sea life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But President Trump has threatened to quit the Paris climate deal, and within minutes of his taking office on Friday, the White House website removed a discussion of the threat of climate change and replaced it with a commitment to eliminate cornerstone environmental policies.If the United States is willing to cede its role, however, there are plenty of countries happy to step up.\u25a0 Mr. Qiao boasted that 70 percent of the 100 billion renminbi, or $14.6 billion, that China Guodian paid into new investments last year went to renewables like wind and solar.\u25a0 Yu Xubo, president of the Chinese food and agriculture giant Cofco, stunned environmental groups by announcing that the company would eliminate deforestation from its supply chain. \u201cContinue business as usual,\u201d he warned, \u201cand face big, serious risks.\u201d\u25a0 Nur Bekri, China\u2019s energy minister, was blunt in acknowledging not only climate change but also the human contribution to it \u2014 a declaration unlikely to be heard by certain members of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration.\u201cToday, we are facing climate change, and we know this is caused by our use of energy,\u201d Mr. Bekri declared. \u201cThat is why the Chinese government attaches great importance to the development of clean energy.\u201dOther developing nations, including India, also promoted their environmental records.India, Ms. Sitharaman said, is \u201cno longer on the fringe\u201d of climate change policies and technologies.They are also motivated by the risks posed by rising seas, extreme weather and other consequences of unmitigated climate change.\u201cCountries are competing to succeed in this new space,\u201d said Pete Ogden, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who was a climate adviser to former President Barack Obama. \u201cAt the same time, Mr. Trump is signaling a kind of fearfulness of America\u2019s capacity to succeed in a clean economy.\u201d\u201cThey see it in their economic self-interest to do so,\u201d Mr. Ogden said, referring to other countries. \u201cAnd if the United States wants to cede the playing field, they\u2019ll be happy to capture as big of a share as they possibly can.\u201dMany corporations, even some previously vilified for their environmental footprint, were eager to jump on the bandwagon, promoting climate-friendly business practices.

It was made, he said, with 50 percent renewable energy and reused water.A group of 62 chief executives at Davos discussed, among other issues, spurring Mr. Trump to take climate action by emphasizing how clean energy investment can create jobs, said Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, who participated in the event.\u201cTo make America great again, climate action is very logical,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very convincing story for job creation and economic growth.\u201dBut there are concerns over this new class of climate-change stewards.Rachel Kyte, special representative of Sustainable Energy for All, a United Nations-backed group that promotes clean energy, said there had been a major shift in the attitudes of top companies toward climate-change risks in recent years.\u201cIt was a roll-up-your-sleeves kind of session,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sense was that we need to keep moving action forward, because we don\u2019t have time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Modi\u2019s Cash Ban Brings Pain, but Corruption-Weary India Grits Its Teeth", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire.But despite those concerns, as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do, for the moment, at least, Mr. Modi\u2019s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena.Even as the poorest Indians have struggled, many have continued to voice support for the prime minister\u2019s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money, known as \u201cblack money,\u201d flowing through the country\u2019s economy, in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr. Modi, analysts say, has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government.\u201cEven though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family, I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country,\u201d said Hem Raj Chechi, 39, a taxi driver in New Delhi, the capital, who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced.Mr. Chechi has not been able to pay his children\u2019s school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months. But, he said, \u201cWe need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me.\u201dMr. Modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in New Delhi, bring jobs and fight corruption. Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption, widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless.Declaring war on corruption, Mr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that 500 and 1,000 rupee bills, worth about $8 and $15, would be banned the next morning.With the currency ban, Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side. He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the long-term good.That frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many Americans to vote for President-elect Donald J. Trump last year, said Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University who is a native of India.\u201cTrump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system,\u201d Mr. Prasad said in an interview. \u201cModi, in the same way, did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can\u2019t tackle deep-rooted problems like corruption. We needed big and painful changes, really disruptive ones.\u201dMr. Modi appeared on television on New Year\u2019s Eve to tell Indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation.He compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, a battle of good versus evil. \u201cToday Mahatma Gandhi is not among us, but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate,\u201d Mr. Modi said, using the honorific for Gandhi.\u201cAs we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha,\u201d he said, referring to Gandhi\u2019s nonviolent resistance movement, \u201clet us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness.\u201dMr. Modi was presiding over one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes, which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit crazy,\u201d said Geng Xiao, a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cWhen I first read the news, I couldn\u2019t even figure out if it was true.\u201dThe government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency \u2014 more than 250,000 rupees, or about $3,670, could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it. Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless.Whether Mr. Modi\u2019s far-reaching move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate. Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy.But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption, even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones.And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it, which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term, economists say. People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard, their diets and livelihoods severely affected.Many in India see Mr. Modi, who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified goods-and-services tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines, as living up to his promise to be a reformer of India\u2019s ossified and bureaucratic economy.But in the process, he has placed the Indian economy and his political future at risk. Many economists believe that the Indian economy will take at least a short-term hit because of a dire shortage of cash, and that the future impact is uncertain. If the effects are prolonged, the public support for Modi could wane.\u201cIf this move damages the economy, he\u2019s in for a rough ride,\u201d said Harsh Pant, the head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank.Mr. Xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial, the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out. \u201cYou need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing,\u201d he said.Mr. Modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014, defeating the government, led by the Indian National Congress party, that had ruled for most of the country\u2019s post-independent life, on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption.\u201cIn 2014, he had presented himself as the big disrupter,\u201d Mr. Pant said. \u201cHe was the precursor to what\u2019s happening in the West.\u201dMr. Modi was then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, where he had a reputation for tearing away the country\u2019s red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand.But during his first two years after winning national election, Mr. Modi, whose party did not control the upper house of Parliament, struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul.Mr. Modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get Parliament to clear the way for the simplified goods-and-services tax.He cast the opposition as \u201cpeople who don\u2019t want change, who don\u2019t want reform,\u201d Mr. Pant said, forcing them in August to support the changes.But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable. Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place, the currency shortage remains acute, leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings, many providers said.Nagender Tiwari, 42, a rickshaw driver in East Delhi, said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1,000 rupees, or about $15, that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result, his family, which includes two children in 11th grade, has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home, he said.He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption, noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes.\u201cSo if bribery is not stopped, how can black money be stopped?\u201d he asked.Raj Kumar Bindal, 65, a paper trader in New Delhi, said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before.\u201cWe can\u2019t shift to a cashless mode overnight,\u201d he said.Surjit Bhalla, a New Delhi-based economic adviser for the Observatory Group in New York, said he believed Mr. Modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months, possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax.India needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat, Mr. Bhalla said. In the United States, for every $100 collected in income tax, an estimated $20 owed is not paid, he added. In India, for that same $100 in taxes paid, $200 more is owed, he said.Collectively, the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform India, Mr. Pant and others said.But doing so depends on Mr. Modi\u2019s continuing to command the political narrative of the country, as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban.\u201cSo far, he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him,\u201d Mr. Pant said. \u201cHe thinks he can continue to do it, but we really don\u2019t know. There are so many unknowns.\u201dHari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

On Thursday, the Rockefeller Foundation, one of the country\u2019s largest and most influential philanthropies, will name Mr. Shah to succeed Judith Rodin, who has been president for 12 years.The appointment will make Mr. Shah one of the most powerful forces in charitable giving, overseeing a foundation that donates roughly $200 million each year and corrals governments, companies and organizations to contribute money and resources in tandem.Mr. Shah, 43, will be the first Indian-American to lead the Rockefeller Foundation, which has gained stature in recent years through some prominent projects but has sometimes been criticized as being more interested in its publicity than its grantees.Founded in 1913 by the oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, the foundation says it has given away the equivalent of more than $17 billion in today\u2019s dollars. Its first grant was to the American Red Cross, and it went on to play pivotal roles in establishing the field of public health, creating vaccines for yellow fever and malaria, and bringing agricultural advances to the developing world.These efforts have struck critics as public relations stunts more than meaningful agents of change. And Ms. Rodin has drawn fire for spending too much time with corporate partners and not enough time with the recipients of grants.Much of the foundation\u2019s work concerns improving health and well-being in Africa, aiding economic development in impoverished areas and developing strategies to combat climate change.It was these diverse causes that attracted Mr. Shah to the job. With advanced degrees in medicine and health finance from the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Shah worked at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for nearly a decade, rising to be director for agricultural development.In those roles, Mr. Shah said, he came to understand the power of public-private partnerships, a strategy that Ms. Rodin has embraced at the Rockefeller Foundation.\u201cI\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible when people come together,\u201d he said in an interview this week. \u201cWe were able to save tens of thousands, if not millions, of lives.\u201dMs. Rodin was not involved in the search for her successor but has known Mr. Shah for years. They worked together on an agricultural project when he was at the Gates Foundation, and he joined the Rockefeller Foundation board in 2015.\u201cHe\u2019s a marvel,\u201d Ms. Rodin said in an interview this week. \u201cHe\u2019s very strategic and very innovative. He shows an interpersonal dexterity that is well beyond his years.\u201dMs. Rodin said she believed that Mr. Shah was a good fit for the job thanks in part to his time at U.S.A.I.D., which required that he forge alliances with a vast array of governments, organizations and companies.\u201cOne of the things we tried to emphasize during my time at Rockefeller was broadening the scope of partnerships,\u201d Ms. Rodin said. \u201cWe see in Raj someone who has the capacity to take advantage of this, and has the capacity to be a great partner.\u201dRichard Parsons, the chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation board, said Mr. Shah was the unanimous choice of the search committee after a competitive process that considered hundreds of candidates.\u201cRaj is the perfect guy to come in after her,\u201d Mr. Parsons said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s a performer. You put him up in front of a group and people come away impressed. Now, he\u2019s got a platform.\u201dMr. Shah said he was committed to the broad themes of resilience and inclusive economies.But he said he would look for opportunities to address schisms in the American electorate in this divisive political moment.\u201cIt is a different time today than it was 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live in a more fractured world.\u201dThe Rockefeller Foundation is viewed by some has having a liberal bent. During Ms. Rodin\u2019s tenure, the foundation donated money to the Clinton Foundation.Mr. Shah is close with President Obama but said he maintained good relations with Republicans in the House and Senate and believed that the foundation\u2019s core mission had bipartisan appeal.\u201cIt\u2019s widely acknowledged that tackling hunger and ensuring health around the globe are in our own national interest,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cI have always been passionate about delivering social justice results at a massive scale.\u201dHe will now have a $200 million a year to try to deliver those results.An earlier version of this article misidentified an entity that led a push to divest stock holdings from fossil fuel companies. That entity is the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, not the Rockefeller Foundation.An article on Thursday about the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s naming Rajiv Shah as its new president, using information from the organization, erroneously attributed a distinction to him. At age 43, Mr. Shah is one of the youngest people to lead the foundation, not the youngest. (At least two of his predecessors were younger.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Answer to Tesla Is Hopeful Entrant to Global Car Market", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byWheelsBEIJING \u2014 On a windswept lot near Beijing\u2019s main airport, Lu Qun talks up the electric sports car he hopes will transform him into China\u2019s Elon Musk.\u201cThis is a real performance car,\u201d the entrepreneur boasted of his sleek, gray-and-black Qiantu K50. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. You can feel the quality. You\u2019ll love driving this car.\u201dFor Mr. Lu, 48, the roadster is his best chance to make it big. After a lifetime of obscurity creating vehicles for other companies, the bespectacled engineer is betting that the rise of electric cars will propel his company \u2014 and his country \u2014 into the automotive spotlight.\u201cTraditional auto manufacturers are constrained by their old models,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can see things with fresh eyes.\u201dAcross China, government officials, corporate executives, private investors and newcomers like Mr. Lu are in a headlong rush to develop a domestic electric car industry. The country\u2019s goal, like Mr. Lu\u2019s, is to capitalize on the transition to electric to turbocharge the country\u2019s lagging automobile sector to become a major competitor to the United States, Japan and Germany.That has been a goal of China\u2019s industrial planners for decades, as the government has lavished resources on building homegrown automakers and discriminated against foreign players.But so far, that effort has failed.Local manufacturers have lacked the brands, technology and managerial heft to outmaneuver their established rivals, either at home or abroad. Chinese consumers have preferred more reliable Buicks, Volkswagens and Toyotas to the often substandard offerings from domestic manufacturers, while little-known Chinese models have struggled to gain traction overseas.Electric vehicles could offer a second chance \u2014 one China\u2019s policy makers do not intend to miss.This time, China\u2019s carmakers may be better positioned. Since electric vehicles are a relatively new business for all players, Chinese manufacturers and international rivals are largely starting from the same point.\u201cThere is a smaller gap between where China is today and the rest of the world\u201d in electric cars, said Bill Russo, managing director at Gao Feng Advisory, a Shanghai consultancy, and a former Chrysler executive. \u201cThere is room for newer start-up companies to dream big in China.\u201dMr. Lu is one of those dreamers.Fascinated by cars since he was a boy, he studied automotive engineering at Beijing\u2019s prestigious Tsinghua University. Upon graduating in 1990, he joined the research and development team at the China-based joint venture of Jeep, then a division of Chrysler.During his time there, which included two years in Detroit, Mr. Lu came to feel such overseas operations had limited prospects in China \u2014 the ventures\u2019 partners would try to balance their interests, and so were slow to develop strategies and make decisions.So in 2003, he and nine colleagues started CH-Auto Technology Corporation as a specialty research and design shop for the local car industry. Since then, the firm has designed vehicles for some of China\u2019s biggest automakers.Mr. Lu decided to start manufacturing his own vehicles because of the shift to electric. Since producing electric cars requires new parts and technologies, he believed a small entrant could better compete with these new vehicles than traditional automakers.\u201cElectric vehicles won\u2019t just replace cars with conventional engines, but they will bring a huge change to the entire car industry,\u201d Mr. Lu said. \u201cWe wanted to be part of this revolution.\u201dThe result is the K50. Designed at his research center, the two-seater has a light, carbon fiber exterior and a console stuffed with touch screens. Rows of batteries propel the roadster to a top speed of about 120 miles per hour and carry it as far as 200 miles on a single charge.No longer content to watch others produce his designs, Mr. Lu is currently constructing a $300 million factory in Suzhou, a city near Shanghai, to manufacture 50,000 cars a year. In all, he expects to invest as much as $1.4 billion into his venture over five years.He did not specify what the car would sell for, but Mr. Lu intends to price the K50 at the top of the market when it goes on sale this year.That sets CH-Auto on a collision course with the industry\u2019s flagship: Tesla.Elon Musk\u2019s company already has an edge. While Mr. Lu is building his business from scratch, Tesla has been established in China since 2013. CH-Auto will have to persuade wealthy customers to plunk down a large sum on an unfamiliar brand \u2014 Qiantu \u2014 over Mr. Musk\u2019s recognizable models.Mr. Lu nevertheless remains confident. He argues the sporty K50 will appeal to a more leisure-oriented driver than Tesla\u2019s cars. As a logo, the company has chosen the dragonfly, because its managers believe the speedy, nimble insect has similar attributes to his electric car. To market it, Mr. Lu is considering opening showrooms in major Chinese cities, backed by a platform to sell online.Elon Musk \u201cis someone I can learn from,\u201d he said. \u201cTesla has huge symbolic significance because it is the first company to make people believe a business model solely around electric vehicles is possible.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cwe are not looking to create the Chinese Tesla.\u201dWhen it comes to competing with Tesla, Mr. Lu can count on ample help from the Chinese government.To bring down costs and spur demand, the state has unleashed a torrent of cash. It has offered subsidies to manufacturers and tax breaks for buyers, and plowed investments into charging stations to make electric cars more practical.In all, UBS Securities estimates that the government spent $13 billion promoting electric vehicles in 2015 alone. So far, Mr. Lu has financed the K50 through loans and injections of fresh capital, but says he \u201cwon\u2019t refuse\u201d government subsidies if they become available.Some analysts fear the state\u2019s largess could prove as much bane as boon.China may be recreating the waste and excess in electric cars that has plagued other state-targeted sectors, like steel and renewable energy, without spurring the technological innovation the economy needs to compete. And even though China\u2019s car market is the world\u2019s biggest, it is still unlikely to absorb all of the electric vehicle projects underway today.\u201cThey are fueling overcapacity, with a lot of wasted money, and I\u2019m doubtful that in the end you\u2019ll have a successful electric car industry,\u201d says Crystal Chang, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley who studies China\u2019s auto industry policies.Significant sums have already been squandered. In September, the Finance Ministry fined five companies for defrauding the government of $150 million by fabricating sales of electric vehicles to obtain more subsidies, and several companies have failed to make an impression.Mr. Lu is certain, however, that the K50 stands out in a crowded field. The car has already gotten some advance buzz; a review on one popular Chinese website praised its design as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cavant-garde\u201d and its body as \u201cvery muscular.\u201d\u201cA big advantage they have is their knowledge of what it takes to build a quality vehicle,\u201d said Jack Perkowski, managing partner of the Beijing-based consulting firm JFP Holdings and a veteran of China\u2019s car sector. \u201cThey have a better chance than many others because of that.\u201dMr. Lu is counting on it.\u201cThere are a lot of electric vehicle companies and hot projects attracting a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cNot every company and not every car will be successful.\u201dEmily Feng contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How We Fool Ourselves on Russia", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byOpinionIn the quarter-century since the end of the Cold War, profound grievances, misperceptions and disappointments have often defined the relationship between the United States and Russia. I lived through this turbulence during my years as a diplomat in Moscow, navigating the curious mix of hope and humiliation that I remember so vividly in the Russia of Boris N. Yeltsin, and the pugnacity and raw ambition of Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Kremlin. And I lived through it in Washington, serving both Republican and Democratic administrations.There have been more than enough illusions on both sides. The United States has oscillated between visions of an enduring partnership with Moscow and dismissing it as a sulking regional power in terminal decline. Russia has moved between notions of a strategic partnership with the United States and a later, deeper desire to upend the current international order, where a dominant United States consigns Russia to a subordinate role.The reality is that our relationship with Russia will remain competitive, and often adversarial, for the foreseeable future. At its core is a fundamental disconnect in outlook and about each other\u2019s role in the world.It is tempting to think that personal rapport can bridge this disconnect and that the art of the deal can unlock a grand bargain. That is a foolish starting point for sensible policy. It would be especially foolish to think that Russia\u2019s deeply troubling interference in our election can or should be played down, however inconvenient.President Putin\u2019s aggressive election meddling, like his broader foreign policy, has at least two motivating factors. The first is his conviction that the surest path to restoring Russia as a great power comes at the expense of an American-led order. He wants Russia unconstrained by Western values and institutions, free to pursue a sphere of influence.The second motivating factor is closely connected to the first. The legitimacy of Mr. Putin\u2019s system of repressive domestic control depends on the existence of external threats. Surfing on high oil prices, he used to be able to bolster his social contract with the Russian people through rising standards of living. That was clear in the boomtown Moscow I knew as the American ambassador a decade ago, full of the promise of a rising middle class and the consumption of an elite convinced that anything worth doing was worth overdoing. But Mr. Putin has lost that card in a world of lower energy prices and Western sanctions, and with a one-dimensional economy in which real reform is trumped by the imperative of political control and the corruption that lubricates it.The ultimate realist, Mr. Putin understands Russia\u2019s relative weakness, but regularly demonstrates that declining powers can be at least as disruptive as rising powers. He sees a target-rich environment all around him.If he can\u2019t easily build Russia up, he can take the United States down a few pegs, with his characteristic tactical agility and willingness to play rough and take risks. If he can\u2019t have a deferential government in Kiev, he can grab Crimea and try to engineer the next best thing, a dysfunctional Ukraine. If he can\u2019t abide the risk of regime upheaval in Syria, he can flex Russia\u2019s military muscle, emasculate the West, and preserve Bashar al-Assad atop the rubble of Aleppo. If he can\u2019t directly intimidate the European Union, he can accelerate its unraveling by supporting anti-Union nationalists and exploiting the wave of migration spawned in part by his own brutality. Wherever he can, he exposes the seeming hypocrisy and fecklessness of Western democracies, blurring the line between fact and fiction.So what to do? Russia is still too big, proud and influential to ignore and still the only nuclear power comparable to the United States. It remains a major player on problems from the Arctic to Iran and North Korea. We need to focus on the critical before we test the desirable. The first step is to sustain, and if necessary amplify, the actions taken by the Obama administration in response to Russian hacking. Russia challenged the integrity of our democratic system, and Europe\u2019s 2017 electoral landscape is the next battlefield.A second step is to reassure our European allies of our absolute commitment to NATO. American politicians tell one another to \u201cremember your base,\u201d and that\u2019s what should guide policy toward Russia. Our network of allies is not a millstone around America\u2019s neck, but a powerful asset that sets us apart.A third step is to stay sharply focused on Ukraine, a country whose fate will be critical to the future of Europe, and Russia, over the next generation. This is not about NATO or European Union membership, both distant aspirations. It is about helping Ukrainian leaders build the successful political system that Russia seeks to subvert.Finally, we should be wary of superficially appealing notions like a common war on Islamic extremism or a common effort to \u201ccontain\u201d China. Russia\u2019s bloody role in Syria makes the terrorist threat far worse and despite long-term concerns about a rising China, Mr. Putin has little inclination to sacrifice a relationship with Beijing.I\u2019ve learned a few lessons during my diplomatic career, often the hard way. I learned to respect Russians and their history and vitality. I learned that it rarely pays to neglect or underestimate Russia, or display gratuitous disrespect. But I also learned that firmness and vigilance, and a healthy grasp of the limits of the possible, are the best way to deal with the combustible combination of grievance and insecurity that Vladimir Putin embodies. I\u2019ve learned that we have a much better hand to play with Mr. Putin than he does with us. If we play it methodically, confident in our enduring strengths, and unapologetic about our values, we can eventually build a more stable relationship, without illusions.William J. Burns is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former Deputy Secretary of State. He served as U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008.Advertisement"}

Indira left Mexico for the United States at age 6 with her parents and two younger sisters. Her mother cleaned houses when she wasn\u2019t caring for the children \u2014 there would eventually be seven of them \u2014 and her father worked in construction, and there was no money for after-school lessons or soccer clubs, let alone traveling. \u201cI\u2019d hear about trips and experiences of my white friends, and I remember thinking: I\u2019ll never go to the beach or Disney World for spring break,\u201d Indira says. Her parents told her that education was all that mattered, and she had to spend all her free time inside, reading and writing. \u201cI tell my children this country is a blessing to all the people living here,\u201d her mother told me. \u201cIf you have the opportunity to be good, it\u2019s very important to take it.\u201d Indira took this advice to heart. By the time she was in fifth grade, her reading skills had improved so much that she tested into the top reading group. By middle school, she consistently got A\u2019s, which qualified her for a celebratory school trip every time report cards came out. \u201cThey rewarded us by taking us skating or bowling,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like I was so smart, just getting the chance to go out for the whole school day with friends. That\u2019s when I said: \u2018I can make it.\u2019\u2009\u201dIndira began to throw herself into everything. At recess, she played soccer and basketball, competing so fiercely that everyone took notice. Boys usually picked other boys for their teams, and white kids tended to favor other white kids. But everyone started picking Indira. In middle school, she was on the track team, running long-distance races. Her coach was stunned by her determination. In meets, even when she won her event, she scolded herself unless she broke her previous record. After practices ended, she would keep running. \u201cI wanted to think,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d stay after practice and run and run and run.\u201dIndira remembers understanding vaguely that it wasn\u2019t just poverty that set her and her family apart. Her parents had been doctors in Mexico. She admired pictures in their dresser drawer of the two of them in their 20s standing together, tall and proud in their white coats \u2014 before they all fled the violence of drug gangs who were then taking over their home state, Guerrero. When she asked her parents why they were no longer doctors, they explained it was because they were not American citizens. It didn\u2019t make sense to Indira. Why would her father have shed that beautiful crisp white coat for the fraying pants and shirts he now wore?Soon after Indira turned 13, in 2011, she was riding home from track practice with her mother when another car sideswiped the family\u2019s Ford Expedition. The other driver, who was at fault, insisted on calling the police, according to Indira and a lawyer who assisted the family. Indira pleaded not to involve the police, explaining that her mother did not have a driver\u2019s license because she was not an American citizen. (In Georgia and most other states, undocumented immigrants cannot obtain driver\u2019s licenses.) But the driver said she needed a police report to get insurance to cover the damage to her car.A police officer arrived and asked for Indira\u2019s mother\u2019s license. When she said she did not have one \u2014 a state crime \u2014 she was told to get out of the car. Indira got out, too. She remembers two of her younger siblings sleeping in the back, one in a booster seat, one in a car seat. Two elders from the church they attended arrived to ask for mercy. She has seven children, they told the officer. He responded that he was simply enforcing the law. Indira\u2019s mother turned to her and began to cry. \u201cIndira, I don\u2019t know what is going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to take me.\u201d Indira remembers remaining strangely calm. \u201cWhen she was being handcuffed, I said: \u2018Mom, everything is going to be O.K.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cThat woke me up,\u201d Indira says. \u201cUntil then, I thought the world was happy.\u201d In fact, she now realized, it was only American citizens who seemed truly happy. \u201cIt must feel pretty good, I guess, to not have to worry about whether your family could be taken away any day.\u201dShe was distressed to discover that Georgia barred undocumented immigrants from attending its top public universities and charged them out-of-state tuition at all others \u2014 triple the rate for citizen residents. She then turned to researching financial aid and learned that Congress barred her from accessing federal Pell grants, loans, scholarships and work-study jobs \u2014 the most common forms of assistance for low-income students. At first, she greeted this as just another set of obstacles to surmount, but as time went on, she began to despair. She would retreat to the classroom of her science teacher, Teresa Leach, who had become her mentor, in need of encouragement. \u201cThere were a couple of times when I just cried to her because I was tired,\u201d she said. \u201cI questioned myself if it was all worth the effort.\u201d All the while, Indira told me, she held onto her religious conviction that God had a plan, and that she must respect it.At a college fair attended by representatives of numerous Georgia colleges, she asked admissions officers what kind of help was available for undocumented students. No one had any to offer her. She switched her focus to private colleges and was admitted to Atlanta\u2019s Agnes Scott, which she says awarded her $20,000 annually in financial aid, less than half of what she needed. She researched full-ride private scholarships and found two for undocumented students, but she was selected for neither. She was awarded seven small scholarships, which totaled $10,000, enough to go to a nearby public commuter college for only one semester at the out-of-state tuition rate.Last May, Indira attended her graduation ceremony at Gainesville High School, but she had nowhere to go next. In every picture from that day, she wears a wide smile, but she was in pain inside, particularly when she caught a glimpse of her mother in the crowd, looking distraught. Unable to bring herself to celebrate with friends, she went home to be with her family.Days later, a friend told her about a philanthropic organization called TheDream.US, which was offering undocumented students full four-year scholarships to Delaware State University or Eastern Connecticut State University. The application was demanding, and only 76 students would be chosen. She poured herself into the essays, spending hours composing them alongside an English teacher, Cindy Lloyd. She applied to Delaware State, a historically black college in Dover, five hours closer to home than Eastern Connecticut. In late June, she received an email from TheDream.US. \u201cI saw \u2018Congratulations,\u2019\u2009\u201d she remembers, \u201cand I read no more.\u201dIn late August, Indira made the 11-hour drive with her parents from Gainesville to Delaware State in unusual silence. She was thinking hard about each of her six younger siblings, wondering how they would fare without her. Over breakfast at a Cracker Barrel in South Carolina, when her mother pressed her about how she was feeling, she talked only of her concerns about not being at home to help everyone. When she arrived on campus \u2014 a flat expanse of grassy courtyards and buildings amid strip malls, auto dealers and chain restaurants just beyond Dover\u2019s historic capital area \u2014 she found 33 other \u201copportunity scholars,\u201d just as worried and hopeful as she was. All of them were assigned to a dorm about a quarter of a mile from the D.S.U. campus, a former Sheraton hotel acquired a few years earlier by the university as part of an expansion. They bonded instantly, traveling as a posse from classes to the library to the cafeteria, often ending up together late at night in the dorm lobby or in a lounge that had been a large hotel suite on the second floor.While most of the students are 18 or 19, typical for college freshmen, some have worked for years in hopes of one day saving enough for college. Olivia Bekale, who is 27 and grew up in Baton Rouge, arrived in Louisiana from Gabon as a child. She graduated from high school in 2008 with a 3.9 G.P.A. from the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, a prestigious state-supported boarding school for top achievers. Unable to afford college, she cycled from one low-wage position to the next \u2014 server at the Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant; retail sales consultant for Sprint; customer-service agent for Marriott; pharmacy tech for Walgreens. Olivia, who had wanted to be a doctor since an aunt died of AIDS when she was 5, had been out of high school for eight years when she learned of the opportunity scholarship; she applied immediately.All but one of the students were enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Created in 2012 by an Obama-administration executive action, DACA allowed teenagers and young adults who came to the United States illegally as children with their parents to register with the government and in turn receive a two-year renewable protection against deportation, along with work permits and Social Security numbers. Most of the students, like Indira, signed up at age 15, as soon as they were eligible. With DACA, Indira, who is now 18, was able to get a driver\u2019s license and a job at a Publix supermarket when she was in high school, working 20 hours a week as a cashier and bagger. Being able to work and drive legally, free of the fears her mother faced, and fitting in with her classmates, Indira says, was \u201cliving the American dream.\u201d With her income from Publix, she even was able to get braces for her teeth.Undocumented children poured into the nation\u2019s schools over the next generation, and as they reached college age, they coalesced into a movement, advocating access to higher education as well as full citizenship. In 2001, they began calling themselves Dreamers, now an estimated 2.1 million young immigrants who have grown up as Americans in almost every way except for their passports. The name came from the Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors), introduced in Congress in 2001 by Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, and for which activists fought for over a decade. The measure, which would have put undocumented children on a path to citizenship, never passed, but the vast network of Dreamers became a compelling political force.In 2001, hundreds of them turned out to testify in Texas in favor of legislation to allow undocumented residents to pay in-state college tuition if they graduated from Texas high schools and lived in the state for three years. \u201cSomething magical happened when those kids told their stories,\u201d says the former Texas state representative Rick Noriega, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. \u201cIt was a humanizing of a very real issue dealing with children\u2019s dreams and hopes. Every heart on that committee was touched, Republicans and Democrats.\u201d The legislation passed both houses almost unanimously and was signed by Rick Perry, then governor of Texas and now President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for energy secretary. Texas became the first state, followed quickly by California, to allow Dreamers to pay in-state tuition. Today, 21 states charge Dreamers the same tuition as legal residents, including six carried by Trump \u2014 Florida, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Texas.In many of those states, however, the once-bipartisan issue has turned politically treacherous. In Texas, efforts to repeal the tuition law come closer to passing every year, and Noriega says there is no chance the original measure would pass today. The leading national opponents of in-state tuition for Dreamers include the Republican senator Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general, and the secretary of state of Kansas, Kris Kobach, a Republican who was a leader of Trump\u2019s transition team on immigration. Each argues that students who are in the United States illegally should not get a public benefit in any state that is denied to a citizen from another state. In other words, if Dreamers pay in-state tuition in Texas, citizen students next door in Arkansas and Oklahoma \u2014 or Massachusetts, for that matter \u2014 should have the same right. \u201cHow much sense does that make, to have people here illegally, and they have more benefits than those who are here legally?\u201d Sessions asked in a Senate floor statement. Kobach used the same argument to bring class-action lawsuits against in-state tuition for Dreamers in Kansas and California. Judges found no legal basis for the claims and dismissed the cases.The larger debate over how to treat an estimated 11 million immigrants who came here illegally has been at a stalemate for decades, with advocates seeking a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d for law-abiding families who have been in the country for years and opponents denouncing \u201camnesty\u201d for people who broke the law to enter the country. Amid hardening resistance in Congress to immigration reform, Dreamers brought pressure on Obama \u2014 including sit-ins and hunger strikes at his 2012 campaign offices \u2014 to use his executive power to create DACA. The program, announced on June 15, 2012, the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s Plyler decision, proved transformative for Dreamers. They have entered college, taken on-the-books jobs, received driver\u2019s licenses, bought cars. They now fly on planes, passing effortlessly through airport security. They still lack legal immigration status, but no longer are they exactly undocumented. \u201cDACAmented,\u201d many have called themselves.Even in states where they pay in-state tuition, Dreamers still struggle to afford college because they are disproportionately low-income and have no access to federal financial aid. Fewer than 10 percent of Dreamers who graduate from high school enroll in college. At a time when college graduates earn 70 percent more than those without degrees, these numbers conjure the 1982 warning by the Supreme Court that undocumented children could become a permanent underclass.In response, a handful of philanthropies have adopted the cause of sending students with DACA status to college. The biggest of these, TheDream.US, has raised $90 million to eventually finance 4,000 students at public colleges, with significant contributions from Donald Graham, former publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, and his family; Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan; Bill and Melinda Gates; the hedge-fund executive William Ackman; and Michael Bloomberg, among others. (I was a reporter at The Washington Post from 1980 to 2008.) In 2014, TheDream.US began offering Dreamers full scholarships in states that charge them in-state tuition. Last year, in partnership with Delaware and Connecticut, the organization created the opportunity-scholarship program for students from the other 29 states, financed by $41 million in philanthropy from Graham and his family and two anonymous donors. The governors of Delaware and Connecticut agreed to charge roughly in-state tuition rates for the 34 scholars at Delaware State and the 42 at Eastern Connecticut State \u2014 a total of $80,000 per student for tuition, room and board for four years. In an effort to pre-empt political opposition, Graham says, the philanthropy works only with schools, like Delaware State and Eastern Connecticut State, that have excess capacity, so that undocumented students are not displacing citizens. And private donors pay all expenses, so that no state dollars are spent.Still, when The Delaware State News ran an article in September about the D.S.U. opportunity scholars, the online comments complained that undocumented immigrants, not citizens, were benefiting. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t perfect, but I will vote for him because he puts Americans FIRST,\u201d wrote a reader named John Huff of Magnolia, Del. \u201cThere are plenty of kids who are citizens who have the same dream and should come first.\u201d And as news of the scholarship spread on the Delaware campus this fall, a number of African-American students told Dreamers that they resented that their own families had to go into debt for a portion of their education costs while the DACA students got full scholarships.By then, Trump had mobilized anti-immigrant anger in large swaths of the country, having kicked off his campaign criticizing Mexican immigrants \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u201d \u2014 and vowing to build a wall on the border to keep them out. In stump speeches, he promised to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and, in his first 100 days in office, to terminate DACA, labeling it \u201cillegal amnesty.\u201d Both vows became instant applause lines.Separation from family, from home, even from Mexican food made most of the opportunity scholars profoundly lonely. Estephany Martinez, a petite criminal-justice major with long black hair, couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her sisters in the first weeks. \u201cWhenever we came home from school, all four sisters would sit in the living room and do our homework and talk and watch TV,\u201d she recalled wistfully of her life in Winder, Ga. In Delaware, \u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody that cared for me. I didn\u2019t have anyone to come home to.\u201d In early September, she summoned all the scholars to a gathering in the dorm\u2019s second-floor lounge. \u201cAll right, you guys, we\u2019re going to be here for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cThat part of our lives \u2014 being undocumented \u2014 is critical to who we are. We have to share our stories.\u201d Everyone crowded in, sitting on the sofa, spilling onto the floor, sitting shoulder to shoulder on counters that once were part of a kitchenette, sprawling into one another\u2019s space.Carlos Gonzales of Manteo, N.C., a lanky and cheerful marketing major whose mother is a restaurant cook, broke down crying when he recalled the violence that drove his family from Mexico City. He, his mother and his younger sister moved to North Carolina when he was 7. It was his mother who encouraged him, beginning in elementary school, to reach for college. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to live the life we\u2019re living now,\u201d she told him. In high school, he was an honor student and varsity wrestler and runner, working nights and weekends at McDonald\u2019s in his Outer Banks town. When he received the email telling him he was an opportunity scholar, he said: \u201cI hugged my mom and cried for two hours. The only reason I stopped was I had to go to work.\u201dIndira told the harrowing story that led to her own family\u2019s departure from Mexico. In 2004, when she was 6, three masked gunmen broke into their home, which housed her parents\u2019 clinic, and robbed them of everything \u2014 money, jewelry, a new computer, a television, cameras and medications. They filed a report with the police, they said, who didn\u2019t investigate, in deference to cartels then taking over Guerrero, now the most violent state in Mexico. An uncle of her father\u2019s already had been killed. In subsequent years, a cousin of her mother\u2019s, a veterinarian, was kidnapped and never found. Two nephews disappeared. Her mother\u2019s sister has been kidnapped twice \u2014 most recently this past November \u2014 and returned only after her family paid steep ransoms.Weeks after the robbery, Indira\u2019s family of five arrived in the United States on a tourist visa that her father procured a month earlier in hopes of taking everyone to Disney World. Instead, they went to Gainesville, where her father\u2019s brother worked in construction \u2014 one of thousands of Mexican workers who flocked to the north Georgia community in the last 25 years, swelling the Hispanic population to more than 40 percent in 2013 from 8 percent in 1990. Indira said her parents are certain they would have been killed had they stayed. They decided to forfeit their careers for their family\u2019s safety. \u201cI no longer saw my future, but I saw my children\u2019s future,\u201d her father said to me.Antonio Patino, a computer-science major who is a lifeguard and plays bass and guitar in his spare time, told the group about riding with his family in their car in 2015 in Lawrenceville, Ga., when a police officer pulled them over, though none of them understood why. His father, who is undocumented and processes returns for a local manufacturer, was driving but did not have a license. Antonio and his mother, younger sister and brother all watched in terror as his father was handcuffed, placed in a police cruiser and driven off to jail. As it turned out, he was released the next day after paying a fine of more than $800 and was not referred to immigration court for further proceedings, but the incident shook Antonio\u2019s sense of belonging in America. \u201cI felt like I got slapped in the face just for living, trying to be a normal person in this beautiful country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like a hole inside me.\u201d He said he now found himself gripped with fears for his parents\u2019 safety at random moments during his days at D.S.U. It is as if he has swapped roles with his mother and father. \u201cLike I\u2019m now the parent and they\u2019re the child, and I\u2019m worried for them,\u201d he told me. \u201cNot being there, all these what-ifs swarm into my mind. What if out of nowhere they get pulled over again?\u201d Calling them and hearing their voices usually comforts him. But after one such call, he said: \u201cI went outside, and I had to cry a little. I was feeling like I couldn\u2019t help them.\u201dA number of students shared the enormous sacrifices they had seen their parents make for them. Juan Chavez, 23, who grew up in Plymouth, Ind., and worked for five years after high school, told of his mother suffering a breakdown after her divorce from his father. He saw it as a response to the crushing instability of their lives, moving from one home to another in search of shelter. \u201cShe\u2019s the strongest person I\u2019ll ever know,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my role model. My father figure as well as my mother.\u201d He continued: \u201cI felt so helpless to make things better. I decided almost right then I\u2019ll go to college and medical school if it takes me the rest of my life.\u201d He is now a psychology and pre-med major, intending to become a psychiatrist.On and on the students went until almost 3 a.m., the common threads in their stories drawing them closer. It was the first time most of them had talked openly about being undocumented, but instead of feeling exposed, they felt safer. Until then, Antonio had gone out of his way to avoid conversations with non-Dreamers at D.S.U. about his scholarship, not wanting to have to explain that he got it because he was undocumented. The next day, though, he fell into conversation with a student who asked him how he happened to come all the way from Georgia to D.S.U., and he said without hesitation: \u201cI got a scholarship.\u201d\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m undocumented,\u201d Antonio said, surprised at how comfortable this felt.\u201cO.K., man, that\u2019s cool,\u201d the student said.After their long night talking, the scholars also better understood what had propelled them all for as long as they could remember. Throughout high school, the opportunity scholars watched undocumented friends and siblings give up and drop out, shamed and beaten down by public scorn over illegal immigration and the dead-end options awaiting even those who excelled in high school. But they kept on striving, steeled to the insults, positioning themselves for a breakthrough they couldn\u2019t yet see. Now this all made sense. \u201cThis pain \u2014 it pushes us,\u201d Estephany said. \u201cIt\u2019s motivation. It has made me who I am. It makes me go through every day.\u201d\u201cNow we know what drives us,\u201d Indira said.A similar scene unfolded that morning in the ultramodern science center, in computational-thinking class, where Antonio and Jose Reyes Rios, another computer-science major, sat front and center with an African-American classmate named Hanqaamo Lintisio, who is from Maryland and has a track scholarship. The three had formed a study group and tutored one another so effectively that they all scored above 100 on the midterm. (They nailed the bonus question.) Theirs were the only A\u2019s in the class.The Dreamers gather daily at a long Formica table in a D.S.U. cafeteria for food and conversation. At lunch, Carla Moreno propped her English composition textbook, \u201cPatterns for College Writing,\u201d against a napkin holder, securing it with an apple. She paged through a chapter while eating her salad and chili dog. \u201cIt\u2019s just a quiz,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I want to keep my A.\u201d\u201cI deal with a lot of students, and I feel like the Dreamers are at a different level,\u201d says Kevin Noriega, the adviser for their scholarships. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got to make this happen because it\u2019s my only option.\u2019\u2009\u201d Of the 488 scholars funded by TheDream.US who began college in 2014, 94 percent remain enrolled after their sophomore year; research shows that only 66 percent of low-income college students nationally return after one year. \u201cThis is a low-income population with retention rates like Harvard\u2019s,\u201d Donald Graham says. Because beneficiaries of TheDream.US have full rides, they avoid a common problem faced by other disadvantaged students: running short of money for costs not covered by Pell grants or other forms of aid.One night in October before a biology exam, Indira went to the D.S.U. athletic center for a workout to relieve stress. She was armed with a stack of homemade flash cards and her iPhone, on which she had downloaded discussions of test topics from various websites. While pounding out three miles on the treadmill, she flipped through her study cards, then plugged in her earbuds for a YouTube lecture on glycolysis. Returning to her dorm, she sat down at her desk for a final review. Hanging on the wall in front of her was a collage of family photographs. One showed the whole family of nine around their dinner table. \u201cWhen I\u2019m struggling, I look at a picture of my mom or dad, and I say, \u2018I\u2019m working for that person,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. That night, her studying complete, she took a last look at her parents\u2019 picture and fell asleep listening to recordings of her biology professor\u2019s lectures. She got an A on the exam.Such unsinkable optimism, which I heard from many D.S.U. Dreamers in the early fall, is hard to maintain, and many of the estimated 65,000 undocumented immigrants who graduate from high school every year \u2014 and thousands who drop out \u2014 simply can\u2019t muster it. In a recent book, \u201cLives in Limbo,\u201d Roberto G. Gonzales, an assistant professor at Harvard\u2019s graduate school of education, writes that academically successful Dreamers are far outnumbered by those who become casualties of \u201cthe deeper and more far-reaching consequences of being undocumented: living in poverty, having parents and family members who also bear the burdens of being undocumented, watching friends moving forward but being unable to join them, watching opportunities pass you by, navigating a world of exclusions while constantly looking over your shoulder.\u201dAt least some of the opportunity scholars\u2019 optimism last fall came from their assumption, based on reported polls, that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. They were heartened by her speeches about keeping families together and pursuing comprehensive immigration reform. At the very least, they were confident that DACA would remain in effect under her leadership. Though they didn\u2019t believe Trump could win, he unnerved them with his speeches branding Mexicans criminals who stole Americans\u2019 jobs and lived off their tax dollars. They took this rhetoric as a personal affront and were horrified by the hatred they saw on the faces of those who cheered his words. \u201cThe only thing that depresses me is so many people support him,\u201d Jose Reyes Rios, the computer-science major, who aspires to work at Google one day, said in late September.On election night, a group of Dreamers gathered around the flat-screen TV in the dorm lobby, many of them studying as they watched returns. Indira had exams the next day in math and biology and arrived equipped with her flash cards. The mood turned dark after Trump won Florida. Everyone\u2019s mind flooded with his vows that they had discounted until now \u2014 to revoke DACA, to deputize local police departments to enforce federal immigration laws. \u201cWe will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings,\u201d Trump said last summer in Arizona. As all of them knew well, these crimes included one of their parents\u2019 daily activities \u2014 driving without a license. If DACA disappeared, and with it their Social Security numbers, their own driver\u2019s licenses would be worthless. So would their federal work authorization, meaning most would lose the jobs that paid for their books, phones, clothes, travel home and anything else they needed.By 1 a.m., Indira became too distressed to concentrate. Olivia Bekale was one of four opportunity scholars who watched until Trump was declared the president-elect. \u201cWe were just looking at each other and crying,\u201d she says. \u201cWe hugged each other and went to our rooms.\u201dSocial media brought aftershocks for all of them as they discovered that many of their best friends voted for Trump. Almost all of Antonio\u2019s high-school swim teammates in Lawrenceville had Trump filters on their Facebook and Snapchat profile pictures. \u201cAll I could think was: You voted against me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did I do to you?\u201dThe day after the election, Indira couldn\u2019t bear to call her mother until the afternoon. Instead, she confided her fears in text messages to her former science teacher, Teresa Leach. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so disappointed in this country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so powerless. ... I\u2019m scared about my family, my mom. ... Not sure if I\u2019ll even get my degree, much less go to medical school here.\u201d When Indira finally did call home, her mother insisted she was not afraid and told Indira that education was now even more important.Several of Indira\u2019s friends back home told her they doubted Trump would follow through on all his campaign promises, and in any case, they couldn\u2019t imagine he would target her. \u201cThese are people who helped me get to where I am, who remind me they love me, and I love them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll never understand what we feel. They say, \u2018He won\u2019t do that.\u2019 Do they think he\u2019s going to send back all the immigrants except Indira?\u201dA lifeline of sorts arrived the week after the election, when the students received letters from TheDream.US, Governor Markell and the president of D.S.U., pledging to stand behind their scholarships no matter what became of DACA. Donald Graham lined up attorneys to represent them if anyone challenged their right to be in school.But their bigger fears were for their parents. Antonio and Indira went home for Christmas to find their families filled with trepidation. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be invisible, trying to stay hidden,\u201d Antonio\u2019s father said, \u201cdo only the things we have to do to live, like go to work, go buy groceries.\u201d During the 2015 holiday season, they took a driving tour of the Christmas lights and celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve in downtown Lawrenceville. \u201cNow we can\u2019t go to any festivities because for us it\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d his mother told me in their apartment in a complex in Buford, Ga. \u201cThere are a lot of police there.\u201dAntonio\u2019s father said he worries about driving his daughter, Litzy, 15, home from her swim-team practice at rush hour, when the police presence increases. Litzy was born in Georgia, and he thought of asking her to leave the team until she is old enough to drive because, as a citizen, she will be able to get a driver\u2019s license. \u201cBut then I said to myself: \u2018No! That\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here \u2014 for our kids. So they can take advantage of every opportunity.\u2019\u2009\u201d He continues to ferry her \u2014 carefully \u2014 during rush hour.Indira found her mother more frightened than at any time since receiving her deportation order. Her mother says she has no choice but to drive when someone at her church asks for help, when her children call for rides home and when she is needed at a charity medical clinic where she volunteers as a doctor\u2019s assistant and translator. \u201cLife changed after the election,\u201d she told me in December, in her living room decorated with framed academic awards for each child. She was surrounded by her kids, who listened carefully. \u201cThe children know I don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. They know at any time maybe the police will take me again. \u2018If I can\u2019t come back,\u2019 I tell them, \u2018you have to go to school every day. You have to study hard \u2014 even harder.\u2019\u2009\u201dEstephany Martinez focused on her life\u2019s mission. \u201cMy goal is being a police chief \u2014 something that makes my voice louder,\u201d said the criminal-justice major. \u201cI have to educate myself to get there. I want to show people who don\u2019t believe in us: \u2018I got all the way here. I\u2019m starting from the bottom with education, and I\u2019m going to get there.\u2019\u2009\u201dAs they settled into the semester, they monitored everything Trump and his close allies were saying about immigration, their moods shifting with each utterance. Back in December, they felt hopeful when Trump, in his interview as Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year, said approving things about Dreamers and indicated that he would deport serious criminals before other undocumented immigrants. They were discouraged in January when Jeff Sessions, in his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, appeared unconcerned about the consequences of revoking DACA. They took heart two days later when Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, said in a CNN town-hall meeting that he wanted Congress to pass legislation making Dreamers \u201cright with the law.\u201dSoon after classes started, the opportunity scholars learned that their collective grade point average for the first semester was a 3.76. Six of the 34 students had achieved a perfect 4.0. Indira was one of them. \u201cSucceeding for me is how I can get my revenge,\u201d she told me over the phone, interrupting her biology homework for a few minutes. \u201cI want to break the stereotype of us being here taking jobs away and not helping the economy. I want Trump to see we\u2019re the total opposite of what he thinks.\u201dDale Russakoff is a freelance writer and the author of \u201cThe Prize: Who\u2019s in Charge of America\u2019s Schools.\u201d This is her first article for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Super Bowl Returns to a Transformed Houston", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetThe Houston that awaits nearly 140,000 Super Bowl visitors and millions of television viewers is the result of an ambitious effort aimed at turning the city into a world-class destination. In contrast to its past reputation as an urban dead zone after dark, Houston now includes a greater array of restaurants, high-rises, green space, and cultural and entertainment venues.\u201cThey are in for a big positive surprise,\u201d Mayor Sylvester Turner said of out-of-towners who may still have an earlier perception of Houston.Houston, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city, is continuing to struggle with the aftershocks of a two-year economic downturn caused by a plunge in oil prices. There is a widespread belief that the economy is showing signs of improvement, but most experts project a long and slow recovery.Per-barrel prices dropped to a low of $26 in February last year, from an oil-boom peak of $108 in June 2014, before starting to swing upward, hammering Texas and other energy-producing states.Energy companies in Houston abruptly shifted from expansion to retrenchment, slashing more than 70,000 energy-related jobs while bowing out of planned projects, consolidating resources and dumping unneeded property.Oil and gas companies based downtown or along the \u201cEnergy Corridor\u201d \u2014 a mileslong stretch of Interstate 10 west of downtown \u2014 scrambled to jettison excess space by vacating offices or by subleasing to other tenants at appealing rates.The economic turbulence reflects Houston\u2019s vulnerability as a world oil capital and has stirred reminders of a devastating crash in the 1980s. Prices plunged to as low as $9 per barrel in 1986, causing the Houston economy to collapse and ultimately claiming more than 221,000 jobs.Houston residents have found some solace in that the latest round of hardships is less severe than what occurred 30 years ago. The city has become more economically diverse and is no longer solely dependent on oil prices and rig counts to stay afloat. Continued overall job growth \u2014 though far lower than in the days of $100-a-barrel oil prices \u2014 has produced guarded optimism.\u201cEvery other time energy has crashed, the world stopped,\u201d said Stuart Showers, the director of research at Transwestern, a Houston-based real estate company. \u201cBut we still have positive growth. We still continue to move forward.\u201d\u201cI think many people will agree that things have kind of bottomed out,\u201d Mayor Turner said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly coming back.\u201dSingle-family home building remains strong, real estate experts say, but a glut in office and apartment developments, largely a result of the boom-to-bust turnabout in energy, has raised fears of substantial cuts in construction jobs. A surplus of apartment units has created what real estate experts describe as a renter\u2019s market, as landlords offer discounts and other concessions to lure tenants.A series of voter-approved initiatives starting in the 1990s and accelerating in the 21st century included the expansion of the light rail, new professional sports stadiums and the development of more than 3,000 acres of green space along Houston\u2019s famous bayous.The urban overhaul intensified after Houston\u2019s last Super Bowl, in 2004, and helped lead to the city\u2019s selection in 2013 to be host of Super Bowl 51.This year\u2019s contest, between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons, will be played at NRG Stadium, less than eight miles from downtown, and is expected to generate a net economic windfall for Houston of more than $350 million. Mr. Turner said the tax revenue could be a \u201chuge stimulant\u201d for the city\u2019s economy.\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to have the spotlight on us but in terms of what it\u2019s really leveraging for regular folks, unfortunately, there\u2019s not much of a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no trickle-down.\u201d She called on city leaders to steer the revenue toward low-income communities that \u201cneed it the most.\u201dCity planners have spent more than two years beautifying the city for the Super Bowl and wrapping up construction projects, most of which were begun before energy prices crashed.A major catalyst for Houston\u2019s downtown transformation was the 2008 opening of Discovery Green, a 12-acre park that replaced two parking lots to become one of the city\u2019s most popular recreational and entertainment destinations.Located just across from the convention center and within walking distance of the two convention hotels, Discovery Green will anchor a 10-day festival, Super Bowl LIVE, which is expected to draw more than one million people in the buildup to the game.An increasing number of downtown residential units, spawned in part by city tax incentives to developers, has drawn thousands of Houstonians to live in the central city.The progression of improvements serves as evidence of \u201ca city reinventing itself in ways that would have been inconceivable\u201d in an earlier era, Mr. Klineberg said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "State Dept. Dissent Cable on Trump\u2019s Ban Draws 1,000 Signatures", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 It started out in Washington.Then it went to Jakarta. Then across Africa.One version even showed up on Facebook.The cable wended its way through dozens of American embassies around the world, quickly emerging as one of the broadest protests by American officials against their president\u2019s policies. And it is not over yet.By 4 p.m. on Tuesday, the letter had attracted around 1,000 signatures, State Department officials said, far more than any dissent cable in recent years. It was being delivered to management, and department officials said more diplomats wanted to add their names to it.The State Department has 7,600 Foreign Service officers and 11,000 civil servants.The letter had been evolving since this weekend, when the first draft emerged. It was edited as it moved along, with some diplomats adding words and others striking out passages.For example, one diplomat suggested this sentence should simply end on \u201clasting shame\u201d: \u201cThe decision to restrict the freedom of Japanese-Americans in the United States and foreign nationals who wanted to travel to or settle in the United States during the 1940s has been a source of lasting shame for many in our country.\u201dSome officials who were trying to sign the document on Tuesday said it was not clear who was in charge or who was collecting signatures. The letter was passed through official State Department email accounts and on government time \u2014 several diplomats said union rules allowed them to work on dissent memos on the clock.The letter, which harshly took apart the executive order, said the visa ban would \u201calienate allies\u201d and \u201churt America economically.\u201d Foreign travelers inject nearly $250 billion into the American economy, the letter said, supporting more than one million jobs.Some diplomats said they joined the dissent by sending an email saying \u201cI\u2019m in\u201d or \u201cPlease add my name as a signer\u201d along with their full name, title, position and post.The letter was apparently circulated through informal networks of diplomats and not through any State Department-wide email list. One diplomat on vacation in the United States said he received the letter from a colleague in another part of the world who was not connected to the drafters and was simply passing it along.The diplomat predicted that hundreds of other diplomats would be eager to sign it if they could, but because of the complications of figuring out where the dissent memo originally came from, he was not sure how many would actually sign it.Most people in the State Department have never seen anything like this, the diplomat said. He said dissent memos were reserved for major policy issues, not for little grumbles like bad food in the embassy cafeteria.That diplomat also requested anonymity, saying that Foreign Service officers were not supposed to criticize American policy publicly and that he did not want to open himself up to accusations that he had violated the rules. That could threaten his job, he said, especially in such a polarized environment.This is exactly what the dissent channel, as it is called, was intended for.Starting in 1971 during the Vietnam War, the channel encourages department officials to voice their criticisms internally through a process of sending a memo or a cable to the secretary of state expressing their concerns and suggesting solutions. The final part of the visa ban memo lays out detailed alternatives, including increased vetting for specific nationalities.But however officially tolerated, several veteran diplomats said dissent was still risky. When it comes to ambassadorships, the selection process is highly competitive \u2014 and highly subjective \u2014 and the diplomats said it would be impossible to prove why someone had been blocked from a coveted post. Previous dissent could easily be used against the person.Some State Department officials said on Tuesday that they would not sign the letter because of those risks. While one said he disagreed with the visa ban, he considered it his job to enforce American government policies whether or not he agreed with them.Other diplomats said the letter did not mean that dissenters would disobey the visa ban. The intent was to try to change the policy so the ban would be lifted, they said.The diplomat who said he would not use a dissent memo to complain about cafeteria food said that he had been torn when the United States invaded Iraq because he was strongly against the war, but that he did not know how to express his concern.He said he was just starting out at the time.The visa ban, he said, \u201cwas such obviously bad policy\u201d that he was trying to find a way to sign the dissent letter.He also said that many diplomats were using the letter as a vehicle to express broader concerns about the way the Trump administration has appeared to sideline the State Department.The diplomat spoke in defense of refugees, saying that the tiny percentage from, say, Somalia who had been approved for resettlement in the United States had been scrutinized by several agencies and were among the most vulnerable of very vulnerable people. Now, many are stuck in limbo in transit centers.He called that \u201cbullying at the highest levels.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zimbabwe Stands Still as President Vacations Off the Grid", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 It was an urgent matter for President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe: His approval was needed so that a loyal supporter who had just died could be buried at a cemetery for national heroes.But with Mr. Mugabe off on his extended annual holiday in Asia this month, it took the acting president a couple of days to track him down, en route from Beijing to his Asian base in Singapore.\u201cI phoned the president telling him about the death, and he told me that he had learned about it through the first lady, who had read about it on the internet,\u201d said the acting president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, one of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s two vice presidents.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays are one of the unusual aspects of the rhythms of political life in Harare, the capital of this southern African nation. Every year, from mid-December through the end of January, Mr. Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years with a tight grip, seemingly releases it. He vanishes in Asia, going off grid, becoming at times unreachable to his own deputies.A couple of years ago, one of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s sons posted photos on Instagram showing the family at a high-end Japanese restaurant in Singapore, apparently enjoying teppanyaki. But the Mugabes have otherwise remained discreet about their holiday activities, sensitive perhaps to criticism back home that they are wasting public money while government coffers are nearly empty.So committed has Mr. Mugabe been to staying away from Zimbabwe that even when he interrupts his long Asian holiday with an official trip to an African nation \u2014 as he did in mid-January by traveling to Mali \u2014 the presidential plane, Air Zimbabwe Flight 1, has made a beeline right back to Asia.In Harare, government decisions, big and small, are put off. It\u2019s a slow month and half for political journalists, even as rumors fill the vacuum. But even in Mr. Mugabe\u2019s absence, the grip of the only leader Zimbabwe has ever known never really loosens.\u201cWhen Mugabe goes on holiday, he goes on holiday with the state,\u201d said Pedzisai Ruhanya, a political analyst and the director of the Zimbabwe Democracy Institute, a research group. \u201cMugabe\u2019s behavior is inconsistent with practices in other countries, with general state practices. This is kind of strange.\u201dThis time, Mr. Mugabe left for Asia immediately after his party\u2019s annual conference in mid-December, which was dominated by his wife, Grace Mugabe, 51. Mr. Mugabe, the world\u2019s oldest head of state, who will be 93 in February, slept through most of the conference but was selected as his party\u2019s candidate in next year\u2019s presidential election.His party is increasingly divided by fighting over succession, and Mr. Mugabe has lost the support of longtime allies like veterans of the country\u2019s war of liberation. Zimbabwe\u2019s financial state remains so precarious that government workers were paid late in December, after Christmas, and have yet to receive their year-end bonuses.\u201cUnder normal circumstances, when things are not O.K. in your house, you wouldn\u2019t leave for such a long time,\u201d said John Masuku, a journalist who worked for 27 years at the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, including as a presidential correspondent.And yet, even in increasingly frail health, Mr. Mugabe has not cut short his annual holidays. The reality, allies and rivals alike say, is that he has secured the loyalty of the political class through patronage, eviscerated the opposition and installed relatives and close associates in important posts in the army and the police. Unlike less-secure strongmen who rarely venture abroad, Mr. Mugabe sticks to his annual routine, leaving Zimbabwe at the same time every year, and he has even lengthened his holidays in recent years.\u201cHe feels quite comfortable,\u201d said Rugare Gumbo, who was a longtime ally of Mr. Mugabe and is now in the opposition. \u201cNo one can take a chance by raising any controversial issue because he would be accused of trying to overthrow the old man.\u201dIndeed, when Mr. Mnangagwa, the acting president, was shown recently in Facebook photos holding a mug with the words, \u201cI Am the Boss,\u201d the attacks against him by party rivals were immediate and relentless. Accused of wanting to push Mr. Mugabe aside, Mr. Mnangagwa had to issue a statement to the contrary.Mr. Mugabe, a well-known Anglophile, used to spend his annual holidays in London or elsewhere in Europe. But sanctions imposed by Western governments after the seizure of white-owned farms in 2000 pushed the Mugabes to look elsewhere.The Mugabes have vacationed in Malaysia and Hong Kong as well as in the Middle East, mostly in Dubai. But Mr. Mugabe has settled in recent years on Singapore, which, in addition to having excellent Japanese food, has a leading medical tourism industry \u2014 and, perhaps most important, is a former British colony.\u201cHe finds it congenial to be in a former British colony than in any other country,\u201d Mr. Gumbo said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get pleasure in London, you might as well get it in its colonies.\u201dWith Mr. Mugabe gone, neither the government nor the ruling party bothers to hold high-level meetings.\u201cWe didn\u2019t hold cabinet meetings in Mugabe\u2019s absence because he is the one who chairs the meetings,\u201d said Didymus Mutasa, who served as a minister to Mr. Mugabe for many years and is now in the opposition. \u201cWhen Mugabe goes on leave, some of his ministers also go on leave.\u201dTendai Biti, an opposition leader who served as finance minister in a coalition government from 2009 to 2013, said that Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays have long been a drain on Zimbabwe\u2019s finances. In a system established before independence, government officials traveling overseas are given hard currency, usually American dollars, upon authorization from the Finance Ministry, Mr. Biti said.During Mr. Biti\u2019s tenure, Mr. Mugabe typically asked for $3 million for his annual holidays, and Mr. Biti said he authorized from $800,000 to $1.2 million.\u201cThe money comes as cash,\u201d Mr. Biti said. \u201cBut whether they put it in suitcases or whatever, I don\u2019t know. That was not my job.\u201dUnspent money \u2014 from Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays or his frequent trips outside Zimbabwe \u2014 is not returned to the state.\u201cIt has become a vehicle for looting,\u201d Mr. Biti said.Most high-ranking government and ruling party officials refused to comment on Mr. Mugabe\u2019s annual holidays.But Tshinga Dube, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s minister for war veterans, said that he carried out his duties the same way whether Mr. Mugabe was in or out of the country. Describing himself as an \u201cambassador\u201d serving under \u201ca Julius Caesar,\u201d Mr. Dube said, \u201cYou cannot do things differently just because he is not there.\u201dAsked about popular criticism that Mr. Mugabe is out of touch by taking such long and costly holidays while the country\u2019s economy teeters, Mr. Dube said that it was \u201ca matter of personal opinion.\u201d\u201cIt is very difficult,\u201d he added, \u201cto talk, to comment about your boss, especially on issues that relate to his health, his age, and things of that nature.\u201dJeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Norimitsu Onishi from Johannesburg.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korean Defector Says Kim Jong-Un\u2019s Control Is Crumbling", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The highest-ranking defector from North Korea in years said on Wednesday that the days of the country\u2019s leadership were \u201cnumbered,\u201d and that its attempts to control outside information were not working because of corruption and discontent.\u201cI am sure that more defections of my colleagues will take place, since North Korea is already on a slippery slope,\u201d the defector, Thae Yong-ho, said during a news conference in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. \u201cThe traditional structures of the North Korean system are crumbling.\u201dMr. Thae\u2019s diagnosis of Mr. Kim\u2019s rule is hardly new. Defectors from the North, as well as some conservative analysts and policy makers in the South, widely share that view. Still, it signaled a drastic change of roles for Mr. Thae.Before his defection, he was a career diplomat, fluent in English, who had served in Britain, Denmark and Sweden, often delivering passionate speeches glorifying the Kim family that has ruled North Korea for seven decades. In the South, Mr. Thae, now affiliated with the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank arm of the National Intelligence Service, has vowed to spend the rest of his life trying to bring down the North Korean government.The former diplomat said he had come up with a detailed plan for his defection, first ensuring that his two sons joined him and his wife in London. (North Korean diplomats are required to leave a child in the North, a measure intended to prevent their defection.) He declined to reveal details of his defection plan and the circumstances.The day Mr. Thae broached his plan for defection with his sons, he told them that he wanted to break the \u201cchain of slavery\u201d for them, he recalled. They wanted to know if they would have free access to the internet, books and movies in the South, he said.The best way to force change in the isolated North, he continued, is to disseminate outside information there to help ordinary citizens eventually rebel. South Korean TV dramas and movies smuggled from China are already popular in the North, he said.Another sign of Mr. Kim\u2019s weakening control, Mr. Thae said, is evident at the unofficial markets in North Korea where women trade goods, mostly smuggled from China. The vendors used to be called \u201cgrasshoppers\u201d because they would pack and flee whenever they saw the police approaching. Now, they are called \u201cticks\u201d because they refuse to budge, demanding a right to make a living, Mr. Thae said.Such resistance, even if small in scale, is unprecedented, he added.The spread of outside news and market activities could eventually doom Mr. Kim because his government \u201ccan be held in place and maintained only by idolizing Kim Jong-un like a god,\u201d Mr. Thae said. \u201cIf he tries to introduce a market-oriented economy to North Korean society, then there will be no place for Kim Jong-un in North Korea, and he knows that.\u201dBut the leader\u2019s efforts to clamp down on information and products from outside North Korea have been unsuccessful because the police accept bribes in exchange for freeing smugglers and people caught watching banned movies and dramas.\u201cKim Jong-un\u2019s days are numbered,\u201d Mr. Thae said on Wednesday.Last year, the North conducted two nuclear tests and launched more than 20 ballistic missiles, and it has openly vowed to develop the ability to hit the United States with a nuclear warhead.On Wednesday, Mr. Thae warned against compromising with the North, arguing that sanctions were effective. In recent interviews with local news outlets, he said that North Korea had lost annual income worth tens of millions dollars, after Britain froze accounts last year held by its state-run insurance company as part of sanctions recommended by the United Nations. Until then, the company had claimed large insurance payments through fabricated documents, he said.Mr. Kim wanted to negotiate a compromise, under which the United States and South Korea would cancel their annual joint military exercises and lift sanctions on the North in return for a moratorium on North Korean missile and nuclear tests, Mr. Thae said.But such a deal would validate Mr. Kim\u2019s argument that he had been forced to develop nuclear weapons as a reaction to American hostility, he said.\u201cThat is really a trap Kim Jong-un wants,\u201d Mr. Thae said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Student Loan Suit Is Bold Gambit on Eve of Trump Presidency", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsNavient, the nation\u2019s largest servicer of student loans, has for years misled borrowers, according to lawsuits.Student loans have doubled since 2009 to some $1.4 trillion, raising fears they may pose a systemic risk to the economy. Default rates have come down but remain at very high levels. The percentage of students who could not make payments within three years stood at 11.3 percent at the end of 2015. Some 43 percent of the 22 million Americans with federal student loans also were delinquent.The regulator accuses Navient, the former Sallie Mae operation that services $315 billion worth of loans, of defrauding borrowers by giving them bad information and obscuring their ability to take advantage of federal programs that tie repayments to income. It further says the $4.6 billion company steered struggling customers to seek temporary forbearance rather than federal assistance, causing them to rack up $4 billion in extra interest charges.Banks ultimately paid tens of billions of dollars to settle allegations of mortgage-lending abuses. Navient is taking a tougher approach. It rejected the charges as unfounded and political, noting how the timing of the lawsuit coincides with political regime change. It is betting on more favorable treatment under the new administration. The C.F.P.B., a Dodd-Frank creation, is disliked by congressional Republicans and the financial-services industry alike.

{"Headline": "British Firms Await Brexit Plans, Poised to Relocate", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported byREADING, England \u2014 With its state-of-the-art robotics, Magal Engineering\u2019s factory in the colorless outskirts of this busy commercial town west of London is an important component of Britain\u2019s booming car industry, churning out millions of sophisticated vehicle parts every year.Yet as Britain prepares to leave the European Union, Magal is having to rethink its operations here.The company has sister factories in France and Germany, imports components from them to assemble in Reading, and sends many finished products back across the English Channel \u2014 all with minimal paperwork and no tariffs.Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union could change all that, ending the tariff-free trade that Magal enjoys, potentially disrupting the hiring of crucial engineers from abroad and requiring new hires to keep up with the added paperwork.Britain\u2019s exit is a \u201cbig worry\u201d and ideally would be stopped, says Gamil Magal, Magal Engineering\u2019s chief executive. But as a realist, he is preparing to live with it. That means suspending investment in Britain and contemplating production cuts here, even as the company continues to put money into France.With Britain, the policy is \u201cwait and see,\u201d Mr. Magal said, speaking in his office above this bustling factory in a building that once produced World War II aircraft.Although Britain\u2019s economy has so far not suffered the economic blowback that many predicted would follow the vote in a referendum last year to quit the bloc, British companies that import or export goods and services are anxiously assessing the potential costs of departure.Complicating matters is continuing uncertainty over the terms of departure that the government wants to negotiate. Prime Minister Theresa May plans to start two years of formal talks with the European Union on Britain\u2019s withdrawal, widely known as Brexit, by the end of March, and on Tuesday she is expected to give some more detail about her objectives.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what is going to happen, the government doesn\u2019t know what is going to happen, and I am not sure that the government even knows what it is asking for,\u201d said David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University.For British banks, a big worry is whether they will able to continue offering services to clients across the bloc.\u201cMost international banks now have project teams working out which operations they need to move to ensure they can continue serving customers, the date by which this must happen, and how best to do it,\u201d Anthony Browne, the chief executive of the British Bankers Association, wrote in The Observer last year. \u201cTheir hands are quivering over the relocate button,\u201d he added.Sectors like agriculture, hospitality and construction are worried about labor. They all rely heavily on workers from Southern or Eastern Europe, whose right to employment here may be curbed to achieve Mrs. May\u2019s objective of reducing immigration.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.For Mr. Magal, the threat of trade tariffs is forcing him to rethink the structure of his business. The company assembles thermostatic control units for car manufacturers, including Jaguar Land Rover in Britain and Daimler in Germany.Tariffs could add anything up to 10 percent to the price of some of his products, an increase he can neither afford to absorb nor pass on. \u201cWe don\u2019t make 10 percent profit \u2014 that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to increase the price, because the customer will say, \u2018We will buy from the competition.\u2019 \u201dThe logic is to reduce the amount of products that are made in Britain for continental Europe, and vice versa. Mr. Magal said that European clients were asking him to consider moving production.\u201cWith all the new projects we are getting now from Europe, they are saying, \u2018Why can\u2019t you put it in your plant in Europe? Why do you need to do it in the U.K.?\u2019 \u201d he said.If there is a hard Brexit, as seems increasingly likely, some production might be shifted to Britain from the Continent to serve the British market, but more would shift the other way, Mr. Magal said, adding that some parts could be made only in Germany.It is unclear what the impact will be on the Reading factory and its 230 jobs, or on another British factory that employs about 100 people.Mr. Magal is also worried about recruiting engineers, who are in short supply in Britain, if new immigration restrictions are put in place. And he thinks he may have to hire more administrative staff to deal with possible tariffs and other red tape.British car manufacturing, which has been booming in recent years after a period of decline, is particularly vulnerable to tariffs. Key components flow back and forth across the English Channel before a car is built, and then the assembled vehicle itself is often exported. That could mean paying tariffs repeatedly at different stages along the way.Around three-quarters of the 1.6 million vehicles built in Britain in 2015 were sold abroad; about 57 percent of British car exports go to the European Union.Last year, Gareth Jones, president of Britain\u2019s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, called for continued \u201cmembership of the single market,\u201d and the ability to trade \u201cfree from barriers and red tape.\u201d He appealed to the government, \u201cDon\u2019t screw it up!\u201dBritish officials say, however, that the country imports more vehicles from the European Union (800,000 a year from Germany alone) than it exports to it, so would be a net beneficiary, in revenue terms, from a tariff war.Yet Germany has a bigger economic interest in keeping the 27 other European Union nations together in a single market than it does in cutting Britain a favorable deal that would undermine that market. A hard-fought negotiation seems inevitable.And the longer Brexit uncertainty prevails, the less attractive Britain is likely to be for many manufacturers, including those from the auto industry.\u201cThe value chain crosses borders numerous times, so anything that gets in the way \u2014 tariff or nontariff barriers \u2014 is likely to mean less investment,\u201d Mr. Bailey said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump, a Chevy and Cuba\u2019s Uncertainty", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorHAVANA \u2014 R.P. is a Cuban entrepreneur. His business consists of him and his car \u2014 but this is not just any man and any car. R.P. is 40 years old. Sixteen years ago he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from Havana\u2019s technological university, but six years ago, when government relaxed the rules on private enterprise, he left his transportation specialist job to become a taxi driver. Almost immediately he started earning five, six times his previous salary. His car, of course, is as idiosyncratic and Cuban as he is: a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air he inherited from his father.A year ago, R.P. converted his sedan into a convertible, the mode of transportation most sought-after by the new crowds of American visitors keen to take in Havana\u2019s sights. To perform this reconstructive surgery, R.P. spent his entire savings and more, some $3,000.But in November, the American president-elect, Donald J. Trump, threatened to roll back the countries\u2019 newly restored relations. Now R.P. has no idea whether his business will continue to prosper or if he just made the worst investment of his life.That was Mr. Obama\u2019s doing, however. It seems doubtful that the relationship between Cuba and the United States will continue to improve under his successor.On a recent morning, a plane touched down at the Havana airport. The flight, from Miami, lasted 45 minutes. Safely landed, the passengers had to wait another 45 minutes on the runway for a portable staircase to arrive so they could disembark. They then spent 90 more minutes at immigration, customs and baggage retrieval. Total: three hours.That same evening, on a TV news program, the supervisor of the airport terminal assured viewers that the airport was able to handle the present volume of visitors to Cuba and could absorb even more passengers if the travel embargo were completely eliminated. Yet many Cubans (both here and in the United States, I believe) can\u2019t help wondering whether that will happen.A reversal in the present state of relations could revive the mistaken political calculation that a hostile American policy will destabilize the island\u2019s government. Cuba, as we know by now, has survived everything from Cold War tensions to the embargo that began in 1962 to the collapse of European Communism, which plunged the country into dire economic straits. The Cuban government withstood those assaults, but it was the Cuban people who bore the brunt of the sacrifice and suffering.Since Ra\u00fal Castro assumed the presidency from his brother Fidel in 2008, one of the most profound changes in Cubans\u2019 lives has been the loosening of restrictions on their travel abroad.This change has spawned more emigration and a lucrative cottage industry: Many Cubans now travel to Panama, Ecuador, Mexico and Miami as \u201cmules,\u201d returning with kitchen appliances, clothing and food that supply small businesses and the black market here. With each voyage the \u201cmule\u201d can earn up to $200, or what a Cuban doctor earns in four months.Mr. Trump\u2019s unsettling comments in November came just as Cubans were mourning the death of Fidel Castro, for so many decades a boogeyman for Washington. After the nine intense days of funeral rites, which came to an end on Dec. 4 \u2014 a significant date in Cuba because it is the day of St. Barbara, syncretized as the Orisha warrior Chango \u2014 life on the island slowly recovered its very Cuban normality.Many people celebrated Christmas. The top baseball players still on the island began the decisive playoff period, while the Yoruba priests, in their annual predictions, announced that 2017 would be a magnificent year. But people still are wondering what will happen in the coming months, without Fidel in Cuba and with Mr. Trump on the other side of the Florida Straits and the new immigration agreements in place. Will it really be a good year for Cubans?Leonardo Padura is a journalist and the author of \u201cThe Man Who Loved Dogs\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cHeretics.\u201d This essay was translated by Kristina Cordero from the Spanish.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Xi\u2019s Great Chinese Soccer Dream", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported by\u201cSoccer will be my career after I grow up,\u201d Wang Kai, a gangly 13-year-old who has studied at the boarding school for over three years, said after a morning session under the supervision of a Spanish coach. \u201cI want to be the Chinese Cristiano Ronaldo,\u201d he said, referring to the Portuguese superstar.Grooming the next Ronaldo or Messi has become a national project in China, where the country\u2019s No. 1 fan, President Xi Jinping, is bent on transforming the country into a great soccer power.It is a moonshot for China, whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition. But the effort has already unleashed a surge of spending and support for the game that has stunned fans and players around the world.In the last two years, the government has poured the kind of concentrated effort into soccer that it has previously devoted to winning Olympic medals in individual sports like diving and gymnastics.It has promised to clean up and reorganize professional soccer and build a new generation of players by creating tens of thousands of soccer fields and adding soccer programs in tens of thousands of schools. The aim is to establish a flow of top players eventually capable of winning the coveted men\u2019s World Cup and returning the women\u2019s team to its former glory.That effort has emboldened Chinese clubs to spend lavishly. As well as paying tens of millions for foreign players, Chinese team owners have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying into European clubs, hoping to tap their coaching and marketing expertise.But if soccer distills Mr. Xi\u2019s national ambitions, it also illustrates how his plans could falter, as they have in other arenas, in a muddle of rushed and distorted enforcement, especially at the local level. There has been resistance by parents, worried about their children taking precious time away from academics, as well as fear that splurging on foreign stars diverts money and attention from fostering homegrown talent.The pitfalls in fixing soccer, it turns out, are a bit like those in fixing the economy; a desire for quick, flashy success is putting long-term goals at risk.\u201cThe national team is a joke,\u201d said Xu Yun, 16, who had come to Workers\u2019 Stadium in Beijing to watch his favorite Beijing team clobber a listless opponent from Henan Province. \u201cI think it will need decades to get it right. It\u2019s not just a question of spending money, it\u2019s attitude.\u201dFor Xi, soccer has been a passion since childhood.\u201cLook how healthy I am,\u201d Mr. Xi told young soccer players at the school. \u201cI laid the basis for that through sports when I was young.\u201dPrivate investors have piled into professional soccer, encouraged by Xi\u2019s backing for the game and apparently eager to curry favor with his government.\u201cNow principals at every school are paying quite a bit more attention to soccer,\u201d said Dai Wei, the athletic director at r. Xi\u2019s old school, the Bayi School. \u201cThat was unthinkable before.\u201dYet there is deep cultural resistance, even at Bayi.Some parents discourage their children from committing time to sports, Mr. Dai said, because they have so much homework and face stiff competition on academic exams.While China has excelled at individual sports that demand intense discipline from an early age, the country has not done as well at fostering group sports, where skills like teamwork and improvisation count as much as personal virtuosity.The privately run Evergrande school, the world\u2019s biggest soccer boarding school, says its formula of intense training combined with a solid education could show the way for developing young players.\u201cAs more soccer schools are built, there\u2019ll be more and more kids playing, and the stars will multiply, too,\u201d said Liu Jiangnan, the principal of the school, which opened in 2012. \u201cI\u2019d guess that in seven or eight years, half the members of the Chinese national squad will come from this school.\u201dDrawn by such hopes, parents pay up to about $8,700 a year to send children here, where 24 Spanish coaches oversee training. Students spend 90 minutes a day on drills and also play on weekends. Promising players get scholarships, and children from poorer families get discounts, school officials said.But even here, the children come to the game later than their European and South American counterparts, and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics, said Sergio Zarco Diaz, a Spanish coach.\u201cThe kids are getting better, year by year,\u201d he said hopefully.But the Evergrande approach is too expensive to be widely copied.\u201cChinese soccer has failed before through rushing for instant success,\u201d Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing, recalling previous failed efforts to build up the game in the 1980s and 1990s. \u201cThe problem is that everyone\u2019s thinking is still deeply set in traditional ideas. Everyone thinks soccer is just about getting results, competition, training, creating stars.\u201dMr. Zhang has instead been encouraging schools to focus on fun and broad participation. That approach gives more children a break from the monotony of the classroom and will eventually bring out more future champions than an elitist, top-down approach, he argues.Some schools are trying his way. On a recent afternoon, the smog that often covers Beijing lifted and the children of Caoqiao Elementary School rushed onto the fields, shouting and squealing with delight.\u201cThis morning soccer had been canceled because of the smog,\u201d said the principal, Lin Yanling. \u201cBut at midday I notified the kids that it was back on, and they all went crazy with relief.\u201dAn article on Jan. 5 about President Xi Jinping\u2019s ambition to transform China into a great soccer power misstated the year that Mr. Xi announced, \u201cMy biggest hope for Chinese soccer is that its teams become among the world\u2019s best.\u201d It was 2015, not last year.Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Seem Invincible. That Worries Lawmakers.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech \u2014 from IBM to Hewlett-Packard to Cisco to Yahoo \u2014 were eventually outmaneuvered by start-ups that came out of nowhere.The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place.Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable.In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world\u2019s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will.The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump\u2019s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds.This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year.Let\u2019s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends \u2014 mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs.Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech \u2014 on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance.The Five aren\u2019t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple\u2019s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet\u2019s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren\u2019t entirely safe from competition from start-ups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot.Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from start-ups; today\u2019s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five.But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you\u2019re supposed to in America \u2014 by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren\u2019t considered that bad. They weren\u2019t causing environmental disasters. They weren\u2019t selling cigarettes. They weren\u2019t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five\u2019s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn\u2019t I called them the Fabulous Five?Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with.During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos\u2019s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry\u2019s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public.For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised \u2014 entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others.\u201cDuring the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U.S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,\u201d said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them.During Mr. Genachowski\u2019s term at the F.C.C., and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201d which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies.But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. \u201cThe next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things \u2014 battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,\u201d he said.That\u2019s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger \u2014 their benefits to society as well as their potential costs \u2014 when deciding how to police them.But there\u2019s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today\u2019s start-ups. The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining, voice-activated assistants, self-driving cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five.That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more; and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Jay Clayton Protect Investors?", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe unanswered question is whether Mr. Clayton would use his knowledge and experience to protect investors from abuse and undue risk in the public markets, or to shield Wall Street from scrutiny.A pro-Wall Street bias on Mr. Clayton\u2019s part would most likely leave several investor protections from the S.E.C.\u2019s agenda unfinished. One is a proposed requirement that stockbrokers act in a client\u2019s best interest when selling and giving advice on non-retirement accounts, rather than pitching products and services that pay the highest commissions.The S.E.C. has not yet used its authority under the Dodd-Frank reform law to ban or limit the use of forced arbitration clauses in brokerage accounts. Such clauses have been linked to investor abuses because firms know they cannot be sued in any disputes that arise. Another unfinished rule, dubbed the \u201cGoldman\u201d rule, would limit conflicts of interest exposed in the crisis in which investment banks make money by betting against securities they create and sell.And still unaddressed are what many investor advocates see as potentially devastating flaws in the design and marketing of exchange-traded funds, investment vehicles that have attracted over $2 trillion in the United States. Originally conceived as passive investments, E.T.F.s have become increasingly complex, without a commensurate increase in oversight.In his career, Mr. Clayton has zealously represented Wall Street clients on mergers, public offerings, settlements and other transactions. He even once argued that laws against bribery should be relaxed so that American companies doing business abroad would be better able to compete \u2014 a race to the bottom that could mean profits in the short term, but benefits no one in the long run.The Senate\u2019s duty is to learn whether Mr. Clayton will protect individual investors with the same zeal. He is the fourth person with current or past ties to Goldman Sachs selected by Mr. Trump for an important post. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign statements to the contrary, Wall Street is certainly well represented on his team.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Trump, an Economic Feast With Surprises on the Menu", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byDealBookLadies and gentlemen, please, please take your seats. It is time again for our annual DealBook closing dinner, where we look back at the year that was to toast and roast the year\u2019s deal makers and look ahead to what may come next.Thank you all for coming to D.C. this year. A special thanks to the folks in the reservations department at the Trump International Hotel here who helped us rent this ballroom on last-minute notice. We know how booked up this place can get with foreign diplomats and leaders; we understand we were competing with a Russian delegation, an Israeli group and perhaps even Bob Dole, who was apparently trying to get the room on behalf of Taiwan.Sitting on the dais tonight, the nation\u2019s new chief deal maker and the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d President-elect Donald J. Trump, along with \u2014 of course \u2014 his entire family. (And please keep off Twitter during the dinner. Sorry. I know, #sad.)Tim Cook of Apple is here. He\u2019s sitting, hopefully not too uncomfortably, at a table with James B. Comey from the F.B.I., who claims he lost his password to the scratched iPhone in his pocket and needs help. Sorry, Jim, this is not the Genius Bar; you\u2019ll need a subpoena for that one \u2014 and please don\u2019t announce anything until you\u2019re absolutely sure. Next to him is Larry Page of Google, holding court, again, on the importance of two-factor authentication for Gmail. (John D. Podesta clearly missed last year\u2019s dinner.) Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook looks as if he just sat down. And yes, Mark, this annual dinner column is fake news, but please don\u2019t filter it!Jeff Bezos was kind enough to contribute a free Amazon Echo to everyone in attendance this year, so feel free to ask Alexa anything you want. Mr. Trump, please remember: It\u2019s a hot mike, so watch yourself with the P-word \u2014 Putin, that is. He is probably listening. Don\u2019t make Rex W. Tillerson of Exxon Mobil, our next secretary of state, have to call his \u201cfriend\u201d to explain things.On the menu this evening: crow. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been eating since most of us here completely missed the way the election would turn out. (Except for Nigel Farage at Table No. 3!) And by the way, the barbecue stations during cocktail hour were provided courtesy of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7.Finally, for the business executives in the room who are wondering if this free meal violates your conflict-of-interest policy, don\u2019t worry; see what your legal department says when you tell it, \u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for the president, it\u2019s good enough for me.\u201dNow, on to the toasts \u2014 and some predictions for the new year.Let\u2019s start with predictions, given that everyone, myself included, seemed to be so wrong about everything in 2016 \u2014 Trump, Brexit, the way the stock market would go. Instead of offering conventional predictions, I\u2019m going to offer up some Black Swans \u2014 things that were considered unthinkable but may now be thinkable, in a blue-sky, the-world-is-upside-down kind of way. Consider some of these thought experiments, if nothing else.This one may be slightly more plausible: Masayoshi Son, the billionaire controlling shareholder of Sprint \u2014 and a newfound friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who pledged to invest $100 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs \u2014 makes a bid to merge Sprint with T-Mobile. Under most antitrust analysis, such a deal would be dead on arrival. But perhaps under a new business-friendly administration \u2014 and given Mr. Son\u2019s public support for the president-elect \u2014 the transaction gets the green light?Here\u2019s another: With the possibility that the Trump\u2019s administration will undo net-neutrality laws that allow content companies to transmit unlimited data over cable company pipes, Netflix will finally accept a takeover bid \u2014 from Disney, which has been looking for a way to create an even stronger direct relationship with its customers. It would be Robert A. Iger\u2019s final megadeal before his contract expires in 2018. It would also pave the way for Mr. Iger to hire digitally savvy Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, a Disney board member, to take over for him.John G. Stumpf, the chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo, wasn\u2019t supposed to end his career this way. He is a reasonable and \u2014 dare I say \u2014 decent man, yet he led a bank engaged in one of the most blatant financial scandals in recent memory. Wells opened up millions of accounts without the permission of its customers, just to goose internal numbers. In truth, customers lost only $1.5 million, which, if we\u2019re being honest, is minuscule for a bank the size of Wells Fargo. The problem is that Mr. Stumpf treated it as a blip on the radar screen and ignored the significant damage his bank was doing to real people. And when he was called to account, he didn\u2019t have the right answers. Ultimately, he resigned, which was the right decision. But it could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 all been avoided.President and Michelle Obama couldn\u2019t make it to dinner (the venue might have been a turnoff). But whatever you think of his stewardship of the nation, he deserves our thanks. For those of us who pay attention to economic statistics, Mr. Obama walked into the worst economic crisis in recent history. We are now in the longest economic expansion and monthly job creation in history. Was he alone responsible? No, but it happened on his watch. Could we have gone faster with different policies? Very possibly. We will see just how much faster we can grow and if there is a cost to doing so under the next administration. Was he perfect? Of course not. But in a town that\u2019s filled with scandals and red flags about conflicts of interest \u2014 which are often skewered in this annual column \u2014 the Obamas stand out for avoiding those questions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018You Focus on the Good\u2019: Women Who Voted for Trump, in Their Own Words", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byWhy did they?But many women also voted against Hillary Clinton, voicing deep suspicions about the American deaths in Benghazi, Libya; her use of a private email server; and the hacked emails of the Democratic National Committee as proof that she said one thing in public and another in private.Here are excerpts, condensed and edited, from their thoughts.In 2008 and 2012, I voted for Obama, I was pro-gay marriage, Planned Parenthood was very important to me. But after eight years, I saw there was much more racial divide than there had ever been, I didn\u2019t like the way the economy is going and I didn\u2019t like the stance he took on police. My husband is a court officer and volunteers in the police force. [President Obama] didn\u2019t support law enforcement the way he did the community that felt they were being unjustly treated. I think he could have done a better job instead of pointing blame. Instead of saying we need to educate people on how to behave when they\u2019re being pulled over by the police.I\u2019m seeing a barrage of patients coming in from different countries. An Iraqi immigrant came in last night, he needs dialysis. He will never be productive in the U.S., he will always be dependent on Medicaid. I feel for him, I want to help him, but we have to take care of our own people first. Driving to work yesterday, I saw three homeless people. They need our help.If I turned down every candidate who objectified women, I\u2019d vote for no one._____Trump\u2019s not a perfect man, by any means. He kind of reminds me of my ex-husband.I think he\u2019s a really good man, deep down. This guy has such potential, and I truly believe he cares about our country and wants to help everyone.At the very beginning of this election, I was leaning toward Bernie Sanders. I looked at all the candidates, what were their ideas to help our country out of debt and make our military strong and be there for our vets. I have so many friends whose health care costs have doubled and are having to get extra jobs just to pay their insurance. And I read all these things about people where their religious liberties are not being taken seriously._____I\u2019m very focused on bringing the plants back. In metro Detroit, waiters usually were younger people and during the time of hardship, the bankruptcies, it was very striking to me to go to a Papa Gino\u2019s and have a middle-aged man being a waiter. Usually these people would have some kind of job related to the automotive industry.I\u2019m super excited about Trump. I believe he knows how to build things. My dad worked at a coal power plant for 39 years and they\u2019re freaked out about energy changing too quickly.I\u2019m also concerned about immigration. I went to Minnesota and I had a Somali cabdriver who lectured me for 35 minutes to the airport about how women in America have too much freedom. My thought process on that is that I don\u2019t like seeing people going through the hardship they go through, but I don\u2019t want to go backwards in the feminist movement, either._____Both my parents are engineers. My mom was an engineer long before many women in the field. When the economy started faltering, she went from a very high position at Pratt & Whitney to being unemployed for a year, and that was heartbreaking. I think that Trump really cares about having high-skilled jobs back here, not necessarily the service industry._____I made up my mind for Trump at the last minute. Since my husband is in the military, I was concerned about having someone who didn\u2019t have military experience, didn\u2019t have the knowledge of dealing with world leaders. And I kind of thought he had a big mouth.But I had an 8-year-old who was totally on the Trump train. He talked me into taking him to a Trump rally. I expected him to be like what I\u2019d seen on the news, saying hateful things. But his presence was very calming and I liked his talking points. We really are the middle class, and we kind of get swept aside.The first time she ran against Obama, I was all on board for Hillary Clinton. I really wanted to have a female president. I think that\u2019s important. But I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s her. In the past, her stance on abortion was more the way I feel, just for the first trimester, then she did a 360. She was here in the primary, having a debate with Bernie Sanders. He answered the question honestly. When they asked her the same question, she kind of danced around it. Then she went on \u201cThe View\u201d and said she was for late-term abortions. Just take a stance, be honest. Same thing as with gay marriage, she wasn\u2019t for it, then she was. I\u2019m 100 percent for it. It\u2019s ridiculous the way we tell people who they can and cannot marry. Don\u2019t go back and forth. Don\u2019t pander.I voted for Obama the last time. I don\u2019t agree with a lot of what he said, but I felt he was honest._____Voter: Katie Holder, 39. Owns a weight-loss business.Home: Gulf Shores, Ala._____We are a country based on immigrants. But I believe they should go through the process. My great-grandparents came here, they had to learn English. This is a Christian country. The whole bending over backwards. He says what everyone\u2019s thinking and is afraid to say. That doesn\u2019t make anyone bigoted.I\u2019m not saying there are people out there who shouldn\u2019t be helped. I worked in the inner cities. They\u2019re on welfare. They make a certain amount of money and everything gets taken away. That amount of money is so low that they have no incentive to work. Why don\u2019t you allow them to gradually earn more money? Find a way to help people get over the hump._____I voted for Trump because I wanted change. I feel like our economy has totally tanked. People do not have disposable income. I feel the last eight years have been a joke. Obama was out for himself. I don\u2019t think he really respected the office. I think it was more about him being a celebrity than a president.Trump\u2019s a successful businessman, and I feel like that\u2019s what America needs to bring our economy back. I don\u2019t think Donald Trump is really Republican, to be quite honest with you. He\u2019s not in a box. One of the most attractive things to me is he can\u2019t be boxed. He wants to bring America back to what it was before. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s taking us back to women have no rights or slavery days._____I spent a long time in the staffing industry here, worked with the automotive industry. We weren\u2019t competitive. That\u2019s got to be turned around. We have to have incentives for companies to keep their work here._____When Trump became my only choice, I felt he was the lesser of two evils. I had major issues with Hillary as far as ethics was concerned. It seems she feels that she is above the law and nothing ever seems to stick. I didn\u2019t particularly like everything he was saying as far as building a wall, and doing this to immigrants. I looked at that more as bravado, his audience needed that to get the applause.But there are allegations about killing people who get in her way \u2014 Vince Foster, people like that. Someone who has a big bravado is not as concerning to me as someone who might kill people who get in her way._____I run my household like a business, my classroom like a business. I expect him to run the country in such a manner. You don\u2019t pay more money out than you have. You want to have your budget under control. You want to know the people you\u2019re working with are above average. You want to pick the people based on what they can do, not on what they did for you. He\u2019s not getting large amounts from donors based on what you\u2019ll do for me later._____I laughed Trump off like everyone else did. Once I stopped laughing at him and started listening, I started to support him. I felt like once you got past the bluster, he really was interested in helping everyone.I do think having a secure border is very important. My father was a Muslim immigrant from Turkey, he went through the process. I don\u2019t agree with a ban on Muslims, but my father was very wary of Muslims who came over if they didn\u2019t have a reason to be here. He would support a full vetting, but not a total ban.I have always considered myself a feminist. For me, I want to be treated the exact same way. That\u2019s not the feel I get from feminists today, they want extra privileges. I gave up my first marriage so I could be a law partner and then I had to give up on my partnership so I could be a better mom.To say women are going backwards would be wrong. Look at how much Trump hires women, how much he does rely on women, how much he relies on his own daughter. I\u2019m sort of amazed by her. She may pull him more into the middle.

{"Headline": "The Shock of the Normal", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Again, think of aggregate demand as reflecting the interest rate, other things equal, while monetary policy normally leans against changes in GDP, so that there\u2019s an upward-sloping LM curve \u2014 but because it\u2019s really hard to cut rates below zero, that curve is flat at low levels of output. Short-run equilibrium of output and interest rates is where the IS and LM curves cross:Now, suppose you\u2019re considering the effects of policies that will, other things equal, raise or lower aggregate demand \u2014 that is, shift the IS curve. In normal circumstances, where the IS curve intersects an upward-sloping LM, such shifts have limited effects on output and employment, because they\u2019re offset by changes in interest rates: fiscal expansion leads to crowding out, austerity to crowding in, and multipliers are low.In the aftermath of the financial crisis, however, we spent an extended period at the ZLB, as shown by the \u201c2010\u201d IS curve. In those conditions, shifts in the IS curve don\u2019t move interest rates, there is no crowding out (actually crowding in because increased sales lead to higher investment), and multipliers are large.Even at the time, however, I tried to explain that this wouldn\u2019t always be the case. From the linked post:Oh, and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always remember that Keynesians like me don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that thing like the paradox of thrift and the paradox of flexibility are the way the economy normally works. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very much exceptional, applying only when interest rates are up against the zero lower bound. Unfortunately, that happens to be the world we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re currently living in.So are we still there? No. Wages are finally rising, quit rates are back to pre-crisis levels, so we seem to be fairly close to full employment, and the Fed is raising rates. So it now looks like the \u201c2017\u201d IS curve in the figure. We\u2019re just barely over the border into normality, which is why I think the Fed should hold and we could still use some fiscal stimulus for insurance, and very low rates still make the case for lots of infrastructure spending. But it\u2019s not the same as it was.Or actually it\u2019s not the same in the U.S.. Europe is still fairly deep in the liquidity trap.The point here is that argument by gotcha is even worse now than usual. If you see progressive economists saying different things about Trump deficits than they said about Obama deficits, it\u2019s because the situation has changed, and the very same models that called for fiscal stimulus when Republicans pretended to be fiscally responsible say that deficits are no longer good now that they\u2019re showing what they always were.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Beckons International Students With a Path to Citizenship", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byST. JOHN\u2019S, Newfoundland \u2014 At the College of the North Atlantic here, a young Chinese woman stood discussing her future with two fellow students, a Bangladeshi man and a Korean woman, amid a flow of mostly pale Newfoundlanders in down coats and hoodies heading for class.\u201cThe environment here is really good, so I think for my health I will stay,\u201d said Fei Jie, from China\u2019s eastern Shandong Province. The others said they, too, were planning to remain in the country after graduation, eventually becoming Canadian citizens.Their path is no accident. They are three of hundreds of thousands of international students in Canada today as part of a government strategy to reshape Canadian demographics by funneling well-educated, skilled workers through the university system. It is an answer to Canada\u2019s aging population and slowing birthrate, and an effort to shore up the nation\u2019s tax base.In November, the federal government changed its electronic immigration-selection system, called Express Entry, to make it easier for international students to become citizens. And a bill pending in the Senate would restore a rule that counts half of students\u2019 time spent studying in Canada toward the period of residency required for citizenship.The country needs talented immigrants to backfill a thinly spread, aging population. According to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the country\u2019s immigration department, immigrants already make up 75 percent of the annual net growth in the country\u2019s work force and are expected to account for 100 percent within 10 years.Internationalizing Canadian education promises a deep and lasting effect on the country, binding it to other nations and cultures through the family ties and the broader perspectives of international students who become citizens and may even rise to positions of national power. Canada\u2019s new immigration minister, for example, arrived in the country as a Somali refugee and earned a law degree at the University of Ottawa.But the strategy may also lead to tensions similar to those seen in the United States and Europe as the makeup of Canadian society evolves and less educated segments of the mostly white work force feel pushed aside.Statistics Canada, the country\u2019s census bureau, predicts that the number will reach nearly 30 percent by 2030. Nonwhites will make up a majority of the population in Toronto and Vancouver.So far, Canadians have shown a remarkable equanimity toward the influx, one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the developed world. While polls show a gradual uptick in concern about the flow of new arrivals, mostly tied to unskilled Syrian refugees, the country on the whole remains welcoming to outsiders.But non-Canadians are already crowding out local students at some of the country\u2019s best-known schools. International students at McGill University in Montreal make up a quarter of total enrollments. In British Columbia, where students from abroad make up 18 percent of the total enrollment, people in the province are beginning to grumble that locals are being passed over in favor of non-Canadians who pay higher fees.The University of British Columbia created a controversy with its plans to spend 127 million Canadian dollars, roughly $95 million, to build a school, Vantage College, for international students \u2014 mostly Chinese \u2014 who need to improve their English before matriculating at the university.International students typically pay more than domestic students, and many, particularly from China, come from affluent families eager to establish a toehold in North America. The money these students bring helps subsidize education for domestic students, but can also distort local economies.About half of Canada\u2019s inbound students come from China and the government wants even more. Former Immigration Minister John McCallum, recently named ambassador to China, met with Chinese officials in August, hoping to double or even triple the number of Canadian visa application centers in mainland China from the four the country has now, not including Hong Kong.Amit Chakma, the president of the University of Western Ontario who led a 2012 government advisory panel that developed the core of the government strategy, said there was plenty of capacity among smaller, high-quality institutions in Canada that are struggling to fill their classrooms as applications from high school graduates fall.Even the broad middle of the country is getting its fair share. The Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology in Regina, for example, has expanded its International English Language Testing System program to meet the demand, which has doubled, by non-Canadians who need to pass the English proficiency exam for immigration requirements.Jack Wu, who arrived from China, manages the design of circuit protection systems for hydro-electric transmission lines. He studied at the College of the North Atlantic in St. John\u2019s before earning an electrical engineering degree in 2005 from Ontario\u2019s Lakehead University. He and his wife immigrated through a provincial program for people who have studied in Newfoundland and Labrador. The process from student to citizen took them about two and a half years.\u201cOur daughters were born here,\u201d Mr. Wu said proudly, sitting in a Tim Hortons, the quintessentially Canadian fast-food chain. \u201cThey are Newfoundlanders.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio Proposes Budget of $84.7 Billion", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday unveiled an $84.7 billion budget proposal for New York City that outlined his spending priorities as he starts his run for re-election, but did not address what he called the \u201cgreat unknown\u201d of possible federal cuts to city financing from the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress.If adopted by the City Council, the city\u2019s budget would be about $12 billion greater than it was when Mr. de Blasio became mayor in 2014. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s final budget called for $72.7 billion in spending.\u201cThis is a budget against a backdrop of a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said at the start of a news conference in City Hall.The mayor cited threats by President Trump and other Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, pare support for social services and public housing, change the way schools are financed and retaliate against so-called sanctuary cities that resist a crackdown on illegal immigrants.But he said that none of those possibilities were reflected in the preliminary budget because it was still unclear which, if any, would occur.\u201cIt\u2019s a budget that focuses on what we can do for ourselves while we wait to see the shape of things in Washington,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, adding that a revised budget proposal in the spring might be able to take those factors into account.The proposed budget takes into account a variety of savings at city agencies, largely through debt service and revised cost estimates. The City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito and the chairwoman of the council\u2019s finance committee, Julissa Ferreras-Copeland,called for the mayor to find ways to cut costs further. Both are Democrats.\u201cI think it is prudent that we actually save more,\u201d Ms. Ferreras-Copeland told reporters. \u201cWe are very concerned about the potential wave that is coming our way.\u201dThe city budget last year included more than $8 billion in federal funds.While saying there was \u201cnothing Trump-specific\u201d in the budget, Mr. de Blasio spent much time talking about the new president and his proposals. He emphasized the importance of immigrants to the city\u2019s economy, trumpeted law enforcement spending and stressed investments in infrastructure, one of the few areas of possible agreement with the White House.The budget presentation, titled \u201cNew York Stands Strong,\u201d echoed many of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s public comments after the presidential election. It offered a vision of a city facing economic headwinds, but did not contain warnings of recession, a departure from last year\u2019s presentation. Instead, it pointed to expected increases in tax revenue in the next fiscal year after a decline during the current one.Many of the proposals \u2014 including money for repaving roads, assisting schools and financing programs for the Police Department \u2014 seemed like typical election-year fare for any mayor trying to please various constituencies, and many represented relatively small investments.The mayor\u2019s proposal for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, included $10.4 million to install bullet-resistant windows in police cars, and $6.3 million to hire 200 additional school crossing guards and 100 crossing guard supervisors.In his initial presentation, Mr. de Blasio did not mention the city\u2019s homelessness crisis, which has become a major vulnerability for him as he has struggles to find a way to care for a record number of people flooding into city shelters.\u201cWe have continued in this budget a lot of the investments we needed to make to continue to improve our approach to homelessness,\u201d he said, in response to a question. But budget documents made available later showed that while city spending on homelessness rose to an estimated $1.7 billion in the current fiscal year, above initial projections, the amount budgeted for the Department of Homeless Services in the coming fiscal year would be $257 million less than that.Freddi Goldstein, an administration spokeswoman, said that the mayor\u2019s office was evaluating its approach to homelessness and expected to include additional spending before the budget is approved.In a statement, the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog group, blamed inadequate management at City Hall for some of the spending increases.\u201cA substantial portion of the expenditure growth derives from challenges managing serious problems, notably an inability to stem the growth in homelessness and in the reliance on overtime among city agencies,\u201d the statement said.Currently, 292,418 full-time employees work for the city, the mayor\u2019s office said.Mr. de Blasio did not unveil any grand new plans on Tuesday. But he suggested one could be coming.Asked about plans for Rikers Island, including its possible closure, under study by an independent commission, Mr. de Blasio hinted at an announcement in the executive budget in the spring. He said he would \u201ccome back in the coming months with a long-term vision.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Union Leaders Meet With Trump, Construction on Their Minds", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byAt a meeting with the leaders of several construction and building trade unions, President Trump reiterated on Monday his interest in directing hundreds of billions of dollars to infrastructure investments, some of it from the federal government, union officials said.\u201cThat was the impression I was taken away with,\u201d said Sean McGarvey, the president of North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions, an umbrella group, on a call with reporters after the meeting. \u201cThat the American citizenry and the American Treasury will be invested in building public infrastructure.\u201dThe meeting included roughly half a dozen union leaders and a similar number of rank-and-file members, as well as senior White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence; Reince Priebus, the chief of staff; Katie Walsh, the deputy chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist; Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor; and Sean Spicer, the press secretary. It took place in the White House and ran for well over an hour.The presence of so many senior aides suggests that the Trump administration sees a political rationale to courting the building trade unions, many of whose members appear to have voted for Mr. Trump last fall.The White House did not comment on the meeting, but Mr. Spicer affirmed in his press briefing that infrastructure remains a high priorityMr. McGarvey and Terry O\u2019Sullivan, the general president of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, stressed to reporters their satisfaction at meeting with the president so soon after the inauguration.

I got that job after being unemployed for six months.\u201dCertain projects, like the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, have divided the labor movement, with the building trades supporting them as a source of jobs with good pay, and other unions, like the Service Employees International Union, opposing them on environmental grounds, and out of concern for desecrating sacred Native American lands.Many conservatives contend that the act inflates the cost of infrastructure projects, and on Tuesday, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, is proposing a bill to suspend it for federal highway construction contracts.Mr. McGarvey said he had told Mr. Trump that Mr. Flake\u2019s bill would undercut wages and undermine the president\u2019s campaign goal of producing good middle-class jobs.The president was noncommittal in response, he said. \u201cHe said he knows the Davis-Bacon proposal well, understands how it works,\u201d Mr. McGarvey said, but avoided taking a position.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel, Russia\u2019s Next Target", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 It\u2019s no surprise that Russia met President Obama\u2019s expulsion of its diplomats, which he announced Thursday in response to the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to manipulate the 2016 election, with a collective shrug. Moscow seems content to let the clock run out, knowing that on Jan. 20 Mr. Obama will be replaced by an admirer in the White House and an old friend in the State Department.But the changeover is bittersweet; President Vladimir V. Putin has also lost a beloved boogeyman. For the foreseeable future, the United States can hardly serve as Russia\u2019s preferred enemy of the state. So guess who qualifies best as a new, well, boogeywoman? Angela Merkel.The German chancellor is a perfect target. Germany is holding general elections next autumn, and with politicians sympathetic to Moscow on the rise, she may well be running for her fourth term as the sole European leader willing to stand up to a newly assertive Russia.Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ms. Merkel has been the most consequential voice for punishing Russia. The next year, she welcomed a million refugees into Germany, and pushed the rest of Europe to do the same \u2014 thus, in the view of Russian ethno-nationalists, diluting European culture. And she still believes in a united, integrated European Union, a bastion of liberal values and, at least implicitly, a political and economic bulwark against Russia.It seems that Russia may be planning to do to Ms. Merkel and her allies in 2017 what it did to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats in the United States in 2016.After all, last year the same hackers who broke into the Democratic Party\u2019s computers, known online as Fancy Bear or Sofacy Group, attacked the German Parliament\u2019s network; they are also accused of stealing documents from individual members of Parliament. Every revelation about how Russia interfered in the American elections gives Germany a foretaste of what is already looking to be the nastiest, toughest, most exhausting election campaign in modern German history.That foretaste, though, is also Germany\u2019s one advantage. We know something about Russians\u2019 technical abilities and methods, and, even more important, we have a developing sense of where they\u2019re coming from ideologically \u2014 and how that will guide their attacks.Here, we can draw valuable lessons from the Cold War. What Russia does today is very much the digital version of what we Germans, before 1989, termed \u201cZersetzung.\u201d The term is hard to translate, but it\u2019s best described as the political equivalent of what happens when you pour acid on organic material: dissolution and disintegration.The methods of Zersetzung are to cast doubt on the basic norms of the Western liberal order and its institutions; to distort and thereby discredit the purposes of the European Union, NATO and the free-market economy; to erode the credibility of the free press and free elections. The means of Zersetzung include character assassination and, through the spreading of lies and fake news, the creation of a gray zone of doubt in which facts struggle to survive.We have seen all of this before, employed by the K.G.B. and the East German Stasi: psychological warfare, rumor-mongering, schemes to bribe politicians and then expose them as criminals. They used it both internally, against dissidents, and externally, against Western enemies. Mr. Putin and his former K.G.B. colleagues should know that, this time, we have a better sense of their dirty tricks, and how they have updated Zersetzung for the internet.The government has its role to play, but so do journalists and civil-society groups. We journalists will put pressure on companies like Facebook and Twitter to be vigilant against fake news; we will expose the patterns of Russian agitprop where we see them.But it is just as important to be clear about the ideology driving these attacks. In September, my newspaper, Die Zeit, joined with the broadcaster ZDF to reveal details of Moscow\u2019s highly sophisticated disinformation campaign. We had gained access to roughly 10,000 emails that showed how ideologues close to the Putin administration advised the pro-Russian rebel government in Eastern Ukraine.No doubt similar marching orders have been given to the armies of hackers who were sent to attack the Democrats, and who are now plotting attacks on Germany.It is quite clear who will lose. Mr. Putin and his reckless fakers should be aware that the only thing they will harvest from this mendacity is another lost generation of Russians who could serve their country better by being given the opportunity for honest and constructive intellectual challenges. A government that maligns the outside world to make feel Russia great again is doomed to fail \u2014 as it failed before.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump Can and Can\u2019t Do to Dismantle Obama\u2019s Climate Rules", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byAlthough dismantling Mr. Obama\u2019s most far-reaching climate regulations can be done, it will take legal acumen and a lot of time \u2013 perhaps longer than a single presidential term. Here\u2019s a look at what Mr. Trump can and can\u2019t do, and how quickly, to roll back environmental regulations.A year ago, Mr. Obama incited the coal industry\u2019s rage with a stroke-of-the-pen executive action banning new leasing of coal mines on public lands. Mr. Trump has the same authority to undo the ban.\u201cThat was Obama hitting the pause button, and Trump can unpause it,\u201d said Richard J. Lazarus, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University. \u201cAnything that was done without a lot of process up front can be undone without much process.\u201dHowever, it\u2019s not clear how much impact this move would have on jobs or the environment. It affects only mines in Wyoming and Montana, where coal companies had for years shed jobs because of increased automation and declining coal demand.\u201cThis one is low-hanging fruit,\u201d said Mr. Lazarus of a new coal mining regulation. On Jan. 19, the day before Mr. Trump took office, the Obama administration completed a rule to reduce mountaintop-removal coal mining, which uses explosives to blast off the tops of coal-seamed mountains. Coal companies oppose the rule, which prohibits them from using the technique near streams that could be polluted by the resulting rubble.The rule will probably be undone quickly. Under the 1996 Congressional Review Act, Congress can scrap new regulations within 60 legislative days of being completed, by a simple 51-vote majority in the Senate. While the law has been used successfully only once in its 20-year history, it is expected to enjoy a newfound prominence soon. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of coal-rich Kentucky, has already vowed to use the act to undo what he calls \u201cthis regulatory assault on coal country.\u201d With the support of all 52 Republicans and probably Senator Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat, as well, the rollback of this rule is expected to be on Mr. Trump\u2019s desk within weeks.In November, the Interior Department completed a rule reining in the venting of methane, a potent planet-warming greenhouse gas, from oil and gas drilling facilities. Oil and gas companies called the rule expensive and burdensome. Like the mountaintop-mining rule, this one falls into the 60-day window allowing Congress to quickly overturn it with a 51-vote majority It is expected that the fossil fuel industry\u2019s allies in the Senate will quickly push to do so.While it can\u2019t be done quickly, there is a clear legal path for the Trump administration to undo one of the hallmarks of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policies: a 2011 regulation requiring automakers to build fleets of cars by 2025 that achieve an average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon. The rule, jointly issued by the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department, would force manufacturers to build next-generation electric cars. It could reduce carbon emissions by about six billion tons, equivalent to removing a little more than the United States\u2019 emissions of carbon pollution for an entire year.But the rule came with a loophole: a provision inserted by automakers to revisit it in 2017 if they found it too onerous. Just before Mr. Obama left office, the E.P.A. released a finding that the rule was not too costly for automakers to meet. But it did not do so jointly with the Transportation Department, leaving a legal avenue for the Trump administration to loosen the standards through that agency.The chief executives of the biggest auto companies have already asked Mr. Trump to do just that, in a meeting with him this week. While Mr. Trump did not offer specifics, he did tell the automakers that he plans to ease their regulatory burden.\u201cIt\u2019s not something that can be done with the stroke of a pen,\u201d said Jeffrey Holmstead, a former senior E.P.A. official in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration who has been mentioned as a possible deputy E.P.A. administrator in Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cIt would likely take a year or 18 months. But it\u2019s not a heavy lift, from a legal perspective.\u201dThe centerpiece of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policy is a 2015 E.P.A. rule curbing greenhouse gas emissions from electric utilities. It could shutter and replace hundreds of coal plants with wind and solar plants. Mr. Trump has vowed to eliminate the rule, but doing so could require years of court battles. He would also be required by law to come up with an alternate regulation.Mr. Obama\u2019s climate rule has already been challenged in a federal court, where it is awaiting a verdict. It is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court.The Trump administration could refuse to defend the Obama rule in court, but environmental groups could continue to argue in its favor. Meanwhile, the Trump E.P.A. would have to create its own presumably more industry-friendly regulation, which could take about 18 months. But that rule would then assuredly be subject to a federal lawsuit, which itself would probably be appealed to the Supreme Court. In one possible but bizarre outcome, both the Obama climate rule and the Trump climate rule could spend years wending their way through the same courts.\u201cThere are a number of ways this could play out as it goes through the courts, and it could take at least four to five years,\u201d said Richard Revesz, a professor of environmental law at New York University and director of the American Law Institute. \u201cUltimately, what happens to it will likely be determined by the results of the 2020 presidential election.\u201dThis obscure but powerful metric was created by Mr. Obama\u2019s economists to put a measurable price, $36 per ton, on damage inflicted by carbon pollution. Mr. Obama\u2019s E.P.A. plugged the social cost of carbon into formulas to create an economic justification for regulations that impose a measurable cost on polluters. By reducing or eliminating this metric, Mr. Trump\u2019s regulators could create an economic rationale to undo those rules and replace them with relaxed, industry-friendly ones.Mr. Obama received angry resistance from rural America over his controversial \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d regulation. It was released in 2015 under the authority of the 1972 Clean Water Act, which gave the federal government broad latitude to limit pollution in major water bodies, like the Chesapeake Bay, the Mississippi River and Puget Sound, as well as small streams and wetlands that drain into those larger waters. But groups like the American Farm Bureau Federation called the rule a land grab, and Mr. Trump has vowed to get rid of it.Mr. Trump\u2019s E.P.A. could revoke the rule. But it would be required to create a new one, venturing into complex legal territory as it tries to redefine the terms of federal waterways and wetlands. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d Mr. Holmstead said. \u201cI believe they can do it, but it\u2019s likely to take several years.\u201dAn article on Friday about what President Trump can and cannot do to dismantle Obama administration climate rules referred incorrectly to the American Law Institute of which Richard Revesz is director.

{"Headline": "Putting Faith and Sports on the Same Team", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byPrototypeFatimah Hussein was born in Somalia and immigrated to Minneapolis when she was 6 with her family, fleeing civil war. Ms. Hussein and her sister played softball when they were young, but in middle school they stopped, as did many of their Muslim peers. \u201cIt was not normal to see girls playing sports,\u201d she said of her childhood.\u201cYou\u2019d see boys continuing to play and getting support by the parents,\u201d said Ms. Hussein, now 29 and a social worker. \u201cIt\u2019s not that my dad ever said, \u2018You can\u2019t play,\u2019 but we just never got that encouragement.\u201dAnother impediment was that Ms. Hussein and her sister wore hijabs, the scarves that many Muslim women and girls use to cover their heads, ears and necks. The garments are typically made of thick fabric that wraps around the neck; some hijabs require pins as fasteners. On the playing field, hijabs are prone to unraveling, and they can be hot and unwieldy. Sometimes they\u2019re even dangerous \u2014 other players could trip on them if they unravel, or the pins could jab the wearer or others.During her childhood Ms. Hussein said she was preoccupied by thoughts of \u201cthis doesn\u2019t look right, this is falling, I don\u2019t feel comfortable inside.\u201dThe Asiya hijabs are made of a lightweight, sweat-wicking fabric, and they come in three styles with varying degrees of coverage. They don\u2019t require wrapping or pins because they\u2019re snug-fitting with built-in headbands that further secure the fabric.For Ms. Hussein, who works full-time as a social worker and had no business background, the transition into entrepreneurship presented a steep learning curve. A small corps of businesswomen in Minneapolis, along with a state senator, swooped in to help bring her product to market. Asiya\u2019s story shows how mentors can be integral to a new business\u2019s growth.A year and a half ago, an early design of what would become the Asiya hijab caught the eye of Minnesota State Senator Kari Dziedzic during a fashion show. She recognized a potential benefit to the state\u2019s Muslim girls and to the economy, in terms of job creation, so she volunteered to help connect Ms. Hussein with local entrepreneurs. One of them was Monica Nassif, the founder of the Caldrea Company and Mrs. Meyer\u2019s Clean Day, both of which make aromatic cleaning products. Ms. Nassif said she was drawn to the idea right away.\u201cI grew up in a family of athletes, and I knew the power of sport,\u201d she said.Ms. Nassif began advising Ms. Hussein on a volunteer basis, as did a couple of other businesswomen. \u201cWhat are you good at? What do you have time for?\u201d were her initial questions for Ms. Hussein, she said.The two biggest challenges to Ms. Hussein\u2019s success, as Ms. Nassif saw it, were time and money constraints. She felt strongly that Asiya needed to be the first to market in the United States, which would require the company to raise capital.\u201cIf you look at any category, the first three players get to own the shelf,\u201d she said. \u201cThe shelf in the retail store, or the shelf in the consumer\u2019s mind. It\u2019s really important to be one of the leaders.\u201dGetting any product to market quickly requires focus, and often entrepreneurs get in their own way. \u201cI call it falling in love with yourself,\u201d Ms. Nassif said. \u201cA lot of people get so enraptured with their idea that they can\u2019t actually put their head down and get the work done.\u201dWhile Ms. Hussein understood the product, she would need a partner who could help figure out how to sell it. By putting out feelers at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Carlson School of Management, Ms. Nassif found an M.B.A. student named Jamie Glover who was interested in teaming up with Ms. Hussein. Ms. Glover had spent a decade working in marketing, at 3M and at a local advertising agency. She had also played on her college\u2019s varsity softball and volleyball teams.Once she agreed to join forces with Ms. Hussein, they officially started Asiya. The company researched fabrics and had the participants in Ms. Hussein\u2019s Girls gym program test prototypes.\u201cNot only did it need to be a sweat-wicking, breathable performance fabric, but because it\u2019s on your face and neck, it had to be very lightweight, soft and stretchy,\u201d Ms. Glover said, adding that they were determined to find an American manufacturer.In order to raise money and do yet more networking, the Asiya founders entered their business plan last year in a start-up competition called the Minnesota Cup, which attracted more than 1,500 participants. Asiya won the social entrepreneurship category and was chosen as the top woman-led and minority-led business \u2014 honors that pulled in $65,000 in capital.Next year, they plan to expand the business to include swimwear and active wear, and they will market the brand not just to Muslims, but also more broadly to girls and women interested in modest apparel.Ms. Hussein and Ms. Glover have also worked to gain official approval for girls to wear their hijabs in Minnesota schools\u2019 sports competitions. A few months ago, the Asiya designs were deemed to be in compliance with safety and design standards for sports uniforms, hastening Ms. Hussein and Ms. Glover\u2019s goal: a time when \u201cwe just let girls compete,\u201d Ms. Glover said, \u201cregardless of what they want to wear.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Trump Rejects Pacific Trade Deal, Japan Fears Repeat of 1980s", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 President Trump\u2019s decision to pull the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal should have been good news for Hitoshi Kondo, a Japanese rice farmer.Mr. Kondo isn\u2019t celebrating, though.\u201cIt\u2019s actually scarier, because what comes next will be a lot harsher,\u201d he said on Wednesday, as Japanese leaders scrambled to find a coherent response.The U-turn is a setback for Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Mr. Abe viewed the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a way to advance two cherished goals: drawing the United States closer to Japan and other friendly Pacific Rim countries (the trade deal, known as TPP, does not include China, the region\u2019s increasingly bristly superpower) and bolstering Japan\u2019s lackluster economy.Such is Mr. Abe\u2019s enthusiasm for the deal that his government finished ratifying it on Friday, just before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to withdraw.On his first full workday in office, President Trump delivered on a campaign promise by abandoning the enormous trade deal that had became a flashpoint in American politics.And Mr. Trump says he wants to pursue trade agreements with individual nations, in lieu of group deals like TPP, which would have included countries comprising as much as 40 percent of the world\u2019s economic output. Japan has long preferred multilateral rule-making to head-to-head deals, but pressure to go along with Mr. Trump\u2019s approach will be strong.\u201cJapan may eventually agree to bilaterals with the U.S. to ensure that the U.S. stays engaged in Asia \u2014 both economically and to provide a security counter to China,\u201d said Glen S. Fukushima, a former United States trade official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank in Washington.Officially, Japan has not given up on the TPP, or on keeping the United States involved.The day after Mr. Trump signed his executive order committing to withdrawal, Mr. Abe said in Parliament he would \u201cresolutely continue to seek understanding\u201d from Washington of the deal\u2019s strategic and economic importance. Mr. Abe\u2019s advisers express hope that members of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet with business and national security experience will lend their voices to the effort.Sadayuki Sakakibara, chairman of Keidanren, the lobbying group representing Japan\u2019s largest corporations, encouraged Mr. Abe this week to take a two-pronged approach. Mr. Abe, he said, should try to keep the deal alive while engaging the United States directly, if necessary, \u201cwith the goal of eventually broadening negotiations to a multilateral level.\u201dBarring a drastic change in Mr. Trump\u2019s views on trade, however, that could mean stringing matters out for years \u2014 possibly until the next administration, if not longer.The TPP\u2019s demise doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat to Mr. Abe, whose poll numbers remain high. About as many Japanese voters favored the trade deal as opposed it.But none of Japan\u2019s other trade options serve Mr. Abe\u2019s goals the way TPP does.Japan and others could move on without Washington, which would require changing a condition that requires the United States to ratify the deal before it can take effect. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said on Tuesday that he had been promoting that idea to Mr. Abe and several other leaders. Japan, with the second-largest economy in the group, after the United States, would be a crucial participant.But it could be politically awkward for Mr. Abe, who sold the deal on the merits of American involvement. Even on narrow commercial grounds, he would have some explaining to do: Accepting more agricultural imports was supposed to be the price Japan paid for cheaper access to the vast United States market for cars and other manufactured goods. With the United States out of the picture, Mr. Abe could be accused of selling out farmers for little gain.Japan is negotiating other deals. One, with the European Union, predates Mr. Abe\u2019s embrace of the TPP, in 2013, but talks had been put on hold. European negotiators want concessions on agriculture, too \u2014 another reason Japanese farmers are not breathing sighs of relief. In at least one area, dairy products, European demands go beyond what Japan agreed to in the TPP.Japan is also part of an Asian trade initiative, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. But that effort is being led by China, which has that partnership\u2019s largest economy.China\u2019s rise represents perhaps the biggest change from the United States-Japan trade battles of a generation ago. For Japan, it is both an added risk and a potential buffer. Many in the Abe administration hope that Mr. Trump will target China first, making Japan a lower priority, said a senior government official involved in trade matters, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.Companies, however, are dusting off their 1980s playbooks. Japanese carmakers built factories in the United States to head off American protectionism then \u2014 investments that Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor, and others have made a recent point of highlighting. Only about a quarter of the Japanese-brand cars sold in the United States are imported, though Japan remains the source for many high-value components as well as design work.One of Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints about Japan, repeated for decades by American trade negotiators, is that its economy is organized to keep foreign products out even without overt trade barriers like tariffs. By this logic, American carmakers have failed to penetrate the Japanese market because dealers and regulators collude against them. (Japan imposes no border taxes on cars; the United States adds a 2.5 percent levy to most imported Japanese vehicles.)Japan has been addressing so-called non-tariff barriers \u2014 in some cases as a direct response to the TPP talks. It agreed during the negotiations to recognize some American automobile safety standards, for instance, and has narrowed a tax loophole that favors ultralight Japanese cars. In agriculture, Mr. Abe has moved to curb the power of Japan\u2019s monopolistic farm cooperatives.Under TPP, Japan agreed to phase out import duties on about 2,000 agricultural products, more than in any previous trade deal, but a smaller percentage of the total than other signatories. Sensitive products like rice were exempted.Mr. Kondo, the rice farmer, worries that Mr. Abe will concede more ground to the United States in order to appease Mr. Trump.\u201cWe have to sell cars to the U.S.,\u201d he said, \u201cand farmers will be traded away for access.\u201dAdvertisement"}

More than curatorial fastidiousness had kept the place from being used before as a fashion show backdrop. Massive, symbolically weighty, alluding to death and destruction, the monumental Kiefer pieces render puny both human ambition and scale.Using the work of an important artist as d\u00e9cor did no particular favors to a collection based largely on fabric innovations (asked afterward what single element meant most to him, Mr. Sartori named a kind of knitwear technology) and one that forged little new ground.Suits with sweat-pant hems, nubby wools, drop-crotch trousers, quilted gilets, neatly barbered shearling, ski pants, hoodies and boiler suits in what looked to be old teddy-bear pelts (actually cashmere alpaca) were tinted the typically offbeat hues preferred by Mr. Sartori who, like Mr. Pilati, is a master colorist.As a rule, designer honeymoons at big houses tend to be lavish affairs, and this was no exception. The problem is that hubris as outsize as Mr. Sartori\u2019s in staging a debut amid Mr. Kiefer\u2019s colossal towers can almost be counted on to leave a viewer with the impression of an elephant giving birth to a mouse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Debt Projected to Grow by Nearly $10 Trillion Over Next Decade", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byThe deficit figures released Tuesday will be a major challenge to House Republicans, who were swept to power in 2010 on fears of a bloated deficit and who made controlling red ink a major part of their agenda under former President Barack Obama.Statutory caps imposed in 2011 on domestic and military spending have helped temper the deficit. But those controls are likely to be swamped by health care and Social Security spending that will rise with an aging population.At a confirmation hearing on Tuesday, senators from both parties peppered Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to be the White House budget director, with questions about how Mr. Trump intended to keep his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare while addressing the budget shortfall.Mr. Mulvaney said that it would be his role to deliver hard truths to Mr. Trump. One of those truths, he suggested, could be the need to raise the eligibility age for Social Security, a proposal that is sure to be contentious.\u201cI haven\u2019t been quiet and shy since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cI have to imagine the president knew what he was getting when he asked me to fill this role. I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s why he hired me.\u201dHe added, \u201cI believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later.\u201dThe deficit is expected to shrink this fiscal year and next before increasing in 2019 and beyond. Deficits would cumulatively total $9.4 trillion from 2018 to 2027, the budget office projects. By 2023, the deficit would reach $1 trillion, and in 2027, a projected $1.4 trillion deficit would be equal to 5 percent of the economy.Most economists believe that deficits are helpful when economies are in recession, but some say that when they are near full employment, as the United States economy is now, deficits should be kept below 3 percent of the economy to avoid a drag on investment \u2014 or worse, a financial crisis.The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s budget and economic outlook said that the share of debt held by the public was expected to reach 89 percent of gross domestic product in 2027. That level could increase the risk of a financial crisis and raise the possibility that investors will become skittish about financing the government\u2019s borrowing, some economists say, although many countries have far higher debt levels.\u201cWithout changes to the federal budget, we are on a path to fiscal crisis with spending, deficits and debt continuing to balloon out of control,\u201d said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the group.Besides the deficit, tepid economic growth is also a concern. Over the next 10 years, real economic output is projected to grow at an annual rate of 1.9 percent.Mr. Trump has promised that his combination of tax cuts and investment in infrastructure will push growth above 4 percent, and Mr. Mulvaney argued on Tuesday that spurring growth was the most effective way of reducing the debt without imposing painful cuts to social safety-net programs.Some senators such as Angus King, independent of Maine, warned against a return to much-debated theories that tax cuts would generate enough growth to pay for themselves and reduce the deficit.Democrats are likely to oppose large tax cuts, but they will press Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to spend big on infrastructure. Senate Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a $1 trillion plan to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads, bridges, rails, transit systems, airports, sewer systems and power grid. \u201cWe will not cut middle-class programs like education and health care to pay for it,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.When it was pointed out that he was proposing the kind of deficit spending that Republicans were sure to balk at, Mr. Schumer was dismissive.\u201cWe Democrats believe that this should be a measure to get the economy going,\u201d he said.Republicans are pressing their own spending priorities, urging passage of legislation that would lift statutory spending caps on national defense, imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, while leaving in place the caps on domestic spending.In one of the testier exchanges of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s two confirmation hearings on Tuesday, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, actually pressed the nominee to accept more military spending, castigating him for struggling to remember his House votes to cut military budgets.\u201cBoy, I\u2019ll tell you, I would remember if I voted to cut our defenses the way you did, Congressman,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t take it with the seriousness that it deserves.\u201dLike many of Mr. Trump\u2019s picks, Mr. Mulvaney has taken positions that contradict Mr. Trump, and it remained unclear how that dynamic would play out in the White House if he is confirmed.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the former Democratic presidential candidate, said that Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s views on the deficit, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid were out of sync with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to protect the programs. He said he feared that Mr. Mulvaney would pull the president to the right.\u201cIt does not make sense to me to have a key adviser to the president having views directly in opposition to what the president campaigned on,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Despite the concern about a growing deficit, the tenor of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s nomination hearings did not reflect the sense of anxiety that was palpable when Mr. Obama was assembling his economic team during the financial crisis eight years ago. The economy, now growing steadily, appears to be giving policy makers time.The Congressional Budget Office report said the economy was on \u201csolid ground,\u201d with increasing output and job growth on the horizon, a sharp contrast to the \u201ccarnage\u201d detailed by Mr. Trump in his inaugural address.Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

As he roams the backlands rodeo circuit in his Mitsubishi Titan pickup, the competitions where Mr. Lima works are often as much about him as they are about bull-riding buckaroos.At a rodeo here in Goi\u00e2nia on a recent Friday night, scantily clad female dancers warmed up the arena before Mr. Lima burst onto the scene around midnight, his arrival heralded by fireworks, a nightclub smoke machine, cannons discharging confetti into the air and a dance involving a good deal of strutting by Mr. Lima himself.After singing Brazil\u2019s national anthem, he led competitors in a lengthy prayer before getting on with the event. He often cracks jokes, exudes pride in Brazil\u2019s ranching culture and bursts into song while describing the technical aspects of the cowpokes competing for prize money.\u201cI love the United States and recognize how much we owe to the rodeo scene up there, but the folks in Brazil expect a little more from their rodeo announcers,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat am I, essentially? A storyteller.\u201dMr. Lima got into radio announcing after studying three things: law, journalism and how to be a clown. He said it was during his time at clown school in Rio, when he was trying to find a way into show business, \u201cthat I learned the valuable lesson of laughing at my own failures.\u201dA self-described \u201cbastard son of a rancher,\u201d Mr. Lima was raised by his mother, a shopkeeper, in Barretos, a city in S\u00e3o Paulo State that has long been an epicenter of the Brazilian rodeo scene. Mr. Lima travels extensively throughout the year to various farming regions, but still lives in Barretos with his wife and son.\u201cObviously, I needed a new name, something that spoke to the greatness of the interior of Brazil,\u201d he said about his stage name. Cuiabanno refers to people from Cuiab\u00e1, the frontier capital of Mato Grosso, a western state with burgeoning farming enterprises.In a country where animal-rights activists have grown more vocal in recent years, not everyone appreciates Mr. Lima\u2019s exaltation of Brazil\u2019s agribusiness prowess.\u201cCuibanno is nothing more than an amusing court jester in a rodeo scene dominated by wealthy ranchers and corporate sponsors,\u201d said Leandro Ferro, president of I Hate Rodeo, a nonprofit group in S\u00e3o Paulo seeking to raise awareness about claims of animal cruelty at Brazil\u2019s rodeos.Mr. Lima chafes at such criticism, contending that his critics are unrealistic about the significance of agriculture and ranching in contemporary society. \u201cNot everyone can go organic, eating leaves in expensive pretty packages,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world needs animal protein, and Brazil supplies it.\u201dDespite championing such feats, along with his own rising prominence, Mr. Lima contends that elites in cities like S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio opt to ignore the signs around them that Brazil\u2019s ranching culture, with its conservative values, is gaining prominence.In Brazilian politics, for instance, a powerful bloc representing large landowners and large-scale agricultural interests exerts considerable sway in Congress. And a subgenre of Brazilian country music called \u201csertanejo universit\u00e1rio,\u201d tapping the aspirations of the college-educated middle class, has surged in popularity.\u201cWe produce the country\u2019s wealth and increasingly the culture that people consume, but the interior of Brazil remains neglected,\u201d Mr. Lima said. \u201cSomething in this equation has got to give.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump on Tuesday named as his chief trade negotiator a Washington lawyer who has long advocated protectionist policies, the latest sign that Mr. Trump intends to fulfill his campaign promise to get tough with China, Mexico and other trading partners.Mainstream economists warn that protectionist policies like import taxes could impose higher prices on consumers and slow economic growth.\u201cWe wanted him to know that we\u2019ll work with him on doing that,\u201d Mr. Trumka said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has enough Republican support to do it, and rewriting the rules of trade is a necessary first step in righting the economy for working people.\u201dMr. Trump and his top advisers on trade, including Mr. Lighthizer, share a view that the United States in recent decades prioritized the ideal of free trade over its own self-interest. They argue that other countries are undermining America\u2019s industrial base by subsidizing their own export industries while impeding American importers. They regard this unfair competition as a key reason for the lackluster growth of the economy.In picking Mr. Lighthizer, who has spent much of the last few decades representing American steel producers in their frequent litigation of trade disputes, Mr. Trump is seeking to hire one of Washington\u2019s top trade lawyers to enforce international trade agreements more vigorously. He must be confirmed by the Senate.\u201cHe will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement.Mainstream Republicans have sought common ground with Mr. Trump, emphasizing, for example, the importance of enforcing trade rules, but they have not abandoned the party\u2019s longtime advocacy for trade. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which will hold hearings on Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s nomination, issued a cautiously supportive statement Tuesday.\u201cAs the world and our economic competitors move to expand their global footprints, we can\u2019t afford to be left behind in securing strong deals that will increase our access to new markets for American-made products and services,\u201d Mr. Hatch said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to a vigorous discussion of Bob\u2019s trade philosophy and priorities.\u201d\u201cThose who say U.S.T.R. will be subordinated to other agencies are mistaken,\u201d said Alan Wolff, another former senior American trade official who was the steel industry\u2019s co-counsel on trade with Mr. Lighthizer for nearly 20 years, citing Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge of trade law. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a dominant figure on trade, in harmony with Wilbur Ross and Navarro.\u201dProponents of trade hope the broader circle, and congressional Republicans, will exert a moderating influence.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a pretty clear indication that there will be a focus on the enforcement of our trade agreements and on the letter of the law,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer at White & Case. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a significant turn toward protectionism. Even free trade guys like me support enforcement.\u201dTrade opponents on the left and the right, meanwhile, are hoping Mr. Trump means to break with several decades of pro-trade policy.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a war within the Trump administration on where they go with trade, and we\u2019re hoping to energize the worker base he had to make sure they go in the right direction to benefit the American worker,\u201d Mr. Trumka said.A broader shift in trade policy would unfold more slowly. Mr. Trump has promised to renegotiate Nafta; the original process took most of three years. He has promised to pursue enforcement actions against other nations, but it takes time to mount cases. He has threatened to impose new tariffs on imports, but sweeping changes most likely would require congressional legislation.Mr. Trump already is seeking to exert influence by seizing the presidential bullhorn.\u201cGeneral Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,\u201d he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. \u201cMake in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\u201dGeneral Motors announced in 2015 that it would make the Cruze in Coahuila, Mexico. American manufacturers are moving small-car production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs and because of declining domestic demand. They continue to build more expensive vehicles in the United States.Ford\u2019s announcement Tuesday does not reverse that trend. The carmaker said it still planned to move production of the compact Ford Focus from Michigan to Mexico. But it said it would invest in a different Michigan plant to expand production of higher-priced vehicles, including its F-150 pickup truck and the Mustang sports car, as well as a new battery-powered sport utility vehicle.\u201cWe are encouraged by the pro-growth policies that President-elect Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue,\u201d said the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields.Mr. Lighthizer served as deputy United States trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration, when he was involved in pressing Japan to reduce its restrictions on American imports and its subsidies for its own exports. Mr. Trump has criticized China for similar practices, setting the stage for a new round of confrontations.Reagan is often remembered as an advocate for free trade, but his administration in its early hours imposed a quota on Japanese auto imports. It was the first in a long series of measures aimed at putting pressure on the nation that was then regarded, like China in recent years, as a threat to American prosperity.Keith Bradsher and Neal E.

There was a cardboard cutout of Mr. Trump, too._____For her part, Dianna spent the past year working tirelessly for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, spending her own money and countless hours to get him elected. She was even a delegate at the Republican convention.She also lived for years in Cambridge, where Hillary Clinton won 88 percent of the vote. (Mr. Trump got 6 percent.) She has a rare ability to move back and forth between the two worlds.She has a lot to say about both.She had never really been that interested in politics. She grew up in Boston in the 1970s. Her dad worked as a school bus driver. Her mom raised four children and tended bar.\u201cWe were all Democrats back then,\u201d she says. \u201cForty years later, we are all Republicans.\u201dMiles driven: 0. Miles to go: 470._____It\u2019s like a giant extended family all chattering at once.Her journey to this point has been quite a trip of its own.Dianna\u2019s adult life happened suddenly and soon. She got pregnant as a freshman in high school \u2014 a Catholic school. She was afraid. She says she got through it by putting each part of her life in a different room and closing the door. At graduation, she was the student council president.She thought she should go to college, but now she had a daughter. She had an underachiever boyfriend. She had no money. And her family did not understand what college would get her. It took her 10 years to finish community college.She worked in a bank, painting houses, as a secretary in an auto-body shop. In her mid-30s, she decided to go to nursing school. She worked in cardiac surgery, in psychiatry, in urgent care. She did well, but she didn\u2019t like it.What she really liked was volunteering. And organizing.She knew nothing about running, but became the director of a private track club, managing 25 coaches and 200 kids ages 8 to 14, and raising the money to support it. When she had the kids sell a coupon book with discounts from local businesses, it was the highest-grossing fund-raiser the club had ever run.Miles driven: 71. Miles to go: 399._____\u201cHere you go, honey,\u201d she says kindly. \u201cSit down. You don\u2019t look so good.\u201dI\u2019m drinking a full sugar Coke, and my stomach is already starting to feel better.Miles driven: 83. Miles to go: 387._____\u201cThe Partridge Family?! Are you nuts?\u201d says Scott.\u201cI have Abba,\u201d she says. \u201cNeil Diamond. Chicago. Bee Gees. But I love the Partridge Family.\u201dScott: \u201cOh boy.\u201dThe music begins to play.\u201cI woke up in love this morning. Went to sleep with you on my mind.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated song,\u201d she says, laughing.Miles driven: 92. Miles to go: 378._____\u201cUncomfortable,\u201d she says.As much as she is part of the Trump team, she tries to avoid alienating people. Maybe that comes from having lived in Cambridge. Maybe that comes from her personality as a networker.\u201cI try to encourage people not to yell,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a little meeting with women who are part of the volunteer team. I said, \u2018If our goal is getting people to go toward Trump, criticizing them isn\u2019t the right way. It makes you look bad, too.\u2019 \u201d\u201cI don\u2019t attack people personally,\u201d she adds. \u201cExcept if I\u2019m by myself and the TV is on.\u201dShe pops an Abba album into the truck\u2019s CD player.Miles driven: 126. Miles to go: 344._____Her move toward politics, she explains, was less a burning ideological expression and more an affinity for people, and for bringing them together. She was good at leading people, but the world was also changing.In 2015, she sold her house in Cambridge and quit nursing to focus on an invention that involves beverages.\u201cI was living in my camper in Framingham in my friend\u2019s yard,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were liberal. Stuff was happening \u2014 San Bernardino, Paris. I\u2019d think: I don\u2019t know if I agree with them.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, she felt no sudden spark, she says. But his message steadily seeped in, like a slow-motion realization about herself and her beliefs: one she had always had, but had never really considered.\u201cPeople were lying down everywhere,\u201d she says, recalling protests about police violence. \u201cThey were lying down in Harvard Square. They were lying down on Route 93. They blocked traffic for three hours. Ninety-three is a really congested road; you want to pull your hair out anyway. To shut it down? What the hell is going on? What are these people doing?\u201dAt some point, she registered as a Republican.\u201cI was trying to find out who I am in this whole crazy mess,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I had to take a stand. It was just crazy. I couldn\u2019t understand it.\u201dMiles driven: 135. Miles to go: 335._____\u201cAll I knew about him was that reality show,\u201d she says.But when she tuned in, she realized he appealed to her. \u201cI really liked Trump\u2019s pro-America thing. I grew up, I went to Catholic school. We did the Pledge of Allegiance every day. That was important.\u201d\u201cI started to pay attention not to what he was saying, but to the effect that he had. The freedom of speech things. He said outrageous things but so what. People would get so worked up over outrageous things.\u201d\u201cHe was the tough guy. I like that he stood up for himself. He didn\u2019t take any garbage from people. He retaught people how to have their self-respect. He showed that you can stand up for yourself.\u201dMiles driven: 142. Miles to go: 328._____\u201cThe guy behind the counter said, \u2018We don\u2019t do politics,\u2019\u201d Dianna reports. \u201cI told him we just needed some fries.\u201dA woman in a puffy blue jacket sitting at the window bangs on the glass with her fist. Having caught our attention, she points her finger at the cardboard Trump and gives a deep thumbs-down motion.We are standing in the parking lot, and two women walk briskly up to Dianna.\u201cI love Mr. Trump, trust me,\u201d says Lillia Millard, a retired translator who was born in Russia and now lives in West Norwalk. \u201cHe says it like it is, just like me.\u201dDianna asks if she is going to watch the inauguration.\u201cYes!\u201d she says enthusiastically.Her daughter, a journalist, will not. \u201cShe\u2019s going to the women\u2019s march, unfortunately,\u201d Ms. Millard says, adding, \u201cI still have until Saturday to talk her out of it.\u201dScott gives her a Trump-Pence bumper sticker, and we pull back out onto the highway to the music of Grand Funk Railroad.Miles driven: 202. Miles to go: 268._____It is in the final minutes.\u201cThere are a lot more good people than bad in this country,\u201d he says.Dianna says back: \u201cYeah. I agree with that. I do.\u201dHe says that he curses more behind closed doors.\u201cSo do I,\u201d Dianna says.He is talking about his daughters. He keeps going. He says he believes in this country. Dianna stops agreeing.\u201cDo you believe he believes in this country?\u201d I ask her.\u201cNo,\u201d she replies. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201dI ask her why.\u201cFor all these years, people said all this stuff about him and I didn\u2019t believe them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he has done so much to harm America. He basically tried to be Robin Hood. His trade policies. His willingness to try to take away from people who had more and give to those who had less.\u201dMiles driven: 207. Miles to go: 263._____Now, she is glad to see him go. Part of that is because of policing.\u201cThen he said, \u2018Trayvon Martin could have been my son.\u2019 Maybe that\u2019s what he\u2019s thinking, but when he says something like that as a leader, people listen. I had this like, \u2018What?\u2019 I was confused by that. What are you doing?\u201dShe added: \u201cThings have changed in terms of the criminality. People will do anything. They are going up to cops and executing them. People are blowing themselves up. They are ramming trucks into things. If you alienate the police, then we are going to have no law and order.\u201dOn Mr. Obama, she said: \u201cWhen you are the leader, there are times when you have to bite your tongue.\u201dShe added: \u201cI feel the irony in that, because people will say Donald Trump doesn\u2019t bite his tongue. I want to see how it plays out once he\u2019s president. I don\u2019t know the answer.\u201dMiles driven: 207. Miles to go: 263._____I\u2019m asking Dianna and Scott about immigration.For Scott, economics undergirds his thinking. Two friends used to give him a lot of landscaping work 10 or 15 years ago, but have since stopped; they have Latin American employees now. Another client, who recently sold a company for millions, said he wanted to cut Scott\u2019s rate to $20 an hour from $30 and asked him if he could learn Spanish to manage a work crew.\u201cFundamentally, it\u2019s not fair,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m working seven days a week now so I can carry myself through the winter. They say Republicans want the cheaper labor and Democrats want the votes. But I think they both want cheaper labor. People with money just want cheaper labor.\u201dHe says he does not blame the laborers, but is angry with politicians who talk as if it were not a problem.\u201cIf I was a poor person south of the border, I\u2019d probably do the same thing,\u201d he says.Scott, 58, who lives in Beverly, Mass., has led rafting trips in Texas on the Rio Grande for years. In 2010, he says, he was at the end of a rafting trip when he saw five people trying to cross the river. They appeared to be asking him to help them across. He kept going.Several months later, Janet Napolitano \u2014 then the secretary of homeland security \u2014 was nearby, in Laredo, Tex., and said the border had never been more secure. Scott says he did not believe her.\u201cYou lose your language, border and your culture, you\u2019re going to lose your country,\u201d he says, sounding one of the president-elect\u2019s campaign themes. \u201cYour country is done.\u201dMiles driven: 240. Miles to go: 230._____Dianna: \u201cDo you like lobster?\u201dScott: \u201cI like it, but it\u2019s expensive.\u201dDianna: \u201cI just don\u2019t like fighting with my food.\u201dScott: \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s really good is the tail.\u201dDianna: \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s really good is the butter. Anything tastes good dipped in butter.\u201dMiles driven: 296. Miles to go: 174._____MOUNT HOLLY, N.J., 7:38 p.m. \u201cO.K., there\u2019s country music in the bathroom,\u201d she said. \u201cIt smells nice \u2014 like candles or something.\u201dShe surveys the store. She looks at a wall full of coffee mugs with names on them: Grandpa. Papa. Mom.\u201cLook at all these cups. It\u2019s spewing happiness. It\u2019s like a quaint little town or something.\u201dWe left because there was no table with an outlet near it for Dianna or me.Miles driven: 318. Miles to go: 152._____\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t deliver on the economy, I\u2019ll be disappointed,\u201d Scott says. \u201cHe says he\u2019s going to change the tax rate for the middle class. That\u2019s huge for me. I bought a house five years ago and the taxes have gone up $200 every single year.\u201dScott doesn\u2019t trusts the elites \u2014 entrenched politicians with money.\u201cI don\u2019t trust McCain, I don\u2019t trust Rubio, I don\u2019t trust Paul Ryan,\u201d he says. \u201cI love Trump for calling out the elites and the ruling class for who they are. Because they have forgotten about the working man and working woman.\u201dHe is also suspicious of the term \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\u201dDianna says: \u201cAnytime a politician uses the word comprehensive, it makes you think they are lying. It\u2019s just an empty word. Smoke and mirrors. They throw big words around, make it look like they are actually doing something. Makes people feel like, almost like they are not smart enough to understand what they are doing.\u201dShe added, \u201cI think Trump will deliver.\u201dOur dinner comes. Two shrimp salads and a burger.Miles driven: 319. Miles to go: 151._____\u201cWhat!?\u201d Dianna says in mock shock. \u201cGot to pay for that wall somehow.\u201dEverybody laughs.We pull up to the cash lane. An older woman in a wool hat, glasses and a yellow security vest hands us change.Holding up the Trump cardboard cutout, Dianna asks: \u201cDo you know who this is?\u201dThe woman responds in a deadpan voice: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him in my life.\u201dBut when she is asked if she likes him, a smile creeps onto her face. \u201cThumbs up,\u201d she says.Miles driven: 366. Miles to go: 104._____\u201cI\u2019m getting out my bell bottoms,\u201d says Scott drily.I sing for a while. Dianna does too. Then I ask about health care.\u201cI spent probably $20,000 on health care last year,\u201d Dianna says. She was paying about $850 a month through a private plan she bought herself. But her deductible for out-of-network care jumped to $4,500 from $3,000. In-network, she says, jumped to $3,000 from $2,000.Dianna, who has been living off the proceeds from the sale of her house in Cambridge, says she could have gotten insured through Obamacare last year, because she was not working. But she chose not to.\u201cI said, Dianna, how can you go on food stamps and get free health care if you are volunteering for Trump? I thought it would be the wrong thing to do.\u201dBut now she has Obamacare. She is helping to support her father, she explains, and her budget has gotten tight.\u201cI don\u2019t feel good that I had to do that,\u201d she says. \u201cI have more control over my life when I have better health insurance. It\u2019s also about pride.\u201dMiles driven: 381. Miles to go: 89._____Whatever happens with Mr. Trump, Scott Hayes has already won something important: a deep network of people who think like him. He has a flip phone. He is not on Facebook. But he believes he will hold on to those new connections. They have revived him. Made him feel more alive.\u201cI always felt so alone, like nobody wanted to hear what I was saying,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019d go to these rallies just to see if there were other people who thought like I did. Now I\u2019m meeting all kinds of people. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201dDianna wants to keep up the momentum with all the people she has met, too. Like the woman named May who owns a Chinese restaurant in Newton, Mass., and who went up to New Hampshire on Tuesdays with some of her staff to volunteer.Dianna organized a Christmas party for Trump supporters in Massachusetts in December. There was Champagne on every table. The cardboard cutout of Trump was there, too.\u201cI\u2019m relieved,\u201d she says. \u201cHe won. I think he\u2019s going to deliver.\u201d_____There is a view of the Washington Monument.\u201cWow, it\u2019s huge,\u201d Dianna says, looking out a long glass sliding door.\u201cThis is, like, pretty fancy.\u201dScott stands the president-elect up.I ask the two of them how it feels to be at the end of this 13-hour-plus journey.\u201cIt\u2019s the end, but it\u2019s the beginning,\u201d Dianna says. \u201cNow, it\u2019s a new chapter in our lives, for the country, for Mr. Trump. Let\u2019s see what he can do.\u201dMiles driven: 470. Miles to go: 0.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dozens of Inmates Killed as Prison Violence Escalates in Brazil", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byThe harrowing scenes on Friday from the latest prison riot in Brazil, in which 31 inmates were killed in the northern state of Roraima in the Amazon River Basin, pushed the death toll to 93 in six days of mayhem in penitentiaries around the country.The bloodshed has shocked the country and is emerging as the most pressing crisis facing President Michel Temer, whose beleaguered government was already grappling with graft scandals, a weak economy and simmering anger over austerity measures.\u201cThe bloodshed is revealing a war between drug gangs, a failed prison system and a weak government,\u201d said Rafael Alcadipani, a scholar who specializes in public security policies at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a leading Brazilian university. \u201cAnd now the horror is spreading.\u201dThe gangs, which operate inside prisons as well as on the streets of many Brazilian cities, are battling for supremacy over the trade in cocaine smuggled into Brazil across the porous Amazonian frontier from countries like Bolivia, Colombia and Peru.The prison was built for 700 inmates but currently holds about 1,400. Carlos Paix\u00e3o de Oliveira, a prosecutor in Roraima, publicly criticized the management of the facility in October, when inmates from the P.C.C. gang killed at least 10 rivals from Red Command.Mr. Oliveira suggested at the time that the prison should be demolished and replaced.\u201cIf they want, the inmates will carry out a new slaughter in there, because no one has control of that prison,\u201d he said.Despite the writing in blood on Friday proclaiming the supremacy of the P.C.C., the authorities contended that the latest killings did not involve score-settling between gangs but a power struggle within the P.C.C. itself, or an effort to project power by the gang.\u201cWe\u2019ve been on guard about something like this for some time, transferring prisoners from Red Command to other units,\u201d said Uziel Castro, the top security official in Roraima. \u201cWe think this had to do with an internal battle.\u201dHuman rights groups compare the current string of uprisings to the Carandiru prison massacre in 1992 in S\u00e3o Paulo, when the police stormed the facility and killed 111 inmates. An appeals court recently voided the convictions of 73 police officers for their participation in the killings.The problems in Brazil\u2019s prisons that led to earlier episodes of carnage have intensified with the growing drug trade, security experts say. Brazil\u2019s prison population has swelled this century as the authorities lock up more people on minor drug offenses.\u201cThis war between the criminal factions is worsening,\u201d said Antonio Cl\u00e1udio Mariz de Oliveira, a former security official in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThe problem is largely a result of the lack of attention towards the prison system, both by the government and the public.\u201d\u201cPeople only react when there\u2019s an episode like this,\u201d said Mr. Mariz de Oliveira. \u201cThen they forget about it until the next one.\u201dIndeed, some elected officials have expressed the hardened views held by crime-weary voters. Jos\u00e9 Melo, the governor of Amazonas State, said \u201cthere were no saints\u201d among the dozens of inmates killed in the state\u2019s prisons this week, calling the victims murderers, rapists or gang members.At the same time, officials in Mr. Temer\u2019s administration have tried to play down the prison crisis. \u201cThe situation is not out of control,\u201d said Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes.Paula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Vinod Sreeharsha from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaders Abroad, Joyful or Wary, Face Uncertainty of Trump Era", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 There was dismay in Britain, applause in Russia and silence in Japan. French populists found hope, Mexican leaders expressed concern and Germany\u2019s vice chancellor offered an allusion to his country\u2019s dark past.In his first speech as president of the United States, Donald J. Trump showed the world he could be as divisive abroad as he is at home. His vow to place America first \u2014 and his threat to upend longstanding alliances, trade deals and many other tenets of the liberal democratic order the nation has chosen for nearly 70 years \u2014 was received across the globe with fear, silence and glee, sometimes within the same country.In searching for a historical analogy, some in Britain reached back to the 1930s, when a bleaker vision of the world prevailed with America on the sidelines. China imposed unusually tight state control over coverage of the inaugural, though state media highlighted \u201cviolent\u201d protests in the United States. In the Philippines, nationalists set fire to an effigy of Mr. Trump, while the country\u2019s president welcomed his American counterpart\u2019s apparent willingness to stop telling other leaders how to govern.In Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May said she would tell a skeptical Mr. Trump how important NATO and the European Union are for European and world stability. \u201cWith the threats we face, it\u2019s not the time for less cooperation,\u201d Mrs. May, who is supposed to travel to Washington soon, told The Financial Times.Nationalist movements embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s words as a validation. The far-right French politician Marine Le Pen, a serious candidate in presidential elections this spring, declared that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory had opened \u201ca new era in the cooperation between nations.\u201dThe mixed reaction reflected the global uncertainty about what a Trump presidency would look like \u2014 and the divided world into which he steps. A fractured landscape of self-interest \u2014 whether from rising nationalist movements in many European countries, an emboldened Russia or longstanding allies such as Britain or Japan \u2014 underscored the confused, and often contradictory, responses. He is, in some ways, a Rorschach test for a polarized world.\u201cTime to buckle your seatbelts and cross your fingers,\u201d said Marcos Troyjo, a Brazilian economist and diplomat.For those hoping the president would sound different from the candidate, there was little comfort in his address.In Germany, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel warned of a \u201cdrastic radicalization\u201d in American politics and said Berlin stood ready to fill the void left by an isolationist Washington. The only thing missing was a denunciation of Parliament as a \u201cgossip chamber,\u201d he added, using a term that fascists applied to German institutions in the 1920s.Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would approach relations with Washington through the traditional channels of existing international agreements, including the Group of 20, which Germany will host this year. \u201cEven when there are differing opinions, possibilities and compromise are always best found through respectful exchange with one another,\u201d she said.For a world confronting a tide of populist rage, his words both soothed and frightened. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, battling nationalist currents in his own country, did not even wait for Mr. Trump to give his address before offering his take.\u201cWe are in an open world economy, and it is not possible nor advisable to want to be isolated from the world economy,\u201d he said.In Mexico, which Mr. Trump has made a whipping boy for the false promise of trade and the threat of migration, the response from President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who plans to deliver his own address on foreign policy on Monday, was almost immediate. On Twitter, after a congratulatory note, he wrote: \u201cSovereignty, national interest and the protection of Mexicans will guide our relationship with the new government of the United States.\u201dAnd an influential member of the president\u2019s governing party, Manlio Fabio Beltrones, warned in a speech after Mr. Trump\u2019s Inaugural Address that \u201ca weak and offended neighbor is not a good ally.\u201dYet the response was not all bad.There were the usual gestures of cooperation, mixed with hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s angry and nationalistic words would not mean an American retreat from global responsibility. There was also joy, whether among nationalist parties or global powers long at odds with the United States.Russia, where often vicious mockery of Barack Obama has for months been a state-sponsored national sport, responded with glee to Mr. Obama\u2019s departure from office and the arrival of President Trump.The inauguration received blanket coverage on state media, with Rossiya 24, a round-the-clock television news channel, broadcasting the entire ceremony and Mr. Trump\u2019s address live, along with scenes of anti-Trump demonstrators smashing shop windows in Washington.Stirring particular delight among Russian politicians and commentators were Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks in his inaugural address about the need \u201cto unite the civilized world against radical Islam.\u201d One of Russia\u2019s biggest gripes against Mr. Obama was that he criticized President Vladimir V. Putin for supporting the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, a position that Moscow presented as tantamount to supporting terrorism.In France, Ms. Le Pen, the National Front leader, lauded the British vote to leave the European Union and Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cIn 2016, the Anglo-Saxon world woke up,\u201d she said. \u201cIn 2017, I am sure it will be the year of peoples across the continent rising up!\u201dMs. Le Pen was to join other far-right leaders from Germany, Italy and the Netherlands in the German city of Koblenz on Saturday, just a day after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, at a conference to consult and celebrate what they consider a popular shift in their direction.And in saying nothing, some world leaders seemed to embrace the new reality, seeking to accommodate a galvanizing political force whose message has been echoed in mass movements across continents.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who was the first world leader to meet with Mr. Trump after his election in November, said nothing publicly after Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. But in a congratulatory message to Mr. Trump after the inauguration, the Japanese news media reported, he called Japan\u2019s alliance with the United States an \u201caxis of Japan\u2019s foreign and security policies,\u201d even though Mr. Trump was vocal as a candidate in attacking Japanese trade practices and questioning American military support for the country.In China, which also offered no public response, the silence was notable for another reason.It appeared to have been codified in an explicit directive. China Digital Times, an American-based website that tracks Chinese media and reports regularly on leaked orders from China\u2019s propaganda apparatus, published a directive that forbade the country\u2019s online news organizations to run photographs of the inauguration or to include it among their top five news stories of the day.Notwithstanding a few aberrations, the words of analysts were less muted, freed from the constraints of political niceties and the obligation of world leaders to work with the new American president.In Japan, Goro Hashimoto, a special editor at the right-leaning Yomiuri Shimbun, the world\u2019s largest-circulation newspaper, compared Mr. Trump\u2019s speech to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s inaugural address \u2014 and not favorably.\u201cWhen I heard Kennedy\u2019s speech when I was a child, I was so excited,\u201d he said. \u201cHe talked about American values as well as the benefits for the world. Trump didn\u2019t talk in that way.\u201dZhang Zhe, a Chinese student who is pursuing a doctorate in political science at Brown University in Rhode Island, watched Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration with his parents. The picture Mr. Trump presented of \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d he said in an email, did not register with the family.\u201cMy parents have only been in America for a few months and they don\u2019t know much about it, but even they could not bear what Trump said,\u201d Mr. Zhang wrote. \u201cMy father asked me, \u2018This president, why does he describe the United States as a society that is worse off than China\u2019s old feudal society?\u2019\u201dThe shift in policy left some determined to forge a path without the United States as the leader.Still, amid the hand-wringing of establishment voices worried about a return to a less globalized world, there was a silver lining.Azam Ahmed reported from Mexico City, Steven Erlanger from London, and Gerry Mullany from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "The Internal Invasion", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byThis is a remarkable day in the history of our country. We have never over our centuries inaugurated a man like Donald Trump as president of the United States. You can select any random group of former presidents \u2014 Madison, Lincoln, Hoover, Carter \u2014 and none of them are like Trump.We\u2019ve never had a major national leader as professionally unprepared, intellectually ill informed, morally compromised and temperamentally unfit as the man taking the oath on Friday. So let\u2019s not lessen the shock factor that should reverberate across this extraordinary moment.It took a lot to get us here. It took a once-in-a-century societal challenge \u2014 the stresses and strains brought by the global information age \u2014 and it took a political system that was too detached and sclerotic to understand and deal with them.There are many ways to capture this massive failure, but I\u2019d rely on the old sociological distinction between gemeinschaft and gesellschaft. All across the world, we have masses of voters who live in a world of gemeinschaft: where relationships are personal, organic and fused by particular affections. These people define their loyalty to community, faith and nation in personal, in-the-gut sort of ways.But we have a leadership class and an experience of globalization that is from the world of gesellschaft: where systems are impersonal, rule based, abstract, indirect and formal.Many people in Europe love their particular country with a vestigial affection that is like family \u2014 England, Holland or France. But meritocratic elites of Europe gave them an abstract intellectual construct called the European Union.Many Americans think their families and their neighborhoods are being denuded by the impersonal forces of globalization, finance and technology. All the Republican establishment could offer was abstract paeans to the free market. All the Democrats could offer was Hillary Clinton, the ultimate cautious, remote, calculating, gesellschaft thinker.It was the right moment for Trump, the ultimate gemeinschaft man. He is all gut instinct, all blood and soil, all about loyalty over detached reason. His business is a pre-modern family clan, not an impersonal corporation, and he is staffing his White House as a pre-modern family monarchy, with his relatives and a few royal retainers. In his business and political dealings, he simply doesn\u2019t acknowledge the difference between private and public, personal and impersonal. Everything is personal, pulsating outward from his needy core.The very thing that made him right electorally for this moment will probably make him an incompetent president. He is the ultimate anti-institutional man, but the president sits at the nerve center of a routinized, regularized four-million-person institution. If the figure at the center can\u2019t give consistent, clear and informed direction, the whole system goes haywire, with vicious infighting and creeping anarchy.Some on the left worry that we are seeing the rise of fascism, a new authoritarian age. That gets things exactly backward. The real fear in the Trump era should be that everything will become disorganized, chaotic, degenerate, clownish and incompetent.The real fear should be that Trump is Captain Chaos, the ignorant dauphin of disorder. All the standard practices, norms, ways of speaking and interacting will be degraded and shredded. The political system and the economy will grind to a battered crawl.That\u2019s ultimately why this could be a pivotal day. For the past few decades our leadership class has been polarized. We\u2019ve wondered if there is some opponent out there that could force us to unite and work together. Well, that opponent is being inaugurated, not in the form of Trump the man, but in the form of the chaos and incompetence that will likely radiate from him, month after month. For America to thrive, people across government will have to cooperate and build arrangements to quarantine and work around the president.People in the defense, diplomatic and intelligence communities will have to build systems to prevent him from intentionally or unintentionally bumbling into a global crisis. People in his administration and in Congress will have to create systems so his ill-informed verbal spasms don\u2019t derail coherent legislation.If Trump\u2019s opponents behave as clownishly as he does \u2014 like the congressmen who are narcissistically boycotting the inaugural \u2014 the whole government will get further delegitimized. But if people redouble their commitment to constitutional norms and practices, to substance and dignity, this thing is survivable.Already you see the political system uniting to contain Trump. In negotiations on the Hill, administration officials feel free to ignore his verbiage on health care and other issues. Members of his team are already good at pretending that Trump doesn\u2019t mean what he clearly does mean, on matters of NATO and much else.I\u2019ve been rewatching \u201cYes, Minister\u201d these days. That was a hilarious British sitcom about a permanent government apparatus that contained and overruled a bumbling political master. America will need a beneficent version of that sort of clever cooperation.With Trump it\u2019s not the ideology, it\u2019s the disorder. Containing that could be the patriotic cause that brings us together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas\u2019 Transgender Bill Idiocy", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe legislation would also invalidate provisions of local ordinances in cities like Dallas, San Antonio, Fort Worth and Austin that for years have provided gay and transgender residents with protection from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.Set against Mr. Patrick\u2019s ignorance and bigotry, the response from private-sector leaders in Texas has been tremendously encouraging.The Texas Association of Business last year commissioned a study about the impact a state law that discriminates against gay, bisexual and transgender people would have. Using the backlash from private industry set off by North Carolina\u2019s law, known as HB2, as a gauge, the group concluded that Texas could lose as many as 185,000 jobs. A discriminatory law would also result in billions of dollars in lost tourism, canceled business investment and an almost certain decline in the state\u2019s vibrant conventions business.These concerns, which are shared by several local chambers of commerce in the state, should be enough to persuade a wide majority of Texas lawmakers to reject Mr. Patrick\u2019s proposal. And if they study the matter closely, they are likely to find that local anti-discrimination ordinances have made cities more attractive to businesses and a broad pool of talent. Texas politicians would be doing their state a service by exploring ways to expand protections to all of its citizens rather than cruelly stigmatizing some of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Make of the \u2018Davos Class\u2019 in the Trump Era", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byDealBookDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has never been invited here. Neither has Nigel Farage, the British politician who led the Brexit campaign.The World Economic Forum \u2014 an annual gathering of global policy and business leaders, who come to debate the world\u2019s great challenges \u2014 gets underway here Monday night as the shifting political trends toward nationalism and against a sense of globalism are raising renewed questions about the relevance of the elites known as the \u201cDavos class.\u201d It is this group of so-called plutocrats that largely failed to anticipate \u2014 and may have even unconsciously generated \u2014 the seeping anti-establishment movement across the globe.Every January, a glittering array of the cognoscenti descend on the Alps: the tech-titan-turned-philanthropist Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft; the billionaire investor George Soros; Jack Ma, the founder of China\u2019s e-commerce giant, Alibaba; and \u2014 until recently \u2014 Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany. An assortment of Hollywood actors including Angelina Jolie, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon have made the pilgrimage over the years to promote their nonprofit work. And the conversations tend to be dominated by issues like inequality, climate change and the economic challenges facing developed and emerging countries.This year, the guest list includes names like President Xi Jinping of China; Vice President Joseph Biden; JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon; the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde; and former Vice President Al Gore.And yet missing from these high-minded conversations have been meaningful challengers or critics of the underlying theme that was seemingly stipulated from the birth of this event 46 years ago: Globalization has the potential to benefit everyone.\u201cTrump\u2019s election victory is a clear indication that the majority of people are not interested in a world government, but want to return to a classical, local democracy,\u201d John Mauldin, an economic researcher and author, recently wrote. \u201cStrange as it may seem to the Davos men, most people tend to love their \u2018patria,\u2019 the land of their fathers.\u201dDissenting voices like those of Mr. Trump and Mr. Farage have rarely been part of the discussion \u2014 though perhaps that will change. Theresa May, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, will attend this year, as will some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers.But the victories of Mr. Trump and the Brexit campaign can be viewed as a rebuke of \u201cDavos Man,\u201d a name that Samuel Huntington, the Harvard political scientist, gave attendees in 2004, describing them as \u201ctransnationalists\u201d who \u201chave little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite\u2019s global operations.\u201dThe middle class in the United States and Britain \u2014 and perhaps in France if Marine Le Pen, the far-right presidential candidate who has also never been invited to Davos, wins this spring \u2014 clearly haven\u2019t felt the benefits of the border-free world encouraged by multinational corporations that allows both immigration and commerce to take place without friction.\u201cThey have witnessed the rise of the Davos class, a hyper-connected network of banking and tech billionaires, elected leaders who are awfully cozy with those interests, and Hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous,\u201d Naomi Klein, a columnist for The Guardian, wrote in a searing analysis of the American election in November. She described the failure of \u201celite neoliberalism\u201d to address the economic challenges of the masses.\u201cSuccess,\u201d she wrote, continuing to describe the middle class, \u201cis a party to which they were not invited, and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness.\u201dThe Davos Man has either failed to properly articulate the benefits of open trade \u2014 or the reality of open trade is more complicated than previously imagined.In a nod to this new reality, the World Economic Forum has put together an index of what it calls inclusive growth and development, which measures 109 countries according to their progress on economic growth and reducing income inequality and breaks out subsets of those countries to compare with different data sets. According to the index, median income actually declined by 2.4 percent between 2008 and 2013 across the 26 advanced economies where data is available, which may help explain the shifting political winds.\u201cIt\u2019s our response to how capitalism has failed us \u2014 and how we need to fix it,\u201d said Adrian Monck, a member of the forum\u2019s executive committee.The United States ranked 23rd out of 30 advanced economies. In terms of wage and nonwage compensation, it ranked last; in social protection, it came in 25th. It also came in 25th on \u201cintermediation of business investment\u201d \u2014 in other words, the amount of money that goes into productive investments, such as research and development and infrastructure as opposed to share buybacks. (Norway ranked No. 1. Living standards there rose by 10.6 percent from 2008 to 2013 while the economy grew only 0.5 percent.)Mr. Monck defended the idea of a globalist approach. \u201cThe benefits of globalization are there to see, in jobs in China, India and many emerging markets,\u201d he said. \u201cBillions of people owe better lives to it.\u201dHe invoked Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum. \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t been listened to in Davos is persistent warnings from people like Klaus that the benefits need to be shared, and that you can\u2019t have winner-take-all capitalism,\u201d Mr. Monck said.Still, he acknowledged that the invitation list of insiders is by design.\u201cWe always want the most comprehensive political attendance in Davos, to help support public-private cooperation, which is what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat inevitably means current, serving political figures. There are politicians in office now \u2014 and coming to Davos \u2014 who reflect this emergent agenda that you\u2019ve seen in the U.S.\u201dFor example, he said, leaders from Poland, Finland, Portugal and even Switzerland \u2014 where the Swiss People\u2019s Party was an early example of the shift in the political landscape \u2014 will be on hand this week.A bevy of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers and members of his business council are expected to attend, including Anthony Scaramucci, who joined the president-elect\u2019s White House staff as an adviser and public liaison to government agencies and businesses. He will be joined by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman of the Blackstone Group and also of Mr. Trump\u2019s President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum.A few people who were once anti-establishment crusaders \u2014 like Ms. May of Britain \u2014 are now insiders. And, depending how the political winds shift, more people of her ideological ilk may join the Davos class in 2018.Many of today\u2019s policy makers and executives gathering here are expected to speak about the rise of populism and the need to adjust economic incentives. Hamdi Ulukaya, the chief executive of Chobani, the yogurt company, is expected to encourage business leaders to do more to address wealth building among employees; he provided shares in his company to every full-time employee, making many of them millionaires.The question, of course, is whether those discussions can ever get beyond the theoretical for a group that is seen by many middle-class voters as out of touch with the real economic challenges that people face. Conversations about income inequality, for example, have long had a tinge of class envy as opposed to a real appreciation for the basic jobs and wages that people are seeking.Still, with the word \u201cDavos\u201d being tossed around as an epithet, some politicians are staying away from the Alps this year. Ms. Merkel, for example, has passed on attending now for two years in a row, in the face of continued criticism among German voters that she is too much of a globalist.So why do so many policy makers and executives still covet an invitation? Because Davos remains the world\u2019s one-stop shop to meet leaders from all corners of the globe. And despite the critiques of the gathering, a remarkable amount of business \u2014 both political and corporate \u2014 takes place behind the scenes.One thing is sure: The predictions made here \u2014 known as the Davos consensus \u2014 have a tendency to be wrong. Mr. Trump, with very few exceptions, was largely written off last year as a bad joke.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Malta Takes the Reins of a Frayed and Anxious European Union", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byVALLETTA, Malta \u2014 It is a ritual of the European Union, rich in symbolism even if many Europeans are not paying close attention: Every six months, the presidency of the 28-nation bloc rotates among its member countries, giving small nations a chance to help set an agenda that is usually dominated by larger countries like Germany and France.This time, it is Malta\u2019s turn, and the tiny country, made up of an archipelago of islands in the Mediterranean, is trying to meet the challenge with a sense of urgency.\u201cThere is a huge disconnect right now between political classes around the world and the lives of normal people,\u201d Joseph Muscat, Malta\u2019s prime minister, said at a news conference on Wednesday at the Auberge de Castille, an 18th-century Baroque building in Valletta, the capital.If anything, his prognosis may be an understatement.\u201cDoes Malta have the political weight or the legitimacy to do this?\u201d asked Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. Probably not, he said, describing the rotating presidency as an archaic distraction that should probably be scrapped.Gatherings of top European officials like the one now being held on Malta \u201care supposed to show continuity of the European project but risk coming off as empty rituals because nobody trusts Brussels to deal with core national concerns like terrorism, migration and economic revitalization,\u201d said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, the director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a research group in Brussels.\u201cThe image of an orchestra continuing to play on the sinking Titanic is not so far-fetched,\u201d Mr. Lee-Makiyama said, referring to officials holding discussions on Malta that are unlikely to do much to ease the bloc\u2019s multiple unresolved crises.In fairness, the Maltese seem aware of the scope of the problem.Mr. Muscat, a Socialist, said that migration and border control \u2014 two related and contentious topics that have roiled countries nervous about terrorism and cultural change \u2014 were essential agenda items. Getting \u201ceveryone together to secure our borders\u201d is essential, he said.It is also a poignant issue for Malta, which is on the dangerous sea route that many African migrants have used to try to reach Europe.Slovakia, which previously held the rotating presidency, staunchly rejected immigration by Muslims and emphasizes national interests over trans-European ones.Malta, a more pluralistic country that has been a historical crossroads of religions and cultures, advocates what Mr. Muscat called a more \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach.The Maltese are far more pro-European than many other countries mostly because their economy has surged over the past decade. The country is even importing labor, partly to handle a construction boom.\u201cWe need to discuss the positive aspects of migration, but we have to put ourselves in the place\u201d of Europeans \u201cwho feel they are being disenfranchised,\u201d Mr. Muscat said.Asked about the bloc\u2019s most pressing challenge \u2014 the looming start of negotiations with Britain over its withdrawal from the European Union \u2014 Mr. Muscat rejected any effort to essentially give Britain a way to reap the economic benefits of membership while letting it withdraw on paper.Any deal for Britain \u201cneeds to be inferior to membership,\u201d Mr. Muscat said. He added that he had rarely been at a discussion on any other subject where the vast majority of member states \u201chave basically the same position.\u201d The withdrawal process is supposed to take two years, but because it has never been used before, almost anything could happen.\u201cI can\u2019t speak at the future and say whether one country or another will then break that sort of unity,\u201d Mr. Muscat said. \u201cI simply don\u2019t see it happening now.\u201dGermany plays the critical role in determining the decisions the European Union makes these days, and that has contributed to a less important role for the rotating presidency. Even so, Malta will have the opportunity to push the rest of the bloc to manage migration, though the numbers of migrants reaching Malta have been very low since Italy and other countries stepped up patrols closer to the North African coastline.Malta will also be expected to set the agenda and broker delicate compromises at fractious ministerial meetings.Mr. Muscat will share the spotlight at official gatherings with Jean-Claude Juncker, who leads the European Commission, the executive arm of the bloc, and with Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, the body representing national leaders, and with whoever replaces Martin Schulz, who recently stepped down as the president of the European Parliament.\u201cWe are very much on the same lines, swimming in the same channels, swimming in the same direction,\u201d Mr. Juncker said at the news conference at which Mr. Muscat spoke, adding that he was optimistic about plans to make the bloc\u2019s borders on the Mediterranean more secure.The byzantine system of governance has evolved to allow a balance between national and European interests. But few citizens understand the arcane procedures that undergird that system \u2014 and few care.Speaking to reporters in Valletta earlier on Wednesday, Louis Grech, the Maltese deputy prime minister, warned of \u201cextreme nationalism\u201d and \u201cextreme xenophobia\u201d and a surge in protectionist trade policies. \u201cAll of these contrast heavily with European values,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Little-Known Role of Western Economists in Building a Post-Mao China", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported bySinosphereWhich foreign scholars had the most influence on Chinese policy makers in the Deng era? The Chinese learned a great deal from these foreign economists, but they did not seek simply to copy Western ideas. So-called \u201cinfluence\u201d in this period was a process of constantly negotiated receptivity and debate about new ideas. And the Chinese side was firmly in charge.Which personal relationship between foreign and Chinese thinkers in this period did you find to be the most interesting?They continued to meet and share ideas, and Wu used Kornai\u2019s ideas to shape the policies of the mixed system that still governs China\u2019s economy today, dubbed a socialist market economy.These personal stories remind us that people operating under real-life constraints, rather than disembodied ideas or historic \u201cforces,\u201d are what make history. Kornai and Wu remain friends and even celebrated their birthdays together in Beijing in 2008.Tobin taught what was essentially Macroeconomics 101. Kornai proposed that China build an economic system in which enterprises would respond to market pressures but the state could still manage macroeconomic policy and regulate the market. The cruise also offered the Chinese officials \u2014 few of whom had lived in a modern market economy \u2014 a chance to see how prominent international economists thought about problems and advised on policy. It was perhaps the single most important of the many intensive intellectual exchanges that Zhao oversaw and was frequently referenced in deliberations at the time. It\u2019s an event that\u2019s emblematic of the broader pragmatic, eclectic open-mindedness of this period.How much credit should historians give to Deng for the economic transformation that took place in China starting in the 1980s?Deng has deservedly received a great deal of credit for China\u2019s extraordinary transformation, but historians are showing that this account is incomplete. One figure who doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves is Zhao Ziyang, who was premier and then general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhao oversaw and directed the development of many market-oriented policies that powered growth, and he set out a vision of a system in which, as he put it in 1987, \u201cthe state manages the market, and the market guides the enterprises.\u201d But Zhao was removed from power in 1989, just before the Tiananmen tragedy, because he opposed imposing martial law. Today, his name almost never appears in print in China. The party takes credit for his achievements or attributes them to Deng.Of course, we should never forget that while these policies and leaders mattered greatly, the engine of China\u2019s transformation was the ingenuity and hard work of the Chinese people.Xi\u2019s regime has taken deeply troubling steps to wall off academia, the media, the professions, the internet and much of society. This history suggests that the costs of these policies may be high. Over the past 40 years, the exchanges between the U.S. and China have not just been in economic goods and services, but also in economic ideas. That openness to new ideas from around the world has greatly benefited China\u2019s quest for greater wealth and power.Without that openness, China will miss out on exactly the kind of interchanges that Deng and reformers of his era believed were essential to China\u2019s success. Worst of all, it intensifies the chilling effect on thinking and policy making within China, discouraging experimentation and innovation when it is urgently needed.Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today\u2019s Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.

The building, called Palacio Chiarino, was designed by three architects: Antonio Chiarino, Bartolom\u00e9 Triay and Gaetano Moretti (Mr. Moretti also worked on Montevideo\u2019s Palacio Legislativo, where the country\u2019s parliament meets). The government declared Palacio Chiarino a historic landmark in 2011.There are period flourishes throughout the apartment, which is reached by an ornate iron elevator. The front door is carved wood with beveled crystal inlays. The reception area has a marble floor, granite columns and painted Venetian-style mosaics. The ceiling is hand-painted with gold leaf. Several rooms feature the original tissue wallpaper from the 1920s.The ceilings in the main living areas are more than 13 feet high. In addition to a living room, the layout includes a tearoom, a reading room and an office. A Venetian-style balcony off the living room has marble floors, balusters and intricate mosaic work. The furniture is not included in the price, but pieces are available for sale, Mr. Garc\u00eda Arocena said.In the dining room, there are stained-glass windows and a Florentine-style fireplace.

The number of transactions was down 10 percent in 2016 compared with a year earlier, and down almost 40 percent from 2014, he estimated.In the past, \u201cthe market was driven by investors who bought properties for rent,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Arocena said. \u201cToday that market has disappeared,\u201d and demand is driven by retirees and young families moving into bigger homes, he said.Uruguay\u2019s economy has been affected by economic and political turmoil in Argentina and Brazil and by a drop in commodity prices, according to Juan Palacios, the managing director of Engel & V\u00f6lkers Montevideo, a real estate agency. \u201cWe are very dependent on what happens in the Argentina and Brazil economy,\u201d he says.There is no multiple listing service in Uruguay, which makes it difficult to track sales and pricing information, Mr. Palacios said. Homes often sell for as much as 20 percent below asking price, he said.The majority of sales are in the lower end of the market, Mr. Garc\u00eda Arocena said. \u201cLuxury property transactions are very few,\u201d but prices have remained flat, with owners unwilling to lower prices, he said.The most popular areas for home buyers are waterfront communities such as Pocitos and Punta Carretas, agents say. New properties on the waterfront can cost $300 to $465 a square foot, compared with close to $185 a square foot in the central part of the city.WHO BUYS IN MONTEVIDEOInternational buyers represent a very small percentage of the overall market, but foreign sales are \u201cgrowing steadily,\u201d according to Sancho Pardo Santayana, the managing partner at 360 Terra International Realty. Most of the growth in international buyers is coming from the United States and Europe, he said.Argentines were once active buyers, but changes in currency regulations imposed by the Argentine government and economic turmoil have slowed the market, agents say.The bulk of buyers are Uruguayans who work in the capital. Second-home buyers typically focus on coastal areas, such as Punta del Este, which is 80 miles to the east, rather than on Montevideo, he said.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreigners owning property in Uruguay. Deals are usually transacted in United States dollars and in cash; it is difficult to get a mortgage, agents said.The key participant in the transaction is Uruguay\u2019s version of a notary, known as an escribano, who has broad responsibility in managing the paperwork and researching the status of the property.\u201cHere the notary is a kind of lawyer,\u201d Mr. Pardo Santayana said.Buyers usually pay a 10 percent deposit, which is held by the buyer\u2019s notary, Mr. Pardo Santayana said.The buying process may take as long as three months to complete, but \u201cother than that it is pretty straightforward,\u201d Mr. Palacios said.WEBSITESLanguage and CurrencySpanish: Uruguayan peso (1 Uruguayan peso = 0.035 United States dollar)TAXES AND FEESTransfer and agent fees, taxes and notary costs typically total about 8 to 9 percent of the sales price, agents say. The total includes a 2 transfer tax, a 3 percent broker fee and the 3 percent notary fee. There is also a 22 percent value-added tax on the fees paid to the broker and the notary.The property tax on this apartment is about $2,500 a year, Mr. Garc\u00eda Arocena said. There is also a monthly building maintenance fee of about $1,000 a month, he said.CONTACTBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a slide show with this article included an erroneous caption for picture No. 16.

{"Headline": "In Chapo\u2019s Extradition, a Lesson for Mr. Trump", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byEditorialIt was not a coincidence. In the waning hours of the Obama presidency, officials in Mexico bundled the drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, known as El Chapo, into an airplane and handed him to the American government so he could stand trial in New York.His extradition came after years of painstaking diplomacy. It required convincing the government of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto that the American justice system was better equipped to take Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, the leader of the violent Sinaloa cartel, out of the drug trade. This was no easy task: Washington\u2019s relationship with Mexico has been strained by an imbalance of power and by American slights. By completing the transfer on President Barack Obama\u2019s watch, Mexico appeared to be rewarding an administration that was respectful. It also ensured that the extradition was not seen as a concession to President Trump, who made maligning Mexicans a centerpiece of his campaign.Obama officials succeeded because they tried to persuade, not hector, their Mexican counterparts. This fit with the administration\u2019s broader strategy for Latin America, one that was rooted in pragmatism and cooperation. It offers a lesson Mr. Trump would be foolish to disregard.Leaders in Latin America watched Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign with morbid fascination, followed the transition period with dread and are certain to have been stunned by his Inaugural Address.Mexican officials have wisely refused to escalate tensions with Mr. Trump. But if they conclude that a respectful and mutually beneficial relationship with the United States is impossible, they have cards to play that could stymie Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. Mexico could cease rigorously controlling its border with Guatemala, which would lead more people to try to enter the United States. It could do more to encourage investment from China and Russia, which are eager to strengthen ties with Latin America. And it could end robust cooperation on drug enforcement and intelligence, which would make Americans less secure.Mexico has made it abundantly clear that this is not the approach it wants to take. If the new administration builds on the successes of Mr. Obama, Mexico may never feel the need to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Mexico Tantrum", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byEditorialLess than a week into the job, President Trump on Thursday raised the specter of a trade war with America\u2019s third-largest partner, Mexico, as the White House warned that the United States could impose a 20 percent tariff on Mexican imports.The tariff tantrum was the latest in a head-spinning torrent of lies, dangerous policy ideas and threats from the White House since Mr. Trump was sworn in last Friday. They have underscored just how impulsive and apparently ignorant the new occupant of the Oval Office is of international economic and security relationships that serve American interests. His advisers appear unwilling to rein in his impulses or, as in the case of the tariff, hapless as they struggle to tamp them down.It\u2019s hard to tell whether the animus Mr. Trump has conveyed toward immigrants, particularly Mexicans, is deeply felt, or if he simply came to recognize how powerfully it would appeal to voters disaffected by an uneven economic recovery and the nation\u2019s demographic changes.But allowing this view to drive trade and foreign policy toward Mexico could have disastrous consequences for workers and consumers in both countries, given how tightly intertwined the two economies have become since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994.Nafta eliminated most tariffs and other trade barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States, creating a continent-size market. The agreement led to production chains for cars, planes and other items that straddle borders and provide millions of jobs. Work that requires cheaper labor typically occurs in Mexico, where earnings are lower, while design, engineering and advanced manufacturing tends to take place in Canada and the United States.Imposing a tariff on Mexico would mean pulling out of Nafta, a move that would severely disrupt the flow of parts and goods across North America and stall production in factories in the United States and Canada. It also could lead to shortages of fresh vegetables and fruits in American grocery stores and drive up the cost of many other consumer goods from Mexico. Mexico\u2019s economy, which is hugely dependent on American trade, would be devastated. But American businesses and workers would stand to suffer immediate harm as well. Mexico would retaliate with tariffs of its own. And no matter how Congress tried to structure the tariff, which would require legislation, it would probably still violate World Trade Organization rules.Sending the Mexican economy into a tailspin is the surest way to reverse that trend, which historically has been driven by market forces, and has never been deterred much by fences or walls. Besides, a tax on Mexican imports would be paid by American consumers and businesses that buy those goods. Americans would pay for the wall, not Mexicans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Record 2016 for U.S. Auto Industry; Long Road Back May Be at End", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Unexpectedly strong sales of new vehicles in the United States in December propelled the industry to another record figure in 2016: 17.55 million sold.That is the good news.The bad news, though, is that the late push to beat the previous record, 17.47 million vehicles sold in 2015, came at a steep cost, as companies piled on higher sales incentives to lure consumers to their showrooms.And with the American market tilting more than ever toward sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, companies are cutting production of passenger cars to reduce big inventories of slow-selling models.As a result, there is little expectation that the sales will continue on this upward trajectory \u2014 at least not without cutting deep into profits. That means the numbers released Wednesday could be the high-water mark for the industry\u2019s impressive comeback from the depths of the recession, when annual sales fell below 11 million vehicles and General Motors and Chrysler needed government bailouts to survive.Adding to the challenge is the potential for major changes in federal regulatory and trade policies by the Trump administration, setting up an uncertain year for an industry that has been barreling along.\u201cOne of the problems with predicting 2017 is it is the year of unknowns,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the car-shopping site Autotrader. \u201cWe are hearing a lot of different things about border tariffs and regulatory policies, but we don\u2019t know what the whole picture looks like.\u201dMost major automakers are making big profits these days, as consumers replace aging cars and trucks with new models, loaded with technology, that last year sold for an average sticker price above $35,000.Yet companies face a new set of challenges posed by slower growth, and industry executives are bracing for potential tariffs on vehicles imported into the United States from Mexico, or other adjustments in trade policies that could upset the global pipeline of parts to vehicle assembly plants.The uncertainty extends to the market itself, which has steadily grown year after year as consumers took advantage of easy credit and better economic conditions to replace aging vehicles.Demand, however, has leveled off, and companies are falling back on old habits to move excess inventories. Analysts reported that sales incentives were about 25 percent higher in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in the same period a year earlier, even though overall sales were flat.That is partly because of a sustained slump in sales of small and midsize cars, which has offset the increased demand for trucks and S.U.V.s. But it forces automakers to rely on discounts to sell less popular models, adjust production plans on the fly and lay off workers at some of their factories.General Motors, the nation\u2019s largest automaker, has announced plans to cut shifts of workers at three assembly plants that build cars in Michigan and Ohio, and analysts expect more adjustments across the industry as companies try to better match supply with demand.\u201cWe do expect production will likely be cut, particularly in the compact and midsize segments,\u201d said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with the research firm Kelley Blue Book.The industry sold 1.69 million vehicles during the month of December, an increase of about 3 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the research firm Autodata. The 17.55 million sold over the year was a gain of 0.4 percent.Sales of trucks and S.U.V.s accounted for nearly two-thirds of the sales volume during December as consumers continue to turn to the larger vehicles over cars. Analysts expect the trend toward larger vehicles to continue as long as gas prices remain low.Over all, the industry forecasts sales exceeding 17 million vehicles in the United States in the coming year, although how automakers manage shifts in demand will affect their profitability.\u201cThe most successful automakers in the long term will be able to prioritize profitability over market share and be willing to pull back artificial support for unprofitable volume,\u201d said Stephanie Brinkley, an analyst at the firm IHS Markit.G.M. said its sales in December increased 10 percent, to 319,000 vehicles, although its annual sales for all of 2016 fell 1.3 percent, to 3.04 million vehicles.The company benefited from strong demand for pickups and its biggest S.U.V.s, such as the Chevrolet Tahoe, whose sales rose nearly 17 percent last year. But G.M. exemplified the market\u2019s split personality, as several of its smaller cars experienced sharp declines.G.M. is expanding its S.U.V. lineup and will unveil new models at the coming Detroit auto show. Moreover, the company expects the industry to achieve near-record levels again in 2017. \u201cKey economic indicators, especially consumer confidence, continue to reflect optimism about the U.S. economy,\u201d said Mustafa Mohatarem, G.M.\u2019s chief economist.Ford Motor, the second-biggest American automaker, said it sold 237,000 vehicles in December, a slight gain from the same month in 2015. For the year, Ford reported sales of 2.61 million vehicles in the United States \u2014 essentially the same total as in 2015.The company\u2019s cornerstone product, the F-Series pickup, was once again the top-selling vehicle in the American market, with 820,000 trucks sold last year. But sales of Ford\u2019s car models fell about 12 percent in 2016 from a year earlier, with products like the Focus and the Fusion posting double-digit declines.The third major American automaker, Fiat Chrysler, reported one of its weaker months in December, as sales fell 10 percent, to 192,000 vehicles. For the full year, the company said it sold 2.24 million vehicles, a decline of less than 1 percent from the previous year.Fiat Chrysler has substantially reduced its production of passenger cars and is busy converting car factories into truck plants. Last year, sales of its cars such as the Dodge Dart and the Chrysler 200 dropped precipitously as the company concentrated on beefing up its lineup of S.U.V.s, particularly its hot-selling Jeep models.Foreign automakers generally reported solid months in December. Toyota, for example, said its sales increased 2 percent during the month, although it ended 2016 with a 2 percent decrease for the full year.While the industry\u2019s health appears closely tied to the continued demand for larger vehicles, some automakers have placed big bets on electric cars, which remain a tiny niche in the market.In one of the most closely watched introductions in the segment, G.M. said it sold 579 Chevrolet Bolts, a new battery-powered sedan, in December, its first month of sales. By contrast, the company sold more than 54,000 Silverado pickups, its most popular product.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robots Will Take Jobs, but Not as Fast as Some Fear, New Report Says", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byThe robots are coming, but the march of automation will displace jobs more gradually than some alarming forecasts suggest.A measured pace is likely because what is technically possible is only one factor in determining how quickly new technology is adopted, according to a new study by the McKinsey Global Institute. Other crucial ingredients include economics, labor markets, regulations and social attitudes.Globally, the McKinsey researchers calculated that 49 percent of time spent on work activities could be automated with \u201ccurrently demonstrated technology\u201d either already in the marketplace or being developed in labs. That, the report says, translates into $15.8 trillion in wages and the equivalent of 1.1 billion workers worldwide. But only 5 percent of jobs can be entirely automated.\u201cThis is going to take decades,\u201d said James Manyika, a director of the institute and an author of the report. \u201cHow automation affects employment will not be decided simply by what is technically feasible, which is what technologists tend to focus on.\u201dThe report, a product of years of research by the McKinsey group, adds to the growing body of research on automation and jobs.Differing assumptions, and sheer uncertainty about the future, explain the conflicting outlooks.Throughout history, times of rapid technological progress have stoked fears of jobs losses. More than 80 years ago, the renowned English economist John Maynard Keynes warned of a \u201cnew disease\u201d of \u201ctechnological unemployment.\u201dToday, it is the rise of artificial intelligence in increasingly clever software and machines that is stirring concern. The standard view is that routine work in factories and offices, like bookkeeping or operating basic machinery, is most vulnerable to automation.But A.I. software that can read and analyze text or speech \u2014 so-called natural language processing \u2014 is encroaching on the work of professionals. For example, there is a lot of legal work that is routine, said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But that routine work, sifting through documents for relevant information, is wrapped in language, which had protected lawyers from the effects of automation. But no longer.\u201cNatural language processing opens the door to doing more and more work that was beyond automation until recently,\u201d Mr. Levy said.The McKinsey report cites natural language processing as a key technology: The faster it develops, the more that tasks can be automated; a slower pace means less automation.The economic cost of automation is another concern. People see advances in self-driving vehicles, and think that the jobs of America\u2019s 1.7 million truck drivers are in imminent peril, said Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey institute and an author of the report.Yet replacing America\u2019s truck fleet would require a trillion-dollar investment, Mr. Chui said, adding \u201cif you could buy a self-driving truck, which you can\u2019t.\u201dSuch uncertainties led the McKinsey researchers to calculate the pace of automation as ranges rather than precise predictions. The report\u2019s multifactor scenarios suggest that half of today\u2019s work activities could be automated by 2055. That threshold could be reached 20 years earlier or 20 years later, the report adds, depending on economic trends, labor market dynamics, regulations and social attitudes.So while further automation is inevitable, McKinsey\u2019s research suggests that it will be a relentless advance rather than an economic tidal wave.\u201cWe have more time than we think to adjust to the world that technology makes possible,\u201d said Matthew J. Slaughter, an economist and dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.The McKinsey report also considered the other side of automation \u2014 as an engine of productivity and economic growth.In that context, the report points to the demographic challenges ahead, as most nations age, and the need for automation-powered growth. Today, there are 46 million Americans over 65, or 15 percent of the population. By 2060, the size of the over-65 group is projected to reach 98 million people, or 24 percent of the population.The American economy may need all the A.I.-assisted automation it can muster.\u201cIf productivity growth continues to be anemic, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d said Hal Varian, Google\u2019s chief economist and an emeritus professor at the University of California, Berkeley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Obama, Some Health Reforms May Prove Lasting", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "A transformation of the delivery of health care may be an enduring legacy for the president, even as Republicans plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Supported byFISHERS, Ind. \u2014 Fragments of bone and cartilage arced across the operating room as Dr. R. Michael Meneghini drilled into the knee of his first patient at a hospital here at dawn. Within an hour, the 66-year-old woman had a replacement joint made of titanium and cobalt chrome, and she was sent home the next day.But the Obama administration was watching over her caregivers\u2019 shoulders. If, over three months, her medical costs exceeded a target amount set by President Obama\u2019s health regulators in Washington, Dr. Meneghini\u2019s employer, Indiana University Health, stood to lose money.Such efforts to squeeze spending out of the nation\u2019s health system may well remain as Mr. Obama exits the West Wing and Donald J. Trump takes his seat in the Oval Office. The Affordable Care Act is in extreme peril, and Mr. Obama will meet with congressional Democrats at the Capitol on Wednesday to try to devise a strategy that can stave off the quick-strike repeal of the health law that Republicans plan for the opening months of the Trump administration.But the transformation of American health care that has occurred over the last eight years \u2014 touching every aspect of the system, down to a knee replacement in the nation\u2019s heartland \u2014 has a momentum that could prove impossible to stop.Expanding insurance coverage to more than 20 million Americans is among Mr. Obama\u2019s proudest accomplishments, but the changes he has pushed go deeper. They have had an impact on every level of care \u2014 from what happens during checkups and surgery to how doctors and hospitals are paid, how their results are measured and how they work together.\u201cFrom the moment I first set foot in the Oval Office in February 2009, the president told me that the law can\u2019t be just about covering the uninsured, but that it also has to be about changing the way care is delivered,\u201d said Nancy-Ann DeParle, who as a White House aide helped lead the effort to pass and carry out the health law. His message, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to cover everyone and just put them in the same creaky old delivery system.\u201dChanges in the delivery system already affect far more people than the law\u2019s higher-profile coverage gains. To visit IU Health, the largest health care provider in Indiana, with 15 hospitals and 8,700 doctors, is to see those changes up close. Its leaders have started moving away from fee-for-service medicine, where every procedure, examination and prescription fetches a price. The emphasis now is on preventive care, on taking responsibility for the health of patients not only in the hospital, but also in the community.Social work has become a larger part of the medical mission. Collaboration between doctors is becoming a necessity.\u201cI don\u2019t know who could be against it: higher quality and lower cost,\u201d said Ryan C. Kitchell, an executive vice president and the chief administrative officer of IU Health.And unlike Mr. Obama\u2019s insurance coverage expansions, these changes are not in jeopardy, said Dennis M. Murphy, IU Health\u2019s president and chief executive.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to create more value in health care,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in an interview after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. \u201cThat principle, I think, survives.\u201dDuring Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure, big systems like IU Health have gobbled up smaller hospitals and physician groups as the industry has consolidated, partly in response to incentives in the Affordable Care Act. Most doctors across the United States are using electronic medical records, installed in many cases with federal money provided by the economic stimulus law of 2009. The federal government and private insurers are rewarding health care providers that work together to coordinate care and avoid unnecessary expenses.Doctors and hospitals here are obsessed with metrics, not least because under the health law, they may be rewarded or penalized based on their performance. They tally the number of medication errors, the number of patients injured in falls and the number who develop infections after certain types of surgery.Expanding coverage is seen not as a political issue, but as a clinical and financial imperative. IU Health has more than 150 \u201cnavigators\u201d who work with patients to help them get insurance, often through a Medicaid expansion authorized and funded by the health law and engineered here by Gov. Mike Pence, the vice president-elect.\u201cI\u2019ve been a registered Republican my whole life, but I support the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Dr. Gregory C. Kiray, co-chief of primary care for IU Health Physicians, \u201cbecause it allows patients to be taken care of.\u201dTo better understand how Mr. Obama has changed health care, two reporters from The New York Times spent a week shadowing and talking to doctors, patients, executives and others at IU Health, a system that demonstrates the breadth of changes catalyzed by the Affordable Care Act.To many IU Health employees, the pace of change can be bewildering, the new directives too numerous or burdensome.\u201cPeople feel like they are swimming in an ocean, drowning,\u201d said Dr. Meneghini, an orthopedic surgeon at IU Health\u2019s Saxony Hospital here in Fishers, a suburb of Indianapolis.But the medical profession increasingly understands that painful as it is, the revolution is necessary and unstoppable.\u201cThe national economy cannot sustain health care being as big a share of the gross domestic product as it is,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, uttering what once amounted to heresy for a health care provider.Fury over the Affordable Care Act helped jump-start the Tea Party movement and sweep Republicans into control of the House of Representatives in 2010 and the Senate in 2014. It ensured gridlock that stifled many of Mr. Obama\u2019s greatest legislative ambitions for six of his eight years in office, and it may well have played a role in the election of Mr. Trump, who attacked the law throughout his campaign.Yet to Mr. Obama, the law remains one of his greatest achievements, said Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff. It also has been his constant concern.\u201cThis attention to cost and concern about cost, and even the emotional concern about cost, comes up all the time,\u201d Mr. McDonough said.The Affordable Care Act gave the government sweeping authority to test new models of care, and the administration has aggressively used that power to try different ways of paying for cancer care, heart surgery, primary care and other services covered by Medicare and Medicaid.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who has been the secretary of health and human services since 2014, said she met with Mr. Obama early in her tenure to describe a series of payment and delivery reforms. He was so supportive, she said, that she and her team decided to undertake even more changes.The size and speed of some of those initiatives have provoked criticism from Republicans, including Representative Tom Price of Georgia, picked by Mr. Trump to be the health and human services secretary. They say the efforts threaten the quality of care and exceed the authority of the agency overseeing Medicare by requiring doctors and hospitals to participate.More than 170 House Republicans signed a recent letter of which Mr. Price was an author, urging the administration to \u201cstop experimenting with Americans\u2019 health.\u201dBut moving aggressively to change how medical care is delivered and paid for has been important to Mr. Obama. In 2015, his administration set a goal for half of all Medicare payments to be tied to the quality, instead of the quantity, of care that doctors and hospitals provide by 2018. Mr. Obama believes that basing pay on whether a doctor visit or a medical procedure helps a patient, rather than on how much care the patient receives, will result in better care.\u201cWhat he said was, \u2018Be thoughtfully aggressive,\u2019\u201d Ms. Burwell said.\u201cI started drinking soda again,\u201d confessed Willie Johnson, a 52-year-old patient with uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure.\u201cHow much?\u201d Dr. Michael E. Busha, a primary care physician at IU Health in Indianapolis, asked quietly as he updated Mr. Johnson\u2019s electronic record.\u201cQuite a bit.\u201dFor Dr. Busha, that mattered.He helps lead the IU system\u2019s effort to measure how well doctors do at keeping patients healthy. And even this champion of \u201cquality measures\u201d \u2014 vital to the Obama administration\u2019s goal of paying doctors based on outcomes, not the amount of care \u2014 has found that it is not always easy to meet them.If enough of his patients fall below the standards set by IU Health, Dr. Busha could lose some of his income. The average salary for the system\u2019s primary care doctors is $236,000. Of that, $50,000 is tied to meeting benchmarks for quality, access (whether a doctor agrees to see patients on weekends and at night, for example) and other performance measures.Mr. Johnson, who registers patients when they arrive for neurology appointments at IU Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, was not helping. He also had stopped taking his cholesterol medicine because it left a bad taste in his mouth. And he was using neither the gym membership that IU Health helps pay for nor his sleep apnea machine. \u201cI never could get adjusted to it,\u201d he told the doctor.Like other primary care doctors at IU Health, Dr. Busha is part of a team that includes a pharmacist, a social worker and a \u201ccare manager.\u201d Such teams, encouraged by the health law, focus on patients like Mr. Johnson who are not meeting IU Health\u2019s quality measures, and who are disproportionately likely to end up in the emergency room or be hospitalized.\u201cThe whole paradigm now is to identify your high-risk people and provide more resources to them, provide better care to them, keep them out of the hospital,\u201d said Dr. Kiray, the primary care co-chief.Partly because of these efforts, IU Health\u2019s two adult hospitals in downtown Indianapolis are already seeing 12 percent fewer inpatients than they were in 2013. The system is merging the two hospitals into a $1 billion medical center focused heavily on outpatient care.President Obama would be proud. Administration officials have continually emphasized the importance of primary care and the \u201csocial determinants\u201d of health. They have offered grants to health care providers to identify Medicaid and Medicare patients with unmet social needs: inadequate food supplies, unpaid rent or utility bills and experience with violence at home, for example.But with some patients, only so much can be done: Mr. Johnson\u2019s care manager had stopped working with him after deciding he was not ready to make changes.\u201cAre we ready to try it again?\u201d Dr. Busha asked him.Mr. Johnson agreed to let the care manager contact him, and to return for a follow-up visit in two months.Such efforts, said Mr. Murphy, the system\u2019s chief executive, will remain \u201chighly relevant\u201d even if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.The push toward a \u201crisk-based\u201d model over traditional fee-for-service medicine has spread beyond Medicare and Medicaid to private insurers. And the Obama administration has been testing new ways to save money on all sorts of medical care. Some of the experiments, overseen by an office created under the Affordable Care Act, have shown promise. But evaluating results is difficult.\u201cIt may be good in theory,\u201d Dr. John M. Thomas, a primary care physician at an IU Health practice in Lafayette, said of Dr. Busha\u2019s system of quality measurements. \u201cBut there are a lot of flaws.\u201dFor example, he explained, rather than risk being paid less because some patients have uncontrolled diabetes, doctors could tell those patients, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re not in compliance with your medications, and I don\u2019t want to be your physician.\u201dDr. Busha said he was used to hearing such arguments.\u201cI have that conversation on a weekly basis,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know: \u2018What if my patients don\u2019t believe in immunizations? Why am I held accountable for that?\u2019\u201dHe added, \u201cWe kind of tell them, \u2018It\u2019s your job to convince them.\u2019\u201dWhen IU Health discovered that a knee surgeon was using \u201cbone cement\u201d costing $300 a patient while another achieved the same results for $84, the first doctor was promptly informed. He switched.IU Health now posts a color-coded \u201cvalue tracker\u201d in operating rooms that gives a green light to lower-cost surgical products, a red light to high-cost items and a yellow light to those in between.\u201cA huge cultural shift,\u201d Dr. Anthony T. Sorkin, the medical director of orthopedics, said of the changes in his department \u2014 for the surgeons and the patients.The IU Health system performed 3,900 hip- and knee-replacement operations in the year that ended on June 30. But it is not enough for doctors just to replace a knee or a hip. They are under pressure, from Medicare and private insurers, to manage and coordinate care for their patients before and after surgery. And, they say, payment for their services is continually being squeezed.Doctors have three main ways to cut costs: improve the condition of patients before surgery, look for savings in every item used in the operating room (gloves, gowns, syringes, surgical tools, sutures, sponges and the implant itself), and send patients to nursing homes that strive to shorten the length of stay.\u201cI\u2019ve been an orthopedic surgeon for 18 years,\u201d Dr. Sorkin said. \u201cFor many of those years, I never once considered the cost for nursing homes.\u201dWhy such attention to cost? In 67 geographic areas, including Indianapolis, Medicare now sets a target price for joint-replacement procedures. That target covers not only doctor services and hospital care but also 90 days of follow-up services like physical therapy, home health care and nursing-home stays. Hospitals are at risk: Medicare can pay bonuses or impose penalties, depending on whether spending targets and quality standards set by the government are met.\u201cWe worry about 90 days of care, 90 days of Medicare spending, not just the brief time a patient spends in the hospital,\u201d Dr. Sorkin said.But in Indianapolis, the results have been promising. By working closely with nursing homes, IU Health halved the length of stay for patients recuperating from surgery, to an average of 12 days from 24 days in early 2016.Doctors and nurses understand the need for change, but some still have concerns.\u201cThese reforms are all intended to slow down the consumption of health care resources in the United States,\u201d said Dr. Meneghini, who is the director of joint-replacement at Saxony Hospital here in Fishers. \u201cWe are careening at a rapid rate to a two-tier system. The public who can\u2019t afford it goes to a public hospital and gets free health care. Those who have money get to pay for really nice care.\u201dJustin Kloski learned that he qualified for Medicaid under the worst of circumstances. The student and part-time lawn-company worker had lost 20 pounds, could not shake a nagging cough and was sleeping 14 hours a day when he decided to visit a clinic in Muncie, Ind., that provides free care for the poor and uninsured. A clinic employee invited Mr. Kloski, now 28, to apply for Medicaid.A few days later, he took his new coverage to the emergency room at IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital in Muncie. A CT scan found a 15-centimeter tumor in his chest, so big it was pressing on his windpipe. In May 2015, he learned he had Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a form of cancer that is curable if caught early.The Affordable Care Act, and Governor Pence\u2019s decision to go against many other Republican governors and expand Medicaid under the law, may well have saved Mr. Kloski\u2019s life.He is among more than 400,000 Indiana residents \u2014 many of them previously uninsured \u2014 who have enrolled in Medicaid since Mr. Pence expanded it in 2015, the 10th Republican governor to do so. Under the terms of the health law, anyone with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level, or approximately $16,500 a year for an individual, now qualifies in states that opt to expand the program.IU Health says it receives more Medicaid payments than any other health care provider in the state. Since the expansion began, the percentage of patients with Medicaid has grown to 23.2 from 20.7.At the same time, the percentage of IU Health patients who are uninsured has fallen to 2.2 from 5.In 2015 alone, the health system enrolled 14,000 people in Medicaid or private coverage, sometimes even signing up patients as they lay in hospital beds.\u201cWe went all in because it\u2019s a pretty big deal to us,\u201d said Jonathan W. Vanator, IU Health\u2019s vice president for revenue cycle services.But, the officials added, these gains have been largely offset by cuts in Medicare reimbursements and other federal funds under a law that has given and taken away.Mr. Murphy is among many hospital executives now anxious about the possibility of seeing a bump in uninsured patients if the health law is repealed, while not getting back the federal funds they gave up under the health law. \u201cI do think it would be problematic if part of the deal was changed and not the whole deal,\u201d he said.Mr. Pence expanded Medicaid only after the Obama administration agreed to let Indiana do it in its own way: Instead of getting virtually free coverage, as Medicaid recipients in many other states do, people enrolled in Indiana\u2019s expansion pay up to 5 percent of their income toward it. Mr. Trump appears interested in promoting Indiana\u2019s \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d model: He has picked its chief architect, Seema Verma, to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Since Mr. Kloski had no income when he enrolled, he paid $1 a month; he has since been classified as \u201cmedically frail\u201d and does not have to pay anything.Medicaid has paid for virtually all of his cancer care, including a one-week hospitalization after the diagnosis, months of chemotherapy, and frequent scans and blood tests.But Mr. Kloski and his mother, Renee Epperson, are still not fans of the health law over all. They believed that it required that Mr. Kloski be dropped, when he turned 26, from the health plan his mother has through her job at Target \u2014 not understanding that it was the law that kept him on the plan until he was 26.Mr. Kloski paid a penalty for going uninsured in 2014 rather than even explore whether he might qualify for a subsidy and find an affordable private plan through the marketplaces.\u201cThere were so many horror stories about how expensive it was going to be,\u201d Ms. Epperson, 47, recalled. \u201cJustin said, \u2018I\u2019m not even going to try it, Mom.\u2019\u201dAnd until they were interviewed for this article, the mother and son did not know that the law was responsible for the expansion of Medicaid that Mr. Kloski benefited from. Neither voted in last year\u2019s presidential election; Ms. Epperson said that she disliked both candidates, and that even though Hillary Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act, she found Mrs. Clinton\u2019s positions unacceptable on too many other issues, like abortion rights, to support her.Still, she said, she ardently hopes that Mr. Trump and the Republican Congress will continue allowing low-income adults like her son to qualify for Medicaid.\u201cOh my God, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201dAs for Mr. Murphy, IU Health\u2019s chief executive, he said that while he did not want to think too much about changes that were still hypothetical, the prospect of losing the Medicaid expansion made him anxious.\u201cI worry about lots of things,\u201d he said. \u201cThat list is probably 50 long, and this is definitely on that list.\u201dGardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Scientists\u2019 March on Washington Is a Bad Idea", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAmong scientists, understandably, there is growing fear that fact-based decision making is losing its seat at the policy-making table. There\u2019s also overwhelming frustration with the politicization of science by climate change skeptics and others who see it as threatening to their interests or beliefs.But trying to recreate the pointedly political Women\u2019s March will serve only to reinforce the narrative from skeptical conservatives that scientists are an interest group and politicize their data, research and findings for their own ends.Please understand, I don\u2019t shy away from openly presenting the facts about the changing climate and rising seas. But I\u2019ve learned that doing so is not without risk.In 2010, I was a co-author of a report for North Carolina\u2019s Coastal Resources Commission that said sea levels along the state\u2019s coastline could rise by as much as 39 inches by the end of the century. That conclusion was based on the best peer-reviewed science and was intended to help policy makers plan for the future.You might think that the lesson I learned from that experience was to distrust the political establishment. No. What I learned was that most of those attacking our sea-level-rise projections had never met me, nor my co-authors. Not only that, most of the public had never met anyone they considered a scientist. They didn\u2019t understand the careful, painstaking process we followed to reach our peer-reviewed conclusions. We were unknowns, \u201cscientists\u201d delivering bad news. We were easy marks for those who felt threatened by our findings.A march by scientists, while well intentioned, will serve only to trivialize and politicize the science we care so much about, turn scientists into another group caught up in the culture wars and further drive the wedge between scientists and a certain segment of the American electorate.Rather than marching on Washington and in other locations around the country, I suggest that my fellow scientists march into local civic groups, churches, schools, county fairs and, privately, into the offices of elected officials. Make contact with that part of America that doesn\u2019t know any scientists. Put a face on the debate. Help them understand what we do, and how we do it. Give them your email, or better yet, your phone number.Al Gore, bless his heart (as we say in the South), was well intentioned when he made \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d in 2006. But he did us no favors. So many of the conservative Southerners whom I speak to about climate change see it as a partisan issue largely because of that high-profile salvo fired by the former vice president.Scientists marching in opposition to a newly elected Republican president will only cement the divide. The solution here is not mass spectacle, but an increased effort to communicate directly with those who do not understand the degree to which the changing climate is already affecting their lives. We need storytellers, not marchers.Believe me, I understand the desire to impart to everyone how important science is to every sector of our economy, the health of our planet and the future of our families. But I don\u2019t see how a march accomplishes any of that. If tens of thousands of us show up, it will simply increase the size of the echo chamber.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Revives Keystone Pipeline Rejected by Obama", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported by\u201cI am, to a large extent, an environmentalist, I believe in it,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a meeting with auto industry executives. \u201cBut it\u2019s out of control, and we\u2019re going to make it a very short process. And we\u2019re going to either give you your permits, or we\u2019re not going to give you your permits. But you\u2019re going to know very quickly. And generally speaking, we\u2019re going to be giving you your permits.\u201dEnvironmental activists quickly denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s decisions. \u201cDonald Trump has been in office for four days, and he\u2019s already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be,\u201d said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club.A detailed map showing the Dakota Access Pipeline, the site of months of clashes near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota.Mr. Trump made clear on the campaign trail that he saw Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental policies as a threat to the economy and dismissed climate change as a hoax perpetrated by China. Myron Ebell, a climate change denier who headed Mr. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency transition team, has drafted a 50-page blueprint for how he could eliminate Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policies. \u201cIt is designed to implement all of the president\u2019s campaign trail promises \u2014 every single one,\u201d Mr. Ebell said this week in an interview.Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest target may be emission rules that would force the closing of hundreds of coal-fired power plants meant to be replaced by wind and solar power. But they are caught up in court battles that could run for months or years.By contrast, he could more quickly soften Mr. Obama\u2019s rules requiring tougher vehicle emission standards. Mr. Trump met on Tuesday with executives of major American automakers, who complained that before leaving office, Mr. Obama finalized an ambitious E.P.A. rule requiring that vehicles average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2026. Mr. Trump said he would help with burdensome regulations, but offered no specifics.Mr. Trump could lift a moratorium instituted last year by Mr. Obama on new coal mining leases on public lands. As soon as next month, the Republican-led Congress may pass legislation undoing Mr. Obama\u2019s regulations on the practice of mountaintop-removal coal mining and on leaks of planet-warming methane emissions from oil and gas drilling rigs.Studies showed that the pipeline would not have a momentous effect on jobs or the environment, but both sides made it into a symbolic test case. The State Department estimated that Keystone would support 42,000 temporary jobs for two years \u2014 about 3,900 of them in construction and the rest through indirect support, like food service \u2014 but only 35 permanent jobs. Similarly, the government concluded that Keystone\u2019s carbon emissions would equal less than 1 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.\u201cKeystone has never been a significant issue from an environmental point of view in substance, only in symbol,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, an energy market analyst and a former head of the State Department\u2019s energy bureau in the Obama administration.But it was a symbol Mr. Trump found important enough to seize on early in his presidency. He signed an executive memorandum inviting TransCanada \u201cto promptly resubmit its application to the Department of State for a presidential permit\u201d for the pipeline, although the document did not guarantee approval.The president told reporters he would \u201crenegotiate some of the terms\u201d \u2014 including possibly an insistence that the pipeline be built with American steel \u2014 but left little doubt that he wanted it approved. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can get that pipeline built,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of jobs.\u201dIn a statement, TransCanada accepted his invitation to seek permission again. \u201cWe are currently preparing the application and intend to do so,\u201d the company said, vowing that it would create jobs and still protect waterways and other sensitive resources.The Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota became the focus of protests when the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe objected to its construction less than a mile from its reservation. The tribe and its allies won victory last month when the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it would look for alternative routes for the $3.7 billion pipeline instead of allowing it to be drilled under a dammed section of the Missouri River.Mr. Trump signed an executive memorandum directing the Army \u201cto review and approve in an expedited manner\u201d the pipeline, \u201cto the extent permitted by law and as warranted.\u201d In his session with reporters, he added, \u201cAgain, subject to terms and conditions to be negotiated by us.\u201dMr. Trump owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners, the company that is building the Dakota Access pipeline, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. Last month, a spokesman for Mr. Trump said he sold all of his stock in June, but there is no way of verifying that sale, and Mr. Trump has not provided documentation of it.Critics vowed to keep resisting the projects. Jan Hasselman, a lawyer for Earthjustice, an environmental law group representing the tribe, said Mr. Trump was discarding the findings of a review. \u201cThey\u2019re just ignoring the problems that the government has already found,\u201d he said, \u201cand that is the kind of thing that courts need to review very closely.\u201dIn Canada, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. \u201cWe have been supportive of this since the day we were sworn into government,\u201d Jim Carr, the natural resources minister, told reporters. Mr. Carr said the American reversal will lead \u201cto a deepening of the relationship across the border.\u201dIn addition to the Keystone and Dakota directives, Mr. Trump signed three others intended to ease the way for businesses and to promote American manufacturing. One instructed the Commerce Department to develop a plan to ensure that future pipelines built in the United States be constructed of American-made materials.Another was aimed at streamlining what he called \u201cthe incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process and reducing regulatory burdens for domestic manufacturing.\u201d The last directive was intended to expedite environmental reviews for \u201chigh-priority infrastructure projects\u201d like highways and bridges.Some news reports on Tuesday said that the E.P.A. and other departments had issued orders forbidding employees from issuing news releases or posting on social media. But longtime officials in multiple agencies said the guidance was similar to that of when Mr. Obama took office eight years ago.Ian Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa, and Jack Healy from Denver.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of European Meritocracy", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported bySOFIA, Bulgaria \u2014 When you can\u2019t understand why people behave in a certain way, the easiest thing to do is to convince yourself that people do not know what they are doing. This is what European political, business and news media leaders have done in response to the populist wave that is sweeping the old Continent. They are shocked that many of their compatriots are voting for irresponsible demagogues. They find it difficult to understand the sources of the rage against the meritocratic elites best symbolized by the well-trained, competent civil servants in Brussels.Why are the \u201cexams-passing classes\u201d so resented at a time when the complexity of the world suggests that people need them most? Why do people who work hard so that their kids can graduate from the world\u2019s best universities refuse to trust people who have already graduated from these universities? How is it possible that anybody can agree with Michael Gove, the pro-Brexit politician, who said people \u201chave had enough of experts\u201d?It should seem obvious that meritocracy \u2014 a system in which the most talented and capable, the best educated, those who score highest on the tests, are put in leading positions \u2014 is better than plutocracy, gerontocracy, aristocracy and, perhaps, even the rule of the majority, democracy.But Europe\u2019s meritocratic elites aren\u2019t hated simply because of populists\u2019 bigoted stupidity or the confusion of ordinary people.What makes meritocrats so unbearable to their critics is not so much their success but their insistence that they have succeeded because they worked harder than others, because they happened to be more qualified than others and because they passed the tests that others failed.The paradox of the current political crisis in Europe is rooted in the fact that the Brussels elites are blamed for the same reasons that they praised themselves for: their cosmopolitanism, their resistance to public pressure and their mobility.In Europe, the meritocratic elite is a mercenary elite, not unlike the way the best soccer players are traded around to the most successful clubs across the Continent. Successful Dutch bankers move to London; competent German bureaucrats move to Brussels. European institutions and banks, just like soccer clubs, spend colossal amounts of money acquiring the best \u201cplayers.\u201d Usually, this system means victories on the pitch or in the central bank\u2019s boardroom.But what happens when these teams start to lose or the economy slows down? Their fans abandon them. That\u2019s because there\u2019s no relationship connecting the \u201cplayers\u201d and their fans beyond celebrating victories. They are not from the same neighborhood. They don\u2019t have mutual friends or shared memories. Many of the players aren\u2019t even from the same countries as their teams. You can admire the hired \u201cstars,\u201d but you do not have reason to be sorry for them.In the eyes of the meritocratic elites, their success outside of their country is a proof of their talents, but in the eyes of many people, this very mobility is a reason not to trust them.People trust their leaders not only because of their competence but also because of their courage and commitment, and because they believe that their leaders will remain with their own in times of crisis rather than being helicoptered to the emergency exit. Paradoxically, it is the convertible competencies of the present elites, the fact that they are equally fit to run a bank in Bulgaria or in Bangladesh or to teach in Athens or Tokyo, that make people so suspicious of them. People fear that in times of trouble, the meritocrats will opt to leave instead of sharing the cost of staying.Unsurprisingly then, it is loyalty \u2014 namely the unconditional loyalty to ethnic, religious or social groups \u2014 that is at the heart of the appeal of Europe\u2019s new populism. Populists promise people not to judge them based solely on their merits. They promise solidarity but not necessarily justice.The American philosopher John Rawls spoke for many liberals when he argued that being a loser in a meritocratic society was not as painful as being a loser in an openly unjust society. In his conception, the fairness of the game would reconcile people with failure. Today it looks as if the great philosopher may have been wrong.Ivan Krastev is the chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies, a permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Text to Text: Comparing Jewish Refugees of the 1930s With Syrian Refugees Today", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byGlobal IssuesIntroduction________Background Even before the beginning of World War II in September 1939, Nazi Germany\u2019s open aggression toward both neighboring countries and people within its borders had sparked a refugee crisis. The German annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland in 1938 increased the number of people affected by Nazi restrictions, while at the same time those restrictions intensified to the point that Jews, political dissidents and others were effectively removed from German public life and denied rights, employment and education. Germany\u2019s aggressive steps to expand its borders touched off both an international political crisis, as world leaders scrambled to avoid war, and a humanitarian refugee crisis, as hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people, mostly Jews, sought safety from the Nazis in countries outside the grip of the Third Reich.In the aftermath of World War II, the newly formed United Nations moved to set up international bodies and laws to define the status and rights of refugees for the first time. The U.N. High Commission for Refugees was established in 1951 and given a three-year mandate to resolve postwar refugee problems. Sixty-five years later, it still exists, and there are more refugees around the world today than at any time since the end of World War II.Can the history of the refugee crisis of the 1930s help us think about how we respond to Syrian refugees today? The Times article by Daniel Victor\u2019 explores the parallels between today\u2019s Syrian refugees and Jewish refugees before World War II. We pair this news article with a 10-minute excerpt from \u201cDefying the Nazis: The Sharps\u2019 War\u201d that focuses on the Sharps\u2019s efforts to help refugees escape from occupied Czechoslovakia in 1939. Together, these sources complicate our thinking about how individuals and governments define their responsibility to refugees, in the past and the present.________Key Questions \u2022 What are similarities and differences between the refugee crises of the 1930s and today?\u2022 How might examining the history of refugees in the 1930s inform the choices that individuals and governments make in responding to refugees today?_________A tweet drawing a historical parallel to the current plight of Syrian refugees drew thousands of retweets this week.Some historians say that, while the two groups are not completely symmetrical, there are lessons to be drawn.It\u2019s true that Americans in 1939 were worried about refugees taking jobs. Those who lived through the Depression were overwhelmingly supportive of restricting immigration, Mr. Shulman said.That caused Jewish refugees to be \u201cextraordinarily, excruciatingly vetted,\u201d said Marion Kaplan, a professor in the Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University.One area where the two refugee groups do not neatly match, Ms. Kaplan said, is the racial animus they faced both home and abroad. Unlike modern Syrians, Jews in the 1930s \u201cwere singled out as the racial enemy, par excellence, in German society,\u201d she said.And the United States was not entirely welcoming. On top of wanting to preserve jobs, Americans were concerned about Jews \u201cweakening the Nordic or Anglo racial stock,\u201d Mr. Shulman said. \u201cThat was a very real concern.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou can\u2019t just reduce it to economics or politics. That sort of racial identity was very powerful.\u201d________________For Writing and Discussion1. How does Daniel Victor\u2019s article compare responses to Jewish refugees in the 1930s with responses to Syrian refugees today? What are some of the key similarities and differences? How do ideas about race and religion shape attitudes to refugees in each example? What other factors play a role?2. How does the film clip from \u201cDefying the Nazis\u201d connect to Mr. Victor\u2019s article? How does it extend your thinking about the lives of refugees and the fears, hopes and challenges they have experienced? How does it add to your understanding of United States\u2019 policies and attitudes toward refugees in the 1930s?3. The historian Peter Shulman, interviewed in the article, argued that there are \u201cenough similarities between Jewish refugees in the 1930s and Syrian refugees today to draw a \u2018moral connection\u2019 between the two situations.\u201d Do you agree with Mr. Shulman? Why or why not? If yes, how would you describe this \u201cmoral connection?\u201d4. What dilemmas did Martha and Waitstill Sharp face in their decision to leave home and help refugees in Europe? What risks did they take? What do you think motivated them to make a choice to help refugees when that was so at odds with American public opinion and national policy?5. Many who connect the refugee crisis of the 1930s to the plight of Syrian refugees today emphasize the failure of the United States and other countries to help. The Sharps\u2019s story, in contrast, is about a small group of private citizens banding together to aid refugees. Is their history relevant to the current refugee crisis? How might a story of people who chose to help then inform decision-making about the refugee crisis today?_________Going FurtherAs you read them, consider these questions: How do the articles portray the crisis and the options available to refugees? What was the range of responses and attitudes to refugees, and what arguments were offered in support of allowing or restricting immigration? What questions would you want to ask the individuals living at the time who are quoted in these articles? What would you want them to understand?The articles below highlight some of these efforts. As you read them, consider: How do these stories compare to that of the Sharps? What is the range of actions individuals have taken to help refugees in Europe today? How do these various efforts differ, and what do they have in common? What tools are these individuals and groups using to make a difference? How have people been able to help when they live in proximity to refugees? How have they helped when they are far away? What can an individual or a small group accomplish that a government may not be able to?________Additional ResourcesAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Are Coping (for Now) With Blows to Unity in Europe", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byLosing one referendum crucial to the future of Europe may be regarded as misfortune, but, as Oscar Wilde might say, losing two looks like carelessness. Europe\u2019s leaders are looking careless after forcing votes in Britain and Italy that went the wrong way, from their perspective, within less than six months.But you would barely realize that any of that happened, judging by the performance of European markets.Popular exchange-traded funds, like Vanguard FTSE Europe and iShares Europe, lost 3.9 percent and 3.2 percent on the year, although dividend payments meant that shareholders just about broke even.European government bond yields have soared since the so-called Brexit vote, but they were still down for all of 2016, which means that bond prices, which move in the opposite direction, rose.The markets are taking political developments in stride, but that may not last. For while the people have spoken, they are not about to pipe down soon; national elections are scheduled this year in the two most important European Union states: Germany and France.There are populist parties on the ballot in each that could achieve enough support to ruffle the markets. Many Europeans are frustrated with decades of economic stagnation exacerbated by a failure by leaders to confront barriers to prosperity like high taxes and rigid labor markets. With so much at stake, investment advisers warn, it would be foolish to downplay the dangers.Europe is suffering from \u201cthe rise of populist backlash against the establishment,\u201d said Paul O\u2019Connor, head of multiasset for Henderson Global Investors, a British company that manages $12.5 billion in assets in American mutual funds. \u201cIt feels as if it\u2019s in its infancy, and it\u2019s going to overshadow the next few years quite significantly.\u201dPopulist governments often spend lots of money on infrastructure projects and other programs intended to curry favor with the public, market strategists say. That enhances growth in the short run, and it may provide a notable boost for Europe by accelerating a nascent trend away from the austerity that many governments imposed during the debt crisis a few years ago.But the spending programs are often financed with borrowed money, something that Europe owes plenty of already, and the damage from the added debt usually outweighs and outlasts the benefits from the growth. Stock buyers lately seem to be focusing on the positive growth factors, while bond sellers are looking further ahead.\u201cTypically, when a populist government gets elected, one of the first things it does is fiscal expansion\u201d to promote job growth and voter confidence, said Markus Stadlmann, chief investment officer of Lloyds Private Bank. \u201cWhat happens in the next phase of fiscal expansion is that it\u2019s financed by government borrowing.\u201d President-elect Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain have proposed programs of one sort or another that would serve this purpose, Mr. Stadlmann said.When the bill comes due, it is often in the form of higher interest rates or higher inflation. At that stage, he warned, \u201cgovernment is less in control, the deficit deteriorates, government spending is unsustainable, wages fall in real terms and there are capital outflows. That\u2019s one of the reasons the bond rout has been really intense.\u201dAnother populist impulse that should worry investors is protectionism through tariffs or other curbs on foreign goods. The aim is to protect jobs, but most economists say that constraining trade limits competition and leads to higher consumer prices.One concern about Brexit is that Britain will lose access to the free-trade zone within Europe. Not only might British merchandise be hit with tariffs, but British companies might also have to pay more for European goods used in manufacturing.Mr. Stadlmann called the potential for trade disruptions \u201ca big risk.\u201dA potentially (if, at the moment, unlikely) catastrophic economic event that investment advisers say is not accounted for in asset prices is the departure from the European Union, or at least the euro, of the one indispensable member: Germany.If Germans wanted to leave the union \u2014 say, because of disenchantment with the influx of migrants or the assistance provided to weaker member states \u2014 it could do so. Germany has a more robust economy than its neighbors, and it runs a large current-account surplus with the world outside Europe (more money comes in than goes out), so it could replace the euro with a stronger currency, reducing the country\u2019s debt burden, whereas a weaker country that left the eurozone might risk default.If Germany left, \u201cthe E.U. would be severely wounded, at best,\u201d said William Porter, global credit strategist for Credit Suisse, adding, \u201cPolitics in the periphery is not what\u2019s going to drive\u201d developments in Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s the core.\u201dMr. Stadlmann expressed similar thoughts, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not Spain and Italy that are different in the E.U., it\u2019s Germany.\u201d He added that he is \u201cnot very negative on the E.U. holding together at the moment.\u201dWhat investment advisers are very negative on when they consider the impact of rising populism is European bonds.\u201cThe re-pricing in government bonds is incomplete,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Connor at Henderson, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s plausible the bull market in fixed-income has come to an end.\u201dMr. Stadlmann likewise noted that the reversal of bond yields is \u201ccontinuing and gaining speed.\u201d As for other assets, he encourages being \u201cvery, very selective.\u201d In particular, he favors stocks of German retailers and real estate companies.John Maxwell, manager of the Ivy International Core Equity Fund, is more optimistic on European stocks, especially on multinational companies that are cheaper than rivals based elsewhere and that are comparatively immune to politics.\u201cIf something goes wrong, it doesn\u2019t mean Procter & Gamble is going to do better than Unilever selling detergent in Italy,\u201d he said.Unilever is one portfolio holding that illustrates his point. Others are the energy company Total, British American Tobacco, the health care concern Smith & Nephew and Reckitt Benckiser, which makes household goods.Mr. O\u2019Connor of Henderson prefers market segments that do well when inflation rises, including financial services and economically cyclical sectors like natural resources and consumer discretionary. Among the 10 largest holdings in the Henderson International Opportunities fund on Nov. 30, the last date for which holdings had been disclosed, were the French carmaker Renault, the British insurance company Standard Life and the German tire manufacturer Continental.But Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s support for European stocks in general is lukewarm, and with the penchant that European voters have shown for making surprising decisions with ramifications that will remain hard to gauge, taking big investment risks may start to look like carelessness.\u201cEquities are the place to be, but I think it\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride,\u201d he said. While he finds that \u201cmomentum is gradually improving,\u201d the inability to find lasting solutions to what does not work in Europe ensures that there will be \u201cno very powerful bull script.\u201d\u201cThere is a more plausible path to growth\u201d in Europe, Mr. O\u2019Connor said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not enough to dispel some of the political things that are flaring up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angst Simmers in Washington as Trump Presidency Nears", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the Virginia suburb of McLean, where the local diner is a C.I.A. breakfast hangout, Gen. Michael V. Hayden, who ran the agency for George W. Bush, is playing career counselor these days. With President-elect Donald J. Trump attacking the intelligence community, the general says his \u201cold tribe\u2019\u2019 is feeling \u201ca special angst.\u201dIn free-spirited Takoma Park, Md., a \u201cnuclear-free zone\u201d since 1983, a left-wing resistance movement is taking shape. Nadine Bloch, an activist and artist, is running pre-inaugural training on nonviolent protest \u2014 complete with mock police officers wielding rolled up newspapers as batons.And here in the District of Columbia, where 91 percent of voters cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton, \u201cfull-scale panic\u201d is setting in, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and Trump enthusiast. Leslie Harris, a liberal Democratic lawyer, uses war imagery: \u201cI feel like my city is about to be invaded.\u201dWashington has always been a chameleon of a city, accustomed to remaking itself when the White House changes hands. But as Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural draws near, in a nation so deeply divided that it seems the political middle has entirely disappeared, perhaps no place in America feels as unsteady and on edge as the capital, which Mr. Trump calls \u201cthe swamp.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what to expect from Trump, except that he\u2019s combative,\u201d said Robert Dallek, a presidential biographer, who has lived here for 20 years. And furthermore, Mr. Dallek complained, \u201cIt\u2019s offensive to be called a swamp.\u201dBut like the rest of America, Washington is also a real place, with real people, who have lived here for decades. The permanent occupants of \u201cthe swamp\u201d see presidents come, and see them go. And no matter what their politics, people agree with Mr. Feehery that this transition \u201cfeels different\u201d from any in recent memory.Ms. Harris is an archetypical northwest Washingtonian. A self-described policy wonk, she grew up somewhere else, Atlanta, and got a taste of politics as a student. When Jimmy Carter won the presidency, she was in the unusual position of being 26 and knowing a lot of powerful people here.She attended law school at Georgetown, married a doctor and raised a daughter and a son. Now semiretired, she used to run the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates internet freedom. She has often worked with Republicans; they are her friends.But when Mr. Trump was elected, suddenly America\u2019s divisions hit home. When Mike Pence, the vice president-elect, rented a house nearby, his neighbors decorated their homes with gay pride rainbow flags. When a white supremacist group hosted a dinner at a nearby Italian restaurant, Maggiano\u2019s, protests erupted outside.Then Comet Ping Pong, a pizzeria where Ms. Harris takes her grandchildren, was targeted by a fake news story involving Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Harris, savvy about the media, organized community support. Soon after, a gunman turned up at the restaurant and fired shots inside.\u201cIt was beyond my imagination,\u201d she said.Just over the Maryland line, Takoma Park is a \u201csanctuary city,\u201d which refuses to prosecute undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump does not look kindly on that. Days after the election, Ms. Bloch, 55, the organizer, helped pull together Takoma Park Mobilization, a new grass-roots group aimed at \u201cstanding up for our neighbors,\u201d she said. More than 500 people attended the first meeting.They have since divided themselves into committees and subcommittees, with titles like \u201cImmigration\u201d and \u201cWomen\u201d and \u201cCivil Rights,\u201d and have been holding weeknight meetings in the firehouse and the airy historical society headquarters, next door to Bikram Yoga and down the street from the food co-op. Next up: sessions aimed at liberal civil servants agonizing about whether to quit their jobs.\u201cIt may be better for us for people to stay,\u201d Ms. Bloch said, \u201cand figure out how to resist within the system.\u201dIn northeast Washington, a heavily African-American quadrant of the city, such discussions seemed ludicrous; people there don\u2019t plan to protest. They just want to stay out of harm\u2019s way. On a snowy Saturday morning at Perfection Unisex Salon, the stylist Chante Watts, 37, urged some of her clients, who are teachers, to come in for cuts on Inauguration Day. They all intend to stay home.She was running a hot comb through the hair of Chris Vera, who helped explain why. Ms. Vera, 32 and a city employee, has been asked to help with the inaugural; she fears violence will erupt that day. \u201cNobody wants to be within a 10-mile radius,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody\u2019s feeling quite safe.\u201dYet in the Virginia suburb of Fredericksburg, about an hour\u2019s drive from here and home to many military people and religious conservatives, Tina Whittington, vice president of an anti-abortion group, has noticed a pickup in home building.\u201cI think there is huge anticipation that this transition is going to be good for our community,\u201d she said, though she confessed that even there, in the heart of Trump country, the feeling is \u201cstill a little apprehensive, wait and see.\u201dIn transitions past, Washington has filled with talk of Georgetown parties and the first lady\u2019s ball gown, and how the city\u2019s culture might change.But with his wife, Melania, and son Barron keeping their primary residence at Trump Tower at least until the school year is out, Mr. Trump may not be spending much time here. That is fine with Mark Salter, a former aide to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is Mr. Trump\u2019s nemesis on Capitol Hill. \u201cThe less he\u2019s here the better, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Mr. Salter said.Movement conservatives, though, are ecstatic. After eight years in the policy wilderness, scholars at the Heritage Foundation, a policy organization, are helping guide the new Trump administration on ideas and personnel. \u201cFolks were pretty happy,\u201d said Wesley Denton, the Heritage spokesman, when Mr. Trump gave them a shout-out during his recent news conference.But in Democratic policy circles there is little lightness this time around. Neera Tanden, a former adviser and strong ally of Mrs. Clinton, has little patience for questions about the city\u2019s mood. She now leads the Center for American Progress, a leading progressive think tank, a job that makes her a de facto leader of the Democratic resistance.\u201cHe\u2019s going to deport undocumented people,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cHow Washington responds is low on the totem pole of problems with this administration.\u201dBut with Mr. Trump openly questioning the \u201chigh confidence judgment\u201d by the C.I.A. about Russian hacking, he has been entertaining a steady stream of visitors wary of joining the new administration.\u201cI say, \u2018Yeah, by all means, if the president-elect asks you to serve, consider it seriously,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t think of it as a lifetime commitment; you remain a free agent.\u2019\u2019If there is a historical parallel to this moment, it may be to President Reagan, said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former Reagan chief of staff. He recalled how liberal Reagan critics sniffed, \u201cHow do you trust this actor with his finger on the nuclear trigger?\u201d conveniently forgetting he had been a two-term governor of California. (Mr. Trump, by contrast, has never held public office.)And if the denizens of the swamp appear to be in some kind of defensive crouch, Mr. Duberstein says, there is perhaps good reason for that: \u201cDonald is saying there\u2019s a new sheriff in town.\u201dTwitter: @SherylNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making the Rust Belt Rustier", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byDonald Trump will break most of his campaign promises. Which promises will he keep?The answer, I suspect, has more to do with psychology than it does with strategy. Mr. Trump is much more enthusiastic about punishing people than he is about helping them. He may have promised not to cut Social Security and Medicare, or take health insurance away from the tens of millions who gained coverage under Obamacare, but in practice he seems perfectly willing to satisfy his party by destroying the safety net.On the other hand, he appears serious about his eagerness to reverse America\u2019s 80-year-long commitment to expanding world trade. On Thursday the White House said it was considering a 20 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico; doing so wouldn\u2019t just pull the U.S. out of NAFTA, it would violate all our trading agreements.Why does he want this? Because he sees international trade the way he sees everything else: as a struggle for dominance, in which you only win at somebody else\u2019s expense.Now, I\u2019m talking about the reality of Reagan, not the Republicans\u2019 legend, which assigns all blame for the early-1980s recession to Jimmy Carter and all credit for the subsequent recovery to the sainted Ronald. In fact, that whole cycle had almost nothing to do with Reagan policies.What Reagan did do, however, was blow up the budget deficit with military spending and tax cuts. This drove up interest rates, which drew in foreign capital. The inflow of capital, in turn, led to a stronger dollar, which made U.S. manufacturing uncompetitive. The trade deficit soared \u2014 and the long-term decline in the share of manufacturing in overall employment accelerated sharply.Notably, it was under Reagan that talk of \u201cdeindustrialization\u201d and the use of the term \u201cRust Belt\u201d first became widespread.Will we repeat this story? The Trump regime will clearly blow up the deficit, mainly through tax cuts for the rich. (Funny, isn\u2019t it, how all the deficit scolds have gone quiet?) True, this may not boost spending very much, since the rich will save much of their windfall while the poor and the middle class will face harsh benefits cuts. Still, interest rates have already risen in anticipation of the borrowing surge, and so has the dollar. So we do seem to be following the Reagan playbook for shrinking manufacturing.It\u2019s true that Mr. Trump appears ready to practice a much more extreme form of protectionism than Reagan, who avoided outright violations of existing trade deals. This could help some manufacturing industries. But it will also drive the dollar higher, hurting others.And there\u2019s a further factor to consider: The world economy has gotten a lot more complex over the past three decades. These days, hardly anything is simply \u201cmade in America,\u201d or for that matter \u201cmade in China\u201d: Manufacturing is a global enterprise, in which cars, planes and so on are assembled from components produced in multiple countries.What will happen to this enterprise if the United States takes a meat ax to the agreements that govern international trade? There will, inevitably, be huge dislocation: Some U.S. factories and communities will benefit, but others will be hurt, bigly, by the loss of markets, crucial components or both.And the biggest losers, as with health care, will be white working-class voters who were foolish enough to believe that Donald Trump was on their side.Advertisement"}

Pekins, the chairman of the natural resources and environment department of the University of New Hampshire and a professor of wildlife ecology.The high mortality rate is a finding from the first three years of a study, which now includes biologists in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, to track moose cows and calves with GPS collars and gather data about their health and survival.\u201cThey\u2019ve wasted away. They\u2019re eating every day but they just can\u2019t come up with enough protein to combat this blood loss,\u201d Mr. Pekins said of the dead moose calves. He is overseeing New Hampshire\u2019s part of the study.Researchers in northern New Hampshire and in western Maine began tagging moose in 2014 \u2014 relying on skilled technicians called \u201cmuggers\u201d to do the job. Working out of a helicopter, the team shoots a net gun at a moose, and then descends to blindfold it, collar it, take blood and fecal samples, and take a tick count. The process takes about 15 minutes.When a moose in the study dies, researchers get a text message and set out \u2014 by truck, snowmobile and snowshoe \u2014 to gather blood and other samples. Over the course of the study, the month of April has brought so many deaths that researchers have taken to calling it \u201cthe month of death.\u201d\u201cMy phone has a special tone that says mortality,\u201d said Lee Kantar, the state moose biologist for Maine. \u201cOne of the macabre tones.\u201dThe study expanded last year to northern Maine \u2014 which Mr. Kantar said had a lower mortality rate of 48 percent \u2014 and to Vermont this month. There are about 250 moose collared for the study.Winter ticks form enormous clusters, attach themselves to animals by the thousands and stay for their entire life cycle. Older moose try to rub them off against trees, breaking the hairs of their fur or even rubbing their skin raw in the process. Researchers call such animals \u201cghost moose\u201d because they look white or patchy.But calves, which can weigh about 400 pounds, are sometimes unable to withstand the blood loss from an infestation, and die in the spring.Ticks \u201cremove so much blood from the animal, the animal can\u2019t replace it fast enough,\u201d Mr. Kantar said, calling the process \u201cpretty gruesome.\u201dMr. Kantar said the study was about moose survival \u2014 not climate \u2014 although there appears to be a link between environmental conditions and the success of the winter ticks.\u201cEvery single day when temperatures are above the norm in the fall is another day that the ticks are out there and able to get on a moose,\u201d he said.Meteorologists have recorded a series of moderate winters in New England over recent years.\u201cThe general trend in the Northeast has been for warmer winters and less snowfall over the last 10 to 15 years,\u201d said Eric Sinsabaugh, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service\u2019s office in Gray, Me. \u201cOf course that coincides with some of the warmest years we\u2019ve had on record.\u201dAnother factor in the spread of winter ticks, researchers believe, is the number of moose, which rebounded by the 1990s after they were decimated by human use of their habitat earlier in the century. More moose, researchers say, mean more hosts for ticks.The biologists say that one possible way to control the problem, though counterintuitive, is increased hunting. If the moose population falls, researchers say, the ticks will have fewer hosts on which to feed, and their numbers will fall.\u201cDo you want a lot of moose that may be a little less healthy, than fewer moose that maybe are more healthy?\u201d Mr. Pekins said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real quandary.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a long and brutal situation for them, until the habitat either changes or humans decide we just need to take more of these animals,\u201d Mr. Theriault said.Researchers say that if hunting does not increase and the weather does not change, the ticks\u2019 own success in killing moose will eventually make life harder for them, too.\u201cWe hope that the tick numbers are thus going to be reduced and at some point you get a new equilibrium of moose density,\u201d Mr. Kantar said. \u201cIt\u2019s just at a lower density.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump and Janet Yellen Look to Be on a Collision Course", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byMonetary PolicyJanet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, made it clear Wednesday that she believes that the American economy is pretty much back on track.And that, in turn, sets the stage for a potential conflict with the incoming Trump administration in the months and years ahead.Congress assigns the Fed two goals: seek maximum employment and maintain stable prices. Ms. Yellen, in a speech in San Francisco, rather explicitly made clear that the nation isn\u2019t far from attaining those goals.\u201cNow, it\u2019s fair to say, the economy is near maximum employment, and inflation is moving toward our goal,\u201d she said. The unemployment rate, 4.7 percent, is back near where it was before the 2008 recession. And \u201calthough inflation has been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time, we have seen it start inching back toward 2 percent last year.\u201dIt is Ms. Yellen\u2019s clearest indication to date that the era of extraordinary efforts by the central bank to get the economy back in shape is nearing its end. The Fed has raised short-term interest rates in each of the last two Decembers, and it is looking likely that there will be more than one rate increase this year. She said in her speech that she and her colleagues were expecting to increase the federal funds rate \u201ca few times a year.\u201dAs central bankers are wont to do, Ms. Yellen emphasized that those plans were contingent on the economy\u2019s behaving as the Fed expected. If inflation starts to slip again, or improvements in the job market recede, the Fed will presumably hold off. But she spoke clearly of the risks of moving too slowly toward the so-called neutral interest rate that neither stimulates nor slows the economy.\u201cWaiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road,\u201d she said. \u201cEither too much inflation, financial instability or both.\u201dBut if things go as planned, there is a clear risk that the Fed\u2019s goals could be on a collision course with the Trump administration\u2019s goals.That view is at odds with both Ms. Yellen\u2019s comments Wednesday and longer-term economic projects that Fed officials have released. For example, the median Fed policy maker viewed the economy\u2019s long-term rate of G.D.P. growth as only 1.8 percent a year, very much in the ballpark that Trump advisers would view as unnecessarily defeatist.So here\u2019s one way things could go: The Fed steadily raises rates, to the degree that employment and inflation data cooperate with their forecasts, with faster rate increases the higher growth rises. It\u2019s possible that what people in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit view as a desirable boom will look to Ms. Yellen and her colleagues as overheating, and prompt equal and opposite interest rate increases.There are a couple of potential twists in this story. The first would involve potential Trump appointments to the Fed; the second could involve big moves in the dollar.Ms. Yellen\u2019s term as chairwoman expires in about a year. Mr. Trump could appoint a new leader to the Fed who is more hospitable to his view (though she would have the option of continuing her time as a Fed governor, one of seven policy makers who are appointed to 14-year terms).There are two governor vacancies available now, so Mr. Trump could quickly influence the direction of the Fed with new appointees.But it\u2019s not clear whether any new Trump appointees would steer the bank toward higher interest rates and greater concern about inflation or let a potential Trump boom advance unconstrained.Big fluctuations in the dollar could also shape a potential tension between Trumponomics and Fed policy. Economists believe a key element of a corporate income tax overhaul advanced by House Republicans, known as a border adjustment tax, would have the effect of creating a huge rally in the value of the dollar compared with other major currencies, perhaps 20 percent or more.The Fed has been more focused than ever in the last few years on how its decisions ripple through the global economy. It held off on rate increases in 2015 and early 2016 in significant part because a rally in the dollar seemed to be destabilizing many emerging markets and fueling risks of a global slowdown.A stronger dollar also reduces inflation in the United States, which in turn makes the Fed more inclined toward caution on rate increases.Add up a week of new signals from incoming Trump administration officials and now Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech, and it is looking like a distinct possibility that Ms. Yellen could wake up one morning in the year ahead to early-morning tweets directed her way, originating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Greece and Turkey, an Old Rivalry Flares", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byThe men \u2014 two majors, four captains and two noncommissioned officers \u2014 turned up in the northern Greek town of Alexandroupolis in a military helicopter the day after the attempted coup. They have claimed that they were not knowingly involved in the rebellion \u2014 that they followed orders but were not aware a coup was in progress \u2014 but fled to escape persecution, asking for political asylum.Since then, the officers have become a touchstone by which many Greeks are testing the independence of their own judiciary and their country\u2019s democratic principles. Those Greeks feel that even if the eight were involved in trying to topple a legitimate government, they should not be sent back to face a judicial system that, they fear, cannot guarantee fair trials. For the Turkish government, however, the eight are traitors, and their flight to Greece was in itself a provocation.Meanwhile, negotiations under United Nations auspices to end the Turkish occupation of part of Cyprus and reunite Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots on the independent island are at a crucial phase. A conference starting in Geneva on Jan. 12, which will include Greek and Turkish delegations, will depend very much on good will from Ankara for a breakthrough in one of the world\u2019s most intractable conflicts.Equally important, Turkey can control the flow of refugees and migrants toward the European Union through Greece. An agreement whereby the European Union will expedite Turkey\u2019s accession while the latter will keep migrants from leaving for Europe is looking increasingly fragile. Ankara\u2019s persecution of lawyers, judges, academics, journalists, opposition politicians and others is one of the main causes of friction with the European Union and human rights organizations. Greece, a member of the European Union and already struggling with more immigrants than it can handle, now has to balance respect for asylum seekers with the possible fallout from an angry Turkey.The head of Turkey\u2019s bar association, Metin Feyzioglu, put it bluntly in a statement distributed by the C.C.B.E.: \u201cThe governmental decrees of the state of emergency are directly targeting the right to defense and the legal profession. The actual targets are the fundamental rights and freedoms of the citizens which are being defended by lawyers,\u201d he said. \u201cOur citizens no longer trust the judiciary. The judiciary is no longer the guarantee of the country.\u201dKostis Papaioannou, who was secretary general for human rights at the Justice Ministry until November (resigning after a cabinet reshuffle), noted that no one could question the Turkish government\u2019s right to protect legality. But regarding the eight, he added: \u201cWe are not interested in the level of their involvement in the attempted coup, our sole concern is their fate if they find themselves in the hands of the Turkish authorities. Greek judges are called on to rule on the basis of their conscience and not according to unspecified appeals regarding national interests.\u201dPeople have always crossed the Aegean in search of asylum. Even Themistocles, the great Athenian leader whose strategy and tactics defeated an invading Persian army in the fifth century B.C., found refuge in Asia Minor, then ruled by Persia, when his fellow citizens turned against him. For the Greek government, it might have been easier if the asylum seekers were intellectuals or artists, not alleged conspirators against a legitimate government. But it is in respecting the rights of all \u2014 regardless of who they are \u2014 that democracies must measure themselves.Nikos Konstandaras, the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Counting the Winners and Losers From an Import-Based Tax", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byThe idea of a broad tax on importers is suddenly at the center of the Washington policy debate, with the inevitable counting of potential winners and losers.Such a tax could hit retailers the hardest if it takes full effect, with their heavy reliance on products as varied as microwave ovens from China and T-shirts from Bangladesh. But few sectors of the American economy and few consumers would be unaffected.If such a tax were imposed on imports from around the world, automakers could face hefty tax bills not only for cars imported from Mexico and elsewhere but also for the many auto parts they buy from overseas for their assembly lines in the United States. Chemical companies, supplying practically every industry, could find themselves paying more for feedstocks. And energy companies could wind up paying more for imported oil.The Republican leadership of the House Ways and Means Committee has been working in recent months on such a plan, a border-adjusted tax, as part of an effort to cut corporate tax rates. On Thursday, the plan got caught up in a discussion of ways to make Mexico pay for a proposed border wall, before the White House stepped back from endorsing that course.If a border-adjusted tax is used to offset a reduction in corporate tax rates, American exporters and their employees would rank among the winners.Yet, even in its broader form, the tax plan could be politically tricky. If a tax covers oil imports, for example, it would end up falling most heavily on rural Americans, who voted heavily for President Trump but also tend to drive farther each year than residents of heavily Democratic large cities.The tax \u201cwould be a boon for producers but it would be a negative for consumers \u2014 it\u2019s going to hit the pocketbooks of his supporters the hardest,\u201d said Ed Hirs, a managing director of Hillhouse Resources, an oil and gas company based in Houston.Even those seemingly safe from import taxes, exporters like Boeing and American farmers, could also lose sales if other countries retaliated. Banks on Wall Street could lose overseas contracts to represent initial public offerings if foreign governments responded by steering their companies to European or Asian rivals.By international standards, the United States puts few taxes on consumption, while taxing producers more heavily. The House Republican proposal would start to shift that balance, and one likely effect would be somewhat higher prices at retailers including gas stations and Walmart.Many small manufacturers without overseas factories have long favored an overhaul of the United States tax code that would increase corporate taxes on importers. The money raised from such a tax increase, they have argued, could then be used to offset a reduction in the overall corporate tax rate of 35 percent.Powerful business groups like the American Chamber of Commerce have said little about such proposals, because of deep divisions in corporate America based on who would pay the import tax and who might benefit from a reduction in corporate taxes.But Mr. Trump and his spokesman, Sean Spicer, may have complicated the House Republicans\u2019 efforts by raising the possibility of imposing such a tax on goods from Mexico first, with the money used to pay for a wall along the Mexican border to deter illegal immigration. The White House later said it was just one of the methods being considered.Linking the plan to Mexico left corporate groups mostly silent, leery of offending the president by criticizing him but also leery of offending Americans who dislike Mr. Trump\u2019s denunciations of Mexico and Mexican immigrants.Industrial labor unions in the United States have been more open to increased taxes on imports from Mexico. After the November election, Dennis Williams, president of the United Automobile Workers, expressed support generally for the president\u2019s advocacy of tariffs on Mexican imports.\u201cI think his position on trade is right on,\u201d Mr. Williams said.If a tax is imposed, the retailing industry, and particularly apparel retailers, could be among the hardest hit. Much of the clothing sold in the United States is made overseas, and retailers have little wiggle room to raise their prices to compensate for higher costs.And the timing could not be worse: Retailers, particularly apparel companies and department stores, have struggled more than other sectors of the economy to recover from the recession.Tighter budgets, Amazon and many new discount chains have conditioned shoppers never to pay full price. In recent years, that has created a discounting war that has decimated once-mighty retail titans like Macy\u2019s and other department stores.Could those same stores start charging more because of the proposed plan to raise the costs on imports?Unthinkable.But David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, said that retailers would have no choice but to raise prices.\u201cI really hope everybody understands that what they\u2019re really talking about is a 20 percent tax on the U.S. consumer,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s like building the wall and having the U.S. consumer pay for it.\u201dBut even if a 20 percent tax on imports were imposed, its effect on retail prices would be far smaller in percentage terms. That is because the value of imports is essentially calculated based on their wholesale value, which may be a quarter or less of the retail price for items like apparel. So the extra tax would fall on only a small share of the total costs of most companies.Apparel companies could be among the most vulnerable if corporate taxes rise for importers of goods from all over the world, since many of the clothes sold in the United States come from China or Bangladesh. Budget-friendly retailers in particular run the risk of alienating customers by raising costs.But while most of the retail industry is alarmed at the thought of higher import taxes, some retailers could actually win if the Republican plan goes through. Stores that operate primarily in the United States and cater to less price-sensitive shoppers could actually see their profits increase, according to some estimates. That is because the imported goods they sell actually make up a small share of their overall costs, while they spend heavily on attractive stores, American staff wages and marketing promotions.The beauty retailer Ulta is one such company, according to Goldman Sachs, which predicted that net income could actually rise by 21 percent.Ulta sells thousands of cosmetics from brands like Chloe and Clinique, many of which depend on overseas factories, according to the company\u2019s financial filings. But Ulta may benefit more from the part of the House Republican proposal that would reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate.As for the higher import taxes, \u201cthey can actually pass along some of the price,\u201d Simeon Siegel, a retailing analyst with the investment bank Nomura, said.By contrast, a tax on imports from Mexico could wreak havoc on finely balanced supply chains in the auto industry. More than two million Mexican-made vehicles were sold in the United States in 2015, according to the International Trade Administration, representing a little over a tenth of the American market. The products range from full-size pickup trucks made by General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, midsize sedans produced by Ford, and small cars assembled by foreign automakers such as Honda and Nissan.Some automakers are more vulnerable than others. The German automaker Volkswagen, for example, imports more than 30 percent of the vehicles it sells in the United States from Mexico. The figure is closer to 15 percent for the two largest American auto companies, G.M. and Ford.A 20 percent tariff would probably have to be passed on, at least in part, to consumers. That could add thousands of dollars to the sticker price of affected vehicles \u2014 and perhaps cause sharp declines in their sales.Mexico also exports about $50 billion in auto parts annually to the United States for use in American assembly plants. Tariffs on those parts would add significant costs to American-built vehicles that use them.Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated criticisms of Mexican exports to the United States have prompted several automakers, including the big Detroit companies, to announce plans to increase investment and jobs in their American factories.Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Fiat Chrysler, said Thursday that policies that force car companies to curtail or abandon Mexican production would have a major impact on the industry.\u201cThe question about repatriation of all of the manufacturing footprint into the United States has got monumental consequences to the industry over all,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said in a conference call with analysts.An earlier version of a picture caption accompanying this article misidentified a Ford Motor executive. The picture showed Mark Fields, the chief executive of Ford, not Ziad Ojakli, a group vice president.Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

First, a trade deficit is not an indicator of failure. Our trade deficit is larger when our economy is growing and smaller when our economy is faltering.A trade deficit is essentially just the flip side of a capital surplus, which means that foreigners are seeing opportunities to invest in our country and employ Americans. That sounds to me like success.Second, our trade deficit is partly driven by our federal budget deficit. Why does all that foreign capital seek out the United States? Because our pool of savings is being drained by government borrowing into entitlements, federal salaries and military adventures.In fact, the budget deficit is our core problem: Our borrowing of the last decade has dampened our capacity for innovation and reduced our ability to invest in infrastructure, education and training.

{"Headline": "With LeBron 14 Release, Nike Is Bypassing the Shoe Store", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last summer, shortly after claiming his third N.B.A. title, LeBron James said he was still chasing Michael Jordan and his six championship rings. But James is also chasing Jordan in the world of signature shoe sales \u2014 a realm still dominated by the Air Jordan line 13 years after its founder retired.So Nike and James are trying something new with their newest release, the LeBron 14, to build extra buzz. Instead of a standard rollout on Nike\u2019s website or at retailers, a small batch of the shoes is going directly to a secondary marketplace before a wider release \u2014 the sneaker world\u2019s equivalent of an initial public offering of a stock.The limited release of the 46 pairs \u2014 called Cavs Court SPO \u2014 come with special features including a hardwood box made from the Cleveland Cavaliers home court from last year\u2019s championship season and a version of the championship rings that the team gave to its employees (which are different from the players\u2019 rings).The chief executive of StockX, Josh Luber, said there was no way to accurately predict how much the shoes might sell for, but he said estimates among his team ranged from $3,000 to $25,000 per pair.That would be a significant bump from James\u2019s recent releases, which have not been embraced by collectors. The LeBron 13, released in September 2015, has been especially disappointing to hard-core sneaker enthusiasts, with some deadstock models \u2014 unworn shoes in the original box and packaging \u2014 selling for less than the original $200 retail price on secondary markets.When Nike released black and red Air Jordan 1 high-tops in September with the original Nike Air logo on the tongue \u2014 unlike the recent models that carry Jordan\u2019s Jumpman logo \u2014 the sneakers sold out in a matter of minutes and were almost immediately selling for more than double the $160 retail price in the secondary market.James and Nike are hoping to tap into a similar nostalgia with the reintroduction of James\u2019s rookie-year sneaker, the Air Zoom Generation, the first sneakers Nike made for James. James is one of the few players, including Jordan, to get a retro release of his own shoe line while he is still playing.\u201cThere is more inherent demand for LeBron\u2019s retro shoe than any of his shoes in the last three years,\u201d Luber said.Neil Schwartz, vice president at SportsOneSource, a market research firm for athletic footwear and apparel, said LeBron was the most popular basketball shoe frontman among active players, ahead of Kevin Durant (Nike), James Harden (Adidas) and Stephen Curry (Under Armour). But James is nowhere near being the king of basketball shoes.\u201cLeBron is not approaching Jordan in popularity,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cHe\u2019s not even close.\u201dLuber said Nike\u2019s willingness to release a high-profile shoe like the new LeBron sneakers on a secondary marketplace underlined the increasingly important role played by resellers in stoking demand for big-ticket sneakers.\u201cIf you asked someone three years ago, they would have said this would never happen,\u201d said Luber, who founded StockX with the Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. \u201cNike is finally acknowledging the secondary market.\u201dStockX estimates that resellers generate $1.5 billion worth of sales in the United States alone. Much of that underground economy is driven by enthusiasts, known as sneakerheads, who camp out overnight or create fast-bidding software programs to snap up new releases of rare models from big sneaker brands. Because many of those shoes are sold in limited quantities, many sneakerheads quickly resell those sneakers on eBay or reseller sites for a tidy profit.The shoe brands maintain a complicated relationship with resellers, who are often the most enthusiastic and well-informed customers. On one hand, long lines of sneakerheads waiting for new shoes are a marketing boon. But savvy resellers game the system for maximum profit, making it difficult for ordinary consumers to buy the hottest shoes without paying a large premium.But James\u2019s shoes have not reached the status of the Air Jordans. Jason Hart, a part-time actor who calls himself a \u201cdilettante sneaker reseller,\u201d said James\u2019s recent shoes had almost no value in the resale market because collectors do not like the shoes\u2019 appearance. Hart said he had spent about $75,000 in 2016 on 300 pairs of shoes and had not bought a single pair of LeBron sneakers. By comparison, half of his purchases were Jordan sneakers.\u201cLeBron is a little off the map,\u201d he said. \u201cNike is going to have to go back and cultivate that again.\u201dBidding for the sneakers opened Friday night and closes on Thursday. The top 23 bids for each shoe will win, and a portion of the proceeds will go to the Cavaliers Youth Foundation. Nike said the LeBron 14s would become widely available at retail later this month for $175, while Air Zoom Generations go on sale on Jan. 25 for $175.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Efficiency Is Wiping Out the Middle Class", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewI am concerned that my childhood dreams may turn into a nightmare.Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d which I first saw in 1968 at seven years of age, sparked my fascination with computers and artificial intelligence, and I have since focused my academic studies and career pursuits within this area.Fast-forward to today. I still believe that A.I. and automation can keep bringing good to the world. Its effects on middle-skill workers, in America\u2019s industrial Midwest and elsewhere, however, worry me.It has been suggested that the significant job loss and career destruction illuminated by the 2016 presidential election are a result of bad trade deals and corporate greed. I disagree. It\u2019s much more likely a result of computers, including significant advances in A.I., which have allowed us to optimize our economy as never before. Already, they have permitted the global economy to function as if it were in your backyard. In the next decade, they will take over a vast array of routine work, in new industries, affecting even more workers.The economic dislocations that computers and artificial intelligence have unleashed have been vastly underestimated. And we are just in the early days.Think about commercial trucking in America. A.I.-based self-driving truck technology for travel on interstate highways is already technically feasible. Today, about five million drivers are employed in this industry. Even a 20 percent reduction in this work force over the next 15 years equates to a million lost jobs.One of capitalism\u2019s bedrock promises \u2014 one that dates back to Adam Smith \u2014 is that competition in the free market benefits society at large. Somewhere along the line, intoxication with efficiency caused us to lose sight of that principle at the expense of workers. Getting back to that promise will require policy changes and a renewal of forgotten values.The raw, widespread anger we saw during the recent election \u2014 and the unexpected swing of several industrial states from reliably blue to red \u2014 reflects in large part the intense despair that many middle-skill workers feel as they see their families\u2019 economic prospects fade and social conditions deteriorate.Trade and immigration have become boogeymen, while technological advances and the huge efficiency gains they bring truly underpin the \u201chollowing out\u201d of the middle class behind the scenes. Industrial automation has been displacing workers for decades \u2014 particularly those doing repetitive, lower-skill work.With so many at risk of being pushed aside by Smith\u2019s invisible hand, no one should be surprised if people decide to push back.Unless we change course now, we can expect many more Everytowns to become Allentowns.What\u2019s the answer? Most of the commonly proposed fixes are unlikely to resolve the issue. For example, an increasing focus on education, while necessary (the number of American college graduates falls short of labor demand by about 300,000 annually), is not sufficient; what good is a college degree if there are no opportunities to use it? The same could be asked of worker retraining programs.Some promote the promise of the so-called gig or sharing economy \u2014 flexibility! convenience! \u2014 but I don\u2019t buy it. Working as an Uber driver might help make ends meet in the short term, but the experience actually causes skills to atrophy over time. When I speak of jobs being lost or saved, what I really mean is careers: the kind of work that provides skill development, meaningful wage growth prospects and a reasonable likelihood that one\u2019s work won\u2019t be automated away. The types of careers, in other words, that have traditionally formed the foundation of healthy communities.Some argue that history teaches us not to worry: The Industrial Revolution was disruptive, but it created jobs eventually, didn\u2019t it? Sure. Will the Information Revolution do the same? Nobody knows. Creative destruction has become a hallowed concept in the American boardroom, but let\u2019s be honest: Not all destruction is creative in the Schumpeterian sense. As we are seeing, it might just create a wasteland where middle-class communities once thrived.Mr. Christensen and Mr. van Bever suggest rebooting the capitalist system through a series of policy incentives aimed at making investment capital more \u201cpatient,\u201d evolving the curriculums at business schools, realigning corporate strategy and resource allocation and freeing managers to focus on long-term value creation.These ideas are worthy of support. I would go further and recommend aligning corporate tax policy with the goal of creating and fostering careers by skewing tax rates to favor businesses that create opportunities meeting the criteria described above (skill development, wage growth and resistance to automation).Given the nature of the problem we face, companies able to create careers through innovation should reap significantly greater policy rewards than companies focused primarily on driving down costs \u2014 and eliminating careers.And business leaders must wake up to the scope and difficulty of the challenges we face. It\u2019s going to require a shift in values. The hollowing out of the middle-skill work force is a classic tragedy of the commons, and few in leadership positions today feel a personal responsibility to help address it. Unfortunately, the true costs associated with the upheaval have thus far been borne not by those in the C-suite, but predominantly by the hard-pressed American worker.A narrow emphasis on efficiency puts our entire system at risk. Moving forward, creating careers (rather than dead-end jobs) must be an equally valid goal. We cannot and should not try to stop the march of technological progress. But we have to redefine what progress really means.David Siegel is co-founder and co-chairman of Two Sigma Investments. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expedia Supports Lawsuit Against Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byUpdateOn Monday, the company \u2014 which is based in Bellevue, Wash., and is the world\u2019s largest online travel firm, with more than $72 billion a year in annual bookings across its 30 brands \u2014 filed a declaration as part of Washington State\u2019s lawsuit against the president. (Amazon did the same.)Mr. Khosrowshahi said 1,000 Expedia customers were affected by the ban.Expedia\u2019s declaration, filed by the company\u2019s general counsel, Robert Dzielak, outlines the damage the ban could have on the company and on the travel industry as a whole.\u201cExpedia believes that the executive order jeopardizes its corporate mission and could have a detrimental impact on its business and employees, as well as the broader U.S. and global travel and tourism industry,\u201d the company said.In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Mr. Khosrowshahi, who is a member of the board of directors of The New York Times, spoke about the declaration. Edited excerpts are below.Q. How did Expedia get involved with the lawsuit?A. The State of Washington let us know on Sunday that the suit was something they were considering and asked for our support. We are generally not aggressive against issues that do not relate to our company, but this is travel, our soul and spirit, and we felt we had to respond. Honestly, it was not a debate whether we should we be involved.How will a temporary restraining order against the ban, as requested by the State of Washington, help Expedia?The declaration is about helping our employees and the 1,000 or so Expedia travelers who are currently affected by the ban. Internally, the order has raised a fair amount of anxiety among our employees about where they can travel. We are a United States-based company but a global brand, and we have people flying to Asia, Europe and other parts of the world to do their jobs. Also, although we recruit talent from the United States to join Expedia, we also look for talent from around the world, and the ban makes it more difficult to recruit employees from the seven countries that are part of the ban.Can you explain what it entails to help the 1,000 Expedia customers who are affected by the ban and what the financial cost is to do so?We do not have a financial estimate at this point, but we are trying to help them by contacting them and getting clarity on their situation. If they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to complete their travel, we help them make alternate plans and incur the costs of those plans. We have seen the travel industry come together on this ban \u2014 all of our supply partners have been as flexible as they can be to help those impacted.Of the seven countries included in the ban, Iran, where you are from, has become a more popular tourist destination for United States citizens in the last year. Given the ban, do you expect that will change?I think it is bound to have an impact on the Iranian tourism industry. I have not been back to Iran since my family left in 1978, but I have a cousin who recently went with his family, and I can tell you that it is a wonderful place to visit with welcoming people and great food.Expedia aside, how will the ban hurt the travel industry as a whole?I think, in general, uncertain times such as terrorist attacks and wars hurt travel, so travel may become more subdued. But, on the other hand, people want to travel and explore different cultures, so it will ultimately come back.Do you think that the ban will affect international tourism to the United States?That certainly is a danger. As the perception of the United States as a welcoming place for all changes among travelers globally, the country\u2019s tourism market, which is a huge revenue generator for the economy, could get hurt.In your opinion, will United States passport holders be subject to greater scrutiny as they travel globally?I think it is tough to tell. Having a United States passport has been an incredible asset, and I hope that will continue to be the case.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Higher Minimum Wage May Have Losers", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byBut that conclusion may gloss over some significant responses to minimum-wage increases by individual employers, according to two new studies. And those reactions may, in turn, raise questions about the effectiveness of the minimum wage in helping certain workers.Mr. Horton, working with the platform, was able to impose a minimum wage at random on one-quarter of about 160,000 jobs posted over roughly a month and a half in 2013. If a worker proposed an hourly wage that was below the minimum, the platform\u2019s software asked him or her to raise the bid until it cleared the threshold. In some cases the minimum wage was $2 per hour, in some cases $3, and in some cases $4.At first glance, the findings were consistent with the growing body of work on the minimum wage: While the workers saw their wages rise, there was little decline in hiring. But other results suggested that the minimum wage was having large effects. Most important, the hours a given worker spent on a given job fell substantially for jobs that typically pay a low wage \u2014 say, answering customer emails.Mr. Horton concluded that when forced to pay more in wages, many employers were hiring more productive workers, so that the overall amount they spent on each job changed far less than the minimum-wage increase would have suggested. The more productive workers appeared to finish similar work more quickly.The traditional way most studies determine if employees are hiring a different kind of worker after the minimum wage rises is to consider certain characteristics, like race, age and education level.The problem is that one worker can be much more productive than another with the same demographic profile, potentially masking the productivity upgrade that Mr. Horton documents. He was able to overcome this problem because the platform gave him access to precise data reflecting productivity, like past wages.When the minimum wage increased, employers tended to hire workers who had earned higher wages in the past, suggesting that they were looking for a more productive work force.If the pattern Mr. Horton identified were to apply across the economy, it would raise questions about whether increasing the minimum wage is as helpful to those near the bottom of the income spectrum as some proponents assume. The higher minimum wage could cost low-skilled workers their jobs, as employers rush to replace them with somewhat more skilled workers.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about my paper that says raising the minimum wage is a bad idea \u2014 it may be that the trade-off is worth making,\u201d Mr. Horton said. But there is \u201cthis consideration we probably haven\u2019t considered.\u201dSome economists are skeptical that employers would respond the way Mr. Horton describes if an entire city or state increased its minimum wage, as opposed to just a single employer or subset of employers.This year, 19 states took matters into their own hands and raised the minimum wage.\u201cI think the way to relate this result to the real world labor market is to consider what would happen if Walmart had to raise wages,\u201d said Arindrajit Dube, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who has studied minimum wage laws.\u201cThis experiment is probably telling us much the same thing,\u201d Mr. Dube added in an email. \u201cBut if we want to know what would happen if N.Y. or C.A. raised its minimum wage to 15/hr, I doubt that this online experiment \u2014 neat as it is \u2014 will shed much light.\u201dWhen the minimum wage goes up for everyone, it is not so easy for employers to substitute better-skilled workers because the new minimum would not offer a more attractive wage. In many cases, more highly skilled workers see their wages rise after minimum-wage increases to keep them above the new minimum, making it all the more difficult to lure them away.Mr. Tankel argued that differences in the productivity of low-level workers in his industry are not very big. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot more money for the exact same job description,\u201d he said. He is accelerating automation in his restaurants, including tablet devices for ordering certain items and payment, to offset the costs of the higher minimum.Mr. Horton is quick to acknowledge that there are many reasons his experiment might not capture employer behavior in the wider economy. But he says a higher minimum wage could attract more highly skilled workers who were not previously in the labor market \u2014 say, college students. At the same time, less-skilled workers might lose their jobs and drop out of the labor force.More broadly, he said, the contribution of his paper is to show that one impulse of many employers in the face of a minimum-wage increase will be to find more productive workers, even if there are limits on how much they can follow through on this desire.\u201cThere are lots of reasons to think this is probably happening and we haven\u2019t detected it because we don\u2019t have the data,\u201d he said. \u201cI know in my career, people have fine-grained opinions about who\u2019s better than who, and we talk about them endlessly. We\u2019re constantly ranking. But when we talk about other labor markets, we pretend the same distinctions don\u2019t exist.\u201dA second study presented at the conference suggests another way that employers may respond to a rising minimum wage: simply going out of business.The husband-and-wife research team of Michael Luca of Harvard Business School and Dara Lee Luca of Mathematica Policy Research identified the ratings of tens of thousands of restaurants in the San Francisco area on the website Yelp and found that many poorly rated restaurants tend to go out of business after a minimum-wage increase takes effect.By contrast, highly rated restaurants appear to be largely unaffected by minimum-wage increases, and over all, there is no substantial rise in restaurant closings after a minimum-wage increase.Though the couple\u2019s study is still being refined and they have yet to explore the reason, one possibility is that workers at poorly rated restaurants tend to be less productive than workers at highly rated restaurants, making it difficult for those restaurants to survive when paying workers more. (It\u2019s also possible that highly rated restaurants are better able to pass rising costs on to their customers.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Takes a Right Turn", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byMost tech executives and employees remain supportive of Democrats, especially on social and cultural issues. The Republican tilt of the PACs at Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook suggests, however, that as these companies\u2019 domains grow larger, their bottom-line interests are becoming increasingly aligned with the policies of the Republican Party.In 2016, the Microsoft PAC gave $478,818 to Republican House candidates and $272,000 to Democratic House candidates. It gave $164,000 to Republican Senate candidates, and $75,000 to Democratic Senate candidates.This was not small change. In 2016 Microsoft employees gave a total of $6.47 million.The firm first became a noticeable player in the world of campaign finance in 2012 when employees and the company PAC together made contributions of $910,000. That year, Facebook employees backed Democrats over Republicans 64-35, while the company\u2019s PAC tilted Republican, 53-46.By 2016, when total Facebook contributions reached $3.8 million, the Democratic advantage in employee donations shrank to 51-47, while the PAC continued to favor Republicans, 56-44.While the employees of the three other most valuable tech companies, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and Apple, remained Democratic in their giving in 2016, at the corporate level of Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 that is, at the level of their PACs \u2014 they have not.Tech giants can no longer be described as insurgents challenging corporate America.American consumer technology companies are getting larger, more entrenched in their own sectors, more powerful in new sectors and better insulated against surprising competition from upstarts.Among Ferenstein\u2019s findings: a minority, 29 percent, of tech company founders described labor unions as \u201cgood,\u201d compared to 73 percent of Democrats. Asked \u201cis meritocracy naturally unequal?\u201d tech founders overwhelmingly agreed.Ferenstein went on:One hundred percent of the smaller sample of founders to whom I presented this question said they believe that a truly meritocratic economy would be \u201cmostly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unequal. This is a key distinction: Opportunity is about maximizing people\u2019s potential, which founders tend to believe is highly unequal. Founders may value citizen contributions to society, but they don\u2019t think all citizens have the potential to contribute equally. When asked what percent of national income the top 10% would hold in such a scenario, a majority (67%) of founders believed that the richest individuals would control 50% or more of total income, while only 31% of the public believes such an outcome would occur in a meritocratic society.One of the most interesting questions posed by Ferenstein speaks to middle and working class anxieties over global competition:In international trade policy, some people believe the U.S. government should create laws that favor American business with policies that protect it from global competition, such as fees on imported goods or making it costly to hire cheaper labor in other countries (\u201coutsourcing\u201d). Others believe it would be better if there were less regulations and businesses were free to trade and compete without each country favoring their own industries. Which of these statements come closest to your belief?There was a large difference between tech company officials, 73 percent of whom chose free trade and less regulation, while only 20 percent of Democrats supported those choices.Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University who writes about demographic, social and economic trends, sees these differences as the source of deep conflict within the Democratic Party.The disruptive force is largely Silicon Valley, a natural oligarchy that now funds a party teetering toward populism and even socialism. The fundamental contradictions, as Karl Marx would have noted, lie in the collision of interests between a group that has come to epitomize self-consciously progressive mega-wealth and a mass base which is increasingly concerned about downward mobility.The tech elite, Kotkin writes, \u201cfar from deserting the Democratic Party, more likely will aim take to take it over.\u201d Until very recently, theconflict between populists and tech oligarchs has been muted, in large part due to common views on social issues like gay marriage and, to some extent, environmental protection. But as the social issues fade, having been \u201cwon\u201d by progressives, the focus necessarily moves to economics, where the gap between these two factions is greatest.Kotkin sees future partisan machination in cynical terms:One can expect the oligarchs to seek out a modus vivendi with the populists. They could exchange a regime of higher taxes and regulation for ever-expanding crony capitalist opportunities and political protection. As the hegemons of today, Facebook and Google, not to mention Apple and Amazon, have an intense interest in protecting themselves, for example, from antitrust legislation. History is pretty clear: Heroic entrepreneurs of one decade often turn into the insider capitalists of the next.In 2016, Donald Trump has produced an upheaval within the Republican Party that shifted attention away from the less explosive turmoil in Democratic ranks.Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed bid to finesse the inherent conflict between her dependence on corporate contributions and her need for a strong turnout by union workers, minorities and idealistic millennials embodies the Democratic Party\u2019s long term struggle.The public, at least for the moment, is not willing to support the continued compromise of principle that has been a hallmark of both parties. Trump has provided a temporary solution for the Republican Party; the Democrats need to find a legitimate and more lasting one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Cities are resurgent. Increasingly they\u2019re where new jobs, economic growth and people are all thriving. From Miami to Munich and S\u00e3o Paulo to Shanghai, the world\u2019s cities are multiplying in number and growing in size.Already, more than half of the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas. By mid century, that share will grow to two-thirds, the U.N. predicts. This urbanization comes at a cost, though. Infrastructure is strained. Cars are multiplying but roads are not, so congestion is worsening. And the supply of vital resources \u2014 energy, clean air and fresh water \u2014 is imperiled.A new generation of technology can help. Self-driving and electric-powered vehicles are here now, pointing toward a safer, cleaner future. As car sharing has boomed, our relationship with autos is evolving: from things we own for years, to services we use, and pay for mile by mile. At the same time smart sensors, big data, artificial intelligence and advanced analytics are evolving in a way that will help improve how cities operate.We\u2019re not there yet. But these dynamics are encouraging public officials, private leaders and everyday residents to hunt for smart ideas, pioneering innovators and revelatory discussions. Ford Motor Company asked many of them to share their dreams for the City of Tomorrow. We invite you to share yours, too.The seeds of the City of Tomorrow \u2014 from technologies like autonomous vehicles to innovations like the sharing economy \u2014 are all around us. But what is it about city life we seek to preserve and accelerate?James Altucher, an entrepreneur and self-help expert who has lived in New York since 1994, sees cities as centers of opportunity. Future cities, he says, will magnify those opportunities for citizens: \u201cCities are remarkable for the amazing number of opportunities. That\u2019s why people have historically moved from rural areas to cities. So the way to reinvent the city is to use technology, innovation and networking to multiply access to opportunity. That turns a city into a megacity. \u201cOne way to multiply opportunity is to provide easier access to everything that\u2019s empty. For empty rooms and offices, you can now provide access through Airbnb or WeWork. This idea didn\u2019t even exist 10 years ago and now it\u2019s everywhere.\u201cIn any situation where there\u2019s excess capacity and people who want to buy that excess capacity, a platform in the middle can multiply exponentially the number of opportunities by matching supply with demand.\"Opportunity is always in the cities, that\u2019s never going away. But the cities that will win will be those that facilitate easy access to those opportunities. Mobility actually increases the value of cities because it allows many more people to take advantage of the opportunities there.\u201dBrigham Yen, chronicler of the downtown Los Angeles renaissance in the DTLA Rising news blog, sees the robust futures of cities inspired by their history: \u201cDowntown L.A., Manhattan and Chicago were built as cities meant for people. You had a grid and a transportation network and people walked. The suburban paradigm that is viewed today as mainstream is really the new way that baby boomers pushed forward after World War II. The idea took off, but there were obviously unforeseen aspects to the suburban model. If everybody gets around by a car, you are going to get traffic. You are going to be isolated. Everything was homogenized. My generation, the millennials, just kind of thought, \u2018It\u2019s boring.\u2019\u201cThe urban paradigm is so much more stimulating. It rests on the idea of a mix of uses and close proximity. You have a concentration of business, residences, culture, entertainment and education. Everything is mixed together dynamically. Especially when they\u2019re younger, people have ambitions, entrepreneurial drive and that spirit to execute their ideas.\u201dIn the past, cities built roads, subways and railroads to support the movement of goods and people. The City of Tomorrow will be built on a digital foundation that\u2019s flexible, intelligent and more affordable.In 2009, New York City closed a stretch of Broadway to vehicles. The move was hotly debated but proved a big success. Tomorrow\u2019s smart cars might make similar decisions independently \u2014 and less contentiously. Former Lord Mayor Stephen Yarwood of Adelaide, Australia, explains: \u201cArtificial intelligence in a vehicle will consciously avoid high pedestrian environments knowing that it will slow its trip and reduce the productivity of the city. Just as at the moment we\u2019re battling to reclaim public space for pedestrians, in the future that will be an organic process where vehicles will choose not to drive through environments where they know that people are.\u201cYou\u2019ll find that people will be able to reclaim public spaces in ways that we don\u2019t understand today. People think that autonomous vehicles, if they look like a duck, quack like a duck, and smell like a duck, they must be a duck. But these vehicles will start to move through cities in different ways, and enable people to reclaim public space.\u201dThe advent of autonomous vehicles and other smart-city technologies will not just reshape how people and goods are moved around. They will also reshape how much is spent on transportation projects, says former U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk: \u201cTransportation is expensive. One of the topics of discussion around the implementation of autonomous vehicles is the impact that they will have on the necessity of building roads, particularly in places like the United States.\u201cI think as we begin to understand the deployment and uses of this technology more it will impact financing decisions because you may not need the same infrastructure that we presumed you would need 30 years ago.\u201cThe smart deployment of this technology can go hand-in-hand with reducing the need for building traditional transit infrastructure. It will allow you to maybe use those dollars elsewhere.\u201dThere is no shortage of data about transportation. The challenge is figuring out how to make it accessible and useable, says Ford Smart Mobility Chairman Jim Hackett: \u201cWe have to imagine that the data has always been there. For example, data exists about where we\u2019re going, the route we will take and what we will face along that journey. Now, as the data becomes transparent \u2014 if people want to opt in \u2014 then we have a chance for the system to be better orchestrated.\u201cWhat we need to realize the full potential of this future is an open operating system. This will help allow all the various actors in the system to engage. Unfortunately, there is no central source for this today. This is where we need to rely on our mayors and other government leaders.\u201cOur role in this system is to deeply understand what people care about in the transportation system as well as be responsible for certain transportation modes in that system. In addition, we want to be a catalyst for the discussion with mayors and city leaders to envision this future.\u201dOpportunities and other benefits of urban living are available only to those who can access them. Will the City of Tomorrow be accessible to everyone?As the CEO of Travel Noire, Zim Ugochukwu has visited many cities around the world. But her vision for a City of Tomorrow is grounded in her experience on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, when she was living on $3 a day: \u201cI used to live on Treasure Island, which is right under the Bay Bridge to San Francisco, and the only way to get to San Francisco was to take a bus. That one bus ran 24 hours but relatively infrequently, so unless you had a car \u2014 you can\u2019t walk across the Bay Bridge \u2014 you were stuck.\u201cWhen you got into the city you had all of these different modes of transportation to get you to different parts of San Francisco. I found that really intriguing: A diversity of transportation options is key.\u201dCar- and bike-sharing services provide access to jobs and fun. But they usually require a bank account. Columbus, Ohio, is working with local banks to find affordable solutions for the 33,000 people who live in the city\u2019s Linden neighborhood. Mayor Andrew Ginther explains the public-private partnership: \u201cAll the mobility options that you and I take for granted, whether it\u2019s Uber or Car2Go or bike-sharing, require a credit card. And research shows it\u2019s the first mile and the last mile that are the biggest challenges around mobility, particularly for folks living in neighborhoods that are more isolated.\u201cIn a pilot, financial institutions are helping us work on a card that you can load cash onto and use to access all different modes of transportation. Some of the neighborhoods that we\u2019re focused on are food deserts, they\u2019re health care deserts, they\u2019re job deserts, and so having access to smart, consistent, safe, reliable transportation is critical to helping those families access what you and I take for granted.\u201cIf you live in Linden, you need to get to a rapid transit stop and then to the front door of your job, your school, your child care, your health care, your job training, or fresh fruits and vegetables. So this transit card is going to help Linden residents navigate that first mile and last mile. That transit card allows them to make that connection. Our hope is to use that strategy in other neighborhoods too.\u201dThe City of Tomorrow will support a diversity of ideas through education and recognize our planet does not have an infinite supply of energy, water or other natural resources.Though the diversity of cities is frequently praised, it\u2019s often not respected. Education will be critical to preserving diversity in the City of Tomorrow, says Blake Mycoskie, an author and the founder of Toms Shoes: \u201cWe have to find a way in the City of Tomorrow to be more supportive of diverse ways of thinking. It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019re even still having this conversation in 2017, but even in the United States we still have work to do on our tolerance for true diversity and different ways of thinking, different religions, different philosophies. We need to find a way in our cities to create educational experiences so that people can see that even though we have differences, we all still have the same basic needs.\u201cThat is going to do the most for our future. We have to find a way to live together in support of one another better than we\u2019re doing today. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a technological solve for that, but there might be a design solve in terms of the ways that we create educational experiences so that our children are experiencing a more radical diversity from the very beginning. That would make the world a better place.\u201dSustainability has been a part of Ford Motor Company since Henry Ford introduced the assembly line. His great-grandson, Executive Chairman Bill Ford, says protection of the planet remains a driving force at the company: \u201cSustainability is about using the resources we have in a way that benefits us today but also preserves them for future generations. Smart mobility is the logical next step in sustainability, because it provides the most efficient and effective way to move people and things. I hope that historians look back on Ford as a company that continually helps make people\u2019s lives better \u2014 by providing mobility for all.\u201cOn sustainability, our vision is underpinned by a \u201czero mentality,\u201d including using zero minerals in our vehicles that contribute to conflict. In our manufacturing plants, our goals include reducing drinkable water use to zero, and helping deliver clean water to communities that need it. And sending zero waste to landfills from our facilities around the world. These are the goals which are driving us into the future.\u201dYounger people are flocking to cities and the opportunities they offer. Their voices are critical in the conversation about the City of Tomorrow.Former Adelaide Lord Mayor Stephen Yarwood \u2014 who, at 39, was then the youngest mayor of an Australian capital city when he took office in 2004 \u2014 says it\u2019s imperative for older generations to keep an open mind: \u201cI would encourage city leaders to listen to the next generation more effectively. They need to create entrepreneurial ecosystems that support contributions by a generation that thinks completely differently than us. Engaging younger people who are digitally literate, who actually think in a nonlinear way \u2014 who understand, have and share and live those values \u2014 is incredibly important as well.\u201cI encourage city leaders to actually give it a go. Install a few apps. Try a few things. Talk to a few people. Maybe become a little bit more reliant on doing some things yourself and having some of those personal human experiences in their own city. What mayors have actually stayed in an Airbnb in their own city and talked to those hosts and had the experience? You can live in a bubble as a leader, and it\u2019s really good to be able to immerse yourself in the community and connect and actually understand how people live and use cities.\u201dTo Ryan Seacrest, television personality, producer and entrepreneur, the City of Tomorrow and work spaces are already being shaped by new generations: \u201cThe younger consumers today are pushing us all to look and see things differently. Some people grumble about their pursuit of instant gratification that technology has enabled, and obviously there\u2019s major disruption happening in many different businesses as a result, but I think it\u2019s actually an exciting time.\u201cToday, people are just as ambitious as they always were. However, they like to have the option to work from home rather than at a traditional work space, and flex hours are what they believe to be normal \u2014 not necessarily nine-to-five.\u201cHere in Los Angeles many of the young members of our team are designing their lives so they can share the commuting experience. They carpool or use Uber or other ride-sharing services or maybe they rent an apartment close by, so they can ride their bike to the office.\u201dHuman ingenuity, partnerships and robust debate were critical in the creation of today\u2019s urban landscape and will be as the City of Tomorrow takes hold.Cities alone can\u2019t create a revolution in mobility, and the job is too much for a single company or even an industry. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford explains the need for partnerships around the globe: \u201cCore to our mobility work are the cities around the world facing congestion and pollution. We know these cities need a partner to deliver mobility solutions that work for their communities to help people live, work or play where they choose. And we are deeply committed to being a thoughtful partner.\u201cThe Ford City Solutions team is the first from any automaker, working with cities around the world, to conceptualize and implement new ways of getting locals and visitors where they want to go. We also recently began to collaborate with Mike Bloomberg in his philanthropic work with a coalition of mayors worldwide to accelerate solutions in cities. In doing so, we will collect the best ideas from around the world and put them into action.\u201cWe know we can\u2019t do it alone, which is why we\u2019re so focused on finding partners to help us bring these solutions to life.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "United States to Lift Sudan Sanctions", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 After nearly 20 years of hostile relations, the American government plans to reverse its position on Sudan and lift trade sanctions, Obama administration officials said late Thursday.Sudan is one of the poorest, most isolated and most violent countries in Africa, and for years the United States has imposed punitive measures against it in a largely unsuccessful attempt to get the Sudanese government to stop killing its own people.On Friday, the Obama administration will announce a new Sudan strategy. For the first time since the 1990s, the nation will be able to trade extensively with the United States, allowing it to buy goods like tractors and spare parts and attract much-needed investment in its collapsing economy.In return, Sudan will improve access for aid groups, stop supporting rebels in neighboring South Sudan, cease the bombing of insurgent territory and cooperate with American intelligence agents.American officials said Sudan had already shown important progress on a number of these fronts. But to make sure the progress continues, the executive order that President Obama plans to sign on Friday, days before leaving office, will have a six-month review period. If Sudan fails to live up to its commitments, the embargo can be reinstated.Analysts said good relations with Sudan could strengthen moderate voices within the country and give the Sudanese government incentives to refrain from the brutal tactics that have defined it for decades.In 1998, Bin Laden\u2019s agents blew up the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than 200 people. In retaliation, Mr. Clinton ordered a cruise missile strike against a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum.Since then, American-Sudanese relations have steadily soured. The conflict in Darfur, a vast desert region of western Sudan, was a low point. After rebels in Darfur staged an uprising in 2003, Sudanese security services and their militia allies slaughtered tens of thousands of civilians, leading to condemnation around the world, genocide charges at the International Criminal Court against Sudan\u2019s president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, and a new round of American sanctions.Sales of military equipment will still be prohibited, and some Sudanese militia and rebel leaders will still face sanctions.But the Obama administration is clearly trying to open a door to Sudan. There is intense discontent across the country, and its economy is imploding. American officials have argued for years that it was time to help Sudan dig itself out of the hole it had created.Officials divulged Thursday that the Sudanese government had allowed two visits by American operatives to a restricted border area near Libya, which they cited as evidence of a new spirit of cooperation on counterterrorism efforts.In addition to continuing violence in Darfur, several other serious conflicts are raging in southern and central Sudan, along with a civil war in newly independent South Sudan, which Sudan has been suspected of inflaming with covert arms shipments.\u201cThere is no reason to believe the guys in charge have changed their stripes,\u201d said Mr. Reeves, a senior fellow at the Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University. \u201cThese guys are the worst of the worst.\u201dObama administration officials said that they had briefed President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s transition team, but that they did not know if Mr. Trump would stick with a policy of warmer relations with Sudan.They said that Sudan had a long way to go in terms of respecting human rights, but that better relations could help increase American leverage.Mr. Reeves said he thought that the American government was being manipulated and that the Obama administration had made a \u201cdeal with the devil.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Donald Trump and Ra\u00fal Castro Make a Good Deal?", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Cuba operates as if it had two parties, President Ra\u00fal Castro joked in his main report to the Seventh Congress of the Cuban Communist Party last April: \u201cFidel leads one and I, the other.\u201dThis was more than just a joke: Fidel Castro, Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s brother and the former president, had criticized President Obama\u2019s visit to Havana a month earlier in official publications. It was the first public split between the brothers on an issue of such importance. President Obama\u2019s Cuba policy change, announced in December 2014, drove a wedge through the Cuban leadership, making manifest the differences between government hard-liners and soft-liners. For the balance of 2016, the hard-liners dominated official communications, republishing tales of American perfidy over the previous two centuries. During the same period, however, Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s senior team negotiated and signed many practical agreements to alter American-Cuban relations.Last year, more than half a million visitors from the United States had set foot in Cuba and American commercial airlines now fly regularly between the United States and Cuban cities. Earlier in the Obama presidency, the United States government liberalized rules on sending money transfers to Cuba, and much of it informally financed the re-emergence of a Cuban private business sector. The number of small- business licenses now exceeds a half-million in a country of 11.2 million people. Money transfers from the United States fund a Cuban civil society independent of the state for the first time in a half-century.Recent agreements between the two countries make it easier for them to cooperate on hurricane tracking and biodiversity protection, share information on pollution and undertake joint maritime geological exploration. Other agreements protect migratory birds and fish. Cuba and the United States now also work together on cancer research, in which Cuban scientists have registered significant advances, and on the prevention and cure of infectious diseases, including combating the Zika epidemic, in which Cuba is a worldwide example of effectiveness.Cuba and the United States have long cooperated on security matters, coordinating on security around the United States Navy base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Since the mid-1990s, the two countries have worked together to prevent undocumented migration. Cuba patrols its ports to prevent anyone from stealing boats and rafts; at its airports, it checks for valid visas among those about to board. United States Coast Guard cutters intercept undocumented migrants in the Straits of Florida and return them to Cuba.The two countries have informally combined efforts on drug traffic interdiction since the 1990s, and this was formalized last July; Cuba provides an effective barrier against drug traffic into the United States.And Cuba long ago adopted the Trump-preferred migration policy: seek to stop the departure and accept the return of undocumented migrants.Suppose you are the United States president-elect. What is not to like?Still, while economic agreements emphasize the two countries\u2019 equality, some of the deals couldn\u2019t be more lopsided. Only American airlines fly between the two countries; Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n does not. And since late 2002, Cuba has purchased about $5.3 billion worth of United States agricultural products, paying cash, while exporting almost no goods to the United States.What\u2019s wrong with agreements already in place that benefit both countries? The United States wants to warn Florida and the Carolinas about hurricane trajectories, its fowl and fish to winter in Cuba\u2019s Caribbean waters and come back, and to benefit from Cuba\u2019s scientific expertise. Cuba and the United States are interested in exploring for oil in the Gulf of Mexico and have agreed to track seismic threats beneath the gulf\u2019s waters to prevent oil spills.On delicate issues, President George W. Bush and Fidel Castro, and later President Obama and Ra\u00fal Castro, developed ways of agreeing substantively while publicly denying any negotiation had taken place. That diplomatic ruse worked. In 2002, the Cubans induced the Bush administration to begin exporting American agricultural products; each side made it known that these were unilateral, independent and sovereign decisions. In December 2012, the United States and Cuba did not trade spies; rather, each made unilateral, independent and sovereign decisions to release some of the other\u2019s prisoners.Slowly, United States-Cuba relations got better. That serves Cubans who may travel more easily, receive friends, rent space through Airbnb, and get working capital through money transfers to establish private businesses and fund an independent civil society. That serves Americans who benefit from freer travel and cooperation on issues such as migration, crime and drug trafficking. What next? Rely on unilateral, independent and sovereign Cuban decisions to foster change.Here\u2019s how Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s joke ended at the April party congress: \u201cFidel will certainly say, \u2018I want to lead the Communist Party,\u2019 and I will say, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ll lead the other one, the name does not matter.\u2019 \u201d If you are a Cuban hard-liner, that joke is terrifying. President Ra\u00fal Castro is prepared to open the gateway to something different, less dogmatic, whose name neither he nor we know. But we know what it is not. It is not called \u201cCommunist.\u201dJorge I. Dom\u00ednguez is a professor of government at Harvard.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Has Trump\u2019s Ear, and Wall Street Takes Note", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseThe election of Donald Trump and the accompanying rehabilitation of fossil fuels should have been, by all rights, devastating for Tesla Motors.Tesla is the top maker of all-electric autos, and it completed its merger with SolarCity, a leading manufacturer of solar energy panels, days after the presidential election.So why have Tesla shares surged since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, closing this week within striking distance of a record high?Adam Jonas, a prominent automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, upgraded Tesla stock to overweight last week, with a target price of $305 a share. (It was trading this week at about $255.)\u201cWhen you look at the businesses Tesla is in, you see many areas of overlapping interest\u201d with the Trump administration, Mr. Jonas told me. \u201cTo the extent the new administration prioritizes the creation of valuable, innovative high tech and manufacturing jobs, Tesla stands at the epicenter of that.\u201dShares in pure solar energy companies haven\u2019t fared as well, but even they have now regained nearly all the ground they lost immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.Solar investors \u201caren\u2019t nearly as negative as they were the day after the election,\u201d said Andrew Hughes, an alternative energy analyst for Credit Suisse.And Mr. Musk was with a group of manufacturing executives at a White House meeting this week at which, according to a participant, he broached the subject of a carbon tax. Surprisingly, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t reject it out of hand.Mr. Jonas said that the \u201cstrategic relationship between Tesla leadership and the new administration is an important development\u201d in his decision to upgrade Tesla stock.\u201cThat Trump would be relying on Musk as an adviser has come as quite a surprise to many people,\u201d Mr. Jonas said.A major fear of investors in solar power was that a Trump administration would end the federal subsidies so reviled by fossil fuel proponents. While that remains a concern, the most recent jobs data suggests that the subsidies have led to a surge in new well-paid jobs, exactly what the president has advocated.\u201cThe jobs data is a compelling argument in favor of the tax credits,\u201d Mr. Hughes said.He noted that federal solar subsidies were set to expire anyway in a few years, a result of rare bipartisan cooperation in Congress. Mr. Musk has stressed that solar energy is close to reaching a scale where federal subsidies will no longer be needed.And Tesla is also expanding rapidly. Tesla employs 25,000 workers in the United States and could easily double that as it ramps up production for its new Model 3 and expands its Gigafactory, a lithium ion battery manufacturing operation in Nevada. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of multiplier you put on that, but it\u2019s a significant boost to the economy,\u201d Mr. Jonas said.Federal subsidies for electric vehicles will also end once a manufacturer hits 200,000 vehicles, a level Tesla may soon reach.Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk appear to have other areas of overlapping interest as well. Mr. Musk has broached the subject of the nation\u2019s aging electricity transmission grid in conversations with Mr. Trump, according to an insider with knowledge of the discussions.Mr. Musk has advocated a so-called smart grid and has said that eventually Tesla will offer grid services, such as batteries that can be added to the grid and paired with solar and wind farms. This is the kind of high-impact infrastructure project that Mr. Trump has supported.And Tesla\u2019s success could help fend off Chinese efforts to compete or even dominate in what could be an important piece of the car industry\u2019s future.But the ultimate bond between the two may simply be that they both like to think big.It\u2019s still early in the Trump administration, and some (or all) of this may turn out to be wishful thinking by fans of Mr. Musk, Tesla investors, environmentalists and hopeful space colonists.\u201cI want to believe that Trump won\u2019t kill solar,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty. The big question: Will he take away the tax credits?\u201dStill, there\u2019s a growing sense that Mr. Trump and Tesla can not only coexist, but even thrive together. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be anti-electric to be pro-fossil fuel,\u201d Mr. Jonas said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Major Potential Impact of a Corporate Tax Overhaul", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewThe United States system for taxing businesses is a mess. If there\u2019s one thing nearly everyone can agree upon, it is that.Now, the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived. With the House, Senate and presidency all soon to be in Republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority, some kind of change appears likely to happen. And it may turn out to be a very big deal, particularly if a tax plan that House Republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation.Among Washington\u2019s lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd, it\u2019s known as a \u201cdestination-based cash flow tax with border adjustment.\u201d It\u2019s easier to think of it as the most substantial reworking of how businesses are taxed since the corporate income tax was introduced a century ago. And it could, if enacted, have big effects not just in the tax departments of major corporations but in global financial markets and the aisles of your local Walmart.This possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care, or even over individual income taxes. But the consequences for business \u2014 and for the long-term trajectory of the economy \u2014 are huge.The basic idea behind a D.B.C.F.T. (to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of Twitter) is this: Right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the United States. But there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden, and those tricks distort the economy.Two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a company\u2019s legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes. Moreover, because interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible, even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along.The House Republicans\u2019 approach, instead of taxing the easy-to-manipulate corporate income, goes after a firm\u2019s domestic cash flow: money that comes in from sales within the United States borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth. There\u2019s no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because you\u2019ll be taxed on things you sell in the United States, regardless.\u201cWith an income tax, one of the key issues is \u2018how do you measure income,\u2019 \u201d said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is a leading advocate of the idea. \u201cBut with cash flow you just follow the money.\u201dAnd the tax, Mr. Auerbach argues, could spur business investment while not encouraging companies to rely on debt. It allows companies to enjoy the tax savings of capital investments immediately rather than depreciating them over time. And it doesn\u2019t give favorable treatment to debt, as opposed to equity.That alone would amount to a major shift in the tax system. Congressional staff members, the incoming administration and armies of lobbyists will spend countless hours hammering out the details of any such proposal: how it might be phased in, and how to treat financial services, and much more.Some of the most complex, and politically problematic, elements of the plan revolve around its treatment of international trade, which creates winners and losers. And some of those potential losers are powerful.Consider what border adjustment means: When an American company exports goods under this new tax system, it would not pay any taxes on its international sales, while its imports would be taxed. So a company that spent $80 making something that it sold overseas for $100 would pay no tax on its earnings. A company that imported goods worth $80 from abroad and them sold them domestically for $100 would pay tax on the full $100.At first glance this looks as if it would boost exports and reduce the trade deficit. Indeed, it might prove politically promising for advocates of the strategy to pitch the plan as one that would do this.Many economists think it won\u2019t work that way, however. That\u2019s because as soon as a cash-flow-based tax with border adjustment looks likely to become law, the value of the dollar should rise in currency markets. And that stronger dollar could eliminate the apparent pro-export, anti-import effects of the tax. The dollar could rise by, say, 20 to 25 percent, and the trade balance could remain about where it started.Essentially, moving to this system means betting on a \u201ctextbook economic theory,\u201d as analysts at Evercore ISI put it, becoming a reality even though the effect hasn\u2019t been tested in practice.If the models turn out to be right, there is a different set of risks. The United States dollar is the linchpin of the global financial system, and a large move in its value triggered by changes in domestic tax policy could have unforeseen effects.Many companies worldwide, especially banks and especially in emerging markets, have debt denominated in dollars, which would become more of a burden after a new dollar appreciation. A big dollar rise would also effectively shift trillions in wealth from American investments overseas toward global investors with assets in the United States.There\u2019s still a lot of work to be done to understand the far-reaching consequences of the D.B.C.F.T. (also, work to be done to find a catchier name). But there\u2019s a broader point about the nature of any major policy reform. The benefits of a reworked corporate tax code would emerge slowly; these disruptions and costs could arrive almost instantly.No matter the outcome, 2017 will be a fascinating year in which core components of the tax system \u2014 with long-lasting economic consequences \u2014 will be up for grabs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Learning Curve\u2019 as Rick Perry Pursues a Job He Initially Misunderstood", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byIn the days after, Mr. Perry, the former Texas governor, discovered that he would be no such thing \u2014 that in fact, if confirmed by the Senate, he would become the steward of a vast national security complex he knew almost nothing about, caring for the most fearsome weapons on the planet, the United States\u2019 nuclear arsenal.Two-thirds of the agency\u2019s annual $30 billion budget is devoted to maintaining, refurbishing and keeping safe the nation\u2019s nuclear stockpile; thwarting nuclear proliferation; cleaning up and rebuilding an aging constellation of nuclear production facilities; and overseeing national laboratories that are considered the crown jewels of government science.\u201cIf you asked him on that first day he said yes, he would have said, \u2018I want to be an advocate for energy,\u2019\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who advised Mr. Perry\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and worked on the Trump transition\u2019s Energy Department team in its early days. \u201cIf you asked him now, he\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m serious about the challenges facing the nuclear complex.\u2019 It\u2019s been a learning curve.\u201dMr. Perry, who once called for the elimination of the Energy Department, will begin the confirmation process Thursday with a hearing before the Senate Energy Committee. If approved by the Senate, he will take over from a secretary, Ernest J. Moniz, who was chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology physics department and directed the linear accelerator at M.I.T.\u2019s Laboratory for Nuclear Science. Before Mr. Moniz, the job belonged to Steven Chu, a physicist who won a Nobel Prize.For Mr. Moniz, the future of nuclear science has been a lifelong obsession; he spent his early years working at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Mr. Perry studied animal husbandry and led cheers at Texas A&M University.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Mr. Perry would sit atop the men and women making the judgments about whether Iran is complying with that accord. In the basement of the Energy Department\u2019s headquarters, the agency\u2019s intelligence unit monitors compliance, working closely with the C.I.A., the National Security Agency and other intelligence bodies.While even Mr. Perry\u2019s supporters concede that he has no experience making high-level decisions on nuclear weapons policy, he has had some dealings with the problem of nuclear waste, which also falls under the purview of the Energy Department.As governor, Mr. Perry pushed a plan to create a low-level nuclear waste repository in Texas, to be privately run by a Dallas-based company, Waste Control Specialists, which was also a contributor to Mr. Perry\u2019s re-election campaigns. The question of what to do with nuclear waste has long been a central problem for the Energy Department. By law, it is supposed to be buried at a federally run repository to be built at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.\u201cNo other state has licensed a nuclear waste facility like this, and it was all done on Governor Perry\u2019s watch,\u201d said Charles McDonald, a spokesman for Waste Control Specialists. \u201cHe really understands this stuff.\u201dMr. Perry\u2019s backers also note that Texas is home to Pantex, an Energy Department plant where nuclear weapons are assembled. But as governor, he had no role in running the facility.His supporters say, however, that his experience running the nation\u2019s second-largest state economy has sufficiently prepared him. \u201cLike with any of these positions in Washington, what is needed is strong leadership skills,\u201d Deirdre Delisi, his former chief of staff, said. \u201cI have no doubt he will be able to attract the best and the brightest.\u201dIn a recent interview in the energy secretary\u2019s office, down the hall from the secure facility where he gets his updates on nuclear threats, Mr. Moniz talked about the challenges the United States will face as the Trump administration decides where to take a multibillion-dollar renovation of the nation\u2019s nuclear production facilities and laboratories. Mr. Moniz championed that effort, hoping it would position the United States to preserve its nuclear force without resuming nuclear tests, and ultimately to reduce the number of nuclear warheads.\u201cWe refurbished our weapons to make them safer and more reliable,\u201d Mr. Moniz said, choosing his words with precision. \u201cWe didn\u2019t \u2018modernize.\u2019\u201d Modernization, he said, \u201cis what Russia is doing and China is doing,\u201d which, he acknowledged, could jeopardize Mr. Obama\u2019s vision of a world free of nuclear weapons.If Mr. Perry has views on those issues \u2014 including on whether to test nuclear weapons rather than build computer models of how they would perform \u2014 they are unknown.He would not be the first nonexpert to run the Energy Department. Bill Richardson took the job under President Bill Clinton after serving as ambassador to the United Nations, and later became the governor of New Mexico.But Mr. Perry\u2019s qualifications to oversee a muscular renovation, or expansion, of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons complex are expected to be among the chief topics of questioning at his confirmation hearing. Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team declined a request to interview Mr. Perry.\u201cRick Perry was pitch-perfect for Texas politics,\u201d said Calvin Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University in Texas. \u201cHe has very close ties to the oil industry. He is about \u2018the Texas way\u2019 \u2014 low taxes, low regulation. But none of that gives him the depth of knowledge needed for running the Energy Department.\u201dMr. Perry is attuned to that vulnerability. The Energy Department was on the list of agencies he said he wanted to eliminate when he ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 \u2014 though he famously forgot its name during a debate. Despite what he called his \u201coops\u201d moment, he stood by his call to dismantle the department, saying, \u201cThey\u2019ve never created one bit of energy, the best I can tell.\u201dIf confirmed, Mr. Perry would be at the table for one of the first big debates of the Trump presidency: what to do with the Iran nuclear deal that Mr. Moniz played such a critical role in shaping. Mr. Trump has called the deal a \u201cdisaster,\u201d and Vice President-elect Mike Pence talked during the campaign about scrapping it.But the president-elect\u2019s pick for defense secretary, Gen. James N. Mattis, advised keeping the agreement during his confirmation hearing, and the nominee for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, was equally cautious.Advertisement"}

Their turnover ratios \u2014 the percentage of holdings they replace each year \u2014 are lower than average. The typical actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar sloughs nearly 65 percent of its portfolio annually. Not one of these three hits that rate.Like Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor who leads Berkshire, Mr. Mullholland started out as a hard-core value hound; he sought stocks that were selling for far less than his estimate of their worth. But, he said, he concluded early on that the best companies also had the potential to grow in the long term and that an investor often had to pay more for them.\u201cYou make money by buying the exceptional \u2014 an exceptional business, exceptional management or an exceptional price,\u201d he said. These days, Mr. Mulholland calls himself a \u201cprice-conscious\u201d purchaser of both value and growth stocks.Consider Goldman Sachs Group, which was recently the fund\u2019s top holding. Its shares, like those of many companies, had lagged in some years since the financial crisis. But Mr. Mulholland said he saw an exceptional business \u2014 \u201cthe premier financial brand in the world.\u201d When he bought in, the stock was trading at what he deemed a discount. It returned nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter.Mr. Mulholland likes to stick with winners and will let them swell into a sizable stake. Goldman recently accounted for 9 percent of his fund\u2019s assets, and several years ago Apple was nearly 18 percent. It\u2019s now also about 9 percent.He runs the fund out of a small office in suburban Philadelphia, and he and his wife are its biggest shareholders, he said. \u201cI invest for myself and whoever wants to ride along with me.\u201dMatthew 25, with an expense ratio of 1.06 percent, returned 19.3 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 3.8 percent for the S.&P. 500.Mr. Miles said he and Mr. Green had learned, in 20 years of running the fund together, that many investors will take \u201cwhatever current earnings are, good or bad, and extrapolate them to an unreasonable level.\u201d Thus good news can lead to irrational exuberance, and bad news to unjustified avoidance. \u201cIf the market says this company is underperforming and will underperform forever, that\u2019s often an opportunity,\u201d he said.That kind of thinking had prevailed, Mr. Miles said, with financial companies, which, as a group, accounted for about a third of the fund\u2019s assets on Nov. 30. \u201cBanks haven\u2019t been given much hope since the financial crisis, and their earnings haven\u2019t been spectacular. So they\u2019ve been inexpensive, relative to the market,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been improving their capital position \u2014 they\u2019re fundamentally less risky. And with the new administration coming in, there\u2019s potential that some of the regulatory regime will relax. That would allow them to generate greater returns on capital, which would improve earnings.\u201dExpectations that President-elect Donald J. Trump will bring different policy priorities to Washington may have also given a lift to private prison companies, Mr. Miles said. The GEO Group, a prison operator based in Florida, was another recent winner for the fund and is a top holding.\u201cThe private prison industry is the low-cost source of supply,\u201d Mr. Miles said. \u201cIf there\u2019s more immigration enforcement, you\u2019d think there\u2019s going to be additional demand.\u201dThe managers of the Hotchkis & Wiley fund neither favor nor shun any particular sector or industry. They will consider any small-cap company that has a strong balance sheet and \u201cimportance to its customers\u2019 success or the broader economy,\u201d Mr. Miles said. The fund returned 17.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Its A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.29 percent.Mr. Coniaris said that three tenets unify the investment approach of all the funds in the Oakmark lineup. They invest in shares trading at discounts to the fund managers\u2019 estimates of their intrinsic value. The stocks\u2019 issuers must show \u201ca clear path to growing per-share value over time,\u201d he said. And their management teams must \u201cthink and act like owners.\u201dHe added that, when valuing stocks, Oakmark doesn\u2019t just seek statistical cheapness, such as a low price-earnings multiple. Its fund managers and analysts dig deeper. That can lead them to picks like Alphabet, which may seem unusual for a value hunter.When valuing the stock, the Oakmark team members made several adjustments, Mr. Coniaris said. They subtracted the company\u2019s big hoard of cash. They also factored out its money-losing \u201cmoonshot investments,\u201d like its effort to develop a driverless car. And they estimated that the market had misunderstood the value of YouTube, the company\u2019s video-streaming service.\u201cIf YouTube were to monetize its viewership like a cable company, it could be worth roughly $300 a share,\u201d Mr. Coniaris said. Alphabet has lately traded above $800.\u201cThe way we see it is, if you back out all that stuff, you\u2019re getting the core search business at a big discount.\u201dMr. Coniaris\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.17 percent, returned 7.6 percent for the quarter. The fund\u2019s sibling, Oakmark Global Select, also thrived in the quarter, returning 7.4 percent. The duo\u2019s holdings overlap, but Global Select is more concentrated, with only 20 holdings, while Global has 35.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Twitter Warning to Toyota Unsettles Japanese Carmakers", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byIt appeared to be the first time he had taken on a foreign company for plans that did not directly involve the United States. The effects were immediate: Shares in Toyota and other carmakers fell in trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Friday. And Japanese government officials hustled to respond to the rhetoric with soothing reminders of the jobs that the country\u2019s auto manufacturers had created in the United States.\u201cToyota itself has tried to be a good corporate citizen in the U.S. to date,\u201d said Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Daily Gendai, one of Japan\u2019s leading tabloid newspapers, declared in a front-page headline that \u201cTrump tries to smash Toyota,\u201d and another tabloid, Evening Fuji, hinted at a coming battle with its headline, \u201cTrump vs. Toyota.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post was not entirely accurate. He said Toyota would build a new Corolla factory in Baja, but the company is actually planning to build a new plant in Guanajuato, Mexico. (It already has a factory in Baja.) More significant, Toyota\u2019s new plant in Mexico will not replace any of its 10 factories in the United States, where the company employs 136,000 people. The company said it had invested about $21.9 billion in the United States.\u201cI think being fair is not really in the playbook of the president-elect,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors.Toyota builds Corollas in Cambridge, Ontario, as well as in Blue Springs, Miss. No workers in either of those plants will lose jobs, and when Toyota opens the new facility in Mexico, the company plans to shift the Canadian workers to making small RAV4 sport utility vehicles.According to Hiroshige Seko, Japan\u2019s minister of economy, trade and industry, Japanese carmakers manufactured about 3.86 million cars in the United States in 2015, up from 1.5 million in the 1990s, and employ about 1.5 million people.In response to a question about Mr. Trump\u2019s post at a meeting of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota, said the company would not change its manufacturing plans in Mexico.\u201cI don\u2019t know yet exactly how, but, regardless of who becomes president, our business is about being good corporate citizens,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said, according to a report by The Associated Press. \u201cAnd by becoming good corporate citizens, we are facing the same goal of making America strong. And so we will continue to do our best.\u201dEven though there are only two weeks left to the inauguration, some analysts suggested Mr. Trump might still be in campaign-promise mode.\u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s quite unclear whether Mr. Trump actually will push this policy after assuming office,\u201d said Yoshio Tsukuda, founder of Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry research firm. \u201cRight now we don\u2019t know if he is just bluffing or serious.\u201dBut others said some of Mr. Trump\u2019s words could spur changes on their own.\u201cI think the threat alone can actually force companies to behave in a more Trump way,\u201d Mr. Okubo said. \u201cSo I think regardless of whether the border tax would actually be implemented, I think he will continue to use the threat to pressure companies.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump singled out Toyota on Thursday, analysts said that his views on trade clearly extended beyond a single company.\u201cThe U.S. is no longer a champion of free trade as a nation,\u201d wrote Genki Fujii, visiting professor at Takushoku University in Tokyo, in a column in Evening Fuji.Some analysts said that once Mr. Trump understood what Toyota was doing with its plants, he might back down.\u201cToyota still is expanding local U.S. production in the long term,\u201d said Takaki Nakanishi, an independent auto industry analyst in Tokyo. \u201cNot at this point in time, because the U.S. market is near saturation, but over the long term I think there is more capacity to expand the Mississippi plant.\u201d\u201cJob growth is coming in the long term\u201d in the United States, he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think Donald is misunderstanding Toyota\u2019s intention.\u201dBut Mr. Nakanishi, who was on his way to the annual North American International Auto Show in Detroit, said he was not surprised by Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\u201cHe wants to protect jobs for the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cSo regardless of the origin of the company, he is just trying to do his job.\u201dSome economists fear that Mr. Trump could return to the trade wars of the 1980s with his policies. Jun Saito, a senior research fellow at the Japan Center for Economic Research, said economic conditions were starting to resemble those of the United States in the 1980s, when the dollar was stronger and the country had a large trade deficit with Japan.\u201cThat was the background for the trade friction between Japan and the United States,\u201d Mr. Saito said. Japan\u2019s trade surplus with the United States \u2014 about 7.2 trillion yen, or about $62 billion, in 2015 \u2014 is smaller than China\u2019s, but it could nevertheless draw Mr. Trump\u2019s ire. \u201cI think we have to be very careful. We can\u2019t be too optimistic.\u201d\u201cI think this could be just the beginning,\u201d Mr. Okubo said. \u201cI think the Japanese government has to be really careful not to act in a way that could be interpreted as manipulating the exchange rate.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the source of a quote from Akio Toyoda about Toyota\u2019s being good a corporate citizen.

Or will this be a policy option?\u201d said Zhu Feng, executive director of the China Center for Collaborative Studies of the South China Sea at Nanjing University. \u201cIf this is a policy option, this will not be able to block China\u2019s access to these constructed islands. There is no legal basis.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond to emailed questions asking for details on Mr. Tillerson\u2019s remarks, and whether they represented the intended policy of the United States after Mr. Trump assumes the presidency.What is also not clear is the extent to which Mr. Tillerson\u2019s tough stance on the South China Sea springs from his extensive experience in the region during his time as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, when his company became embroiled in bitter territorial disputes over the extensive oil and gas reserves beneath the seafloor.A spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil in Singapore did not return a phone call asking for comment about the company\u2019s operations in Vietnam.

{"Headline": "Dutch Leader Takes Trump-Like Turn in Face of Hard-Right Challenge", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The prime minister of the Netherlands, aiming to head off an insurgent challenge from right-wing populists, stunned many Dutch citizens this week with a strategy that could have come from President Trump\u2019s playbook.Mr. Rutte castigated \u201cantisocial\u201d behavior like littering and spitting, then broadened his critique to include people who do not respect women or gay rights.While the letter did not explicitly mention Islam, the implication was not lost on anyone, whether or not they support Mr. Rutte, who has been prime minister since 2010 and is seeking a third term in an election set for March. Muslims make up about 6 percent of the population, and there have been sharp debates in the Netherlands for nearly two decades about the role of Muslim immigrants in political and social life.\u201cThe solution is not to tar people with the same brush, or insult or expel whole groups, but to make crystal clear what is normal and what is not normal in our country,\u201d Mr. Rutte wrote.Mr. Rutte has led his center-right People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy since 2006, and he has been credited for changes that have helped lift his country \u2014 whose economy\u2019s performance is closely tied to the fortunes of neighboring Germany \u2014 out of the doldrums after the 2008-9 economic crisis.The letter from Mr. Rutte, which was published online on Sunday, seemed like an effort to head off that challenge by embracing some of Mr. Wilders\u2019s populist messages.\u201cIf you reject our country so fundamentally, I\u2019d prefer you leave,\u201d Mr. Rutte wrote in the letter. \u201cI have the same feeling. Act normal or leave.\u201dThe letter stunned members of the Dutch establishment.Analysts said Mr. Rutte\u2019s statement was not only a response to the polls, but also part of a broader strategy to reconnect with angry and disaffected voters who have been fleeing mainstream parties. While traditional center-left and social-democratic voters seem to be most open to the messages of the far right, center-right parties like Mr. Rutte\u2019s are taking heed.The debate over Islam in political life has a particularly strong resonance in the Netherlands.\u201cIt is clear to the liberal party that they need to regain some of the votes that they virtually lost to the P.V.V., and part of their strategy is to be tough on immigration,\u201d said Claes de Vreese, a political analyst at the University of Amsterdam, using the Dutch initials for Mr. Wilders\u2019s party and the word liberal in the classical European sense of the word \u2014 supportive of free markets and individual liberties.In previous years, the most important issue in the election would have been the economy, Mr. de Vreese said, but since the economy has been doing well over the past six months, the nation is more focused on immigration and integration, as well as on health care.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Soldiers Mutiny in Ivory Coast, Reviving Memories of Civil War", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byABIDJAN, Ivory Coast \u2014 Angry soldiers took up arms in at least two cities in Ivory Coast on Friday in a demand for pay raises and other concessions, paralyzing commerce and street life, and terrifying citizens who still have memories of civil war.Gunfire rang out early Friday across Bouak\u00e9, the second-largest city in this West African nation, amid news reports that soldiers had seized at least two police stations there. Bouak\u00e9 was the crucible of a civil conflict that plagued the country from 2002 to 2011 and left thousands dead.Later in the morning, soldiers launched a similar mutiny in the city of Daloa, according to Yolande Kouame, who works for a financial institution there. She said that shots had been fired at about 10 a.m. and that soldiers had blocked entrances into town.There were news reports of a similar disturbance in the northern city of Korhogo.Tensions from past conflicts simmer, but the soldiers\u2019 actions on Friday took Ivorians by surprise.Just after midnight on Friday, troops broke into a military barracks in Bouak\u00e9, according to the Defense Ministry, and stole a cache of weapons. The renegade soldiers were circling the city on motorbikes, firing shots in the air to disperse crowds, according to Moussa Coulibaly, 30, a student from Bouak\u00e9. He said schools were closed, and the streets of the normally bustling city were quieter than usual.Dominique Koffi, a moped repairman in the city, said a lot of gunfire could be heard early Friday morning in the city center. \u201cThen we saw uniformed military men around town,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got scared and left. The city is paralyzed and shops are closed because of fear.\u201dMilitary leaders have been talking with the renegade soldiers, according to Ivory Coast\u2019s defense minister, Alain Richard Donwahi, who appeared on national television Friday afternoon. The soldiers are seeking raises, bonuses and shorter tenures of military service, among other issues, he said.\u201cThere are ongoing negotiations between the authorities and the soldiers,\u201d Nicolas Djibo, the mayor of Bouak\u00e9, said in a telephone interview.Mr. Djibo said he was optimistic that the situation would be resolved by day\u2019s end, but that it had become a national issue that was beyond his authority.\u201cThe mayor can\u2019t give security guarantees,\u201d he said.In a statement, the Defense Ministry urged all soldiers \u201cto remain calm and return to the barracks, with a view to finding lasting solutions for all of the components of the armed forces.\u201dA similar uprising took place in November 2014, when thousands of soldiers left their barracks to demand back pay and benefits. At the time, the government agreed to meet the demands of the roughly 9,000 former rebel fighters, but those grievances have apparently endured.Bouak\u00e9 was a stronghold for rebels during a 2002 civil war that divided the country. A 2007 peace deal appointed a former rebel leader, Guillaume Soro, as prime minister, but the military remains a loosely knit national force.Rebel fighters helped install Mr. Ouattara in 2011 after the president at the time, Laurent Gbagbo, refused to recognize Mr. Ouattara\u2019s electoral victory. When Mr. Gbagbo would not step down, it took an international military intervention to remove him.Mr. Ouattara, an American-trained economist and a former top official at the International Monetary Fund, has promised to deliver inclusive economic growth. But threats to the country\u2019s stability such as the mutiny on Friday pose a stiff test for his economic goals.Sean Lyngaas reported from Abidjan, and Dionne Searcey from Dakar, Senegal.

{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Extreme Right Challenges Guilt Over Nazi Past ", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byDRESDEN, Germany \u2014 At a chandelier-lit beer hall on Tuesday evening, the lean blond man\u2019s voice boomed out over a crowd of hundreds \u2014 some middle-aged and working-class, but with a contingent of polished young professionals.\u201cThe AfD is the last revolutionary, the last peaceful chance for our fatherland,\u201d declared the man, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, referring to the political party Alternative for Germany, and employing a reverential term for Germany, one of several nationalist buzzwords usually shunned in the country\u2019s politics.\u201cJawohl!\u201d a few shouted. \u201cYes!\u201dWhen Mr. H\u00f6cke (pronounced HOOK-ay) lamented that \u201cGerman history is handled as rotten and made to look ridiculous\u201d \u2014 a subtle but clear reference to guilt for the Holocaust and other Nazi war crimes \u2014 the crowd responded by chanting, \u201cDeutschland, Deutschland.\u201dHis speech at the rally in Dresden on Tuesday touched off a wave of national alarm by challenging Germany\u2019s national atonement for the Holocaust and for its Nazi crimes. His comments drew broad criticism for their venom and because Mr. H\u00f6cke, a rising star in the AfD, has found growing success with his messages of extreme nationalism.Shouting to be heard over cheering supporters, many of whom stood, Mr. H\u00f6cke challenged the collective national guilt over the war that has restrained German politics for three generations. At times he used language that seemed to hint at lamenting Nazi Germany\u2019s defeat.Germans were \u201cthe only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital,\u201d he said, referring to a memorial to murdered Jews in Berlin. He added that Germans had the \u201cmentality of a totally vanquished people.\u201dMr. H\u00f6cke, who began his speech by triumphantly raising his arms over his head, represents the rightward flank of Alternative for Germany, an already far-right party.The chairman of the Green Party for the state of Saxony, J\u00fcrgen Kasek, on Twitter called for the speech to be checked for possible violations of anti-incitement laws. He accused Mr. H\u00f6cke of saying things that violated the spirit of the Constitution \u201cin the style of national socialism.\u201dThe Central Council of Jews in Germany, in a statement, called the comments \u201cdeeply deplorable and fully unacceptable.\u201d Charlotte Knobloch, a former president of the council, told the newspaper Stimme Heilbronner that Mr. H\u00f6cke\u2019s speech was \u201cunbearable agitation,\u201d and she warned that \u201cthe AfD is poisoning the political culture and social debate in Germany.\u201dMr. H\u00f6cke\u2019s comments even drew a rebuke from the chairwoman of Alternative for Germany, Frauke Petry, who said they were out of line and \u201cstraining\u201d the party. Ms. Petry and Mr. H\u00f6cke have been locked in a power struggle for months over how far to the right to position the party, which was originally founded on an anti-euro platform.Those 20-somethings, many in coat and tie, looked clean-cut and primly trendy. Most of the men wore their hair buzzed close on the sides and long and floppy on top, separated by a severe side parting that seemed unmistakably evocative of Hitler\u2019s.Mainstream parties in Germany have long eschewed charisma-driven politics \u2014 in the style of personality-centered movements \u2014 and have avoided shows of overt nationalism. But that leaves an opening: A populist party like Alternative for Germany can indulge those ideas just enough to excite its supporters without scaring off larger groups of voters.The Alternative for Germany supporters who were gathered in Dresden, the capital of Saxony, seemed animated in a way that is unusual when it comes to modern politics in Germany. Most Germans rarely feel allowed to get excited about their political beliefs or, just as sensitive an issue, about their national identity.The atmosphere lent the evening a feeling of thrilling transgression, as if the act of cheering half-forbidden ideas was as important, or perhaps more so, than the ideas themselves.Julian M. W\u00e4lder, a 21-year-old law student, said he had initially joined the youth league of the Christian Democratic Union, the center-right party to which Chancellor Angela Merkel belongs. But the party did not feel like \u201creal politics,\u201d he said.Alternative for Germany, Mr. W\u00e4lder said, finally felt genuine. This is a core part of the party\u2019s message: While other parties are all the same, only Alternative for Germany really expresses the popular will.Mr. W\u00e4lder and other young attendees seemed tense \u2014 the location of the gathering was kept secret until that morning in a failed attempt to avoid the anti-fascist protesters who often gather outside the semiregular rallies \u2014 but they were jovial. The rally on Tuesday felt, if not like a watershed, then a glimpse of a wider, more gradual change.Calls for asserting a strong national identity are not pernicious on their own \u2014 all nations have identities, after all \u2014 but they remain somewhat taboo in Germany. And that taboo is precisely the point. Only the fringes would be brazen enough to champion a nationalist identity. But that risks letting those fringes define its contours.Mr. H\u00f6cke called Mr. Weizsacker\u2019s address \u201ca speech against his own people, and not for his own people.\u201dSince 2015, when Germany received nearly a million asylum seekers, Alternative for Germany has sought to portray national identity as under threat from migration and multiculturalism.Establishment parties and other enemies, Mr. H\u00f6cke told the crowd, \u201care liquidating our beloved German fatherland, like a piece of soap under warm running water. But we, we beloved friends, we patriots, we will close this open tap, and we will win back our Germany, piece by piece.\u201dAmid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.Politics in Germany usually play out in quiet, polite negotiations among members of the coalition, rather than in dramatic, public clashes between competing parties.The coalition blocks fringe parties like Alternative for Germany, which can then paint mainstream politics as an elite conspiracy to impose unpopular policies and to shut down real debate.The crowd, at one point, chanted a line Mr. W\u00e4lder has also used: \u201cWe are the outsiders.\u201d It was a jarring moment, as many of the \u201coutsiders\u201d were young, white and wore suits and ties \u2014 seemingly the definition of an insider in Germany.Because these young Germans say that the political establishment has denied them sufficient pride in their national identity, they feel as if they are being oppressed, even though they have every right and live in a country that has one of Europe\u2019s best-performing economies.But young and old supporters of Alternative for Germany seemed to find something at Tuesday\u2019s rally that is not common among far-right politics: a sense of impending victory. Not in the sense that they would oust Ms. Merkel\u2019s government this fall \u2014 she is likely to retain power \u2014 but in the belief that their movement would quickly shape and perhaps one day overcome a system that they see as denying them their German pride.Mr. Mounk said that the rise of extremist voices may have been inevitable, given the failure of mainstream parties to satisfy the desires for national self-esteem and for charismatic politics.That left an opening for Mr. H\u00f6cke to deliver a message \u201cbeyond the usual gripes about being too ashamed of being German,\u201d Mr. Mounk added, \u201cimplying, though never quite stating outright, that defeat in 1945 was a bad thing.\u201dMr. H\u00f6cke concluded his speech on Tuesday with a rallying call. \u201cBeloved friends, we must do little less than make history, so that there will be for us Germans, us Europeans, a future,\u201d he said, as the audience stood, cheered and chanted his name.He added, \u201cWe can make history, and we are doing it.\u201dShane Thomas McMillan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reflections on Obama", "Date": "2017-01-07", "News": "Supported byLettersReaders describe how they will remember the president as a man and as a leader.Just as Jackie Robinson was perfectly cast for his historic breakthrough, so, too, was Barack Obama. He emerged from relative obscurity as a beacon of hope and change. And, despite the roadblocks and setbacks, he remains so. The Obama presidency has been consequential. Especially impressive is his bold leadership on some of the most significant issues of our time, from health care reform to climate change to a nuclear deal with Iran that was once unimaginable. But it is Mr. Obama the man I will remember most. The personal indignities to which he was subjected, from \u201cbirtherism\u201d to other acts of disrespect and contempt, are a disgrace. Yet he never lost his own dignity or grace. It was an \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d epitomized by his leading this hymn at the funeral for nine African-Americans massacred in Charleston. Now, with his successor inspiring more fear than hope, President Obama is urging us not to despair. Rather than apocalyptic, he\u2019s still optimistic. Let\u2019s follow his lead. Those of us who share his values should continue to work tirelessly toward the progressive ideals he has espoused. Barack Obama\u2019s story will always represent the unique promise of America.SAM BROMBERG, Delray Beach, Fla.President Obama\u2019s domestic legacy is one of thoughtful policy successes, and a failure to publicize and celebrate those achievements. This contradiction is best illustrated by the fact that the majority of Americans polled opposed Obamacare despite overwhelming public support for its individual provisions. More than $800 billion was spent under the 2009 stimulus package, but ordinary Americans couldn\u2019t point to a single bridge built or job saved by it. Mr. Obama, a cerebral technocrat, seemed to operate on the assumption that his nuanced policy solutions would speak for themselves. Despite his soaring speeches, he never learned how to convince Americans that his agenda was working. Mr. Obama\u2019s shortcomings in flaunting his achievements are further accentuated by his successor\u2019s flair for it. The economy added 156,000 jobs in December, but it was 800 jobs at a Carrier factory in Indiana that captured the national spotlight.SAM SKOVGAARD, DenverSUSAN SCANDRETT, Oakland, Calif.President Obama\u2019s accomplishments in office are numerous, from saving the economy to passing comprehensive health care and financial reform. Yet when the history books describe his time in office, President Obama\u2019s legacy will be defined most significantly by his record on climate change. He took office at a true crossroads for our planet: a failure to act could push the world past the tipping point, leading to a cascade effect of irreversible consequences. Mr. Obama met the moment boldly, taking a series of critical steps at home \u2014 including unprecedented investments in clean energy, the largest protections of public lands and waters in history, and the first-ever national carbon pollution standards for power plants \u2014 that served as a foundation for international action such as the bilateral agreement with China and the Paris Agreement. Although the incoming administration seems determined to look backward on environmental issues, many of the president\u2019s changes are here to stay. Future generations will be forever grateful for his leadership.JACK DIMATTEO, Deerfield, Ill.Barack Obama came into office with the possibility of being another L.B.J. or F.D.R. He probably could have got a single-payer health plan; instead he settled for the Republican plan of subsidized insurance. He could have tried to send crooked bankers to jail, as F.D.R. and even Ronald Reagan did; instead it was \u201clet\u2019s just move on.\u201d He could have saved people\u2019s homes; instead he bailed out the bankers who made (and profited immensely from) obviously bad loans. He could have said, \u201cIraq shows we need to keep our hands off the Muslim world.\u201d Instead he destabilized Libya and Syria with our worse than useless intervention. Yes, he had a tough Republican Congress to work with, but the Republican victories were to a great extent the result of his own failed policies. Like Jimmy Carter, Mr. Obama was a good man, but a poor president.HARRY M. CORRIGAN, Hendersonville, N.C.CHRISTINE LAVIN, Geneva, N.Y.While many journalists are pointing to President Obama\u2019s decency and scandal-free administration as major takeaways, what I have been most impressed with is his international legacy. Having lived many years in Asia, where the United States is often seen as brash and arrogant, I have appreciated how he shows genuine respect for other cultures and religions. He has emphasized dialogue, partnership and diplomacy, such as the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris Agreement on climate and relations with Cuba. Furthermore, he has been restrained in the use of military force, which has allowed us to allocate resources to domestic priorities and has greatly reduced combat deaths. \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid stuff\u201d is not a bad mantra.PHYLLIS SATO, Virginia BeachI will remember Barack Obama as president in a flurry of images and sounds \u2014 body surfing in Hawaii, wiping a tear speaking of the Sandy Hook victims, singing \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d announcing Osama bin Laden\u2019s demise, dancing with Michelle on inauguration night, holding hands with his daughters, signing the health care act, showing off Muhammad Ali\u2019s boxing gloves, shooting that three-point swish, doing really funny stand-up comedy, resuscitating our American automobile industry, placing medals of honor on soldiers, and always keeping it truly real. Most of all I will remember his presidency as one of a dedicated family man exuding grace, intelligence, humor, wit, compassion, thoughtfulness and fierce commitment to ideals and principles. And, his smile.SAM BIRENBAUM, Malibu, Calif.PHILLIP J. STOBER, New YorkAfter Barack Obama\u2019s Democratic convention speech in 2004, when people started telling me to watch this rising political star, I responded: \u201cDon\u2019t waste my time. Do you really think Americans would vote for a black man, let alone one named Hussein? Are you kidding me?\u201d Boy, was I wrong. Mr. Obama\u2019s election proved to me that, mixed in with our less savory tendencies, Americans have the capacity to be intelligent, tolerant and inclusive. The very image of this man as our president has provided continuous inspiration and affirmation of America\u2019s goodness to me, my family and friends throughout the highs and lows of his tenure.FRED MORGENSTERN, Charlotte, N.C.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have little brown kids in the White House,\u201d said my husband. I squeezed his hand, speechless. A knot had formed in my throat. It was Nov. 4, 2008, and Barack Obama faced us for the first time as our president-elect, nodding his head slowly, as if acknowledging the weight, the majesty, of the moment. We knew he was imperfect. Over the next eight years, we watched him navigate an increasingly fractious geopolitical atmosphere; fretted when he offered no easy answers. His landmark achievements \u2014 the stimulus bill, Obamacare, the Paris climate accord, diplomatic relations with Cuba \u2014 none of these passed without severe backlash. Yet at no point in time did we question his unwavering devotion to us. In him, we saw ourselves: brown, othered. Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency was the living embodiment of a dream we were once promised. If we could live in a world where he was president, maybe America saw, respected, even loved us. For a brief, magical time, that \u201cmaybe\u201d felt like reality.BEVERLY TAN MURRAY, MiamiDespite his admirable, almost superhuman restraint, I will sadly remember President Obama\u2019s tragic moment of self-indulgence, the night he skewered Donald Trump at the White House Correspondents Dinner. For all the times the president courageously bit his lip in the face of unfair and often hateful criticism, he chose that one time to get even. We are now paying the price for that personal moment of revenge. I will sincerely miss President Obama, but I cannot forgive him for putting himself before the country that one time. He knew better. When they go low, we go high. Always.TOM SEIGEL, Weston, Conn.Barack Obama is the first president to make openly gay and lesbian men and women and transgender individuals feel truly at home in our national government. Hundreds of openly gay and lesbian men and women now serve in important positions throughout the federal government in cabinet agencies, in the judiciary, as United States attorneys and as ambassadors. Pride organizations can be found at the Justice Department, the C.I.A. and elsewhere. The president also ably worked with Congress in the bipartisan repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d My earnest hope is that the president-elect and the new Congress will embrace this historic legacy.RICK VALELLY, Swarthmore, Pa.The writer is a professor of political science at Swarthmore College.Four years ago, I was a young, brooding, biracial (Mexican-Palestinian) man trying to find myself and my place in America. All of this, while adjusting from West to East Coast culture and reconnecting with my Muslim father, a foreign government official, whose absence was ever present. President Obama went down an almost identical path, giving me both the road map to navigate through my own journey and the destination itself \u2014 a role in his administration. It is because of him that I finally found my place in America.AMMAR CAMPA-NAJJAR, San DiegoThe writer was a public affairs officer in the Department of Labor.I will remember Barack Obama as a basically good man who overplayed his hand his first two years in office and was ineffectual the rest of his term. A politician who considers himself above the down-and-dirty \u201cpolitics\u201d of the job isn\u2019t going to get much done. And his foreign policy decisions will haunt the world for years to come.STEVE CRESCENZO, ChicagoAlthough President Obama\u2019s major policy achievements \u2014 passage of the Affordable Care Act and the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 are now in danger under a Republican president and Congress, there can be no erasing the moral standards he established. No president in modern American history has faced such venomous (and unwarranted) political opposition from his first day in office. Yet in the face of such hostility (some with racial overtones), Mr. Obama never lost faith in his countrymen and always acted on behalf of the many rather than the few. He rescued the economy, led international efforts to slow climate change, and struck at terrorists from the skies to minimize American casualties. He took important steps to protect the environment. Sadly, he was unable to pass immigration reform or gun-control measures, but not for lack of trying. He opened new doors to the Pacific Rim, but he blinked when he should have punished the Syrian government for using chemical weapons. Though he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, he did not forge a single peace agreement. Despite making only incremental progress, Mr. Obama will long remain inspirational \u2014 his intelligence, grace, compassion and eloquence offering a beacon to a troubled world.DANIEL BERNSTEIN, SacramentoA memorable part of President Obama\u2019s legacy will be of a man who knew how to laugh at himself. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t take the job seriously. He was serious about his responsibilities to all of us. But he also knew that much of what he had to deal with each day wasn\u2019t earth-shattering stuff. It was ceremonial or trivial, and he soldiered his way through it. He was also a very committed family man. He partnered with his wife, Michelle, to keep his daughters largely out of public scrutiny. He maintained his family\u2019s values, like the dinner hour spent together. In so many ways, he was easy to relate to, even though none of us had lived a life that was in any way comparable to his. I will miss him!JULIE KING, Bloomington, Ind.I was 8 years old when President Obama took office in 2009. I watched the inauguration all the adults in my life were calling \u201chistoric.\u201d I might not have understood exactly why, but I knew that day in history mattered, and maybe not just because of his race. President Obama would be the one to make our government feel human to me. He warmed up the cold bureaucracy of Washington, he made me feel like my government was on my side, and he personally was working tirelessly just for me. Here was a president who delivered arguably the funniest White House Correspondents Dinner speech ever, here was a dad who made jokes that made me groan out of sympathy for Malia and Sasha. Here was the leader who never seemed to give up. His legacy to me is his tireless warmth, his unfailing optimism and his belief that government is good.ELLA PETERSON, Moorestown, N.J.I will remember President Obama as the man who caused enormous financial hardship to my family through the ill-conceived Affordable Care Act. We have struggled for the past two years to meet premiums and co-payments for health insurance coverage that did not meet even our most basic needs. Our premiums and deductibles totaled $18,528 in 2016. It has adversely affected our ability to live, save and plan for a comfortable retirement. For me, any other positives of the Obama presidency have been overshadowed by the folly of Obamacare.TULA KAVADIAS, Munster, Ind.Because of President Obama\u2019s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding, I got my dream job working for the State of New York and am able to do meaningful work that makes a difference every day. The money and security from that job allowed my husband and me to finally start our family after 10 years of marriage and to buy a better home. President Obama made the American dream come true for me, and I will forever be grateful.KATHERINE KIYANITSA, AlbanyI have many good memories of President Obama, but the best was just a dream. We were in the White House kitchen, washing dishes. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that this is the biggest part of the job,\u201d he told me as he handed me another dish to dry. \u201cEvery day, you gotta take care of the necessary things.\u201d And he smiled, letting me know he no more minded tending to tedious details like that, than about handling the big problems. He\u2019s the only president I\u2019ve ever dreamed about, and it was often. He always came as a friend. Sometimes he let me know he had my back. Sometimes I told him I had his. And how much I appreciated all he has done.SANDRA LYNN SPARKS, Mount Airy, Ga.I will remember Barack Obama as the most admirable man to hold the office of the presidency in my lifetime (70 years). My admiration has nothing to do with his policy successes or failures. No, my admiration is based on his deportment as a human being. He is an exemplary husband and father; he treats others with respect; he pursues the greater good over personal gain; his actions are guided by strong ethical and moral convictions; he receives criticism with grace and equanimity; he has a disarming sense of humor; he is resilient; he finds joy in living; he is stubbornly hopeful and optimistic. In short, he is the human being I have always endeavored to become.BOB GUELICH, Edina, Minn.Having voted for President Obama twice, I have become more and more discouraged by both his domestic and foreign policies. The Affordable Care Act has been a well-predicted disaster. The stimulus package was mostly squandered without a noticeable upward effect. On the foreign front, we have seen Mr. Obama\u2019s laughable Syrian red line; his \u201creset\u201d button with Russia, which turned that country into an enemy; his endless war in Afghanistan; the disastrous nuclear agreement with Iran; and, the most serious of his failures, allowing North Korea to possess nuclear arms and delivery systems that pose an existential threat to the United States. No wonder Donald Trump won.ALAN J. RUDE, New YorkWatching President Obama at the Kennedy Center Honors show on television every December has reliably put a lump in my throat. The way he grinned, and grooved, and shook his head in time with the music, eyes closed, and mouthed the words \u2014 unquestionably cool. But the lump came from seeing his palpable pleasure in the extraordinary range of talent being celebrated, the diversity of Americans\u2019 creativity on glorious display.ABIGAIL PESSEN, New YorkMy heart is truly heavy as President Obama leaves office. His intellect, strength, sense of humor and demonstrated love of his family have filled that empty space in my heart for someone who looks like me who could stand as a public model to the country of the best in my community. Yes, we have millions of others like him in my community \u2014 alas, unsung heroes who are sidelined by the media\u2019s constant barrage of negative, stereotyped characterizations of African-American men. So for me, his legacy is the fact that my family, and I\u2019m sure others like mine, will be able to tell the story of an African-American man with courage and grit who served as president of the United States \u2014 without a hint of scandal \u2014 for eight years. He rose above efforts to delegitimize his presence from day one and managed an economic turnaround. I can say that and much more to my grandchildren. Thank you, Mr. President.CAROL M. TAYLOR, Falls Village, Conn.I will always remember President Obama for his eloquence and the way he could move an audience, as well as for his compassion and empathy. Breaking into \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d at the funeral of those gunned down at Emanuel A.M.E. Church. Offering up words of healing at the funeral of Dallas police officers. Honoring those killed and injured with Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona. Crying with the families of Sandy Hook. And inspiring audiences here and abroad with uplifting messages of hope and respect for American values.MARY E. PRIER, Norfolk, Va.Before Obamacare, I went nine straight years without health insurance. I was fairly healthy and the cost of insurance was too high. So when the individual mandate forced me to buy health insurance, I reluctantly signed up and received a generous subsidy on my health plan. Then I had a stroke and the insurance covered 100 percent of the hospital and related medical costs. I received excellent care and have completely recovered. But that\u2019s not how I will best remember President Obama. I will remember him as a rock-solid decision maker. I always had confidence that he would always do the right thing. There is no one on this earth that I respect more.ROBERT PUTNAM, Placerville, Calif.LISA BROOKING, New OrleansBarack Obama reminds me of what it is to be a grown-up, when it is often the case that there are few grown-ups in the room. When there\u2019s glory to be had, he doesn\u2019t claim it all for himself. When there\u2019s blame to be identified, he takes his share rather than trying to unload it all on someone else. When there\u2019s a problem to be solved, he consults the opinions of others; he does his homework; he understands that every issue is part of an ecology of the whole, one thing relating to all the others in some way that needs to be discerned. He works more than one step ahead. He is capable of empathy, sympathy, compassion, patience and personal discipline. I will miss him terribly.RONALD P. BYARS, Lexington, Ky.I will remember President Obama as a historic first black president, with class and intellect and humor and grace. He is a president I was proud of. He moved forward on the progressive social issues that I strongly believe in. In the end though, I will remember him most as the president who betrayed Israel by abstaining from the United Nations resolution that will embolden the Palestinians to continue to reject any and all prospects of peace with Israel.EVE BIRNBAUM, Tel AvivWhat I will remember and miss the most about President Obama is watching the working of his mind. Every time the president spoke you could just see his vast and extraordinary intelligence in his eyes and on his face. I always felt I was actually watching that extraordinary brain of his in motion.MARGOT HEAD, New YorkAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oakland Raiders Apply to Move to Las Vegas", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byAfter decades of shunning Las Vegas, the American city most closely associated with gambling, the N.F.L. has moved a lot closer to having a team there.On Thursday, the Oakland Raiders applied to relocate to Las Vegas, a bid that will test the league, which has stridently opposed sports gambling for decades. Relocation would require approval from at least 24 of the 32 teams, and the earliest the owners are expected to vote is late March, when they are to meet in Phoenix.Although the league has long shunned the idea of putting a team in Las Vegas, that stance has softened in recent years with the growth of daily fantasy sports and other forms of wagering. The N.F.L. is still wary of gambling and its potential influence on games, but players, coaches and some owners, most notably Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, have dismissed those concerns.\u201cThe unique thing about Las Vegas is it\u2019s a jewel for our country,\u201d Jones said in a recent interview. \u201cIt really can be a plus for the \u2018wow\u2019 factor and for the N.F.L.\u201dThe Raiders, he said, had the \u201ccachet\u201d and the national following to make a splash in Las Vegas.The Raiders have said they want to move to Nevada because they have failed for years to find a replacement for their home, Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, one of the oldest and most decrepit stadiums in the league. Local government officials have said they cannot pay a large share of the bill for a new sports facility, something the Raiders have demanded.If enough owners approve the application, which seems quite likely based on the swift approval of recent moves and statements from powerful owners like Jones and Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots, the Raiders would become the third N.F.L. team to move in less than two years.After nearly two decades of relative stability, the N.F.L. map would be altered dramatically. Two teams \u2014 the Chargers and the Rams \u2014 already abandoned smaller markets in San Diego and St. Louis for Los Angeles.The Raiders would leave a city that already lost the team once, when it moved to Los Angeles in 1982 before returning in 1995. They have significant fan bases in both Northern and Southern California.Having reordered its domestic map, the N.F.L. may now set its sights on potentially placing a team in London, though significant logistical hurdles must still be addressed.The Raiders tried to leave Oakland last year but failed to persuade the owners of other teams to let them build a new stadium in Southern California with the Chargers, who last week announced their move from San Diego to Los Angeles. So the Raiders owner Mark Davis, who also had talked with officials in San Antonio, began meeting with lawmakers in Nevada, who ultimately agreed to contribute $750 million in hotel taxes to help pay for a domed stadium that Davis wants to build in Las Vegas.Lawmakers and business leaders in Oakland can still come up with an alternative plan to keep the Raiders, but time is running short. The City Council voted last month to give Fortress, an investment group, 60 days to persuade the Raiders to consider a plan to build a new stadium in Oakland.\u201cThe Bay Area, millions of stalwart fans and the business community are not giving up on keeping the Raiders here where they belong,\u201d Jim Wunderman, president and chief executive of the Bay Area Council, a business and public policy group, said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to believe that a deal can be reached to build a modern stadium complex that the Raiders deserve and that benefits Oakland.\u201cWe urge the Raiders, the N.F.L. and Oakland to work together to find an agreement that can benefit everyone and avoid the disruption and pain of a costly move. Relocating a franchise with the deep roots and storied history that the Raiders have here in the Bay Area would be a disaster for the community.\u201dRaiders fans were not surprised at the move but were still angered by it.\u201cWhy would you rip a team out of a market that has supported you for more than four decades?\u201d said Jim Zelinski, a lifelong Raiders fan who helps run Save Oakland Sports. \u201cThe Raiders mystique will be gone forever if they move to Las Vegas and play in an air-conditioned dome.\u201dThere are significant questions as to whether Las Vegas \u2014 which will welcome an N.H.L. expansion team, the Golden Knights, next season \u2014 can sustain an N.F.L. team, although with about 2.5 million residents, the metropolitan area is bigger than several others with N.F.L. teams, including Buffalo, Green Bay and New Orleans.But if the owners were to allow the Raiders to move, the team would be leaving Oakland, a city in a far wealthier and larger region. Las Vegas, which primarily makes its money on tourism, has a less diversified economy and is prone to economic swings.The owners will also have to consider how Davis intends to pay for a stadium, because the league prohibits owners from having direct interest in gambling establishments. Sheldon Adelson, a casino magnate and the chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, will reportedly pay $650 million for a share of the new stadium, which is projected to cost $1.9 billion. It is unclear, though, whether he also wants a share of the Raiders.The N.F.L. owners\u2019 stadium and finance committee was shown plans last week by the Raiders that included building a stadium without financial support from Adelson.Davis, who does not have any significant business interests beyond his stake in the Raiders, will be eligible to receive $200 million in financial aid from the league for stadium construction, and presumably can raise money through the sale of stadium naming rights and licenses to purchase season tickets. But he would also have to pay a relocation fee, which will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.Little may change in the short term. Davis has said the team will play in Oakland for at least two more seasons while a stadium in Las Vegas is being built.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Great Working-Class Colleges", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byMore recently, these universities have seemed to struggle, with unprepared students, squeezed budgets and high dropout rates. To some New Yorkers, \u201cCity College\u201d is now mostly a byword for nostalgia.It should not be.Yes, the universities that educate students from modest backgrounds face big challenges, particularly state budget cuts. But many of them are performing much better than their new stereotype suggests. They remain deeply impressive institutions that continue to push many Americans into the middle class and beyond \u2014 many more, in fact, than elite colleges that receive far more attention.To take just one encouraging statistic: At City College, in Manhattan, 76 percent of students who enrolled in the late 1990s and came from families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution have ended up in the top three-fifths of the distribution. These students entered college poor. They left on their way to the middle class and often the upper middle class.\u201cWe are the engine of the ability to be socially mobile,\u201d Baruch\u2019s president, Mitchel B. Wallerstein, said. Most Baruch graduates, he added, are making more money than their parents as soon as they start their first post-college job.I\u2019ll admit that the new data surprised me. Years of reporting on higher education left me focused on the many problems at colleges that enroll large numbers of poor and middle-class students.Those college graduates have to come from somewhere, of course, and most of them are coming from campuses that look a lot less like Harvard or the University of Michigan than like City College or the University of Texas at El Paso. On these more typical campuses, students often work while they\u2019re going to college. Some are military veterans, others learned English as a second language and others are in their mid-20s or 30s.\u201cThere are a lot of people who would not go to college at all, and would not get an education at all, if they had to go through some selective criteria,\u201d said Erik Pavia, a 2010 graduate of the University of Texas at El Paso, known as UTEP. \u201cUTEP opens the doors to people from all walks of life.\u201dPavia grew up in Canutillo, a poor neighborhood in El Paso, the son of a construction worker and house cleaner. He did well enough in high school to attend many colleges but \u2014 as frequently happens with low-income students \u2014 was not willing to leave home at age 18 for an unfamiliar world. \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel like I was ready to go out to college on my own,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I decided to stay home and save money.\u201dAfter college, he went to law school, and today is a business manager at a technology start-up called Knotch. Twice a year, he returns to UTEP to teach an intensive two-week class on business and law. Pavia\u2019s story is the classic story of the American dream.Because the elite colleges aren\u2019t fulfilling that responsibility, working-class colleges have become vastly larger engines of social mobility. The new data shows, for example, that the City University of New York system propelled almost six times as many low-income students into the middle class and beyond as all eight Ivy League campuses, plus Duke, M.I.T., Stanford and Chicago, combined.The research does come with one dark lining, however \u2014 one that should motivate anyone trying to think about how to affect government policy in the age of Donald Trump. The share of lower-income students at many public colleges has fallen somewhat over the last 15 years.\u201cIt\u2019s really been a nightmare,\u201d said Diana Natalicio, UTEP\u2019s president and herself a first-generation college graduate. \u201cThe state does not recognize \u2014 and it\u2019s not just in Texas \u2014 the importance that the investment in public education has for the economy and so many other things. Education was for me, and for many of the rest of us, the great opportunity creator.\u201dThe question is how to enable more working-class students to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s really the way democracy regenerates itself,\u201d said Ted Mitchell, Obama\u2019s under secretary of education. The new research shows that plenty of successful models exist, yet many of them are struggling to maintain the status quo, let alone grow. It\u2019s true in red states as well as in many blue and purple states, and it\u2019s a grave mistake.There is a reason that City College and California\u2019s universities evoke such warm nostalgia: They fulfilled the country\u2019s highest ideals \u2014 of excellence, progress and opportunity. Many of those same colleges, and many others, still do. They deserve more than nostalgia.A picture caption with David Leonhardt\u2019s column last Sunday misstated the location of the section of the City College campus depicted. The building in the photograph, Shepard Hall, is on Convent Avenue in Manhattan, not on Broadway.Advertisement"}

But this would not generate any new federal revenue as the corporate income tax rate would be lowered.In any case, Mexico itself would not be paying for the wall, as Mr. Trump had indicated.The taxes would be paid by companies selling Mexican goods in the United States. Some would raise prices, others would absorb the taxes and see their profits reduced.Tariffs would violate the North American Free Trade Agreement and most likely the rules of the World Trade Organization. People would find a way around any clampdown on remittances.But what if the administration went ahead with it?It has already been embarrassed by an accounting scandal.Now, Toshiba, one of Japan\u2019s oldest and proudest technology conglomerates, has to sell its most valuable business to try to undo the damage.Toshiba is desperate for cash after nuclear-related losses came to light last month, and it had to warn that it was preparing to write off several billion dollars of ballooning expenses at its nuclear subsidiary. Analysts say the semiconductor business could fetch $13 billion to $17 billion.\u201cTo the extent the new administration prioritizes the creation of valuable, innovative high tech and manufacturing jobs, Tesla stands at the epicenter of that.\u201dThe oil and mining tycoon Eike Batista was once Brazil\u2019s richest man, and his prominence was associated with the booming economy.Mr. Batista has been in legal trouble before.In 2014, he went on trial on charges of insider trading and stock market manipulation, but the case was suspended after the judge presiding over his trial was filmed driving his seized Porsche. After the judge was removed, Mr. Batista was barred from serving as a corporate officer for five years.This time, prosecutors say that Mr. Batista paid $16.5 million in bribes to S\u00e9rgio Cabral, the former governor of Rio de Janeiro, where Petrobras is based. Mr. Batista\u2019s lawyer said his client had left the country.\u2022 The Commerce Department releases its first major batch of economic data under the new president.

{"Headline": "How an Author Found the Real Florida", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byQ AND AMs. Salustri, the arts and entertainment editor at Creative Loafing Tampa, took a 5,000-mile road trip across Florida. She sought to retrace the routes taken by a collective of writers in the 1930s, which included Stetson Kennedy and Zora Neale Hurston. The group of writers was commissioned to document the state with the Federal Writers\u2019 Project (F.W.P.), part of the Works Progress Administration (W.P.A.), which culminated in the book \u201cFlorida: A Guide to the Southernmost State.\u201dBelow are edited excerpts from an interview with Ms. Salustri.Q. During your road trip, what was the most eye-opening route for you? Why do you think so much of the state is under-the-radar?I think we do the job of selling ourselves. We do such a good job, though, that we feel like we have to hide these other parts.What influenced you when writing this book?The structure of the book is patterned exactly after the W.P.A. Guide from the 1930s. My writing is very influenced by author Bill Bryson. Not to flatter myself, but I really hope that I was able to use that kind of braided narrative.More than many other states, Florida has a mystique to it. Why?We\u2019re a paradise. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve promoted ourselves as before it was really a paradise. We don\u2019t have a state income tax and don\u2019t have many industries left other than tourism. It\u2019s a very manufactured thing, and I don\u2019t say that in a bad way. For example, Key West is considered an arts community. What people don\u2019t realize is that the whole idea of Key West as an arts community was actually a W.P.A. project to save the economy. The government shipped in artists and people worked on the beaches.Why do you prefer taking U.S. Highway 41, known as the Tamiami Trail, south of Naples headed to Miami?You\u2019re going through the swamp if you\u2019re on U.S. Highway 41. If you exit Interstate 75 near Naples and turn onto Highway 41, there\u2019s a Circle K, CVS, and a Tractor Supply. And then there\u2019s less and less around you, and then you\u2019re in the swamp. You can feel yourself start to slip off the edge of North America. One of the most beautiful things I\u2019ve ever seen in my life was when I was driving to South Florida to catch an early flight. I was going east across the Everglades before sunrise. Within five minutes of actual sunrise, I saw wave after wave of birds take off from the trees. I watched the Everglades wake up. It was such a mind-clearing experience. It reminds you that Florida is so much more than a meme. We are just an incredible beauty. There\u2019s nothing else like the Everglades anywhere in the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Tough Times,\u2019 but U.S. Investor Bets on Latin American Start-Ups", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 With a change of administration in the United States ushering in uncertainty, this may be an unusual time for an American investment firm to bet on emerging markets.Yet San Francisco-based Rise Capital, founded by Nazar Yasin, a former director at Tiger Global Management, sees some of the next big internet companies coming from Latin America, in particular Brazil and Mexico.After investing in multiple countries in the region in recent years, Rise, for the first time, has backed an internet start-up in Colombia. The firm led a $5.2 million round, which closed this month, in OFI, an online office supplies company in Bogot\u00e1, both Mr. Yasin and Peter Ostroske, a co-founder of OFI and its chief executive, said in interviews.That stake comes on the heels of one that Rise made in Brazil. In December, it joined in a $10 million private investment raised by S\u00e3o Paulo-based InstaCarro, an online platform for selling automobiles. FJ Labs and Lumia Capital, both existing investors, led that round, InstaCarro\u2019s chief executive, Diego Fischer, said in an interview, but Rise put in money for the first time.Mr. Yasin said Rise continued to see promising opportunities in the region and expected to make more investments this year despite some of its countries\u2019 ailing economies and uncertainty stemming from President Trump\u2019s policies.Mexico\u2019s economy is likely to be affected by decisions made in Washington. And Brazil remains mired in major political and economic upheaval. The central bank of Brazil\u2019s most recent weekly survey of economists estimated growth at a mere 0.5 percent this year. The International Monetary Fund is even less optimistic, forecasting 0.2 percent growth here.\u201cBrazil is not out of the woods from a macroeconomic perspective,\u201d Mr. Yasin cautioned. But that did not seem to faze him as a long-term investor.\u201cThe reality of investing in emerging markets is that most of the time, it\u2019s tough times,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will always be more bad years than good years.\u201dThe region\u2019s start-up scene has also been through ups and downs over the last several years, but the entrepreneurship wave continues.Mr. Yasin is no stranger to investing outside the United States. He was previously co-head of European internet coverage at Goldman Sachs. In 2010, he joined Tiger Global Management as a director and worked there until 2013.Tiger was an early investor in Latin American internet companies, well before Silicon Valley venture capital firms took interest. It was also during his stint there that Mr. Yasin first met Mr. Ostroske of OFI, who is American.Mr. Ostroske said OFI, which was previously backed by another Silicon Valley early-stage investment firm called 500 Startups, planned on using the new capital to expand, and not only in Colombia.\u201cWe have a very robust operation in Colombia, but it needs to be developed in Mexico,\u201d he said. He expects that over the next 12 months, \u201cmy focus will be on developing the Mexico City office,\u201d he added.That opportunity is a big reason that Rise invested, Mr. Yasin said. \u201cBrazil and Mexico are two of the largest internet markets in the world right now, and there\u2019s still little venture capital there,\u201d he added.He said Rise was also keen on India and Indonesia, where, he believes, many offline sectors are fragmented. Those countries have each crossed the threshold of 100 million people online, an important marker for him.\u201cOnce the internet gets to scale in larger emerging markets, there tends to be an acceleration in market capitalization,\u201d he noted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Will Miss Antibiotics When They\u2019re Gone", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsThis anonymous woman is only the latest casualty in a war against antibiotic-resistant bacteria \u2014 a war that we are losing. Although most bacteria die when they encounter an antibiotic, a few hardy bugs survive. Through repeated exposure, those tough bacteria proliferate, spreading resistance genes through the bacterial population. That\u2019s the curse of antibiotics: The more they\u2019re used, the worse they get, especially when they\u2019re used carelessly.Already, more than 23,000 people in the United States are estimated to die every year from resistant bacteria. That death toll will grow as microbes develop new mechanisms to defeat the drugs that, for decades, have kept infections at bay. We are on the cusp of what the World Health Organization calls a \u201cpost-antibiotic era.\u201dYet few new antibiotics are in development. Most large drug companies have fled the field. The reason is simple: To conserve their effectiveness, new antibiotics are put on the shelf to be used only when older antibiotics stop working. That makes perfect sense for public health, but companies can\u2019t make a profit on what they can\u2019t sell. This mismatch between the huge social value of new antibiotics and the relative indifference of drug manufacturers could spell disaster.But the law probably won\u2019t stimulate much innovation. A couple more years of poor sales are a small incentive and may actually promote overuse of antibiotics. The law is also poorly targeted. Some \u201cnew\u201d antibiotics are similar to existing compounds \u2014 so similar that bacteria are already resistant to them. We don\u2019t need to reward manufacturers for tweaking antibiotics that we already have. We need them to develop entirely new antibiotics.A few federal agencies have shown more initiative. Medicare, for example, has moved to require hospitals and nursing homes to adopt plans to prevent the spread of drug-resistant infections and to assure the proper use of antibiotics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is taking steps to limit the spread of resistant infections and to reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics. The Food and Drug Administration has simplified approval standards and has worked with industry to limit the use of antibiotics in livestock, which today accounts for three-quarters of antibiotic sales in the United States. And the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority has been working creatively to build public-private partnerships to support the most promising research.But Congress needs to think bigger if it wants to fix the broken antibiotic business model. Although the patent system is good at producing new blood-pressure medications and cardiovascular drugs, it\u2019s not the right fit for antibiotics. Because new antibiotics may be held in reserve for years, manufacturers can\u2019t sell enough during the patent term to justify large research investments. Congress should instead reward manufacturers that bring a targeted, highly innovative antibiotic to market with a substantial financial prize; in exchange, manufacturers would surrender their patent.This kind of \u201cmarket-entry\u201d reward would enable public health officials and physicians to deploy new drugs precisely where they\u2019re needed. Manufacturers would no longer have an incentive to milk their patent, marketing the drug for inappropriate uses. The antibiotic could also be sold at a reasonable price in developing countries, which might otherwise be unable to afford a patented antibiotic.Financing market-entry rewards would be expensive, perhaps $4 billion per year in total, or about 10 percent of the annual global bill for antibiotics. But you can\u2019t defeat bacteria on the cheap. They\u2019ve survived for billions of years because they\u2019re so good at adapting to new threats. Staying one step ahead will require ingenuity, money and radical change. Tinkering around the margins isn\u2019t going to cut it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pact Would Force Out Joseph Kabila From Congo. If, of Course, He Agrees.", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Did a group of bishops just disarm one of the most explosive political problems in Africa?Shortly before midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve, with crowds waiting anxiously in the streets of Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Catholic bishops announced a deal that could calm a very turbulent nation.This was huge news in Congo, which has never enjoyed a peaceful transfer of power. It has been racked by more rebellion, assassinations, civil war, suffering and death than just about any other country on the continent. Geographically the biggest nation in sub-Saharan Africa and one of the most stunningly beautiful, Congo is also one of the poorest and most violent.So in the last few days, many Congolese have expressed relief, gratitude, even downright joy, calling the deal brokered by the Catholic Church \u201chistoric.\u201dBut there is at least one problem that is pretty hard to ignore: Mr. Kabila has yet to sign the agreement.Some opposition figures signed it, as did some members of Mr. Kabila\u2019s political party, including the minister of justice. But in the absence of Mr. Kabila\u2019s signature, people inside and outside Congo are trying to piece together what this means and what the real chances of peace are.\u201cKabila is not trustworthy. That\u2019s why we will keep our eyes on him,\u201d said Abraham Luakabuanga, an opposition spokesman.Mr. Kabila, 45, is a hard man to read. He has been president since 2001, when his father, President Laurent Kabila, a smuggler turned rebel leader, was assassinated. Considering he has been in office for nearly 16 years, longer than any other Congolese leader except for the singular Mobutu Sese Seko, he has not left much of a mark. Congo has benefited from some progress in the last decade and a half, but the vast majority has been driven by the private sector or outside investment, not by the government. Mr. Kabila is a reclusive figure, and many Congolese feel they know little about him.Congo\u2019s Constitution says he should have been out of office by Dec. 20. Several analysts contend that Mr. Kabila is not desperate to be president for life. Instead, they say he has another reason for hanging on to power: He is scared, for his safety and his wealth.Congo is rich in natural resources, including diamonds, gold, oil, timber, copper, hydropower, cassiterite for tin ore, uranium for nuclear bombs and cobalt for cellphones. The underground treasures have stirred many rebellions, and Mr. Kabila is widely suspected of extracting millions of dollars for himself and his family from highly suspicious mining deals.That may have been a big factor in why his political party finally said he would leave, but many Congo analysts think it is far from certain that he will actually do it.\u201cThe fact of the matter is, he has no good exit plan, so he has little interest in respecting this agreement,\u201d said Jason Stearns, the director of the Congo Research Group, a research project based at New York University.Mr. Stearns was not all negative about the deal, saying it was \u201castounding\u201d that Mr. Kabila\u2019s side had agreed to important concessions, such as appointing a member of the opposition to be the new prime minister and not changing the Constitution so that Mr. Kabila could run again.But Mr. Stearns also said Mr. Kabila \u201ccould have just realized that he needed a good excuse to kick the can down the road further and a solution would pop up in the long term.\u201dAnd why did the opposition agree?Opposition leaders had vowed never to allow Mr. Kabila to stay in office beyond Dec. 20. They threatened to mobilize millions in an Arab Spring-like uprising to drive him out.That did not happen. Some demonstrators hit the streets on Dec. 19 and 20, but they were quickly run off by the security forces, who have remained loyal to Mr. Kabila partly because he has paid them relatively well despite a crashing national economy.For the moment, the new agreement seems to have quieted things down. But Mr. Kabila, who is hardly known for his democratic spirit, has yet to say publicly why he did not sign the accord about his own tenure. Several analysts say that may have been a strategy to give him room to back out, though that will not be easy if the Catholic Church mobilizes the population behind this accord.Opposition members said they expected Mr. Kabila to sign the agreement once a new government was formed, but others dismissed that as wishful thinking.Some of his political allies have already begun to grumble, complaining Tuesday that the agreement was not \u201cinclusive\u201d enough.Another worry: Is it even possible for Congo to hold a credible election by the end of the year? The nation is nearly one million square miles, and much of that is thick, impassable rain forest, with rebel groups lurking here and there.It is not clear how, in the next 12 months, nationwide elections can be organized, especially by an election commission that is widely suspected of money laundering and other corruption.Many young men idolize Mr. Katumbi; his name is on the tip of many lips when politics come up. He has the cult of personality, the fortune, the network and the technocratic inner circle, including several American advisers, to mount a bigger, more sophisticated campaign than anyone else.Though Mr. Kabila\u2019s government agreed last week to drop charges against some political prisoners, the charges still stand against Mr. Katumbi, clearly the most aggravating thorn in Mr. Kabila\u2019s side.\u201cKatumbi has the money,\u201d said Marthe Mujinga, a teacher in Kinshasa.She, along with many others, said Mr. Katumbi would be the obvious front-runner. But she doubts Mr. Kabila is serious about leaving power. \u201cHe and his ministers use pretexts to justify postponing elections because of their interests,\u201d she said.Soon enough, she added, Mr. Kabila will \u201cdeploy the police in all the roads of Kinshasa.\u201dSteve Wembi contributed reporting from Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Officials See Faster Economic Growth Under Trump, but No Boom", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal Reserve officials expect Donald J. Trump\u2019s election to result in somewhat faster economic growth over the next several years, but they see little chance of the boom Mr. Trump has promised, according to an account of the Fed\u2019s most recent meeting in mid-December.That is in part because the Fed plans to raise interest rates more quickly if growth accelerates.For now, however, Fed officials plan to wait and see what happens next, the account said.\u201cWhile the Fed signaled that it would likely respond to expansionary fiscal policies with a faster pace of rate hikes, the Fed believes it is too early to embed this into its baseline,\u201d Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, wrote on Wednesday following the release of the minutes. \u201cAny real shift in the stance of monetary policy will require more clarity on the stance of fiscal policy.\u201dOfficials instead spent the meeting talking about what comes next. Mr. Trump has promised a bevy of major changes in economic policy, including tax cuts and spending increases, reductions in regulation, and restrictions on trade and immigration. As a result, the account said, Fed officials regard both faster growth and slower growth as more likely than before the election, when the economy seemed locked into its longstanding pattern of slow and steady growth.\u201cThe job of conducting U.S. monetary policy has not become any easier over recent months,\u201d said James Marple, senior economist at TD Bank, referring to the increased uncertainty.The Fed, led by Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman, predicted in December that it would raise rates three times this year. The account said officials were not yet ready to predict how the pace of rate increases might change as a result of new policies pursued by Mr. Trump and Congress.\u201cParticipants emphasized their uncertainty about the timing, size and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those policies might affect aggregate demand and supply,\u201d the minutes said. The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, has 17 members, 10 of whom cast votes on monetary policy.The Fed\u2019s caution amounts to a bias in favor of growth. The economy is expanding at roughly the pace Fed officials regard as sustainable. The work force is growing slowly as more baby boomers retire, and productivity is rising slowly. Two percent growth may be about as good as it gets.Ms. Yellen has warned that fiscal stimulus, like a tax cut or a spending increase, could increase economic growth to an unsustainable pace in the near term, resulting in increased inflation. The Fed quite likely would seek to offset such policies by raising interest rates more quickly.Instead of acting pre-emptively, the Fed is choosing to wait for more information.But the minutes said officials were concerned about the challenge of communicating their increased uncertainty. They want to be clear that the Fed\u2019s prediction about the pace of rate increases depends on its prediction about economic growth. Faster growth will mean faster increases.The account said Fed officials were confident in their ability to raise rates quickly enough to prevent overheating, seeing \u201conly a modest risk\u201d of a \u201csharp acceleration in prices.\u201dBy holding rates at low levels, the Fed has sought to increase economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking; higher rates reduce the stimulative effect. The benchmark rate now sits in a range from 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, still very low by historical standards.\u201cConsumers have no reason to panic about the rate hike last month, or even about additional rate increases in 2017,\u201d said Alan MacEachin, chief corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. He noted that the last rate hike would add $1 to the monthly payment on a $5,000 credit card balance.The economic forecast prepared by the Fed\u2019s staff for the December meeting anticipated that Mr. Trump\u2019s election would result in \u201cslightly higher\u201d growth over the next several years. It said a likely increase in fiscal stimulus would be \u201csubstantially counterbalanced\u201d by higher interest rates and a stronger dollar, which would reduce exports of American goods and services.Several Fed officials reported that Mr. Trump\u2019s election had increased optimism among business executives in their districts. \u201cSome contacts thought that their businesses could benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax and regulatory policies,\u201d the minutes said.Businesses across the country also reported increased difficulty in hiring qualified workers, the minutes said. The unemployment rate fell to just 4.6 percent in November. The lack of readily available workers could further limit the benefits of a fiscal stimulus.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Health Care Fundamentals", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Another week of complete chaos on the health reform front. Dear Leader declares that he\u2019ll give everyone coverage; Republicans explain that he didn\u2019t mean that literally. CBO says the obvious, that repealing the ACA would lead to immense hardship for tens of millions; Republicans declare that this is wrong, because they will come up with an alternative any day now \u2014 you know, the one they\u2019ve been promising for 7 years.I\u2019ve written about all of this many, many, many times. The logic of Obamacare \u2014 the reason anything aiming to cover a large fraction of the previously uninsured must either be single-payer or something very like the ACA \u2014 is the clearest thing I\u2019ve seen in decades of policy discussion. But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever written out the fundamental principles that lie behind all of this.So here we go: providing health care to those previously denied it is, necessarily, a matter of redistributing from the lucky to the unlucky. And, of course, reversing a policy that expanded health care is redistribution in reverse. You can\u2019t make this reality go away.Left to its own devices, a market economy won\u2019t care for the sick unless they can pay for it; insurance can help up to a point, but insurance companies have no interest in covering people they suspect will get sick. So unfettered markets mean that health care goes only to those who are wealthy and/or healthy enough that they won\u2019t need it often, and hence can get insurance.If that\u2019s a state of affairs you\u2019re comfortable with, so be it. But the public doesn\u2019t share your sentiments. Health care is an issue on which most people are natural Rawlsians: they can easily imagine themselves in the position of those who, through no fault of their own, experience expensive medical problems, and feel that society should protect people like themselves from such straits. The thing is, however, that guaranteeing health care comes with a cost. You can tell insurance companies that they can\u2019t discriminate based on medical history, but that means higher premiums for the healthy \u2014 and you also create an incentive to stay uninsured until or unless you get sick, which pushes premiums even higher. So you have to regulate individuals as well as insurers, requiring that everyone sign up \u2014 the mandate, And since some people won\u2019t be able to obey such a mandate, you need subsidies, which must be paid for out of taxes.Before the passage and implementation of the ACA, Republicans could wave all this away by claiming that health reform could never work. And even now they\u2019re busy telling lies about its collapse. But none of this will conceal mass loss of health care in the wake of Obamacare repeal, with some of their most loyal voters among the biggest losers.What they\u2019re left with is a health economics version of voodoo: they\u2019ll invoke the magic of the market to somehow provide insurance so cheap that everyone will be able to afford it whatever their income and medical status. This is obvious nonsense; I think even Paul Ryan knows that he\u2019s lying like a rug. But it\u2019s all they\u2019ve got.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Ambassadors in Asia Make Final Plea for Dead Trans-Pacific Trade Pact", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported bySinosphereThe partnership, called the TPP, was a hallmark of the Obama administration. It would have been one of the largest trade agreements in history, covering about 40 percent of the world\u2019s economy and setting new terms and standards for trade for the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations. China was not included but would have been able to join.In their letter, the ambassadors warn that \u201cwalking away from TPP may be seen by future generations as the moment America chose to cede leadership to others in this part of the world and accept a diminished role.\u201d\u201cSuch an outcome would be cause for celebration among those who favor \u2018Asia for the Asians\u2019 and state capitalism,\u201d it added.The 2016 presidential race was shaped by anti-globalization trends. Donald J. Trump promised to destroy the pact if he became president. Hillary Clinton also denounced it, even though she supported a form of it as secretary of state.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said after the election in November that Congress would not take it up. That meant it was dead.The letter by the six ambassadors, all of whom are political appointees who leave their jobs on Friday, was symbolic. It put them on record supporting Mr. Obama\u2019s plan more than a year after the trade chiefs of the nations involved endorsed the pact. Following is the text of the letter:An Open Letter to Members of Congress:Seventy-five years ago last month, an attack on the United States set us on the path to becoming the Asia-Pacific power we are today. As U.S. Ambassadors assigned to the region, we interact daily with governmental, business, and civil society leaders who appreciate profoundly the role the United States has played in underpinning the region\u2019s security and prosperity ever since. These same leaders are now asking an alarming question: Will we relinquish our mantle as the pre-eminent force for good in the planet\u2019s most dynamic region? The cause for their concern \u2014 possible U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). We believe their fears are justified, that walking away from TPP may be seen by future generations as the moment America chose to cede leadership to others in this part of the world and accept a diminished role. Such an outcome would be cause for celebration among those who favor \u201cAsia for the Asians\u201d and state capitalism. It would be disastrous for supporters of inclusive politics, rule of law, and market economics \u2014 and for U.S. national interests.Let\u2019s be clear. The alternative to a TPP world is not the status quo. Others are actively engaged in setting the rules of commerce in the Asia-Pacific region without the United States. In addition to its massive Eurasian infrastructure initiative, China is working on a trade pact called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with fifteen other countries, many of whom are TPP signatories. RCEP is a much lower-standard agreement that, in the absence of TPP, would likely serve as the template for economic integration in Asia and shift trade away from America, which would face higher tariffs. That would mean less U.S. exports and more jobs moving overseas.TPP would not just cut tariffs for U.S. products. Unlike RCEP, it would compel stronger intellectual property rights, limits on subsidies to state-owned enterprises, and protection of worker rights, the environment, and a free and open internet. These enforceable commitments would give a leg up to U.S. companies already adhering to high standards \u2014 and the U.S. workers who make them the most productive in the world \u2014 and provide a powerful lever for change that we are unlikely to replicate in any other form in the near future. Without them, our companies will face even more competitive disadvantages in Asia\u2019s booming markets.The blow to our strategic position is even more worrisome. This is not speculation. To turn our back on our allies and friends at this critical juncture, when the tectonic plates of regional power are shifting faster than ever, would undermine our credibility not only as a reliable trade partner, but as a leader on both sides of the Pacific. It would also create a potentially destabilizing void that might even lead to conflict, an outcome which would hurt everyone in the region, including China.The bottom line is this: TPP is good for American workers, American values, and American strategic interests. We urge the Congress to work with the new administration to find a way to realize its many benefits before the window for doing so closes. As we reflect on more than seven decades of U.S. sacrifice and stewardship in the region that will define our destiny in coming decades, we should understand that, if we fail to answer today\u2019s call, history will pose a stern question \u2014 why did America forsake its best chance to shape the Pacific Century?Signed by: Max Baucus, ambassador to China; Nina Hachigian, ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; Caroline Kennedy, ambassador to Japan; Mark Lippert, ambassador to South Korea; Mark Gilbert, ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa; and Kirk Wagar, ambassador to Singapore.

When I spoke to his counselor about bringing him home to say goodbye, she told me that she thought his leaving the facility now is a bad idea. (I didn\u2019t say: \u201cAnd letting his mother die without saying goodbye to him is a good idea?\u201d) I don\u2019t want to be difficult with the counselor. But can I bring this up again? And what should I tell my wife, who asks often?JACK, PENNSYLVANIAIf anyone on earth is allowed to be difficult right now, Jack, it is you. I am so sorry for your troubles. And I admire your attempt to manage these tough, competing claims with grace. To the counselor, say: \u201cI respect your opinion that my son should stay on site now. But I worry about the future repercussions of his missing his chance to say goodbye to his mom. Can we revisit this issue with his team?\u201dAs it stands, we don\u2019t know enough about the counselor\u2019s reasoning or your son\u2019s condition. You might float the idea of engaging a travel companion for your son, who could see him safely to your wife\u2019s door, then back to the facility again. Or perhaps his physical (or emotional) state is too delicate for travel \u2014 or for a traumatic visit with his dying mother. But one thing is certain: Raising this issue again with his treatment team falls squarely in the zone of loving familial behavior. Go for it.As for your wife, tell her you are working on your son\u2019s visit. Share your landmark memories of raising him, regardless of the travel outcome. And encourage her to talk all she wants \u2014 of happy times and sad. Your job isn\u2019t to fix problems right now, but to listen and hold your wife\u2019s hand, as she says all the things she needs to say. My thoughts are with you.My boyfriend and I are in our early 20s. We have been together for over two years. We live with our families and have good jobs. Recently, I\u2019ve been spending more time with his family, as it\u2019s closer to work. I\u2019ve noticed that his mother cleans his room, packs his lunch, cooks dinner for him and even schedules his appointments. (He contributes nothing in return.) I am worried about his lack of self-sufficiency, and I simply mentioned that he shouldn\u2019t depend on his mother so much. He got very defensive about their relationship. Was I out of line?DELANEYIf you want to drive a young straight guy bonkers (in my experience), call him a \u201cmama\u2019s boy.\u201d (Again, in my experience: Most of them are.) I suspect they hear it as a knock on their raging masculinity or some creepy Oedipal accusation. But, dude, if your mom is washing your underpants at 24, you have officially failed to launch.I get your worry. If your relationship progresses, you fear that you will inherit this man-child and presumably begin scheduling his teeth cleanings. But that hasn\u2019t happened yet. He isn\u2019t asking you to coddle him, correct? Try engaging him in adult tasks (a load of whites, anyone?) and praise him when he joins you. Avoid speaking with Big Mama; this is between you and your beau. You may advise him that full-time maid service will not be part of your relationship with him. But put yourself in his shoes: Who packs lunch if someone else will do it for us?For years, I worked as a lawyer at a corporate law firm. I didn\u2019t like it, but I didn\u2019t hate it. And I earned lots of money. Last year, I was fired in a reorganization and became certified as a yoga teacher. Since then, I love my work every day.

The universe gave you a little shove, and you turned it into a beautiful upward-facing dog. (That\u2019s a yoga pose, for the three readers who don\u2019t know.)

{"Headline": "As S.U.V.s Take Over, New Camry Gets a Quiet Greeting", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byWheelsDETROITJUST a few years ago, the introduction of a new Camry sedan by Toyota Motor would have been a momentous event \u2014 for both the automaker and its rivals.The Camry has been one of the top-selling vehicles in the United States since the 1990s, and it has been the outright sales leader among cars for the last 15 years. An updated version with added features, increased power and better fuel economy was always certain to give Toyota an extra lift in the highly competitive American auto market, and could mean tougher times for other car companies.But at the Detroit auto show this week, the introduction of the all-new 2018 Camry got a muted reception.The Camry, which will arrive in dealerships this fall, won plaudits for its bold sporty look, improved engines, eight-speed transmission and advanced safety electronics. A radar system for detecting pedestrians and other vehicles, and stopping the car before hitting them, will be standard on all versions of the Camry.Yet few analysts are expecting the car to rock the market.\u201cThe new Camry will do O.K. It will have its share of the market,\u201d said Karl Brauer, senior editor at Kelley Blue Book, an auto-research firm. \u201cBut Toyota cannot bank on it being a big boost to overall sales.\u201dThat outlook is a reflection of the new reality in today\u2019s car business: The family sedan is no longer king of the road. Compact and midsize cars used to be the two largest segments in the auto industry. But for several years now, low gasoline prices have lured more Americans into buying larger vehicles, especially S.U.V.s and the lighter and more fuel-efficient versions known as crossovers.At the Detroit show, new S.U.V.s dominated the headlines. General Motors, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan all lauded new S.U.V.s that are about to arrive in showrooms or will in the next few years. New car unveilings were scarce.Full-size S.U.V.s, like big pickup trucks, sit on heavy steel frames. Crossovers look like S.U.V.s; they are roomy and have higher seating positions than cars. But they are made from the lighter underpinnings of cars, so they have a smoother ride than trucklike S.U.V.s, and do well on gas mileage.That proved a winning combination for Charles Watkins, a civil engineer in Newton, Mass. Last month he and his wife, Erika, started shopping for a second car, and on New Year\u2019s Eve they bought a Honda CR-V, which is rated at 27 miles per gallon over all, compared with 30 for an Accord sedan.\u201cWe thought about getting a car, but the extra cost of gas is only going to be a little bit more,\u201d Mr. Watkins, 28, said. The extra cargo space in the CR-V made it a no-brainer. \u201cIf we have to move furniture or pick up sheets of plywood, it\u2019s no problem,\u201d he said.That kind of sentiment is shaking up the auto business. Last year, automakers sold almost five million crossovers of all sizes, up 8.5 percent from the year before, according to Autodata. Sales of midsize cars like the Camry fell 8.4 percent, to 3.2 million.In 2016, the Honda CR-V outsold its stablemate, the Accord, for the first time. The top-selling Ford, after the F-150 pickup truck, is the Escape, a crossover. They outpaced both the Fusion and the Focus. At Chevrolet, the Equinox crossover has outsold the Malibu sedan five years in a row.Toyota is counting on the new Camry to buck that trend. With sculpted curves and creases, the new version is supposed to present a more modern and sporty look than past Camrys, which were often criticized as bland and boring. The 2018 model will be available with a four-cylinder engine as well as a V6, an option many competing models do not offer. A hybrid will be part of the mix, too.\u201cWith all the improvements we made to the car, we really think that we will add a lot of excitement to the midsize segment,\u201d said William D. Fay, general manager of the Toyota division in the United States. \u201cMaybe we start to get some people to pay a little more attention to it.\u201dEven as sedan sales slump, the Camry is still a powerful franchise. Although sales of the car fell 9.5 percent last year, Toyota still sold 388,616 of them. The only vehicles with higher sales were three pickup trucks: the Ford F-150, the Chevrolet Silverado and the Ram.Mr. Fay noted that seven million people in the United States are currently driving Camrys, giving Toyota a loyal base of customers to woo. \u201cOur expectations continue to be very large for this car,\u201d he said.Other automakers are less optimistic about the car business. At the Detroit show, Ford\u2019s conviction was displayed in three coming models that the company heralded. A small crossover, called the Ecosport, and a new Ranger, a small pickup truck last made in 2011, are due in dealerships late this year. A rugged S.U.V. is coming in 2020 and will be called the Bronco, reviving a nameplate that was dropped in 1996.\u201cIn the past S.U.V.s were not fuel efficient and cars were. You don\u2019t have to make that trade-off anymore,\u201d said Joe Hinrichs, chief of Ford\u2019s North America region.On the car side, Ford\u2019s plans are less clear. It recently canceled plans to build a new small-car plant in Mexico, in part because of declining demand for cars.\u201cThere will continue to be a car market,\u201d Mr. Hinrichs said. \u201cWe want a car portfolio. But do we need one in every segment? That\u2019s one we will discuss over time.\u201dFiat Chrysler Automobiles has already had that discussion, and has walked away from a large part of the car business. Last year it stopped making the Chrysler 200, a Camry competitor, and the Dodge Dart compact, amid disappointing sales. It has instead focused on bigger vehicles.There are no signs, though, that the company has any plans of turning back to cars.\u201cBoth the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart were the least financially rewarding that we\u2019ve carried out,\u201d Sergio Marchionne, the company\u2019s chief executive, told reporters at the Detroit show. \u201cI don\u2019t know one investment decision that was as bad as these two were.\u201dBill Vlasic contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Off Long Island, Wind Power Tests the Waters", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported byOnly a few years ago, the long-held dream of harnessing the strong, steady gusts off the Atlantic coast to make electricity seemed destined to remain just that. Proposals for offshore wind farms foundered on the shoals of high costs, regulatory hurdles and the fierce opposition of those who didn\u2019t want giant industrial machinery puncturing the pristine ocean views.Now the industry is poised to take off, just as the American political landscape and energy policy itself face perhaps the greatest uncertainty in a generation.And in New York, after years of stymied progress, the Long Island Power Authority has reached an agreement with Deepwater Wind, which built the Rhode Island turbine array, to drop a much larger farm \u2014 15 turbines capable of running 50,000 average homes \u2014 into the ocean about 35 miles from Montauk. If approved by the utility board on Wednesday, the $1 billion installation could become the first of several in a 256-square-mile parcel, with room for as many as 200 turbines, that Deepwater is leasing from the federal government.\u201cWe\u2019re developing this first offshore wind project in federal waters, but it\u2019s really a gateway project to other locations around Long Island,\u201d said Thomas Falcone, the power authority\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019re now at a point where developers can build projects at prices where utilities are willing buyers, and to me that is a very big deal.\u201dThese projects could also become an important test case in establishing just how far states can go to to pursue their clean energy agendas under the Trump administration. Before putting steel in the water, the project would need federal approvals and policies that are in doubt amid Washington\u2019s changing of the guard.Wind power has finally become viable for a number of delicately interlaced reasons. It has taken favorable state policies and technological and economic advances to spur the current level of activity, as well as interest among developers and investors, including foreign oil and gas companies that see offshore wind as an important part of their corporate strategies. In Europe, where the offshore wind industry is far ahead of the United States\u2019, costs have plummeted to roughly half of what they were five years ago, said Thomas Brostrom, who runs United States operations for Dong Energy, the Danish oil and gas giant and a leading offshore wind developer.As the industry has grown, manufacturers have been able to take advantage of economies of scale and cut their prices. At the same time, turbines have grown ever larger, allowing them to capture and produce more energy on the same site.Dong hopes to help foster similar developments in the United States. The company bought leases in Massachusetts and New Jersey and opened an office in Boston. \u201cWe are here to create an industry,\u201d Mr. Brostrom said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a ways to go, but everything that we hoped would happen has happened.\u201dDong has plenty of company. Statoil, the Norwegian fossil-fuel giant, has been aiming to get into the offshore business in the United States for years, and proposed in 2011 to build a farm off the Maine coast using floating platforms it had designed. The company withdrew the project two years later amid uncertainty over changing state policies, eventually deciding to build off the Scottish coast.Now it is back, having won a 33-round auction to secure a 79,000-acre site south of Jones Beach on Long Island. Statoil beat out several other bidders, including the state\u2019s energy agency, Dong and a subsidiary of Iberdrola, a leading energy company based in Spain. Statoil pledged $42.5 million for the lease, which still awaits final approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, far more than the $16 million generated by all earlier offshore wind auctions combined.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of companies starting to invest that had been wary of the U.S. offshore wind market and some of the initial lease sales,\u201d said Walter Cruickshank, acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. \u201cThey have been coming to the table in a big way more recently.\u201dThe appeal of offshore winds as an energy source goes beyond their potential role in efforts to slow global warming. As people flock to coastal cities, where land is scarce and expensive, and conventional power plants are moving toward retirement, states have looked to add new forms of power production. Moving it out to sea has become more attractive, proponents say.The country\u2019s coasts, home to over half the population, offer some of the strongest wind resources in the world, creating, in theory, enough energy to provide roughly four times the power the nation now produces.Though it is easier and cheaper to construct turbines on land, the East Coast in particular offers opportunity because of its strong winds and shallow waters, which means turbines can operate farther out to sea, and out of sight. The potential of offshore wind power converged with rising demand on Long Island\u2019s South Fork, where in areas like the Hamptons, commercial activity was rising and property owners were building larger houses, calling for more air-conditioning and more pool pumps.In New York, the Long Island farm is part of a plan to meet Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s goal of drawing 50 percent of the state\u2019s power from renewable sources by 2030. That includes developing 2.4 gigawatts of offshore wind, he said in his State of the State address this month, by far the nation\u2019s highest target, equaling the capacity of the Niagara Falls generating station.The wind array would not be visible from Montauk Point, and difficult to see from Martha\u2019s Vineyard, some 15 miles away, said Jeffrey Grybowski, Deepwater\u2019s chief executive. That makes it unlikely to stir the kind of public opposition that all but sank Cape Wind, the ambitious development that would have positioned 130 wind machines just five miles off Cape Cod but stalled in a political storm over blighted vistas.The Rhode Island project allowed Deepwater to work through many of the obstacles that had been holding back the industry, Mr. Grybowski said, including the lack of an established permit process and acceptance on the part of the public and the electric companies. \u201cThe Block Island project made offshore wind a reality in the United States,\u201d he said, \u201cso the conversations changed with utilities, who want to know that you can actually deliver on a project that you\u2019re proposing to them.\u201dDeepwater Wind first proposed the South Fork wind farm in response to a Long Island Power Authority solicitation for projects, but it was ultimately rejected by the authority\u2019s board in favor of several solar farms. The wind developer returned the next year with a new proposal that came close to approval a number of times, but fell short.Now, however, executives have negotiated a contract that they expect the board to approve. Under it, the utility will purchase all of the electricity delivered from the turbines by an underwater transmission line to a substation in East Hampton, paying a price comparable to what it would pay for other utility-scaled renewables like onshore wind and solar, according to the utility. Those prices have run around 16 cents a kilowatt-hour, higher than its average wholesale price of 7.5 cents.Deepwater plans to finance the project with a mix of loans and equity investments, though it is unclear if it will be able to benefit from federal tax credits that have spurred investment in wind farms and helped reduce the price of the power they produce. Until this year, a federal investment tax credit worth 30 percent of the development cost could be claimed. That has dropped to 24 percent for projects that begin this year and is set to be phased out by the end of 2019. To qualify, the project would need to demonstrate construction activity by then, which could be open to interpretation by the Treasury Department.But wind developers and advocates say the credit is also important to red states in the middle of the country, where it has helped drive the spread of land-based wind farms. Nurturing an offshore wind industry would meet the stated goals of many Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration, including the pursuit of an \u201call of the above\u201d energy program. Building and installing the wind machines could create thousands of new jobs, as it has in the land-based wind business, in manufacturing and construction. The project would also require special vessels and large onshore staging areas to assemble the components of the platforms and turbines, which could help the shipbuilding and port industries.\u201cWe\u2019re a heavy industry that\u2019s poised to build, employ and invest,\u201d said Nancy Sopko, who manages advocacy and federal legislative affairs at the American Wind Industry Association.That momentum may be difficult to slow, even if new federal policies put a stop to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management\u2019s leasing activities for wind energy, its proponents say. The active leases alone, if developed, are enough to create an industry, they say. And the commitments of states like New York and Massachusetts, and experienced multinational developers, show that the struggle to harness Atlantic breezes is no longer the same as tilting at windmills.\u201cIt is a sign of something that\u2019s inevitable, which is the addition of offshore wind into the energy mix,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be too appealing. In the end, the economics trump Trump.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the future of offshore wind farms misidentified the agency that needs to sign off before Statoil can proceed with its plan for a wind farm site south of Jones Beach on Long Island. The remaining signoffs involve the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management \u2014 not the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, which have already approved the plan. \u0081Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Darker Theme in Obama\u2019s Farewell: Automation Can Divide Us", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byRobot Revolution\u201cThe next wave of economic dislocations won\u2019t come from overseas,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good, middle-class jobs obsolete.\u201dDonald J. Trump has tended to blame trade, offshoring and immigration. Mr. Obama acknowledged those things have caused economic stress. But without mentioning Mr. Trump, he said they divert attention from the bigger culprit.The inequality caused by automation is a main driver of cynicism and political polarization, Mr. Obama said. He connected it to the racial and geographic divides that have cleaved the country post-election.It\u2019s not just racial minorities and others like immigrants, the rural poor and transgender people who are struggling in society, he said, but also \u201cthe middle-aged white guy who, from the outside, may seem like he\u2019s got advantages, but has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change.\u201dTwenty-eight percent of work activities involve tasks that are less susceptible to automation but are still at risk, like unpredictable physical work or interacting with people. Just 21 percent are considered safe for now, because they require applying expertise to make decisions, do something creative or manage people.The service sector, including health care and education jobs, is considered safest. Still, a large part of the service sector is food service, which McKinsey found to be the most threatened industry, even more than manufacturing. Seventy-three percent of food service tasks could be automated, it found.No one knows how many people will be threatened, or how soon, the report said. It cited various researchers\u2019 estimates that from 9 percent to 47 percent of jobs could be affected.In the best case, it said, workers will have higher wages and more leisure time. In the worst, there will be \u201csignificantly more workers in need of assistance and retraining as their skills no longer match the demands of the job market.\u201dTechnology delivers its benefits and harms in an unequal way. That explains why even though the economy is humming, it doesn\u2019t feel like it for a large group of workers.Education is the main solution the White House advocated. When the United States moved from an agrarian economy to an industrialized economy, it rapidly expanded high school education: By 1951, the average American had 6.2 more years of education than someone born 75 years earlier. The extra education enabled people to do new kinds of jobs, and explains 14 percent of the annual increases in labor productivity during that period, economists say.Now the country faces a similar problem. Machines can do many low-skilled tasks, and American children, especially those from low-income and minority families, lag behind their peers in other countries educationally.The White House proposed enrolling more 4-year-olds in preschool and making two years of community college free for students, as well as teaching more skills like computer science and critical thinking. For people who have already lost their jobs, it suggested expanding apprenticeships and retraining programs, on which the country spends half what it did 30 years ago.President Obama, in his speech Tuesday, named some other policy ideas for dealing with the problem: stronger unions, an updated social safety net and a tax overhaul so that the people benefiting most from technology share some of their earnings.The Trump administration probably won\u2019t agree with many of those solutions. But the economic consequences of automation will be one of the biggest problems it faces.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Potential Weapons if Trump Declares War on Nafta", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIn normal times this question would not be top of mind for Mexican policy makers. Mexican governments over the last quarter-century have consistently pushed back against the nation\u2019s historical resentment toward the United States, hoping to build a more cooperative relationship with its overbearing northern neighbor.But these aren\u2019t normal times. As President Trump prepares the opening gambit in his project to either renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or pull out, Mexico\u2019s most important strategic goal is narrowing to one word: deterrence.It must convince Mr. Trump that if he blows up the trade agreement on which Mexico has staked its hopes of development, by weaving its economy ever more closely into that of the United States, the United States will suffer, too.The critical question is whether Mexico\u2019s threat will be convincing.Mexico\u2019s main challenge as it confronts a hostile Trump administration is the enormous asymmetry of the bilateral relationship. Ending Nafta would hurt the United States: Six million American jobs depend on exports to Mexico, according to Mexican officials. But to Mexico, it could prove devastating.Mexico has relied on the pact to draw foreign capital into the country, not only ensuring multinational companies stable access to the largest consumer market in the world but also guaranteeing that their investment is safe, noted Luis Rubio, who heads the Center of Research for Development in Mexico City.\u201cWe will bring to the table all themes,\u201d he said in a speech. \u201cTrade, yes, but also migration and the themes of security, including border security, terrorist threats and the traffic of illegal drugs, weapons and cash.\u201dHis hope is that by introducing broader uncertainty about the bilateral relationship \u2014 Will Mexico still cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking? Will it stop foreign terrorists from using Mexico as a way station into the United States? \u2014 Mexico can raise the stakes enough for Mr. Trump to reconsider his \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to commerce.\u201cMexico has a lot of chips to play,\u201d said Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a former foreign secretary who has staked out a combative approach.Let Mr. Trump pull the United States out of Nafta, he argues. Instead of stopping Central American migrants at its southern border, Mexico should let them through on their way to the United States. \u201cAnd let\u2019s see if his wall keeps the terrorists out, because we won\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Casta\u00f1eda added.The view from Mexico City is not uniformly bleak. Some analysts believe there is a potential for a situation in which a new Nafta benefits all. \u201cI have always believed one should never let a good crisis go to waste,\u201d said Arturo Sarukh\u00e1n, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States. \u201cThere is an opportunity that we could end up modernizing and improving Nafta.\u201dThe view that there is a potential silver lining to Mr. Trump\u2019s hostility toward Nafta is also popular in some Washington circles. The quarter-century-old agreement is due for some modernization anyway, if only to deal with things like data protection, online crime and e-commerce \u2014 which were not around in the early 1990s. Nafta\u2019s weak provisions on labor and environmental standards could also be improved.Trade has contributed to economic growth, but changing dynamics have also prompted concerns about lost jobs and the trade deficit. But when something is manufactured in the United States, it is often made up of parts from around the world.Many aspects of Nafta could be upgraded, trade experts say. It could do with new rules to open up government projects to bidders from all three Nafta partners. Allowing long-haul trucking companies from Mexico and the United States into each other\u2019s markets could make trade between the two more efficient. What\u2019s more, the Mexican-American border could benefit from more infrastructure investments to integrate energy networks, reduce clogged lines at border crossings and the like.Now that Mr. Trump has formally nixed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have tied North America and nine other nations from the Pacific Rim into one large trade bloc, some of its provisions could be drafted into a new North American deal.Gary Hufbauer of the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington suggests that the name \u201cNafta\u201d be retired \u2014 it has a bad reputation. But a lot of its substance could remain, perhaps in the form of separate bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico.\u201cTrump wants some easy victories,\u201d Mr. Hufbauer pointed out. If he can score political points using his Twitter feed to persuade a few companies to keep jobs in the United States, why risk hurting the American economy by abandoning the North American trade deal? \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the reconciliation,\u201d Mr. Hufbauer said.Still, it\u2019s hard to reconcile the proposal for an improved, more effective trading pact in North America with Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent portrayal of trade as a zero-sum game that inevitably shortchanges the United States.In Mr. Trump\u2019s eyes, improving Nafta seems to mean eliminating Mexico\u2019s trade surplus with the United States and limiting investment by American multinationals in Mexico. But one can\u2019t quickly eliminate a $60 billion trade surplus with a new Nafta \u2014 not unless it has some incredibly draconian limits on imports or local content requirements that could be as damaging to Mexico as abandoning the pact altogether.Many Mexican officials fear that it is precisely this kind of draconian change that Mr. Trump has in mind. It would be politically profitable, at least in the short term. And it would signal toughness to China \u2014 a more formidable rival that is next on Mr. Trump\u2019s list. If Canada stays out of the fray, cutting a separate deal with the United States to replace Nafta, Mexico would be left alone in an existential fight for its future.In this case, Mexico may have no choice but to raise the stakes and hope to arrive at the negotiating table with a threat at least as credible as Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to pull out of the deal.Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiating position does have some soft spots. For one, said Mickey Kantor, the American trade negotiator who concluded the Nafta negotiations during the Clinton administration, \u201che is under pressure to deliver a deal.\u201dIf Mexico stands its ground and even allows Nafta to dissolve, it would send its own signal to China: Resistance is not futile. And Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to raise tariffs against Mexico to 35 percent could easily be challenged under the rules of the World Trade Organization.This is, of course, a hugely risky strategy for Mexico. When Mr. Trump entered the presidential race in June 2015, a dollar was worth about 15 pesos. Now it\u2019s worth about 22. A frontal confrontation with the United States might send it to 40, Mexican officials fear, fueling capital flight.And yet that may be Mexico\u2019s strongest card.As noted by C. Fred Bergsten, director emeritus of the Peterson Institute, an irony of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to Mexico is that by weakening the peso so much, he is going to increase the bilateral trade deficit, increase Mexico\u2019s competitiveness and make it more attractive for American companies to invest there. \u201cThat is going to swamp anything he achieves with his company-by-company efforts,\u201d he added.That\u2019s if Mexico manages to hold on. The more ominous situation is one in which the United States pushes too hard and Mexico \u2014 its economy, its unpopular government, its public order and political stability \u2014 buckles. The United States has enjoyed a peaceful southern border for 100 years, since Pancho Villa made his marauding raids into the Southwest during the Mexican Revolution. \u201cThat is worth pure gold in this and any other world,\u201d Mr. Casta\u00f1eda said. \u201cMexico\u2019s best argument is \u2018Don\u2019t mess with that.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hunting for Unicorns in the N.B.A.", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byOn SportsJanuary is hangover month for the National Basketball Association. The pageantry of the league\u2019s Christmas Day games has faded, the playoffs are still months away and the exciting unknowns of a new season have mostly been resolved: The Warriors still dominate; the Nets still stink.Just days after the new year began, two average teams, the New York Knicks and the Milwaukee Bucks, played what set up to be another meaningless regular-season snoozer. But after the game, the reporters crowding the narrow, sterile hallways beneath Madison Square Garden were uncommonly excited. When a Knicks public-relations staff member showed up to declare that the home team\u2019s locker room was now open for reporters, almost nobody moved: The Knicks had been upstaged that night by a kind of Ghost of Basketball Future, Giannis Antetokounmpo, the 22-year-old, nearly seven-foot-tall Bucks point guard who had just stunned the New York crowd with a buzzer-beater.It wasn\u2019t simply that he made his first game-winner as a pro. He rendered a Knicks defender helpless with one impossibly long, oddly graceful step backward before rising way up to calmly sink a fadeaway jumper. Antetokounmpo is the rare athlete who looks more human in slow-motion replay \u2014 that\u2019s where you can see the end of his stretchy limbs and the way he moves them as an actual person does. In real time, he seems liquid, his body flowing to the empty spaces on the court. This shot was no different; it looked as if T-1000 from \u201cTerminator 2\u201d had challenged a Wang computer to a jumping contest.These sorts of revelatory moments, when you can glimpse basketball\u2019s future as a game that has abandoned its traditional roles based on body sizes and when a team\u2019s players run the floor like five Magic Johnsons, have turned the Bucks \u2014 more or less an afterthought since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for Los Angeles \u2014 into appointment viewing. And as the energized reporters waited in the Bucks locker room for Antetokounmpo to appear, a couple of aging beat writers seemed to be grappling with ways to describe what they had seen. They settled on \u201cMadison Square Giannis.\u201dThose old imperatives have never exerted much of a hold over a new, enlightened generation of N.B.A. fans. Ten years ago, the influential basketball blog FreeDarko coined the term \u201cliberated fandom.\u201d What FreeDarko celebrated were the quirks and oddities of specific N.B.A. players rather than winning seasons or huge marketing campaigns or even geography. (Disclosure: I wrote a few posts for FreeDarko.) Since then, more N.B.A. fans have detached themselves from tribal ties to local teams. And while the franchises and shoe companies that make up the N.B.A. economy haven\u2019t completely caught up with the online buzz generated by the league\u2019s most dedicated fans, they have begun to prepare for what feels like inevitable change. Antetokounmpo and fellow young \u201cunicorns\u201d like Kristaps Porzingis of the Knicks and Joel Embiid of the Sixers \u2014 their taxonomic I.D., co-opted from Silicon Valley, refers to a singular talent without antecedent \u2014 will go a long way toward determining whether the pro-basketball industrial complex can make as much money appealing to liberated fans as to their hidebound, local-market counterparts.\u201cThe size of the market doesn\u2019t really matter anymore,\u201d Dustin Godsey, the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 chief marketing officer, told me, referring to a team\u2019s location. \u201cYou can be a superstar anywhere.\u201dWhen the team drafted Antetokounmpo three years ago, he was unknown, born in Greece to Nigerian parents. The Bucks didn\u2019t bother putting him on billboards as the face of the franchise. Instead, Milwaukee became the first team, according to Godsey, to provide instant in-game highlights on social media, most of which featured Antetokounmpo streaking up the court and making moves that hinted at his absurd potential. In the three seasons that followed, Milwaukee never finished with a winning record. Antetokounmpo did not make an All-Star Game \u2014 that should change this year, his fourth, because he has been averaging something like 24 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists \u2014 but video views through Bucks social feeds tripled over the last year. Online streaming of local games doubled. In response, Godsey\u2019s team changed its strategy: Antetokounmpo now appears on billboards in Wisconsin, in TV ads, at events. Whether he has earned this superstar treatment is of no account \u2014 he looks good in seven-second video clips.\u201cThe N.B.A. is changing,\u201d Russ Bengtson, an emeritus editor of Slam magazine and a senior editor at Complex, told me. \u201cThe shoe companies need to figure out a way to become super-nimble \u2014 the league is full of \u2018unicorns\u2019 now, and by the time a guy becomes a story, the next guy is already coming up. The whole definition of what a star is has changed a bit, and they need to be able to strike while the iron is hot.\u201dAs the season rolls into the All-Star break, nearly half the players leading the voting play in ways that defy the old but still widely held archetypes \u2014 the high-flying shooting guard, the stoic center, the scrappy white sharpshooter. The marketing efforts haven\u2019t fully caught up to the evolution. This month, Nike released a signature shoe for Paul George, who like Jordan and Kobe Bryant is a handsome, high-scoring shooting guard. But George, who plays for the Indiana Pacers, doesn\u2019t signal a possible paradigm shift as Antetokounmpo or Embiid or Porzingis does. He may be very good, but he does not fire up the internet. His time as the N.B.A.\u2019s next big thing probably peaked three seasons ago, too.Because the hype cycle for up-and-coming stars still moves too quickly for them to be marketing stars as well, it\u2019s unclear when players like Antetokounmpo, who have no real on-court or business archetypal predecessor, will be able to convert online hype into reliable moneymaking. Nationally, he is still a commercial puzzle \u2014 a Nike representative told me the company is going to put him in a digital campaign but wouldn\u2019t elaborate on other plans.Antetokounmpo seems to understand that we haven\u2019t yet completely entered the liberated future. In the locker room after his game-winning shot at the Garden, I asked him if he thought his career so far would have been different if he played in New York or Los Angeles. He seemed, at first, perplexed by the question, before he said, \u201cI guess I would have gotten more publicity.\u201d But then, like so many up-and-coming superstars, he retreated straight into the sorts of clich\u00e9 that have become the soundtrack for the marketable athlete. But anywhere I am, he said, I am going to be a gym rat and work hard.Jay Caspian Kang is a writer at large for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Threatens a Good Neighbor", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMEXICO CITY \u2014 For Mexico, the United States has been a difficult neighbor, sometimes violent, almost always arrogant, almost never respectful, rarely cooperative. Mexico, on the other hand, has been a good neighbor to the United States.To each offense, we have responded first with a gesture of noble resignation and then by searching for a practical resolution through a conciliatory openness of mind. Our positive attitude has allowed our two nations to live for almost 200 years in a generally peaceful atmosphere, though there have been tragic episodes and periods of tension. It is a record of tranquillity that few countries sharing a border can claim.The first and most serious offense was of course the American invasion of Mexico in 1846 and the subsequent Mexican-American War, which resulted in Mexico losing more than half of its territory. It was so traumatic an event that it became the theme of our national anthem.And my reference to Vietnam is not accidental. According to ample testimony in American newspapers and private letters, the American troops in Mexico committed numerous massacres and other atrocities. Ulysses S. Grant would write in his memoirs, \u201cI do not think there was ever a more wicked war than the one waged by the United States on Mexico.\u201dNevertheless, Mexico accepted defeat and moved on. It supported the Union in the American Civil War and, after 1876, opened its doors wide to American investment in railroads, mining, agriculture, ranching, logging, manufacturing, public services, banking and the oil industry. In 1910, at the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, American investment in Mexico was greater than that of all other countries combined.The second grave offense took place in February 1913. Francisco I. Madero had become president through the first truly democratic election in Mexican history. He was an admirer of the United States. But the United States ambassador, Henry Lane Wilson, worried that Mr. Madero\u2019s policies would hurt American business interests, and helped orchestrate a coup that resulted in the assassination of Mr. Madero and his vice president. Mexico immediately plunged into a ferocious civil war that killed hundreds of thousands. The advent of Mexican democracy was postponed for almost 90 years.Still, in 1917, when Germany proposed an alliance against the United States with the promise of returning the territories lost in 1848, President Venustiano Carranza disdained the offer.The third serious offense consisted of a period of prolonged hostility. In 1914, the United States Marines occupied Veracruz, and two years later American troops entered northern Mexico in unsuccessful pursuit of Pancho Villa, who had attacked the town of Columbus, N.M. Frequent \u201cfake news\u201d reports in the 1920s by the Hearst newspapers, supported by American oil interests, were published in the hopes of instigating war against Mexico. Supporters of an invasion were almost at the point of achieving it in 1927, when President Calvin Coolidge\u2019s administration called the country \u201cSoviet Mexico.\u201d Although congressional opposition thwarted an invasion, relations remained tense. Right up to the end of World War II, an American invasion seemed at least a threat.But Mexico did not sever relations with the United States. On the contrary, Mexico honored its debts and its agreements, attracted and inspired American artists and writers, favored American business investment, cooperated with Franklin D. Roosevelt on his Good Neighbor Policy and, in 1942, declared war on the Axis powers and sent an aerial squadron to fight in the Pacific War. In 1947, an age of cooperation began that the New York Times reporter Alan Riding called the era of \u201cdistant neighbors.\u201dMexico must respond differently this time. The Mexican Congress should offer the world an example of dignity by demanding that the next president of the United States apologize for having called Mexicans rapists and criminals. Such an apology is imperative, and would be the best signal that any negotiations, difficult as they may be, could be conducted within a framework of mutual respect and good faith.Another point that is not negotiable is the wall. The Mexican government must make it clear that Mexico will never pay for Mr. Trump\u2019s wall in any way. Without meeting these two points, there are no grounds for a negotiation.A priority for the government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has to be preserving the objective advantages of our bilateral commerce. Mexico must oppose Mr. Trump\u2019s call for mass deportations of Mexicans. Such a move would not only gravely damage both countries\u2019 economies but further inflame the racial hatred that has become resurgent because of the Trump campaign.Finally, Mexico should make it clear that a severe economic crisis in our country set off by Mr. Trump\u2019s politics would lead to extraordinary instability on the border and an inevitable wave of migration that no wall could conceivably stem.The friendship between our modern countries is a state of mutually beneficial harmony that surely deserves to be preserved. A confrontation should be avoided. But Mexico is not the defenseless country it was in 1846. It has legal means of response to assaults, whether in commerce or migration, diplomacy or security. And it will not stand alone but will find support among key political and economic figures and forces in the United States and in much of the rest of the world. It would be a battle of great ethical significance.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated when and where a photograph of Pancho Villa was taken. Villa was photographed with Gen. John J. Pershing in El Paso, Tex., in 1914, not in Nogales, Ariz., in 1916.Enrique Krauze is a historian, the editor of the literary magazine Letras Libres and the author of \u201cRedeemers: Ideas and Power in Latin America.\u201d This essay was translated by Hank Heifetz from the Spanish.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump May Not Like Alternative Energy, but Investors Should", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersGIVEN what President-elect Donald J. Trump has said about his energy strategy \u2014 he favors coal and wants to end federal subsidies to the clean energy industry \u2014 does it still make sense to invest in wind, solar and other alternative sources of power?The answer is an emphatic yes, according to investment advisers, who say clean energy companies will continue to thrive during a Trump administration, regardless of what the president says or does. The sector has become as much about getting returns on investments and catching the next technological boom as it is about reducing greenhouse gases and helping the environment.And clean energy is creating jobs in every state, not just the ones that have oil or gas in the ground. Even the most politically conservative states, like Kansas and Iowa, are leaders in wind power and are likely to continue investing in it.\u201cNo longer is there a trade-off between what you believe in and what you can make money off of,\u201d said Nancy Pfund, a founder and managing partner of DBL Partners, which made early investments in SolarCity and Tesla.She predicts that investors \u201care going to redouble their efforts to migrate their portfolios to a 21st-century energy economy.\u201d Even without subsidies, she said, alternative energy sources will be well positioned to compete with coal and other carbon spewers.\u201cIt really has to do with the cost of wind, solar and electric cars compared to where we were 12 years ago,\u201d Ms. Pfund said.But the challenge for all investors during the Trump administration and beyond will be to make sure that passions for change and innovation, or anger at environmental policies that favor fossil fuels, do not cloud sound investment analysis.\u201cRecently, people have taken the green mandate and said, \u2018You need to invest in the future,\u2019\u201d said Chat Reynders, the chief executive and chairman of Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, a $1.3 billion asset-management firm. \u201cPeople have chased some investments that weren\u2019t timely or were not quality investments in order to participate.\u201dFor example, back in the 1970s, some investors were eager to back manufacturers of solar panels. But what was then a cutting-edge technology with high barriers to entry is now a commodity, with prices dropping as more manufacturers enter the market. This is good for the consumer, but not great for investors in the panel makers.\u201cYou can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle when it comes to the economics driving solar, wind and battery storage,\u201d said Thomas Van Dyck, managing director in the SRI Wealth Management Group at RBC Wealth Management.\u201cThe economics are such that in California, wind and solar are the cheapest form of power you can put in place,\u201d Mr. Van Dyck said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a long-term investor, you need to look at these long-term trends.\u201dDespite the economic forces lining up behind clean energy, investors and analysts caution that people interested in investing in this area should be prepared for a rough ride in the short term.\u201cIf you\u2019re a long-term investor and looking out five to 10 years, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Mr. Van Dyck said. \u201cIt\u2019s like looking at Intel or Microsoft in the 1990s \u2014 they had some cyclical issues, but look at them today.\u201dR. Paul Herman, the chief executive of HIP Investor, an investment rater and portfolio manager, said investors looking for broad guidance should keep three things in mind. They should look for companies that are trying to save money and reduce risk through clean energy. This is the Walmart example.They should monitor their investments in fossil-fuel producers closely, lest their stocks plummet again as renewable energy gets cheaper and the value of their reserves diminishes. And those with a longer-term investment horizon and a higher tolerance for risk should look for companies focused on energy innovations.The last is the holy grail. Ms. Pfund\u2019s firm, DBL Partners, had great success investing in Tesla and SolarCity, but she said she was not looking to mimic those investments today.\u201cThe last thing I\u2019m going to do is keep investing in the same old, same old,\u201d she said. \u201cThe venture-backed electric car company was a smart investment 10 years ago, but today it\u2019s things like storage \u2014 the batteries in a Tesla or stationary storage \u2014 that are going to play a huge role in the electric grid of the future.\u201dWith storage, the energy created by the sun and wind can be used on demand \u2014 or on cloudy, calm days.Mr. Reynders said he was steering clear of solar panels but liked companies that install the panels. He also said he thought the Trump administration would be good for alternative-energy investment, though not as its cheerleader. If the administration follows through on Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to cut clean-energy subsidies, it could force a shakeout in the industry and prompt investors to pay closer attention to company fundamentals.For investors with a greater appetite for risk, there are certainly longer-term energy investments. One is graphene, a superthin, incredibly strong material that can be used as a conductor. Its promise is for batteries of the future, and probably much more.William Page, portfolio manager for global environmental opportunities strategy at Essex Investment Management, said he saw the potential in investing in graphene but was avoiding it for now.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to invest in a technology that might work in the lab today but it\u2019s not something that is a viable investment today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want something that is profitable today.\u201dLike Mr. Reynders, Mr. Page thinks that companies that install solar panels are a good investment. He also likes LED lighting installation \u2014 not the exactly the sexiest clean energy investment, but one that is environmentally sound and profitable today.At the opposite end of the risk spectrum, Matthew Weatherley-White, co-founder and managing director at the Caprock Group, said people could make alternative energy investments in themselves, as it were.\u201cSay you have $10,000,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to invest in a solar panel company or in a solar array for your house?\u201dOf course, it depends on whether you are a city or country dweller. \u201cIn Idaho, where I live, there\u2019s 6 percent internal rate of return for a solar array, so you get paid back in 18 years,\u201d Mr. Weatherley-White said. \u201cThat might not blow the socks off as an investment, but it\u2019s pretty predictable.\u201dIn places like California, where state policies favor solar power, that rate of return could be three to four times what it is in Idaho, he said. Still, it comes down to a question every investor should ask: \u201cWhere am I going to invest for a positive financial return and an environmental impact?\u201dAnd in the United States, it is the states rather than the federal government that may wield the greatest influence over the clean-energy sector. \u201cWhile the Trump victory for some was disturbing or took the wind out of their sails,\u201d Ms. Pfund said, \u201cthe federal government can only do so much.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It seemed like almost everything that was getting shot in Detroit for a while was a horror movie. We just wanted to show the city the way we saw it growing up.\u201dWith \u201cDetroiters,\u201d which debuts on Feb. 7, they get that chance, not only filming in their hometown but also filling it \u2014 both on and behind the screen \u2014 with a cavalcade of locals.The show follows a pair of small-time admen, Sam and Tim, who are best friends, next-door neighbors and brothers-in-law. Imagine \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d meets \u201cMad Men\u201d \u2014 if Don Draper was wildly goofy and handled accounts for D.U.I. lawyers and hot-tub shops.Mr. Robinson, 35, spent his childhood in Clarkston, a suburb of Detroit; Mr. Richardson, 33, grew up in the Boston Edison district of the city. The two actors met at the now-defunct Detroit chapter of the comedy company Second City. Mr. Robinson, Mr. Richardson\u2019s improv teacher, used to sneak the underage Mr. Richardson into bars; then, both performed on the troupe\u2019s Chicago main stage at the same time. They formed a close friendship, bonding over their shared backgrounds and a highly specific love of a Christmas special with Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby, which they watch together every December.Throughout their peripatetic careers, which took Mr. Richardson to Los Angeles and Mr. Robinson to New York, they have texted with each other daily, vowing that they\u2019d return eventually to their native city to shoot something.When Comedy Central ordered \u201cDetroiters\u201d \u2014 which they created with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alumni Zach Kanin and Joe Kelly \u2014 and agreed to film it on location, the pair made the show as homegrown as possible. (The series pilot benefited from a Michigan state film incentive program, but by the time the series got the green light, new legislation had nixed the initiative.) The bouncy earworm theme song? Written by the artist and sneaker entrepreneur Rick Williams, a high school friend of Mr. Robinson\u2019s, produced by John Jay Henry of Detroit, and sung by Yolanda Williams, Mr. Williams\u2019s wife. The blizzard of cyclist extras in Episode 2? Members of Slow Roll Detroit, a group of biking enthusiasts.Between crew and cast, \u201cDetroiters\u201d hired more than 200 people from the area \u2014 and drafted seven interns from Grow Detroit Young Talent, a city jobs program. The show coaxed Hollywood actors with Detroit backgrounds \u2014 like Keegan-Michael Key, who once taught Mr. Robinson improv \u2014 to guest-star. They spread their shots across Detroit locations both majestic and mundane. A swanky gala scene was set at the Detroit Institute of Art; Mr. Richardson fretted about doing a monologue involving his genitals in front of a Diego Rivera painting. \u201cIt felt like sacrilege,\u201d he said.The most visible local addition is Shawntay Dalon, a Detroit actress who had just moved to Hollywood when she was invited to audition for the show. She recorded her audition in an apartment stuffed with six other actors. A few weeks and a callback later, Ms. Dalon learned she had won the part of the female lead. It was time to go home.The familiarity felt surreal to Ms. Dalon as she began playing Chrissy, who is Sam\u2019s sister, Tim\u2019s wife and an assembly line worker at Chrysler. (In real life, Mr. Robinson\u2019s wife is an electrical engineer for the company.) \u201cWe\u2019d be shooting outside, and across the street, neighbors would be sitting on their porches yelling: \u2018Yeah! That looks funny!\u2019\u201d Ms. Dalon said. \u201cThat used to be me. I could never walk by anything filming.\u201dThe result of all this effort is a show that feels cheerily authentic. Though a creative class of Detroiters has rallied to revive the city\u2019s food, art and fashion scenes, \u201cDetroiters\u201d is more likely to linger on a shot of a middle-class neighborhood or public park than highlight hipster hallmarks of urban revitalization, like microbreweries or gastro pubs. That\u2019s because, as Jason Sudeikis, who plays a Chrysler executive and is one of the executive producers, puts it, the show sees Detroit as a place that draws strength from its past and present as much as from its future. \u201cDetroit\u2019s story is one of falling away and coming back and maintaining,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea behind the show was that notion of hope, the idea of this blue-collar Midwest work ethic.\u201dBut despite the pride friends, family and other Detroiters feel for the city finally getting a loving screen treatment from returning natives, Mr. Robinson noted there is one downside to being a hometown hero of sorts: \u201cMy mom is always like, \u2018You know, it\u2019s your uncle\u2019s birthday on Sunday, and you\u2019re in town.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Aw, man.

{"Headline": "Life on the Farm Draws Some French Tired of Urban Rat Race", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported bySaulx-les-Chartreux JournalSAULX-LES-CHARTREUX, France \u2014 Two years ago, Elisabeth Lavarde decided to quit her office job in Paris and start a new life in Saulx-les-Chartreux, a small town with two butchers and one baker just south of the capital.Ms. Lavarde, 39, is now an apprentice farmer at a 24-acre farm that grows organic vegetables, sold directly to local consumers. New farmers like Ms. Lavarde usually make what they see as a decent salary of about 1,500 euros, or about $1,600, a month, slightly above the French minimum wage.\u201cI wanted a job with more meaning,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I was tilting at windmills.\u201dAlongside the experienced farmer she has been paired with as part of a training program set up by an association that nurtures small-scale farmers, Ms. Lavarde grows around 40 kinds of organic produce, including tomatoes, potatoes, cauliflowers and carrots.As the sun was about to set behind rows of cauliflower plants on a recent afternoon, Ms. Lavarde gazed over the land she cultivates. A few yards away, a large shelter of tarpaulins rippled in the wind. Ms. Lavarde and her farming tutor, Guilain Verg\u00e9, 31, use the shelter to do their bookkeeping and to keep track of their crops on a whiteboard as they wait for authorization from the local government to build a decent barn.It\u2019s all hard work, she acknowledges. But, she says, \u201cSeeing the sky every day, be it blue or gray, it\u2019s amazing.\u201dMore younger people like Ms. Lavarde are making lives as small-scale farmers in France, drawn in some cases by idealistic notions of tilling the land and of getting away from the rat race of the cities. They often leave behind well-paid jobs, as well as relatively comfortable lives that they nonetheless find unfulfilling.Before they can set up shop, however, new entrants have to overcome a range of obstacles, including navigating their way through a labyrinthine bureaucracy that oversees building permits and the distribution of land.But the reality is much bleaker for most farmers, who say they feel constrained by European Union regulations and who have been hit by global competition, shrinking margins and poor harvests in recent years. Generous agricultural subsidies mostly benefit large farms.That dire outlook, however, has not deterred people like Ms. Lavarde from taking up farming, even if established farmers view their efforts with skepticism.Standing near a frozen wheat field near Ms. Lavarde\u2019s farm, Bruno Gilles, 47, a third-generation farmer who grows cauliflowers, tomatoes and other vegetables, was skeptical about Ms. Lavarde\u2019s chances of success, citing narrow margins and competition from farms that produce vegetables year-round.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard,\u201d Mr. Gilles said, his arms folded over a military sweater.The first test for new entrants might be their hardest: finding land.\u201cI find myself to be extremely lucky,\u201d Ms. Lavarde said. \u201cWhen I see other people around me, access to land truly has been an obstacle for them.\u201dSince the 1960s, that access has been tightly regulated through regional agencies that act as intermediaries between land-seekers and those either selling or renting.The agencies have traditionally favored established farmers over new entrants, many of whom grow alternative products based on small-scale organic farming and have modest farming experience.Ms. Lavarde said that when a young farmer she worked with set out to find agrarian land in the area of Saulx-les-Chartreux, she discovered that a tract had been allocated to a conventional farmer without anyone informing her that it was available.At the end of their training period, aspiring farmers have agrarian experience, some money in the bank and mentors to vouch for them when they fill out papers to apply for land.Part of the problem with land allocations is the lack of farms on the market, said Fran\u00e7ois Purseigle, a sociologist at INP-Ensat, an agronomy engineering faculty in Toulouse, in southern France.\u201cWe have guys in the fields that think: \u2018I\u2019m keeping my farm. My children are teachers or doctors, so they\u2019re not going to take over. I have a crummy pension. I\u2019ll still keep that property because, you never know, it could gain in value,\u2019\u201d Mr. Purseigle said in a telephone interview.Vincent Martin shielded his eyes from the sun on a recent morning at a farm near the village of St.-Augustin, about a two-hour drive east of Saulx-les-Chartreux. He said much of his future as a farmer relied on finding agrarian land.\u201cLand is key,\u201d said Mr. Martin 36, a single farmer who made a living selling health club memberships in Paris until he left his job about five years ago, eventually to take up farming.To find agricultural land in the area, he was counting on word of mouth rather than on the regional agencies, despite having filled out piles of application forms.His tutor, Philippe Caron, 58, who took up farming a few years ago, said he and his wife, Anna, would do all they could to help Mr. Martin get started.The other challenge facing new producers is distribution, which for larger, established farms usually involves dealing with middlemen selling products to supermarkets and stores around the country. For small producers, the system cuts deeply into meager profits. The solution has been to find ways of selling directly to consumers, mostly through nationwide networks like the Association for the Defense of Small-Scale Agriculture, known by its French acronym, AMAP.Under one AMAP plan, consumers sign up for a year and get a basket of vegetables, meat, cheese or fruits each week, delivered by a local producer. Prices for a basket range from \u20ac12 to \u20ac24, and customers, by paying in advance, agree to take their share of the risks that come with climatic contingencies.H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rouet, 43, a former logistics manager volunteering in one Paris-based AMAP office, quit her job to live in the country with a local producer. She said customers who took the produce baskets had a unique link to the food. \u201cThe farmer tells us about the difficulties he\u2019s faced; it\u2019s like he\u2019s bringing us his babies,\u201d she said.Even when they\u2019ve found land and distribution, some neo-farmers still find themselves having to commute to their land, whereas older farmers often live on the edge of their fields. New entrants often can\u2019t afford to buy the buildings on their farms, if there are any.Some buy shabby trailers to stay in near their farms or sleep in their cars.Mr. Martin said it sometimes took him over two hours to commute to the farm. He started work at dawn to plow, sow or harvest, depending on the season.\u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d Mr. Martin said, \u201cfor now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should We Trash Cash?", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyThe two retired notes represented 86 percent, by value, of all the cash in circulation in India. To see what a big deal this is, you have to appreciate the nature of the Indian economy. Many Westerners have become so used to discussing China as the most populous country in the world, with 1.357 billion inhabitants, that they forget India is just behind it, with 1.252 billion. Of that total, only 12 million pay income tax. That\u2019s an astonishing number: 99 percent of Indians don\u2019t pay tax. The majority of Indians work in what economists call the \u201cinformal\u201d or \u201cunorganized\u201d economy, which runs overwhelmingly on cash.The short-term result of Modi\u2019s move has been, unsurprisingly, chaos: huge lines at A.T.M.s and banks, farmers unable to buy seeds to plant crops, weddings and property transactions canceled, piles of illicit cash shredded or burned. Some workers have been forced to choose between earning a day\u2019s pay or spending the same day waiting to deposit money in a bank. Many of the poor don\u2019t have bank accounts at all. (This despite an admirable push for financial inclusion on the part of the Indian government, which led to 175 million new bank accounts between 2011 and 2014.) The government has brought out a new 500-rupee note and a new denomination, a 2,000-rupee note, but there isn\u2019t nearly enough of the new cash to replace the old, nor will there be anytime soon.From the outside, you have to wonder what on earth would make it desirable to undertake an experiment of this scale and apparent recklessness. As it turns out, there are good reasons for having doubts about the way cash works in the contemporary economy. In a brilliant and lucid new book, \u201cThe Curse of Cash,\u201d the Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff gives a fascinating and thorough account of the argument against cash. There are two main pillars to it. The first and more wonkish concerns something called the \u201czero lower bound.\u201d Because official interest rates can\u2019t be set below zero \u2014 if they were, people would just hold cash instead \u2014 the tool kit of monetary policy has a built-in limit. This might sound like a small point, but as Rogoff explains, \u201cthe zero bound has essentially crippled monetary policy across the advanced world for much of the past eight years.\u201d Governments want to get money moving in the economy, but in a world awash in paper currency, monetary policy can do nothing further to help. If central banks could go below the zero bound, as a cashless economy would allow, they could in effect force people to spend their money and thereby kick-start the economy.The zero bound, however, is not the issue in India. There, the main focus is the second big argument against cash: that far too much of it is involved in crime. Think for a moment about how much actual physical cash you have. I\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019re a long way below the per-capita amount of dollars in circulation in the United States: $4,200 for every man, woman and child in the country. Eighty percent of that is in the form of $100 bills, which many Americans hardly ever see. Where is all this money? The short and very disconcerting answer is that, in Rogoff\u2019s words, \u201ctreasuries and central banks simply do not know\u201d where this money is.Among students of the subject, the assumption is that this cash is overwhelmingly used for activities that evade tax but are otherwise legal (for instance, paying workers, from builders to babysitters, off the books) but also for outright crime. The \u201cunderreporting of business income by individuals who conduct a significant share of their transactions in cash\u201d is, Rogoff reports, the single biggest contributor to the \u201ctax gap,\u201d the approximately $500 billion annual difference between federal tax voluntarily paid and tax due. The numbers for untaxed criminal transactions are huge, too. One example: Business in the United States for the four main drugs \u2014 heroin, cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine \u2014 is worth $100 billion a year, almost all of it carried out in cash.A million dollars in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds and can fit in a shopping bag. Imagine that a proposal to phase out high-denomination notes was implemented in the United States. If the highest-\u200bdenomination note were $10, that million bucks would weigh 10 times more, take up 10 times as much space and be a lot harder to hide \u2014 and how many legal activities would be disadvantaged as a result? This is why Modi went after cash: The idea was to crack down on what he calls \u201cblack money,\u201d a term encompassing tax evasion and all forms of crime up to and including the use of counterfeit currency to fund terrorism. By the end of 2016, Indians with serious \u201cblack money\u201d (including counterfeit versions of the old bills) had no choice except to either trash it or take it to a bank and explain how they earned it.This Indian experiment is far from over yet, and the initial chaos may well yield to an outcome that feels as if it was worth the trouble. As of late December, it was estimated that nearly 15 trillion rupees had been deposited in banks, out of a total 15.4 trillion rupees outstanding, meaning that 97 percent of the relevant cash was now legal and in the system, an outcome that no doubt exceeds the government\u2019s expectation.I wonder, though, about the wisdom of the anti-cash crusade. The problem with the argument is that it concedes too much power to the modern triple-headed monster of the economy \u2014 the state, the central bank and the banking system. If there is no cash, there is nowhere for the private citizen to hide any assets at all, not just for criminal reasons but simply for financial security. The year 2008 was a reminder of how fragile our banking system is and how all-encompassing financial crisis can be. Merryn Somerset Webb, editor of the financial-advice magazine MoneyWeek, has argued that one of the best things an individual can do, with banks fragile and interest rates low, is buy a good safe and fill it with cash. I have no desire to do that myself, but it is reassuring to know that if I wanted to, I could.The rich have many ways of hiding assets and making them safe from states and from the taxman. As we\u2019ve recently been reminded, some very rich people don\u2019t pay any income tax at all. Cash is one of the few ways in which ordinary citizens can enjoy a tiny taste of the freedom, privacy and security that the rich take as their due. That, for me, is what\u2019s missing in the critique of cash. If there were to be a big, convincing, systemwide drive to tax the hidden assets of the rich, to drag them inside the same norms that constrain the rest of us, to make it clear that we are all playing by the same rules \u2014 well, then maybe we can start to talk about abolishing cash. Until then, we would do well to bear in mind a favorite line of the pro-cash lobby, Dostoyevsky\u2019s observation from a czarist prison: \u201cMoney,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis coined liberty.\u201dJohn Lanchester has written eight books, including the novel \u201cCapital\u201d and, most recently, \u201cHow to Speak Money: What the Money People Say \u2014 and What It Really Means.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Reassures Employees, Without Wholly Rejecting Travel Ban", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byWall Street is an industry built on courting clients around the globe and hiring some of the best and brightest, wherever they may be.Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, issued perhaps the only condemnation by a Wall Street firm of Mr. Trump\u2019s order, saying it was \u201cnot a policy we support.\u201dMr. Blankfein\u2019s carefully worded criticism still stood as one of the sharpest responses from the finance industry, where business is fundamentally about moving money across the globe. Wall Street has deep roots to immigrants. Marcus Goldman, as a case in point, was a German immigrant, as were the Lehman brothers.And Wall Street, perhaps more than any other industry except the technology business, has prided itself on hiring top job candidates from anywhere in the world. That said, some banking executives said it was unclear how much the still-evolving contours of the travel ban would affect their staffs, with some saying relatively few employees appeared to have been affected thus far.Still, the finance sector has had to confront growing nationalist sentiment in the United States and Britain, where the vote to leave the European Union, widely known as Brexit, has threatened to drive out much of that country\u2019s financial industry, which could limit global trade and the flow of both money and qualified employees.\u201cI think it would probably hurt them because they do tend to rely on the best international talent, regardless of where they\u2019re from,\u201d said Charles Geisst, a professor at Manhattan College who has studied Wall Street.But the finance industry has largely been cautious in moving into political controversy outside its focus on regulation.So perhaps it was unsurprising that Mr. Blankfein used a voice mail message sent to employees on Sunday \u2014 a time-honored Wall Street way of delivering firmwide messages \u2014 to criticize the travel ban and note that parts of the executive order had been at least temporarily suspended.In his message, Mr. Blankfein cited Goldman\u2019s business principles, which included the line \u201cBeing diverse is not optional; it is what we must be.\u201dCitigroup\u2019s chief executive, Mike Corbat, told employees in an internal memorandum on Monday that the firm was \u201cconcerned about the message the executive order sends,\u201d and he encouraged finding \u201cthe right balance between protecting the country and its longstanding role as an open and welcoming society.\u201dAnd top officials at the asset-management giant BlackRock, which oversees $5 trillion in investments and counts big Middle Eastern countries as clients, said that while they recognized the need to keep the United States safe, any approach needed to respect the law.\u201cWe, of course, all want to promote security and combat terrorism, but we believe it needs to be done with respect for due process, individual rights and the principle of inclusion,\u201d the executives, including Laurence D. Fink, a founder and the chief executive, wrote.Still, other firms took a more cautious approach, refraining from outright criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. Most companies that issued statements said they intended to focus on helping any affected employees.In an internal memo, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s top executives said that they were both \u201cgrateful\u201d for efforts to keep the United States safe and supportive of diversity. Wells Fargo also posted a statement on its employee website saying that it was still assessing what the executive order meant for its business and employees but that it was \u201ccommitted to fostering a culture of diversity.\u201dBank of America said in a message from its chief executive, Brian Moynihan, that it was working to ensure it had the most accurate information to best help affected employees.The chief executive of Morgan Stanley, James P. Gorman, wrote to his employees, \u201cContinuing to draw on talent from across the globe is a key element of Morgan Stanley\u2019s culture and ultimately to our success in serving our clients.\u201dOther firms, such as Blackstone and TPG, had declined to comment.Here are the various responses that major financial firms have sent to their employees regarding the executive order. (Some have been edited to remove internal company phone numbers.) We\u2019ll update the list with more responses as we collect them.This is Lloyd. The president has issued an executive order that, generally, bans individuals from seven different countries from entering the United States and freezes the broader refugee program. This is not a policy we support, and I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court, and some of the order has been enjoined at least temporarily.If the order were to become or remain effective, I recognize that there is potential for disruption to the firm, and especially to some of our people and their families. I want to assure all of you that we will work to minimize such disruption to the extent we can within the law and are focused on supporting our colleagues and their families who may be affected.Let me close by quoting from our business principles: \u201cFor us to be successful, our men and women must reflect the diversity of the communities and cultures in which we operate. That means we must attract, retain and motivate people from many backgrounds and perspectives. Being diverse is not optional; it is what we must be.\u201d Now is a fitting time to reflect on those words and the principles that underlie them.To: All EmployeesFrom: James GormanWe are closely monitoring developments around the new United States travel restrictions imposed this weekend. While no individual employees were impacted in their travel to date, we are concerned for those individuals and their families who could be impacted and will provide them support as needed.Any employee who has questions about upcoming travel should contact the Global Travel and Security teams.We value immensely the contribution of all our employees from all over the world. Continuing to draw on talent from across the globe is a key element of Morgan Stanley\u2019s culture and ultimately to our success in serving our clients.In light of recent executive orders in the United States regarding immigration policy, we want every one of you to know of our unwavering commitment to the dedicated people working here at JPMorgan Chase. This includes a number of our outstanding employees \u2014 all of whom have adhered to our country\u2019s immigration and employment processes \u2014 who have come to the United States to serve our company, clients and communities.Over the weekend, we have worked to reach out to all JPMorgan Chase employees on sponsored visas who are potentially impacted by the recent orders. We understand the situation is evolving quickly, so if you have any concerns about your own situation and have not been contacted, please reach out to your local immigration specialist or human resources team.With more than 140,000 employees in the United States alone, we are grateful for the hard work and sacrifices made to keep our country safe. At the same time, we understand that our country, economy and well-being are strengthened by the rich diversity of the world around us, where we are dedicated to serving customers and communities in more than 100 countries every day.Thank you.Dear Colleagues,Since the weekend, we have been reviewing the executive order on immigration, as well as statements by administration officials, to assess its impact. As a United States company and the world\u2019s most global financial institution, we are concerned about the message the executive order sends, as well as the impact immigration policies could have on our ability to serve our clients and contribute to growth. We have been advising colleagues who could be affected and will continue to support them and their families.We are proud of Citi\u2019s diversity and the fact that we hail from over 100 countries. We encourage the leaders of the United States to find the right balance between protecting the country and its longstanding role as an open and welcoming society.Dear colleagues,Since Friday, we have been in touch with many colleagues, clients and friends worldwide concerned about the United States executive order restricting travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa.As a truly global company, we are proud of the diversity at BlackRock and proud of the diversity of our client relationships. We have long had valued colleagues and clients in Muslim nations, and, from the earliest days of our company, we have worked hard to build an inclusive culture that welcomes and values the contributions of people from all parts of the world.BlackRock will continue to embrace our values and culture, notwithstanding the challenges created by this order. Indeed, we believe that it is more important than ever that we promote our principles, which we established at the founding of our company 29 years ago, including our commitment to inclusion. We, of course, all want to promote security and combat terrorism, but we believe it needs to be done with respect for due process, individual rights and the principle of inclusion.In addition to the broader implications of this order, we have been working to assess the impact it may have on travel for BlackRock\u2019s employees. At this time, we believe there are relatively few individuals whose travel will be directly impacted, but of course the full implications are still being assessed. We also are closely monitoring the repercussions for United States citizens traveling abroad.As you have likely already seen in news reports, there are protests at many United States airports. Anyone traveling either internationally or domestically should anticipate longer delays getting to or from airports and passing through immigration. If you have any questions or concerns about your travel, please call the Corporate Security hotline 24 hours a day. We will continue to keep you posted as the situation evolves.BlackRock always has and will continue to engage with and welcome people in all parts of the world. That is at the root of who we are and always will be.Larry Fink, chairman and C.E.O.Rob Kapito, presidentJeff Smith, global head of human resourcesOn Friday, President Trump signed an executive order on immigration that includes a provision blocking citizens of seven countries from entering the United States for 90 days \u2014 these countries are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.The company is currently reviewing the executive order and its implications to determine whether it has any direct effect on team members or our business.\u201cWhile we are still assessing what this change means for Wells Fargo, we know that it may have deeply personal implications for team members who may have friends or family affected by it,\u201d says chief administrative officer Hope Hardison. \u201cAs always, Wells Fargo is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion where our team members are encouraged to value and respect others for their differences. These values will continue to be of great importance as we support team members who have been affected by this executive order.\u201dBelow is a message from C.E.O. Brian Moynihan.As a global company, we depend upon the diverse sources of talent that our teammates represent. In view of this, we are closely monitoring the recent refugee- and immigration-related executive order in the United States, and subsequent developments.We are connecting with teammates who may be affected, in response to questions. We also are working to ensure we have the most accurate and timely information to best assist potentially impacted teammates.

{"Headline": "Japan Becomes a Rising Star for the Swiss Watch Industry", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Once considered Switzerland\u2019s biggest rival in watchmaking, Japan is fast becoming its former foe\u2019s best customer.Not only has it overtaken mainland China as the No. 3 market for Swiss watch exports worldwide, but Japan has proved more resilient to the swings of the global economy than Switzerland\u2019s top two markets, Hong Kong and the United States.As the watch trade gathers in Geneva this week for the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, all but forgotten is the fact that Japanese quartz technology decimated the Swiss mechanical industry in the 1970s, putting 60,000 Swiss watchmakers out of work. Instead, Japanese demand for Swiss watches \u2014 along with the question whether the strength of the Japanese yen will help or hurt business \u2014 is expected to be a hot topic at the show, with watch executives eager to focus on positive news amid declining sales.For the first 11 months of 2016, total watch exports dropped 10.4 percent from the prior year to 17.7 billion Swiss francs, or $17.2 billion, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. Exports to Hong Kong plunged 25.9 percent, and those to the United States fell 10.6 percent. The slide in Japan, on the other hand, was a mere 3.9 percent.With several high-profile watch boutique openings in and around Tokyo over the past six months, plus more scheduled for 2017, Japan is emerging as a mature market with room to grow.\u201cWe\u2019re kind of in start-up mode in Japan,\u201d said Steve Amstutz, vice president and chief commercial officer of Parmigiani Fleurier, a Swiss luxury brand expanding its footprint in Japan. \u201cThe market has changed over the past five, 10 years. It went from being an exclusively domestic market to one where there is a travel retail business, meaning overseas foreigners are coming to Japan and buying luxury products from Europe.\u201dThe bulk of those foreigners are Chinese tourists who are avoiding Europe over fears of terrorism. Instead, they are spending their money closer to home, at luxury boutiques in Japan and South Korea. The Japanese have even coined a term for Chinese spending: bakugai, which translates to \u201cexplosive buying.\u201dGuido Terreni, global managing director of Bulgari Watches, said that in 2015, when Chinese tourism peaked, big spenders from China accounted for 10 to 15 percent of the brand\u2019s timepiece sales in Japan.But there\u2019s more to the Swiss watch industry\u2019s increasingly cozy relationship with Japan than hordes of Chinese tourists. In the Japanese, the Swiss have found arguably their most formidable clients. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting market, but it\u2019s a very demanding market,\u201d said the avant-garde watchmaker Richard Mille, who opened a boutique in Tokyo\u2019s Ginza district five years ago and plans to open two stores, in Osaka and Kobe, later this year.\u201cThe Japanese love technical details, so we had to do a lot of literature to explain the concept of the brand,\u201d Mr. Mille added.Elizabeth Doerr, co-founder of the watch blog Quill & Pad, said the Japanese hold a special place in their hearts for the revered independent Swiss watchmaker Philippe Dufour.\u201cThis preoccupation \u2014 a more than 20-year love affair with the man and his work \u2014 is sound proof of what makes the Japanese watch collector community tick,\u201d she added.In 2003, the independent watchmaker Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Journe opened his first boutique in Tokyo. Instead of choosing Ginza, the city\u2019s luxury hub, he commandeered a location on tree-lined Omotesando, in the Shibuya district.Today, when Mr. Journe creates limited-edition timepieces, the Tokyo boutique receives the No. 1 model, \u201cand that always creates a buzz,\u201d he said.That buzz is expected to grow louder as the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games approach.The Swatch Group, owner of Omega, the official timekeeper of the Games, stands to reap the greatest rewards from a beefed-up presence in Japan, and the company has intensified its efforts to woo local buyers.In mid-November, two of the Swatch Group\u2019s luxury brands, Glash\u00fctte Original and Jaquet Droz, opened a new shared boutique in the Nicolas G. Hayek Center, a 14\u2013floor retail hub in Ginza. Inaugurated in 2007 and named for the group\u2019s founder, the building \u2014 designed by the world-famous Japanese architect Shigeru Ban \u2014 is home to seven brand boutiques, including Omega, Blancpain and Swatch, each boasting its own entrance via hydraulic elevators in the lobby.Images of the watch popped up all over social media that night, even though most Japanese buyers still gravitate to wristwatches by Rolex, Omega and Cartier, according to a 2016 consumer awareness survey conducted by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. There are signs, however, that their tastes are evolving.Last fall, Felix Baumgartner, a co-founder of the avant-garde Swiss brand Urwerk, spent two weeks in Japan with his business partner, Martin Frei, and came away feeling optimistic about Urwerk\u2019s potential there. \u201cFifteen years ago, for the Japanese, Swiss mechanical watchmaking had to be traditional,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now contemporary watchmaking is starting to be appreciated and collected.\u201dOne of the biggest challenges facing Swiss watchmakers this year will be the strong Japanese yen, which soared in 2016.\u201cWe are considering lowering our prices in Japan, which brings a whole lot of complexity,\u201d Mr. Amstutz of Parmigiani said. \u201cWe know that major watch brands have made drastic price reductions in Japan in order to be more competitive in the local market.\u201dCompetition is heating up, especially from Japan\u2019s domestic watchmakers. The Tokyo-based Citizen Watch Group, for example, recently announced plans to open its first flagship store on April 20 in a new commercial complex in Ginza. Along with Citizen-branded watches, the store will carry three brands acquired by the group within the past decade: the entry-priced Bulova, the accessible Swiss luxury brand Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant and the prestige watchmaker Arnold & Son.\u201cIt\u2019s the right time to communicate to the Japanese market who we are,\u201d Norio Takeuchi, director of Citizen, said through a translator. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to establish our identity here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His father ran a country store in the Deep South. And he is widely regarded as rigidly honest and inflexible on issues he considers matters of principle. Mr. Trump has meandered across the political spectrum; Mr. Sessions has been a deeply conservative Republican his entire life.But besides their age \u2014 both are 70 \u2014 Mr. Sessions shared one trait with Mr. Trump: He was an outsider, dismissed by much of the Republican Party as a fringe player on all but his signature issue, immigration. The two men unexpectedly bonded over their willingness to buck the establishment and the unlikely hope that lower-middle- and working-class voters would carry a billionaire to the White House.Within days, he could be confirmed as attorney general of the United States.Some cabinet nominees arrive at confirmation hearings with records that require considerable guesswork. Not Mr. Sessions. His rock-ribbed conservatism was forged in the deep poverty and isolation of rural Alabama, sharpened during 16 years as a federal prosecutor and state attorney general and polished as a senator. After one of the most liberal periods in Justice Department history, Mr. Sessions is expected to execute an about-face on the Obama administration\u2019s policies of immigration, criminal justice and \u2014 many critics fear \u2014 civil rights.He argues that immigrants are siphoning billions in welfare payments, committing crimes and snatching jobs from Americans. He has questioned whether the Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States, as the 14th Amendment states, and has insisted that the First Amendment doctrine of separation of church and state has been too broadly interpreted. He declared same-sex marriage an indisputable threat to American culture and once went to court to deny funding for gay student groups. Overreaching by the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, he has said, at times has led to \u201ccivil wrongs.\u201dHe favors stiff, mandatory penalties for drug offenses, believes that the government has grown soft on crime and objects to what he sees as unwarranted criticism of police behavior.Mr. Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, has been a consistent voice for conservative policies for nearly two decades in the Senate. Here are some of his positions on the issues.Mr. Sessions is not a uniquely conservative pick; John Ashcroft, attorney general under President George W. Bush, held similarly strident views. But Mr. Ashcroft was a party stalwart whom any number of Republican presidents might have nominated. Mr. Sessions offers an uncompromising brand of conservatism that combines Christian and small-government values with strains of populism and a willingness to say the unpopular, or even offensive. He speaks to a disenchanted electorate that includes the white, nationalistic fringes of his party. In short, he is a uniquely Trump nominee to lead the Justice Department.To many Trump supporters, he is a rare public servant with the backbone to enforce the nation\u2019s laws strictly, regardless of political consequences. \u201cHe has been the leader of this populist revolt against the political elite,\u201d Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News Network who will be a senior White House adviser, said in February.Critics see Mr. Sessions as a throwback to a bygone South. \u201cHis whole life, he has been on the wrong side of every issue,\u201d said Wayne Flynt, a politically progressive Alabama history professor who has followed his career for decades. On questions about voting, gays and immigration, he said, \u201che has argued to narrow democracy, not broaden it.\u201dThe roots of his ideology, and the combination of independence and tenacity that has carried Mr. Sessions to this point, can be found in rural Alabama, where he grew up.Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III was named after his father, who was named after his grandfather, who was named after the Confederate president Jefferson Davis, his parents once said. Buddy, as he was called, grew up an only child on the ragged edge of Alabama\u2019s famous Black Belt in Hybart, a one-crossing hamlet where his father ran a store. The family lived in a one-story house with no driveway, a small concrete front stoop and a heating system consisting of a fireplace and space heaters.Birmingham had a steel industry. Mobile had a port. But around Hybart, work was limited mostly to logging or farming. Neighboring Wilcox County, home to the nearest town of any size and Mr. Sessions\u2019s high school, then was one of the nation\u2019s poorest. It still is.He learned thriftiness from his parents, who grew up during the Depression. Upon becoming a United States attorney in 1981, he had only $750 in the bank, records show. Friends joke that even after he attained the comfortable life of a senator decades later, he refused to replace an aging car or the outdated kitchen countertops at his home in Mobile.It was an environment that fostered Mr. Sessions\u2019s belief in frugality and self-reliance, bounded by a strict \u2014 if much disputed \u2014 code of what was and was not fair.It also bred, even early on, a skeptic\u2019s eye toward elites. His parents were longtime Republicans in a state that had been run by Democrats since Reconstruction. In high school, as racial politics laid the foundation for the eventual Republican takeover of the South, Mr. Sessions was fascinated by Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s book \u201cA Choice Not an Echo,\u201d a catechism on the split between the Republican Party establishment and its right wing. The book enjoined true conservatives to topple the party\u2019s kingmakers and compromisers, presaging the rise of the Tea Party and Mr. Trump \u2014 and now, Mr. Sessions himself.Unpopular ideas did not faze him, even as a schoolboy. His mother told one reporter, \u201cThat boy could argue with a signpost.\u201d His high school yearbook photo bore the caption: \u201cHe is a host of debaters in himself.\u201dAlabama\u2019s economic struggles helped define his political priorities. As a young man, he watched timber imports eat into local logging jobs, cheaper foreign steel hasten the closing of Birmingham mills, and immigrants take jobs in the fields and chicken processing plants. Most economists say those changes were largely unavoidable as the United States shifted from an economy based on manual labor to one rooted in services and knowledge. But Mr. Sessions saw a threat to the hard-working families he had grown up with, former aides said.To Alabama voters, weary of decades of Democratic back-scratching and scandals, Mr. Sessions seemed a breath of fresh air when he emerged on the political scene in 1994, after 12 years as the top federal prosecutor in Mobile. As the state\u2019s attorney general, his first elective post, he slashed staff, pay, travel, cars and supplies. Republican leaders hoped he would come to the rescue of the former governor, Guy Hunt, who was removed from office after a 1993 ethics conviction. Instead, Mr. Sessions asked a federal appeals court to uphold the conviction.The business-dominated establishment wing of Alabama\u2019s Republican Party is closer to the state\u2019s senior senator, Richard C. Shelby. Mr. Sessions\u2019s political base included rural and suburban working-class and evangelical white voters \u2014 the same constituencies that proved crucial to Mr. Trump\u2019s success in November. \u201cSessions had a Trump movement before there was a Trump,\u201d Professor Flynt, of Auburn University, said.His record as Alabama\u2019s attorney general \u2014 he served just two years before winning election to the Senate in 1996 \u2014 showcases his fiercely conservative views. Mr. Sessions supported reviving chain gangs of volunteer inmates. He defeated a court order that would have directed more state money to schools in poor districts by arguing that a single judge had usurped management of the entire state school system. He supported efforts to tighten identification requirements for Alabama voters and backed a county judge who posted the Ten Commandments in his courtroom and opened court with a daily prayer.Alabama liked what it saw: Seeking his fourth term in 2014, Mr. Sessions was the only United States senator to run unopposed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hide who he is. He\u2019s a conservative guy,\u201d said former Senator Mark Pryor, a Democrat from Arkansas who once led the Senate\u2019s weekly prayer breakfast with Mr. Sessions. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t represent Massachusetts. He represents Alabama.\u201dBut his rigid views and his willingness to buck the Republican leadership isolated him in the Senate. A fervent budget hawk, he was ready with his own spending plan when Republicans captured the Senate after the 2014 elections. But party leaders passed him over for chairmanship of the powerful Budget Committee, leaving him the longest-serving senator without a committee to lead. Former aides describe the decision as payback for Mr. Sessions\u2019s relentless opposition to bipartisan efforts to ease immigration restrictions.Republican purists like the radio host Rush Limbaugh said Senate power brokers were punishing a courageous truthsayer. \u201cThat alone tells you where the Republican leadership mind-set is on this,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said on his program in 2014. \u201cThey want to take out the one primary voice of opposition.\u201dThere is perhaps only one area in which Mr. Sessions\u2019s views are in question. It is the source of his sole setback in four decades of public life and most of the controversy over his nomination.As Mr. Sessions attended his church youth group and worked toward the rank of Eagle Scout in the early 1960s, Alabama was emerging as ground zero of the civil rights movement, the backdrop for violence and bravery since immortalized in museums. But as he has himself suggested, the era\u2019s historic tumult largely escaped him.Segregation permeated the rural Alabama of his youth. As late as 1985, his father told a local paper that he believed in it, although he stressed he was not speaking for his son. Wilcox County High School, where Jeff Sessions was voted senior class president in 1964, was an all-white institution. African-Americans, the majority of county residents, were largely illiterate, living in unpainted wooden shacks insulated with newspapers, their children shunted to squalid schools with no instructional materials.In March of Mr. Sessions\u2019s senior year, demonstrators from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference came to town, demanding that African-Americans be allowed to register to vote. Police officers responded with tear gas and smoke bombs. The same month, state troopers armed with billy clubs attacked African-Americans as they began a historic march in Selma, 35 miles north of Wilcox County High.A few months later, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 opened the polls to African-Americans. The year after Mr. Sessions graduated, the Justice Department pried open the doors of Wilcox County schools for African-American students, winning a court judgment against a school board that had flatly declared that \u201cdesegregation is not good for education.\u201dBy then, Mr. Sessions was a history major at Huntingdon College, a small, all-white Methodist school in Montgomery. He led the Young Republicans club \u2014 maybe a dozen students, including Mary Blackshear, whom he met on a hayride and married soon after graduation. \u201cEven though we were in Montgomery at a time when so much was going on, it was like we were in a little bubble or something,\u201d said Phebe Lee, a college friend and club member.Mr. Sessions co-sponsored legislation awarding Alabama\u2019s civil rights marchers and Rosa Parks Congressional Gold Medals, but he has expressed mixed views about the Justice Department\u2019s enforcement of civil rights. In the mid-1980s, he called the Voting Rights Act, which prohibited racial discrimination at the polls, \u201can intrusive piece of legislation\u201d and said that federal judges of that era \u201ccan be criticized legally for exceeding jurisdiction.\u201dOn balance, he said, the law was necessary, and he voted with every other member of the Senate in 2006 to extend its provisions for another 25 years. But in 2013, after the Supreme Court invalidated one of the act\u2019s core provisions that required Justice Department approval to change election laws in places with histories of discrimination, he called it \u201cgood news, I think, for the South.\u201dMr. Sessions has long accused the department of overstepping its authority by promoting minority rights that conservatives argue have no clear basis in law. \u201cThere is a perception, not altogether unjustified, that this department\u2019s Civil Rights Division goes beyond fair and balanced treatment, but has an agenda,\u201d Mr. Sessions said last year. \u201cThat\u2019s been a troubling issue for a number of years, frankly.\u201dCritics fear such comments presage a rollback in civil rights enforcement. \u201cJeff Sessions is emblematic of too many white Southerners who learned very little from the civil rights movement, except how to be more creative in carrying out an anti-civil-rights agenda,\u201d said Allen Tullos, a history professor at Emory University.Under President Obama, the Justice Department has threatened civil rights lawsuits to force police departments to change policies on the use of force, advocated gay rights and told local school districts to let transgender students use bathrooms that match their gender identity.Advocates and career prosecutors see a shift in the department\u2019s work on gay, lesbian and transgender issues as all but certain under Mr. Sessions. As Alabama\u2019s attorney general in the mid-1990s, he defended a state law barring funding for gay student groups on state college campuses, arguing that their very existence encouraged violation of state sodomy laws. A federal appeals court disagreed, striking down the law as \u201cblatant\u201d discrimination. In the Senate, he voted against making it a federal hate crime to attack people based on their sexual orientation.Mr. Sessions has also questioned the use of consent decrees \u2014 one of the Justice Department\u2019s most powerful civil rights tools \u2014 as \u201can end run around the democratic process\u201d and a dangerous exercise of raw government power. The Obama administration has relied on consent decrees, in which local governments agree to make new policies to avoid battling the federal government in court, to transform police training, improve conditions in prisons and change how officers make arrests and use force.\u201cI think you\u2019ll see the Civil Rights Division go back to its more traditional role in terms of law enforcement,\u201d said Larry Thompson, a former deputy attorney general and longtime friend of Mr. Sessions. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to countenance a police officer shooting someone under color of law, but more than the current administration, he\u2019ll make sure to stand up for law-abiding citizens when one of these unfortunate situations occur.\u201dMr. Sessions\u2019s last nomination to a federal post, a federal judgeship in 1986, foundered over questions by senators of both parties about his commitment to civil rights. Accounts of the nomination battle typically focus on testimony about a string of racially insensitive comments he was accused of making as a federal prosecutor. Those included statements \u2014 which he said were taken out of context but did not deny \u2014 that the N.A.A.C.P. and the American Civil Liberties Union were \u201cun-American\u201d groups that \u201cdo more harm than good.\u201dBut perhaps most crucial to his rejection was his 1985 prosecution of three longtime black community activists on ballot-fixing charges. One was Albert Turner, an adviser to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and one of the Selma marchers attacked by state troopers.In 1984, Mr. Turner, his wife, Evelyn, and Spencer Hogue Jr. were working to elect a black candidate for local office over another African-American who, they believed, was in league with white politicians. A federal grand jury convened by Mr. Sessions\u2019s office charged them with 29 criminal counts for allegedly altering about two dozen absentee ballots without the voters\u2019 consent.Among other concerns, Senator Howell Heflin, an Alabama Democrat who sat on the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, doubted that the case merited the full force of the federal government, Steve Raby, Mr. Heflin\u2019s former chief of staff, said in an interview. Losing the support of a home-state senator proved fatal. It was only the second time in 48 years that a judicial nomination died in committee.Mr. Sessions, who prides himself on methodical preparation, has said he was \u201ca babe in the woods\u201d before the committee. If so, he has learned his lesson: In recent weeks, a string of African-Americans, whom he has recruited, hired and promoted, have come forward to testify to his lack of racial animus.Mr. Sessions is also mounting a vigorous effort to show that he stood up for civil rights as a federal prosecutor. He cites his successful pursuit of two Ku Klux Klan members who in 1981 brutally murdered a black teenager. \u201cThere were a lot of Southern United States attorneys who were not very welcoming to attorneys from the Civil Rights Division in the 1980s,\u201d said Barry Kowalski, the Justice Department attorney on the case and a lifelong Democrat. \u201cAnd he was.\u201dMr. Sessions has also revised a list of the 10 most important cases that he \u201cpersonally handled\u201d as a prosecutor to include four voting rights and school desegregation cases, even though his involvement was minimal, former Justice Department lawyers said.Albert Turner died in 2000. His son and namesake, who is a Perry County commissioner, now defends Mr. Sessions. \u201cHe is not a racist,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI believe him when he says he was simply doing his job.\u201dHis mother, Evelyn Turner, 80, does not. In February, at the congressional ceremony that honored her husband and other Selma marchers, the senator tried to hug her, she said. \u201cBut I said, \u2018No, get off of me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI know he has not changed.\u201dBut in general, he was viewed in the Senate as a bill killer, not a bill sponsor.\u201cPreventing something bad from happening is just as important to him as getting something good done,\u201d said Marcus Peacock, a former senior aide.C-Span played endlessly in his office and, if something disagreeable caught his ear, he summoned staff members to help him craft an immediate response in pencil on a yellow legal pad. \u201cEven if you had meetings, the assumption is you\u2019d be there,\u201d Mr. Peacock said. Then the senator was off to the Senate floor, often to speak to an empty room.A frequent topic was what he saw as the Obama administration\u2019s leniency toward drug offenders. Mr. Sessions served as a federal prosecutor in Mobile in the heyday of the nation\u2019s war on drugs, a time when Congress passed lengthy mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes and the prison population ballooned. He has proudly described himself as a lieutenant in the nation\u2019s drug war.Many politicians now regard that as a period of excessive punishments. The Obama administration \u2014 using clemency, discretion and more lenient sentencing laws \u2014 has undone many of that era\u2019s policies and helped reduce the federal prison population for the first time in decades.But Mr. Sessions believes those long prison sentences produced low crime rates. \u201cIt\u2019s mathematics,\u201d he has said: the more criminals in prison, the fewer on the street. When Mr. Obama likened marijuana to alcohol, Mr. Sessions was \u201cheartbroken.\u201d \u201cThis drug is dangerous,\u201d he said last year, adding, \u201cGood people don\u2019t smoke marijuana.\u201dLiberals may chafe at such rigidity, but Mr. Sessions shares their disdain for the philosophy of \u201ctoo big to jail\u201d \u2014 the notion that prosecutors should consider whether bringing charges against large companies would imperil the economy. \u201cThis is a dangerous philosophy,\u201d he said in 2010 amid Justice Department investigations into the banks at the heart of the financial meltdown. \u201cNormally, I was taught, if they violated the law, you charge them. If they did not violate the law, you do not charge them.\u201dBut no single topic energizes Mr. Sessions more than immigration. In 2013, when the Senate was considering a pathway to citizenship for immigrants, Mr. Sessions spent more time on the Senate floor than its top leaders, aides said. The issue has defined his Senate career and, along with trade, formed his link to Mr. Trump.Soon after his arrival in Washington, Mr. Sessions had received a visit from Roy Beck, an author who had recently formed the group NumbersUSA to advocate reduced immigration. Mr. Beck arrived at Mr. Sessions\u2019s fourth-floor Senate office building prepared to make a sales pitch.Immigrants, here legally or illegally, he said, were taking jobs from American workers. Democrats, because of their Hispanic constituencies, were reluctant to address this, he said. And Republicans were too aligned with big corporations that benefited from immigrant labor. Mr. Beck figured that, as a former prosecutor, Mr. Sessions might be sympathetic at least to the idea that America\u2019s immigration laws should be better enforced.Almost immediately, Mr. Sessions began finishing Mr. Beck\u2019s sentences. He noted with dismay the transformation of Alabama\u2019s poultry industry, which for years had provided jobs \u2014 grueling, punishing work, but jobs nonetheless \u2014 to even the poorest, least-educated workers. \u201cHe saw a work force that was maybe half white, half black become mostly foreign,\u201d Mr. Beck recalled.\u201cThis is what justice is about,\u201d Mr. Sessions told him. \u201cYou don\u2019t put your finger on the scale against the poor person who\u2019s trying to make a living.\u201dSince then, Mr. Sessions has become the most reliable congressional ally of anti-immigration groups.Mr. Sessions has for years heard claims that his views are rooted in a fear of foreigners. He has steadfastly denied it. \u201cIt is not xenophobic but our patriotic duty to defend the integrity of our borders and the rule of law,\u201d he said in 2014.When business leaders said more foreign workers would help the economy, Mr. Sessions mocked them for playing \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d from behind the high fences of their estates. His office was a font of research that he sometimes personally thrust into the hands of fellow senators.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a traditional base of Republican support, strongly supported immigration legislation and went so far as to say that Republicans should not bother running a presidential candidate in 2016 if they did not pass it. \u201cGosh,\u201d Mr. Beck said to Mr. Sessions. \u201cHow far can you go on this?\u201d\u201cHow many votes does the Chamber of Commerce have?\u201d Mr. Sessions quipped.When it became clear that, over his vehement objections, the Senate would pass an immigration bill in 2013, Mr. Sessions helped rally conservative House members to defeat the bill and make sure it would not become law.As attorney general, Mr. Sessions would oversee the hiring of immigration judges and the operation of immigration courts. Though the Department of Homeland Security directly enforces immigration laws, the Justice Department is involved in helping set immigration legal policy and in prosecuting people who return to the country after being deported.\u201cThroughout the debate on comprehensive immigration reform, no one was more anti-immigrant than Jeff Sessions,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cAnd for me that outweighs the fact that he is a colleague and someone that I have worked with well on other issues like trade.\u201dFor years, Mr. Sessions envisioned a day when the Republican Party would shed its big-business, country-club image and become a workers\u2019 party. But his arguments gained little traction. In 2012, he believed, Mitt Romney handed Mr. Obama a second term by failing to appeal to voters earning less than $50,000. By 2015, Mr. Sessions was disillusioned and saw his party in disarray.In a 23-page memo to his colleagues that January, Mr. Sessions said the road to capturing working-class voters was clear: The party, he wrote, had to show how lax immigration policies had stolen their jobs and erased their prospects for moving up the social ladder. \u201cRepublicans cannot win in 2016 without these voters,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand Republicans cannot win these voters unless they prove that they are willing to break from the donor class.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump announced his presidential bid six months later, Mr. Sessions saw a potential political mold-breaker. Within weeks of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign announcement, the two men talked by telephone about trade and immigration.In a 90-minute meeting in the senator\u2019s office in September 2015, Mr. Trump assured Mr. Sessions that he was in the race to win. The senator\u2019s staff shared position papers and a top aide, Stephen Miller, joined the campaign.When Mr. Sessions sent Republican candidates his questionnaire, every candidate except Mr. Trump ignored it.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy\u201d to gain Mr. Sessions\u2019s support, Mr. Trump said after winning his endorsement late last February, just before sweeping a string of Southern primaries. \u201cI put in a lot of work on the subject matter.\u201dBut Mr. Sessions did not waver, even at the lowest points of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. When Mr. Trump was denounced for his anti-immigration rhetoric, colleagues said, Mr. Sessions offered reassurance. He helped craft a crucial immigration speech and prepare for the presidential debates. It was the senator\u2019s idea to bring to the Republican convention people whose family members had been murdered by illegal immigrants, according to Rudolph W. Giuliani, a campaign adviser who credits Mr. Sessions with shaping Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration views.For all that is known about Mr. Sessions, one thing that is unclear is how he will measure up to what he has declared to be a crucial test of an attorney general\u2019s qualifications: the willingness to stand up to the president, who in this case plucked him from obscurity.Critics point to his support for President George W. Bush\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program and Justice Department memos authorizing waterboarding as signs that Mr. Sessions takes a broad view of presidential power.But his supporters point to a track record of insisting on Justice Department oversight and independence. Mr. Sessions chastised the Obama administration for refusing to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, saying that senior Justice Department lawyers should have told the president that they insisted on doing so, as a matter of principle. Mr. Sessions also did not support Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch\u2019s nomination because she stood behind Mr. Obama\u2019s authority to enact immigration policy through executive orders, which he called an abuse of presidential authority.The Justice Department can help the president achieve policy goals, he said, but must stand firm against overreaching.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be prepared to say no,\u201d he said in 2011. \u201cAnd if you do, politicians normally come around. You don\u2019t have to do it publicly. You just tell him, \u2018Mr. President, you cannot do that.\u2019\u201dNow, as Mr. Trump embarks on a presidency in which he promises to remake Washington and dispense with many of its traditions, it will fall to Mr. Sessions to decide if and when to say no. And his reputation for standing up to the powers that be, consequences be damned, may face its stiffest test yet.Emily Bazelon, Campbell Robertson and Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "A Whiff of a New-Car Smell, Just a Page Flip Away", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byWheelsSteve Hayes was 9 when, after a death in the family, his parents sent him to Maine to visit a cousin. To keep their charge occupied, the relatives took him to the local auto dealerships to see the new models.It was the summer of 1946, and America had gone car-crazy as vehicle production resumed after World War II. Pent-up demand for new cars far exceeded supplies, so many models were not available, but prospective customers could at least drop by a dealership for a whiff of new-car smell and a sales brochure to stoke their dreams.\u201cWe visited half a dozen dealerships in and around York, and picked up brochures,\u201d Mr. Hayes, who will soon turn 80, recalled recently. \u201cOne for them and one for me.\u201dThat diversion evolved into a casual childhood hobby, and then a grown-up obsession, with Mr. Hayes amassing some 13,500 marketing brochures. Now, about 71 years after starting his collection \u2014 which chronicles the evolution of motorcars through the 20th century and includes lush illustrations worthy of an art gallery \u2014 Mr. Hayes will sell \u201c99.9 percent of it\u201d at an April 1 auction at Nest Egg Auctions in Berlin, Conn.He still remembers which promotional items he gathered on that first trip: \u201cFord, Chevrolet, Pontiac, Olds, Buick, Cadillac, Plymouth, Dodge, Chrysler \u2014 but no De Soto \u2014 Kaiser-Frazer, and I got the Studebaker folders from the family doctor.\u201d There was even a brochure for Oldsmobile\u2019s Hydra-Matic Drive, one of the first automatic transmissions. (\u201cNothing for your left foot to do!\u201d it promised.)Mr. Hayes is keeping that original cache of postwar handouts along with a few others he can\u2019t let go.A retired travel agent, Mr. Hayes has lived in Manhattan since 1963. Although he has a driver\u2019s license and occasionally rents cars on his travels, he has owned only one \u2014 quite briefly. In 1960, when he was a soldier learning Russian at the Army Language School in California, he bought a 10-year-old Studebaker Champion Starlight Coupe. He had it three months.Mr. Hayes kept his archive of consumerism \u2014 thousands of handouts promising, for most of a century, new and improved automotive wonders \u2014 inside discreet file cabinets and storage drawers in his meticulous four-room high-rise apartment near Madison Square Park. Packed into 70 boxes, the collection arrived last fall at Automobilia Auctions in Connecticut, where the owner, Jerry Lettieri, has spent months taking inventory and dividing the archive into auction lots with a common theme. \u201cIt is a very significant collection, starting in the early 1900s and covering the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Lettieri said.Another collector, Bill Schwartzberg of Flushing, described Mr. Hayes\u2019s hoard as extensive, but added: \u201cIt\u2019s a hobby you can\u2019t complete. There are always items out there that you don\u2019t have.\u201dIndeed, given the global sweep of the auto industry, the 120-plus years of production and the thousands of companies that have made cars, Mr. Lettieri estimated that the total number of auto brochures \u201cis easily into the millions.\u201d Consider, for example, that a checklist circulated among collectors lists 17 distinct promotional items for a single model in a single year, the 1926 Nash.Through the 1950s, Mr. Hayes picked up each new-car brochure every year. By the end of that decade he had begun looking backward, buying vintage brochures from collectors.His earliest item is from 1899, promoting electric vehicles, and he has some of the first Oldsmobile catalogs, circa 1901.

{"Headline": "Is Trump\u2019s Tariff Plan Constitutional?", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAmong the first steps being floated by the incoming Trump administration is a 5 to 10 percent tariff on imports, implemented through an executive order. It\u2019s the sort of shoot-first, ask-questions-later action that President-elect Donald J. Trump promised during the campaign. It\u2019s also unconstitutional.That\u2019s because the path to imposing tariffs \u2014 along with taxes and other revenue-generating measures \u2014 clearly begins with Congress, and in particular the House, through the Origination Clause. When presidents have raised (or lowered) tariffs in the past, they have tended to do so using explicit, if sometimes wide-ranging, authority from Congress.The founders thought about this issue a lot: After all, taxes, as every grade schooler knows, fueled the colonies\u2019 push for independence. So they wrote the Constitution, and its Origination Clause, to give the taxing power to the part of government that is closest to the people, thereby protecting against arbitrary and onerous taxation.Tariffs were a big deal in the early days of the Republic. The framers believed that a tax on imports would be the country\u2019s main source of revenue, and for a while, they were right: For much of the 19th century, tariffs dwarfed other revenue measures in contributing to the federal coffers, with income taxes not rising in importance until the 20th century. Throughout this period and even today, the House has closely guarded its turf over tariffs, and the Senate has uniformly acquiesced in this arrangement.So strong is the connection between tariffs and the Origination Clause that early treaties involving tariffs were implemented with legislation that began in the House \u2014 even though Article II of the Constitution gives the president the power to make treaties (with advice and consent of the Senate).True, tariffs are no longer used to raise money, but to protect domestic industries, and to punish foreign ones. But they unquestionably still produce revenue. And while tariffs on imports are aimed at foreigners, they affect domestic industries that use or compete with imports; they can also have an enormous impact on the overall economy by raising consumer prices. Allowing the executive to circumvent the House to enact otherwise unfavorable tax policies that affect Americans is what the clause is designed to avoid \u2014 that those furthest removed from the people have the ability to tax them.While there isn\u2019t an enormous body of Supreme Court case law on the Origination Clause, what little there is supports the understanding that the clause would cover tariffs. The court\u2019s test seems to set a pretty low bar: While paying lip service to an inquiry of the law\u2019s purpose, the court has instead looked at whether a measure funds the general treasury rather than a specific program \u2014 a hurdle that tariffs, the money from which almost always goes into the general coffers, would easily clear. Whether the tariff exists to raise money or punish bad trade practices is likely irrelevant.Indeed, in cases where the court has analyzed the Senate\u2019s power to amend tariff legislation originating in the House, the court has never questioned that the bills at issue fell within the scope of the clause, thereby implicitly accepting tariffs as \u201cbills for raising revenue.\u201dExecutive orders imposing tariffs would also disrupt the framers\u2019 careful constitutional structure. The House\u2019s origination privilege was meant to appease the large states in exchange for equal, rather than proportionate, representation in the Senate. It also stood as a counterbalance against the special powers over treaties and appointments given to the Senate. Mr. Trump could upend this grand bargain by wresting control over tariff policy from the House (and, indeed, Congress altogether).Mr. Trump would not be the first president to suggest raising revenue by executive action. Last year, President Obama, long criticized for his expansive use of executive authority, eyed unilateral actions on tax matters, with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders voicing support. The taxes at issue then, however, were predominantly to close corporate loopholes. These loopholes were either created by the Treasury or implicated regulatory powers delegated to the agency by Congress, and thus were appropriately in the executive\u2019s wheelhouse.Of course, Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t have to act unilaterally; he has Republican majorities in both chambers that are eager to work with him. One option would be to push for a border adjustment tax, a proposal already being floated in the House as part of comprehensive tax reform, which would forbid tax deductions for imports and exempt exports from taxes.A border adjustment tax is a far better option than tariffs. It would eliminate incentives in the current tax system to manufacture abroad, and to shift income abroad. Unlike a tariff, it aims to be trade neutral, with any changes in consumer pricing of imports and exports being offset by a rise in the dollar. And with strong support in the House, it could be enacted in full compliance with the Origination Clause, lending it legitimacy that a unilateral tariff would lack.Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t need to go it alone in strengthening the domestic economy. He just needs to have the patience to do it in accordance with the Constitution.Rebecca M. Kysar is a professor at Brooklyn Law School.Advertisement"}

The president-elect\u2019s poll numbers, already measurably low by historical standards, do not reflect the degree to which his non-supporters dislike the prospect of his presence in the Oval Office.One might have strongly disliked the policies of Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush or Barack Obama, but in none of those cases were the pre-inaugural opinions of their non-supporters so widely and deeply fueled by feelings of dismay, disgust, trepidation, disrespect, dismissal or outright loathing.Mr. Trump\u2019s administration seems likely to be a deeply divisive one, and he has so far shown more inclination to fan the flames of discord than to ameliorate them.STEVE KOSSNew YorkTo the Editor:As a corporate vice president, now retired, I interviewed scores of applicants for executive positions, and I know talent when I see it.

{"Headline": "Accused of Looting Millions, Son of African Leader Stalls Trial", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byOn Wednesday, a judge decided they would have to wait a bit longer.Three days into the closely watched trial of the president\u2019s son, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, on embezzlement and money-laundering charges, the presiding judge, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Perthuis, agreed to give the defense more time to prepare. The judge rescheduled the trial for June 19.The French authorities used trucks to haul away Mr. Obiang\u2019s luxury car collection in Paris, which included two Bugattis, two Ferraris, an Aston Martin, a Maybach, a Maserati and a Rolls-Royce in 2011, suspecting that he had looted public funds.The next year, they raided a house on the Avenue Foch, near the Arc de Triomphe. A 101-room property, the house is worth $180 million and includes two gyms, a cinema, a nightclub, a hair salon, a Turkish bath and bathrooms with gold- and jewel-encrusted fixtures, along with $50 million in furniture.Prosecutors say Mr. Obiang amassed a personal fortune of around $115 million from 2004 to 2011, which he then used to indulge his expensive tastes. When he served as agricultural minister of Equatorial Guinea, prosecutors say, he used his influence over the timber industry \u2014 the country\u2019s main export after oil \u2014 to line his pockets.If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison, but he is not in France and it is highly unlikely he will serve his sentence.\u201cMore and more states are recognizing that if we do not combat the flow of dirty money, tax evasion and corruption, we threaten the balance of public finances and the real economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the taxpayer that pays the price in the end. There is a historical movement underpinning this trial, which gives it a powerful symbolism.\u201dThe court did, however, rule that the 101-room mansion had the legal status of a diplomatic mission. Judge de Perthuis cited lingering doubt over the legal status of the property as another reason to delay the trial.A family of cocoa field workers just outside Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. The current American ambassador there defends the government of\u00a0Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo against statistics that show a huge gap between the country\u2019s oil wealth and the poverty of the population.According to Mr. Bourdon, the charges have not been supported by some in the French establishment, some of whom have significant economic and political interests in West and Central Africa. Paris remains a favored destination for African leaders, some of whom have made contributions to French political parties.\u201cWe succeeded in braving many obstacles, notably those made by the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office under the mandate of Nicolas Sarkozy,\u201d Mr. Bourdon said, referring to Mr. Hollande\u2019s predecessor as president.He said Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s office had gone along with \u201cthe idea that these heads of state could continue to invest in Paris with total impunity, which they have done since the end of colonialism,\u201d adding: \u201cThis trial is a new paradigm.\u201dMr. Obiang\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Marsigny, disagreed. He said the case represented an undue intervention by French courts in the affairs of a sovereign nation. He also argued that while his client might have acquired a personal fortune, his financial dealings were never illegal in Equatorial Guinea. \u201cHis activities were not illicit \u2014 they were perfectly legal with regards to the laws of his country,\u201d he said in an interview. The Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in Paris did not respond to a request for comment.The United States also investigated the Obiang family\u2019s finances.In November, prosecutors in Switzerland seized luxury cars belonging to Mr. Obiang. And last month, at the request of the Swiss, the Dutch authorities seized Mr. Obiang\u2019s 250-foot, $100 million yacht, named the \u201cEbony Shine,\u201d as it was about to sail to Equatorial Guinea, according to the Swiss publication L\u2019Hebdo. Mr. Obiang said the yacht belonged to his country\u2019s government.An article on Jan. 5 about the rescheduling of the trial of a son of the president of Equatorial Guinea on embezzlement and money-laundering charges transposed two of the son\u2019s names. He is Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue (not Obiang Nguema). The error was repeated in an accompanying picture caption.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trumpism May Not Endure", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorDonald J. Trump enjoyed a rare satisfaction for a newly inaugurated president \u2014 waving goodbye not just to one vanquished rival, but to three.His unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton overcame the 25-year Democratic institution known as Clintonism that dates from her husband\u2019s successful administration in the 1990s. It squashed President Barack Obama\u2019s attempt to secure his legacy, and his party\u2019s fifth victory in seven elections.The new chief executive\u2019s unconventional approach to Republican politics could yet create a durable Trumpism that remakes his party, fueling success beyond his own. But there are early reasons for doubt.America\u2019s partisan struggle pits historically resonant philosophical traditions against each other. Democrats most vigorously champion social and economic equality, Republicans individual liberty and economic freedom. Presidents who alter the competitive balance modernize their parties for changing demographic, economic and cultural circumstances.In the late 19th century, President William McKinley helped Republicans retool for the shift from an agricultural to an industrial economy. With outreach to Catholic immigrants and labor, as the modern-day strategist Karl Rove recounts in a recent book, the former Ohio governor cemented a Republican era that lasted, with the exception of Woodrow Wilson, until the Great Depression.In the late 20th century, Ronald Reagan\u2019s message of lower taxes and smaller government realigned \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d and shattered Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal coalition. Later, Bill Clinton offered a \u201cbridge to the 21st century,\u201d tapping a growing bloc of college-educated baby boomers by offering social tolerance, fiscal moderation and a market-oriented approach to Democratic economic objectives.President Barack Obama built on that by harnessing the power of America\u2019s swelling nonwhite constituency, which has doubled since Mr. Clinton\u2019s 1992 breakthrough. Mr. Obama\u2019s dominance among younger voters \u2014 mirroring that of President Reagan and President Clinton earlier \u2014 alarmed Republicans after his 2012 re-election.\u201cYoung voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the party represents, and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country,\u201d read an \u201cautopsy\u201d commissioned by the party\u2019s chairman at the time, Reince Priebus. \u201cIt is time to smartly change course, modernize the party, and learn once again how to appeal to more people.\u201dMr. Trump did essentially the opposite. He won by maximizing support in decisive states among declining segments of the electorate: older, rural, white, non-college-educated voters. He fared worst among the young.His call to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d appealed openly to nostalgia. More vehemently than other Republicans, the billionaire developer vowed to lift prospects for long-suffering working-class voters in an era of rising inequality.\u201cFor too long, a small group in our nation\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost,\u201d Mr. Trump declared in his Inaugural Address. \u201cPoliticians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.\u201dIn his administration, the new president promised, \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\u201dThe possibility of a durable Trumpism lies in deepening the allegiance of those working-class voters while attracting more nonwhites in a steadily diversifying electorate. \u201cIf he embraces the working class and actually delivers for them, he has potential,\u201d said April Ponnuru, who advocates new Republican approaches at the Conservative Reform Network.Yet the new president\u2019s agenda, like his campaign rhetoric, often looks backward.He aims to revive a coal industry sagging under the weight of competition from cheap natural gas and environmental concerns. That emphasis risks ceding jobs and market share in the growing renewable energy sector to China.President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d trade policy bucks the tide of globalization that has reshaped the world\u2019s economy. His immigration stance jeopardizes Republican hopes of adding Latino support and his quest for increased economic growth, since businesses need immigrants to offset dwindling labor supply as baby boomers retire.Mr. Trump has conspicuously pressured companies to shun less expensive labor overseas and invest in America. If successful, he could help temper some harsher features of 21st-century capitalism by altering corporate cost-benefit analyses. But his strategy could also raise consumer prices and inflame conservatives opposed to government coercion and crony capitalism.It\u2019s unclear how vigorously the new president will confront the \u201ccorrupt establishment\u201d he has condemned. Alumni of Goldman Sachs will run his Treasury Department and National Economic Council.On taxes, he offers Reagan-era prescriptions such as cutting rates on top earners and eliminating estate taxes. Ms. Ponnuru, who advocates a \u201cpro-family\u201d approach focused on lower earners, hopes his past campaign rhetoric eventually tugs him and the party in that direction.Presidents can also modernize their parties through updated campaign techniques. Mr. Rove showed how McKinley\u2019s \u201cfront porch\u201d campaign exploited the growth of late-19-century media. Mr. Trump has blazed a new trail using Twitter.But is that digital pulpit a model for other Republicans without his panache? And more important, is reshaping the Republican Party even on Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda?You wouldn\u2019t know it from his past threats to abandon Republicans if treated \u201cunfairly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that he cares about modernizing his party,\u201d said Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton\u2019s pollster in 1992. \u201cWhat he does seem to be doing is dominating his party.\u201dThat\u2019s indisputable.

{"Headline": "As Trump Orders Wall, Mexico\u2019s President Considers Canceling U.S. Trip", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 When Donald J. Trump called some Mexican immigrants rapists, threatened to deport millions of them and promised to build a wall to keep others out, Mexican officials counseled caution, saying it was merely bluster from an unlikely candidate who, if elected, would never follow through.Now, after just five days in office, President Trump is looking a lot like Candidate Trump \u2014 and the Mexicans are furious.With just a few strokes of the pen on Wednesday, the new American president signed an executive order to beef up the nation\u2019s deportation force and start construction on a new wall between the nations. Adding to the perceived insult was the timing of the order: It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington, and just days before a meeting between the two countries\u2019 presidents.The action was enough to prompt President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico to consider scrapping his plans to visit the White House on Tuesday, according to Mexican officials. In a video message delivered over Twitter on Wednesday night, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto did not address whether he would cancel the meeting, saying only that future steps would be taken in consultation with the country\u2019s lawmakers. Instead, he reiterated his commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people, and chided the move in Washington to continue with the wall.\u201cI regret and condemn the United States\u2019 decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us,\u201d he said.It mattered little to Mexicans whether Mr. Trump\u2019s order would receive congressional approval or the funding required to fulfill it.The perceived insults endured during the campaign had finally turned into action. Decades of friendly relations between the nations \u2014 on matters involving trade, security and migration \u2014 seemed to be unraveling.Calls began to come in from across the political spectrum for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto to cancel his visit, and to respond with greater fortitude to the perceived menace from President Trump. On Twitter, Mr. Trump\u2019s action was referred to by politicians and historians as a \u201can offense to Mexico,\u201d a \u201cslap in the face\u201d and a \u201cmonument to lies.\u201dHistorians said that not since President Calvin Coolidge threatened to invade a \u201cSoviet Mexico\u201d had the United States so deeply antagonized the Mexican populace.\u201cIt is an unprecedented moment for the bilateral relationship,\u201d said Genaro Lozano, a professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. \u201cIn the 19th century, we fought a war with the U.S.; now we find ourselves in a low-intensity war, a commercial one over Nafta and an immigration war due to the measures he just announced.\u201dThe fear of many in Mexico is that Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks will force Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s hand. While the Mexican president has opted for dialogue over confrontation, the building pressure, and perceived slights, could complicate his agenda.That could ultimately lead to disastrous consequences. With Nafta gone, both countries would be likely to suffer significant damage to their economies, and Mexico could see a sharp decline in foreign investment. The United States, meanwhile, might find its southern neighbor far less willing to cooperate on issues of security.Pressure from the political opposition could also color the Mexican government\u2019s response. During a rally, the leftist politician Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador asked for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto to appeal to the United Nations and accused Mr. Trump of \u201cviolating human rights\u201d and of racism.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who ran a close race against Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto for president in 2012, said the actions by Mr. Trump on Wednesday were \u201ca great opportunity for Pe\u00f1a to begin his defense of Mexican immigrants, with steadiness and dignity.\u201dFor a new American president, Mr. Trump is both well known in Mexico and widely disliked. His remarks have unified an otherwise fractious country, where corruption, a shaky rule of law and economic struggles have alienated many and kept them from becoming politically engaged. As Mr. Trump\u2019s promises have begun to materialize into action, the public discourse is changing.Some fear the worst.\u201cDiplomatic relations are ever changing, never static, but there is a real concern that this wall, as a powerful symbol of national resolve, will unleash a blunt, raw nationalism in Mexico,\u201d said Allert Brown-Gort, a professor of international relations at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cIt would be similar to the one the American government is showing, and would undermine all efforts for the relations to go back to their normal state.\u201dThe Trump broadside on Wednesday, coming as the Mexican foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, was to begin preliminary talks in Washington, was a new low in bilateral relations.After Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Mr. Videgaray\u2019s fortunes revived and he became foreign minister. But any hope that his invitation to Washington could be leveraged in Mexico\u2019s favor now seem dashed.Many Mexicans said conciliatory gestures were no longer an option.\u201cIt\u2019s like we are Charlie Brown and they are Lucy with the football,\u201d said Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a former foreign minister. \u201cPe\u00f1a is a weak president in a weak country at a weak moment, but he has to find a way to get some official backbone.\u201dStill, despite the outrage, there was a recognition that the action was more political than substantive, like the wall itself. A meaningful stretch of the United States border is already lined with a wall, and illegal immigration persists.\u201cSymbolic gestures are not going to change the fact that we\u2019re neighbors and that our countries will affect each other in perpetuity,\u201d said Carlos Pascual, a former United States ambassador to Mexico. \u201cWe have no choice but to keep working for better solutions.\u201dOthers took talk of a wall with a grain of salt, figuring Mexican creativity, or ingenuity, would render it useless anyway.\u201cThis is just politics, it won\u2019t upend life in Mexico,\u201d said Ariel Najum, 39, who runs a family business. \u201cYou know how Mexicans are: If they go high, we go underneath, with tunnels.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

In Italy, constituencies that used to routinely back the center-left Democratic Party are turning to the new anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which is Euroskeptic and anti-globalization \u2014 just as some working-class, left-wing voters in France are now looking at the extreme-right National Front.\u201cWe have a population cut in half by globalization,\u201d said Thomas Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, a political science professor at Sciences Po in Paris and the author of \u201cUnhappy Globalization,\u201d who sees the winners and losers of globalization as the axis of European politics.Across Europe, the old Socialist blocs have fractured into smaller parties, partly because their voting bases have changed but also because rampant inequality and the decline of the middle class have created fertile ground for more extreme parties.\u201cOn the left they are trying to stand up for their old core group, industrial workers,\u201d said Steve Coulter, who teaches political economy at the London School of Economics. \u201cBut then there\u2019s another group on the left, who are pro-free trade, L.G.B.T., flat-white drinking, bearded hipsters \u2014 and that\u2019s the middle-class part of their support.\u201dIn Limousin, a relatively poor area of central France best known for the succulent beef from its cattle industry, its yellow apples and its elegant Limoges porcelain, these broader economic forces are evident. Mr. Ducourtioux said that he had voted for Mr. Hollande in the last election, but that this time he was looking toward the National Front, although he stopped short of naming it.\u201cYou have Trump \u2014 who do you think I am going to vote for?\u201d Mr. Ducourtioux said.For years, the regional economy was built on agriculture, manufacturing and small businesses that were subcontractors to larger enterprises like the automakers Renault and Peugeot. And for most of the last 100 years it was a left-leaning stronghold.The Socialist mayor of Limoges, Alain Rodet, served multiple terms until he was toppled in 2014 by a well-known psychiatrist, \u00c9mile-Roger Lombertie. He had no government experience and ran as an outsider (although on the eve of the election he became a member of the mainstream conservative party, now known as the Republicans).In those same local elections, National Front candidates won an unprecedented 17 percent of the votes in the first round, a high figure given the leftist traditions of the area, which was the birthplace in 1895 of France\u2019s leading trade union.In a small storefront office, Vincent G\u00e9rard, a representative of the National Front in the region, said the party\u2019s growth was telling because the left was so entrenched there. His own story is typical of many people in the region. His small electrical supply business once had five employees but now has two, including himself. \u201cEighty percent of my clients were industrial, and in five years I lost all of them,\u201d he said.\u201cThe markets are no longer local,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have gone to Romania, or the Czech Republic, I don\u2019t know exactly. They\u2019re in Europe, but in Eastern Europe.\u201dCompounding the sense of a changing world, even a modest wave of immigration disturbed many local residents. Beginning about six years ago, a small number of sub-Saharan Africans arrived in Limoges, soon followed by bigger numbers of Eastern Europeans.\u201cSo, here in our street, we had principally Bulgarians, afterwards Romanians and then Albanians,\u201d Mr. G\u00e9rard said. \u201cWhy? This I know, because Europe no longer has any borders.\u201dAt the same time, many affluent people began moving to the suburbs for bigger houses and left the city center to older people and newcomers, many of whom were migrants.Mr. Rodet, the mayor who was toppled, said that just weeks before the election, there had been a rumor that an abandoned military base near the center of Limoges would become a home for \u201c3,000 Kosovars.\u201d\u201cIt was not true, but I did not respond quickly enough,\u201d he said, and by then the idea had gained currency.Not all traditional centrist voters are concerned about immigration or dwindling manufacturing jobs. Alexis Mons, a high-tech entrepreneur, has a digital marketing firm, Emakina, which does branding worldwide for companies, many of them high end.\u201cYou have an old industrial base that is very much intertwined with the political milieu in some fashion,\u201d Mr. Mons said. \u201cAll this little world talks to each other, it has its customs, it does business and then a new economy is born, a new economy with start-ups, with people coming from the internet, and that no one foresaw.\u201dThere are now more than 100 high-tech firms just in Limoges, Mr. Mons said, yet few people in the area know about the business park where the companies are.\u201cI have the impression that a good part of the establishment lives wearing the spectacles of the 20th century,\u201d he said. He added that politicians were manipulating the picture so that \u201cin the working-class neighborhoods, there has been a sense of abandonment that pushes people into the arms of the National Front.\u201d\u201cThe world has changed,\u201d he said, \u201cand a certain number of people do not want to see that.\u201dReporting was contributed by Beno\u00eet Morenne and Aurelien Breeden from Paris, Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome, Joanna Berendt from Warsaw, and Stephen Castle from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Falcons, Drones, Data: A Winery Battles Climate Change", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Jackson Family Wines is among California winemakers employing both high-tech and old-school techniques to adapt to hotter, drier conditions.Supported byOn a misty autumn morning in Sonoma County, Calif., Katie Jackson headed into the vineyards to assess the harvest. It was late in the season, and an army of field workers was rushing to pick the grapes before the first rains, however faint, began falling.Ms. Jackson, along with her siblings and mother, owns and operates Jackson Family Wines, one of the largest family-owned winemakers in the country. Best known for its Kendall-Jackson chardonnay, a supermarket staple, the family also produces dozens of other wines on five continents. After decades in the business, the Jacksons are sensitive to slight variations in the weather, and they are convinced of one thing: It is getting hotter and drier, and that could be a problem.As California endures a yearslong drought, the Jacksons, like other winemakers, are grappling with new realities. Grapes, though a surprisingly resilient crop, are ripening earlier. Nights are warmer. Aquifers are running dry.As a result, the region\u2019s wine country has become a laboratory for the reshaping of agriculture nationwide. Because, of course, it\u2019s not just California that\u2019s warming up.The Jacksons are going beyond the usual drought-mitigation measures. They are using owls and falcons, to go after pests drawn by the milder winters. They are finding new ways to capture rainfall. And since fossil-fuel consumption is one of the biggest drivers of climate change, they are trying to become more energy efficient, in part through the use of old-school farming techniques.Wearing jeans, a plaid shirt and hiking boots, her hair pulled back in a loose ponytail, Ms. Jackson, 30, caught a ride with one of the vineyard managers to a hill overlooking the picturesque Alexander Valley, an area that produces some of California\u2019s best wines.At the peak, she stopped to inspect a shed housing the recently-updated belly of the vineyard\u2019s irrigation system. Inside was a new energy-saving variable-frequency drive that allows for more precise, efficient watering.Nearby was a solar-powered weather station. If the sensors decide it has become too cold in the middle of the night (climate change, of course, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always hot), new wind machines will automatically start circulating warm air to protect the vines.Beside that was an owl box \u2014 occupied \u2014 part of an effort to control pests without pesticides. And just below the peak was a man-made reservoir, one of more than 100 added to manage what is any farm\u2019s most precious resource: water.\u201cThe climate has been getting warmer and warmer, and we\u2019re seeing more extremes, from really wet to really dry,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cLittle by little, we\u2019re learning.\u201dSo far the drought has not wreaked havoc on the California wine business. No harvests have been destroyed and quality remains strong. Moreover, many of the Jackson vineyards are in pockets of the California coast that benefit from the cool, humid fog.Already, winemakers in the region are noticing distinct changes that signal a hotter, drier future.\u201cIt used to be there were a lot of nights when it would get 28 and 29 degrees, but now when farmers wake up, they\u2019re less likely to have a mud puddle with ice on it,\u201d said Daniel Sumner, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis. \u201cThe growers are going have to be a little bit more nimble.\u201dAbout a decade later, he released the first vintage of Kendall-Jackson. Aged in French oak barrels \u2014 a rarity for an American wine \u2014 Kendall-Jackson was an instant hit. Mr. Jackson was soon acquiring more vineyards throughout California.Mr. Jackson, who died in 2011, raised his children around the business. Ms. Jackson worked her first harvest cleaning tanks and filters in a cellar. Today, she leads the company\u2019s sustainability efforts, pushing for the use of less water, lower fossil-fuel consumption and more natural farming techniques.In 2008, the company formalized its sustainability program and began measuring its energy and water usage and its greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cThey are leaders,\u201d said Rex Stults, the government relations director of Napa Valley Vintners, a trade group. \u201cBut this is becoming an important topic for just about everybody.\u201dThe clearest sign of the Jackson family\u2019s efforts can be found in the network of more than 100 reservoirs scattered across its vineyards. Some have cost as much as $1.5 million to build.On this morning, Ms. Jackson was visiting a reservoir on the sloping hills of the Stonestreet Estate Vineyards. The property is home to 800 acres of merlot, cabernet and chardonnay grapes, and another several thousand acres of uncultivated land.Though it was late in the summer, the reservoir, which draws groundwater from a well, was still full. Two deer were drinking at its edge. The reservoir is connected to a gravity-fed drip irrigation system that pulls the water down the hills and through the vineyards. It now provides most of the water for the winery, which previously relied on wells and rain.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a really sharp decrease in rainfall,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cHaving these in place meant we were able to have enough water to get us through the year. It\u2019s the biggest thing we\u2019ve done to deal with the drought.\u201dAs California heats up, winemakers are confronting new challenges large and small \u2014 some very small.Mice, voles and gophers love vineyards. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more pest pressures due to warmer winters,\u201d Ms. Jackson said, walking through rows of cabernet grapes. Another emerging issue: Grapes ripen earlier, and swallows and crows are eating fruit before the harvest. \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d she said.That explains the owls. Sixty-eight boxes are occupied by hungry barn owls; during the harvest, a falconer comes to some vineyards every day, launching a bird of prey to scare away other birds with a taste for grapes.The Jacksons have also begun analyzing their crops with increasingly sensitive tools. Ms. Jackson recently installed devices that measure how much sap is in the vines. They transmit the data over cellular networks to headquarters, where software calculates how much water specific areas of vineyards do or don\u2019t need. \u201cData-driven farming,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.The Jacksons are also monitoring their crops using drones equipped with sensors that detect moisture by evaluating the colors of vegetation. The wrong color can indicate nutritional deficiencies in the crops, or irrigation leaks.\u201cPreviously, it would require an experienced winemaker to go and look at the grapes,\u201d said Clint Fereday, the company\u2019s director of aviation. \u201cNow we can run a drone, tag an area of the vines with GPS, and go right to the spot that has a problem.\u201dThe drones have other uses, too. An infrared camera can scan for people guarding illicit marijuana operations on nearby lands.Not all the changes being made on the Jackson vineyards involve advanced technology. Some are simply ancient farming techniques that the drought has made increasingly relevant.Field hands plant cover crops, like rye and barley, between every second row of vines, to help keep the soil healthy. The family is stepping up its composting program. Pressed grapes are composted, then placed beneath rows of vines, since the organic matter is better at retaining moisture than soil.Ms. Jackson\u2019s husband, Shaun Kajiwara, is a vineyard manager for the company, overseeing the grapes that go into many of the upscale labels. Walking through rows of vines that will yield $100 bottles of wine, he said that in recent years the company had begun planting new vines that send roots deeper into the soil, drawing more ground water and requiring less irrigation.The company also began sanitizing the 51,000-gallon tanks it uses to blend chardonnay with ultraviolet light instead of water. There is an elaborate new rainfall capture system. And workers have devised a system to recycle the water used to wash barrels. In total, these efforts are saving 28 million gallons each year in the company\u2019s California wineries.\u201cEach year we\u2019re finding more and more ways to make use of this water that was going down the drain,\u201d said Sam Jamison, the general manager of the label La Crema.Now Ms. Jackson is overseeing an ambitious groundwater recharge project. This winter, the company plans to capture storm water runoff and flood a large, flat vineyard near the La Crema winery. If all goes as planned, the water will seep down and help replenish an aquifer from which the farm draws.All these efforts have put the Jacksons in an enviable position: They have more water than they need.In 2015, Ms. Jackson learned that the Green Valley Creek, an important tributary for the Russian River, was in trouble. Once a healthy stream, the drought had shriveled it to a series of stagnant pools, only occasionally connected by flowing water, adding to problems for the coho salmon, an endangered species. The Jacksons grow pinot noir grapes on a hill near the creek, and maintain a reservoir there; Ms. Jackson offered to release water in a bid to help the fish. Soon PVC piping was rigged up to the reservoir, winding down two miles of hillside to the creek.Pushing away overgrown branches, Ms. Jackson made her way to the creek\u2019s edge, where she met up with David Hines, an in-stream flow specialist with the National Marine Fisheries Services. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like much, but this is an important tributary for coho,\u201d Mr. Hines said. In an eddy no larger than a kiddie pool were three baby coho, a few inches long and not more than seven months old.\u201cThey\u2019re the young of the year,\u201d Mr. Hines said.For Ms. Jackson, it was all of a piece with her efforts to ensure a healthy future for her family\u2019s business. And the family\u2019s efforts are making a difference. Since 2008, Jackson Family Wines has reduced its annual water usage by 31 percent.\u201cMy family knows we aren\u2019t out of the drought yet,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lower snowpack. There\u2019s less groundwater in the Central Valley.\u201dWater conservation can only accomplish so much. Jess Jackson had resisted expanding his winemaking operations to Oregon. The colder northern climate wasn\u2019t nearly as suitable for wine production, he thought, and California\u2019s perfect conditions weren\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon.But since his death, his family has concluded otherwise. Oregon is producing some of the best pinot noirs around. In 2013, the company bought its first winery in Oregon. Last year, it expanded again, buying two properties with tasting rooms and more than 100 acres of planted vineyards outside Portland. Ms. Jackson says the northward expansion is part of the unending search for good wines. But it doesn\u2019t hurt that, in contrast to California\u2019s increasingly hot and dry climate, Oregon is comparatively cool and lush.\u201cOur sustainability efforts are always looking at water security issues,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThe more abundant water in Oregon is nice to have.\u201dOne morning, Ms. Jackson and Mr. Kajiwara climbed aboard the company helicopter and headed north. Below them, fields of marijuana interrupted the rows of vineyards, and golden hills gave way to thick forests.After a 30-minute ride, they touched down next to a new reservoir at the Jackson family\u2019s Pine Mountain property. Situated in Mendocino County, the land is higher in altitude, about 3,000 feet, and was acquired a few years ago for its cooler, wetter climate. The grapes grown here are used to make Capt\u00fbre wines, which sell for up to $140 a bottle.Ultimately, Mr. Kajiwara believes that with the right mix of new rootstocks, cover crops and fortuitous rainfall, some of the Jackson vineyards might not need irrigation at all. \u201cIn a few years, I think we could be dry-farmed up here,\u201d he said. \u201cOur reservoir will just be insurance.\u201dIt is a snapshot of the future for the Jackson family: a vineyard north of traditional wine country, where natural features might offset some of the deleterious effects wrought by climate change. And, in combination with the adaptations Ms. Jackson has put in place, it might just be enough to allow the company to keep making fine wines for many years to come.Advertisement"}

Bombastic, vain and slippery, Mr. Trump played the same small-screen character he has offered the viewing public for years.Presenting himself as the leader of \u201ca movement like the world has never seen before,\u201d he offered no olive branch to the majority of American voters who opposed him. He displayed only petulance and braggadocio in response to issues that dogged him during the campaign.On suggestions that he had business dealings with Russia: \u201cI tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia.\u201d He ducked and dodged when reporters asked whether he or members of his staff colluded with Russia before the election \u2014 one of the most explosive of the charges swirling around him.On his promise to reveal his tax returns, which could prove he has no financial or business ties to Russia: \u201cI\u2019m not releasing the tax returns because as you know, they\u2019re under audit.\u201d He added, \u201cYou know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, O.K.?\u201dOn whether he would maintain sanctions on Russia, for its hacking of the presidential election: \u201cIf Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That\u2019s called an asset.\u201dOn the economy: \u201cI will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.\u201dOn congressional Republicans\u2019 effort to repeal Obamacare: \u201cSo we\u2019re gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff. And we\u2019re gonna get a health bill passed, we\u2019re gonna get health care taken care of in this country.\u201d This would happen, he said, \u201calmost simultaneously.\u201dMr. Trump seemed unaware that Republicans themselves have not settled on a replacement yet, even as they push for repeal. Tom Price, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for health and human services secretary, has proposed a plan that would make health insurance unaffordable for millions of Americans, especially working-class people and those with prior medical conditions.Mr. Trump spoke while standing next to piles of manila folders, props representing his decision to turn management of his business interests over to his adult sons. That half measure will not dispel suspicions about his hidden conflicts as president. By not divesting his businesses, Mr. Trump invites corruption by signaling that corporations and foreign actors have many ways to curry favor with him and his administration through his family.He emphasized that, in his view, he wasn\u2019t legally required to do a thing, presenting his largely symbolic measures as a high-minded sacrifice to the public interest. He bragged that over the weekend he had been offered $2 billion \u201cto do a deal in Dubai,\u201d adding, \u201cI didn\u2019t have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I\u2019m president, which is \u2014 I didn\u2019t know about that until about three months ago, but it\u2019s a nice thing to have.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Sheri Dillon, said that the Trump Organization would do no more new foreign deals, and that domestic deals would \u201cgo through a vigorous vetting process\u201d by an as yet-unnamed \u201cethics adviser.\u201d This leaves in place problematic deals Mr. Trump has with politically connected business people in India, the Philippines, Turkey and elsewhere. She did not explain how the ethics adviser would remain free of coercion, or escape firing if he or she rejected any agreements.Ms. Dillon also said the Trump hotel would donate \"profits\u201d from foreign governments to the Treasury. This arrangement is a fig leaf that fails to address numerous potential violations by Trump-branded real estate developments, golf courses and other businesses. It, like the rest of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, ignores what government ethics officials told Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers: The only way to avoid conflict-of-interest charges is to sell off his businesses and put the proceeds into a blind trust.Mr. Trump closed the news conference with his best \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d scowl. Of his sons, he said, \"If they do a bad job, I\u2019ll say, \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019\u201d His staff and supporters applauded, and the show was over.Advertisement"}

But in one of his last opinions, Justice Scalia supplied a powerful weapon to resist Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for a border wall.But the 2006 law authorizes the secretary of homeland security only to take actions to secure the border that are \u201cnecessary and appropriate.\u201d These are the same words (in the opposite order) the Supreme Court interpreted in Michigan v. E.P.A. As Justice Scalia said, it would not be \u201cappropriate\u201d to \u201cimpose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars\u201d in benefits.Mr. Trump says that Mexico will pay for the wall, implying that the actual cost to the United States will be zero. But the statute doesn\u2019t authorize Mr. Trump to charge Mexico, and Mexico says it will not pay. A judge would therefore give no weight to this argument.The problems that Michigan v. E.P.A. create for Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda extend beyond the wall. Numerous statutes contain similar language requiring agencies to take \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cappropriate\u201d actions, or other language requiring agencies to take into account costs. While the legal details are arcane, Justice Scalia\u2019s ghost may also block Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to eliminate climate regulations and deregulate the financial industry. Courts will look askance at regulators who tell them they want to eliminate regulations that, a few years ago, they insisted were cost-justified. The same rules that apply to regulation apply to deregulation as well.President Trump promises to appoint a Supreme Court justice \u201cvery much in the mold\u201d of Antonin Scalia. And yet Justice Scalia\u2019s cost-benefit jurisprudence may put Mr. Trump in a bind. Applause lines at campaign rallies would not have swayed Justice Scalia and will not impress current judges. If President Trump wants to enact his agenda, he will need to drop the bluster and explain why his policies do more good than harm.Daniel Hemel, Jonathan Masur and Eric Posner are professors at the University of Chicago Law School.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Vie to Be Part of Trillion-Dollar Infrastructure Spending Sprees", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byNew Jersey wants a railroad tunnel under the Hudson River, California wants high-speed rail linking north and south, Florida wants improved seaports, and most everyone wants highways and bridges.President Trump and congressional Democrats have proposed trillion-dollar infrastructure spending sprees, and among their most ardent allies are the nation\u2019s governors, Republicans and Democrats, who cite years of pent-up demand for fixing or expanding old assets and building new ones.\u201cEvery single governor in this nation has roads, bridges, tunnels and airports, and we want to work together, because we need to replace them, and we need to repair them,\u201d Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a Democrat, said on Wednesday at a National Governors Association meeting in Washington.Last month, the Trump transition team asked the governors association to collect wish lists from the states, with an emphasis on \u201cshovel ready\u201d projects that are far enough along in engineering, approval and even construction to begin using the money quickly, and those that enhance national security and economic competitiveness, especially in manufacturing. The president has expressed a preference for partnerships between government and private industry, used in projects like toll roads that can attract private investors with a steady stream of revenue.Forty states and some territories have submitted lists, containing more than 300 projects, to the governors association. The group declined to make the lists public, but several states were willing to describe their submissions.It is far from certain that the building boom will materialize, or that it will be as big as Mr. Trump and others would like. Congressional Republicans blocked President Obama\u2019s plans for a major infrastructure push, which would add to the federal deficit.It also remains to be seen how much resistance fiscal conservatives will offer with a Republican president in office, but some have already balked at the price. Policy makers often treat big-ticket projects that employ thousands of people as short-term stimulus for a sluggish economy, but these are being proposed at a time of economic expansion and low unemployment.The Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has warned against \u201ca trillion-dollar stimulus.\u201d Representative Bill Shuster, the Pennsylvania Republican who leads the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has cautioned that an infrastructure bill will not be considered for a few months, at least, because lawmakers will not take up a program until they figure out how to pay for it.But among governors, infrastructure spending is \u201cone of the few areas where you\u2019re seeing some pretty significant Democratic and Republican agreement,\u201d said Scott Pattison, executive director of the governors association.Enough agreement, in fact, that some Republican governors have overcome their aversion to taxes to pay for transportation projects. In the last three years, 17 states and the District of Columbia have raised their gasoline taxes, and lawmakers in at least nine states, from Alaska to South Carolina, are considering doing so this year.Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, whose office has not yet submitted a wish list, said that he wanted federal money for his state\u2019s seaports, and that he planned to lobby Vice President Mike Pence and Elaine L. Chao, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for transportation secretary.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to invest in things that are going to get you returns,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cWe need to have projects that actually get more jobs.\u201dIn California, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, noted Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure proposal in his annual address to the Legislature, adding, \u201cAnd I say amen to that, amen to that.\u201d\u201cWater was the area where we really felt we had a quality-of-life issue,\u201d he said.Michigan has not yet submitted a list of projects to the president, but a spokeswoman for the governor said state officials specifically discussed with the Trump transition team improvement of the Soo Locks, on an important freight route on the waterway connecting Lake Superior to Lake Huron. That project is also on the Trump team\u2019s tentative list.Iowa is seeking money for locks and dams along the Mississippi River, and flood control in Cedar Rapids, which was hit hard by flooding in 2008 and again last year.Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama, a Republican whose proposals include construction of a six-lane bridge over the Mobile River, as well as water and sewer projects, said he hoped calls for greater infrastructure spending would prevail, even if they faced stiff opposition on Capitol Hill.\u201cWe will have everything ready,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we need is just the funding.\u201dBut he, like other governors, said the states needed a lot of help: \u201cI\u2019m not sure $1 trillion is enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ahead of Theresa May\u2019s Visit, Talk of Trade Deal Is Clouded by Politics", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byIn the world according to President Trump, the United States and Britain are about to make their special relationship great again. Having cast off decades of global niceties \u2014 the United States by putting him in the White House, Britain by voting to leave the European Union \u2014 they can now forge a magnificent future.Mr. Trump is readying proof. As he prepares to host Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain at the White House on Friday, he intends to begin discussions on a free-trade agreement that would deepen commercial ties between their countries.What areas of business could be opened to increased competition tend to be the most politically sensitive: agriculture, government procurement and defense. Legions of lobbyists would mount ferocious battles to preserve the privileges of now-favored industries.\u201cIf President Trump genuinely means \u2018buy American, hire American\u2019 above all else, then there\u2019s going to be very little left to offer other countries,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cThere is no way in hell this is a massive trade deal. It would take massive effort to create a trade deal of even minimal effect.\u201dTrade, it is worth noting, tends to involve trade-offs. Negotiations are politically fraught, because they expose domestic industries to the prospect of greater competition with overseas companies. In exchange, domestic consumers gain access to more and cheaper products.British steak aficionados may cheer the shrinking of steep tariffs that limit the influx of American beef. The British beef industry would probably respond less enthusiastically. It would seek protection, particularly as Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc would eliminate European subsidies for British agriculture. Any proposed opening of agriculture would probaly provoke British opposition to genetically modified crops.British insurance companies may be eager for a greater crack at the enormous American market, but that would be outside the scope of a potential deal. In the United States, the insurance industry is regulated at the state level, meaning the Trump administration would lack the authority to engineer an opening.The biggest impediment to a substantial deal between Britain and the United States is the similarity of the two economies, and especially the importance of financial services on both shores.Opening finance to greater competition would require that British bankers pledge fealty to American regulations. Either that, or the rules would have to be opened and renegotiated by both sides. That might happen in the same way that Mr. Trump might perhaps renounce shiny ties and golf in favor of tie-dye and Zen meditation.For American companies, the appeal of giving something up to gain access to the British market has been diminished by the very thing that makes such a trade permissible: Britain\u2019s looming exit from Europe, known as Brexit.Britain\u2019s inclusion in the European Union and its enormous single market has made Britain a prized center for manufacturing and corporate headquarters for multinational companies. American investment banks have been able to set up shop in London and use these bases to serve clients from Ireland to Romania, as if operating in one country.But once Britain leaves Europe, these benefits would almost certainly disappear, raising endless questions about the future terms of trade across the English Channel.Already, major banks are publicly outlining plans to shift some operations to cities in the European Union, exploring Dublin, Paris and Luxembourg. Already, major multinational companies are expressing reservations about sinking the next investment in Britain.All of this makes a trade deal less compelling, diminishing the stakes, leaving politics as the most meaningful context.Last year, before Britain\u2019s referendum, Mr. Obama visited the country and urged voters to opt for remaining in Europe. He sought to undercut a key aspiration of those urging a break from the bloc \u2014 the prospect that a more independent Britain could strike a free-trade deal with the United States.With Mr. Trump now in the White House, Britain\u2019s place in the queue has effectively been upgraded, a handy development for Mrs. May as she presses ahead with Brexit. She is under pressure to demonstrate that Britain, once liberated from Europe, can harvest bounty via trade with faster-growing, more innovative parts of the globe. A trade deal with the largest economy on earth would presumably check that box.\u201cIt is clearly in the British government\u2019s political interest to show that it can negotiate a free-trade agreement with the United States,\u201d said Stephen Woolcock, a trade expert at the London School of Economics. \u201cThe question is what the economic costs and benefits of such an agreement would be? These would seem to be less clear cut.\u201dIn much of the world, Britain\u2019s decision to abandon the European Union has been construed as a retrenchment of British influence and a disengagement from global affairs. In recent weeks, Mrs. May has labored to displace that notion by describing post-Brexit Britain as a land of dauntless capitalists scouring the planet for fresh opportunities.In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, she described a British exit as \u201ca vote to take control and make decisions for ourselves and, crucially, to become even more global and internationalist in action and in spirit, too. Because that is who we are as a nation.\u201dA trade deal with the United States could be considered evidence to further that case.Mr. Trump could post a deal with Britain on Twitter as proof he is not, despite popular perceptions, a nativist protectionist leading the United States on a retreat from global concerns.In a similar vein, he could use a trade deal with Britain \u2014 even a narrow, economically inconsequential one \u2014 to claim vindication for his encouragement of leaving the bloc. That could resonate with the sort of voters who make up Mr. Trump\u2019s base as well as supporters of Brexit in Britain \u2014 that is, those inclined to blame immigrants for economic afflictions.\u201cTrump can play to his constituents,\u201d Mr. Posen of the Peterson Institute said, people \u201cwho believe that trade deals among white rich people are particularly desirable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S.-Trained Official May Shape China\u2019s Response to Trump on Trade", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Over the last year, Liu He, a soft-spoken, American-educated technocrat, has consolidated his status as President Xi Jinping\u2019s top economic adviser, amassing influence that some believe rivals that of the prime minister.But as his star has climbed, Mr. Liu has struggled to overcome resistance to a program of measured economic liberalization and more open markets that he argues is critical to China\u2019s long-term economic health \u2014 and that is generally favored by Washington.But in a study he oversaw that was published as a book more than three years ago, he argued that China \u201ccannot shoulder excessive responsibility\u201d for reducing its trade deficits with other economies.\u201cPopulist policies adopted by the governments of developed countries are often the instigators of crisis,\u201d he wrote.In the pre-Trump era, Mr. Liu was seen as the kind of Chinese official whom Americans could work with. He advocated China\u2019s adjusting its saving and spending to help the United States recover from the 2008 financial crisis.Mr. Liu was regarded as an insider with a direct line to the top.Now he is widely expected to become the director of the National Development and Reform Commission, a powerful agency where he is currently a deputy director. That promotion would increase his visibility as well as his prospects of becoming a deputy prime minister in 2018, when a new government is formed for Mr. Xi\u2019s second term.Mr. Liu cannot dictate policy unilaterally, but his proximity to Mr. Xi gives him more sway than his bureaucratic-sounding titles would suggest.Beside pressing for a dose of economic liberalization and more room for markets, he has advocated trimming bloated state-owned industry and sought to curtail China\u2019s ever-rising debt.But even as he has gained influence, his ability to push through changes in these areas has been limited. Mr. Xi still calls the shots, and his pledge to revamp the economy jostles alongside his fiercely conservative agenda to restore party control and protect state companies. Mr. Xi\u2019s promises of shaking up industry and reducing debt clash with vows to keep growth ticking.The election of Mr. Trump and his selection of a trade team that seems ready to restrict China\u2019s exports to the United States have only complicated the task ahead for Mr. Liu. The risk of layoffs in export industries, and even just the uncertainty about what lies ahead, will make it even harder to push through changes and may strengthen the hand of bureaucrats who want banks to keep lending heavily to keep businesses humming, regardless of losses.Chinese trade experts with government ties have already hinted that if the Trump administration imposes barriers to Chinese goods, they are ready to retaliate through steps like switching aircraft contracts from Boeing to Airbus, diverting food import contracts to rival countries like Brazil and possibly making it more difficult for Apple to sell iPhones in China.While Mr. Liu and other market-oriented economists may see an argument in principle for lowering some of China\u2019s steep trade barriers, doing so amid the nationalistic backlash that could be provoked by American trade restrictions would be political poison.But Mr. Liu is a savvy player. His response to his agenda\u2019s being sidelined in 2015 offers an intriguing window into his political style and the art of waging policy battles at the top levels of the Xi administration.A set of economic challenges that year \u2014 the stock market tumble in June, a currency devaluation two months later and a significant and unexpected slowing of economic growth \u2014 dampened the appetite for economic liberalization. Policy tensions opened up over the right balance between shoring up growth and imposing overhauls.Mr. Liu began a canny lobbying effort aimed squarely at Mr. Xi.In an apparent bid to win favor, Mr. Liu submitted a long memo in late 2015 praising Mr. Xi\u2019s record in office and arguing that he had a historic mission to transform China, including by making bold economic changes, according to four people who have been told about the document by senior officials. All spoke on the condition of anonymity.While the memo was not made public, Mr. Xi endorsed it by ordering it circulated among the party\u2019s upper echelons.Last May, an article by an anonymous official appeared in People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s main newspaper, warning of the risks of an overleveraged economy. The official, cited only as an \u201cauthoritative person,\u201d accused laggard officials of undercutting reforms by trying to spend their way out of economic malaise, implicitly exempting Mr. Xi from any blame.If rising debt is not restrained, \u201cit will trigger a systemic financial crisis and lead to negative growth and even the evaporation of ordinary people\u2019s savings,\u201d the article said. \u201cThat would be fatal.\u201dOfficials, economists and even reports in the Chinese news media have said the article came from Mr. Liu\u2019s office, and the article echoes phrases and ideas Mr. Liu has used.Still, the results of his campaign have been limited. Beijing disclosed on Thursday that bank loans and other credit rose again last month by more than Western economists had expected, a trend that has continued largely unabated in the eight months since the anonymous article appeared.In nearly any room of senior Chinese officials, Mr. Liu stands out. While most other bureaucrats in their 50s and 60s dye their hair black, Mr. Liu, 64, has gray hair.He also stands out for his American education, a rare qualification among senior Chinese officials. He received a master\u2019s degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and before that he studied business at Seton Hall University in New Jersey.Returning to Beijing, he rose quickly from writing studies of industrial policy as a government researcher to leading the party group that steers economic policy. In 2013, he became a deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, which steers industrial policy.While his response to American trade restrictions is unknown, there is little doubt that a trade war with the United States would amplify the voices of economic nationalism.As Global Times, a nationalistic Chinese newspaper controlled by the Communist Party, put it in an editorial this month: \u201cThere are flowers in front of the China Commerce Ministry gate, but sticks as well, hidden behind the door. Both are waiting for the Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Death Toll From Brazil Prison Riot Reaches 26; Decapitations Are Seen", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The death toll from a riot in a penitentiary in northeastern Brazil rose on Sunday to 26 prisoners, increasing the number of prison killings in the country this year to more than 120.Decapitations and mutilations are common in Brazil\u2019s violent, overcrowded prisons, in which 40 percent of inmates have yet to be sentenced, but the latest wave of brutality has appalled many here.The riot began around 5 p.m. on Saturday at the State Penitentiary of Alca\u00e7uz, 13 miles from Natal, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, and continued until around 7 a.m. on Sunday, when riot police officers took control of the prison.\u201cThe situation of the rebellion is controlled,\u201d said Maj. Eduardo Franco of the Rio Grande do Norte police.On Sunday, the authorities initially said they had found 27 bodies, but the death toll was later revised to 26; Major Franco said there had been a mistake. Many of the bodies were mutilated.The prison has a capacity of 620 but was holding around 1,100 prisoners when the riot began, the authorities said. All of the inmates had been sentenced, Major Franco added.Wilma Batista, the director of the prison agents\u2019 union in Rio Grande do Norte, sent a photograph of two headless, mutilated corpses in a prison yard via a cellphone messaging service and said she had seen many others.\u201cWe are shocked,\u201d she said.With Brazil swamped in recession, President Michel Temer\u2019s government reeling from one graft scandal after another, and a wave of seemingly uncontrollable prison violence, many Brazilians feel they are going back to a darker recent past when crime, corruption and the economy were out of control.\u201cWe thought we had turned that page, and now it is coming back,\u201d said Mauricio Santoro, a professor of international relations and political science at the State University of Rio de Janeiro.The killings reflected the escalation of a deadly gang war that exploded when 56 prisoners were massacred in Manaus, in Amazonas State, on Jan. 1. Four more were killed the next day in another jail in the city.The state authorities attributed the Manaus deaths to the Family of the North, an Amazon drug gang that had attacked prisoners connected to a rival gang, the S\u00e3o Paulo-based First Capital Command, known by its Portuguese abbreviation, P.C.C.The gangs were believed to be fighting for control of lucrative drug smuggling routes. The P.C.C. was for years allied with a Rio de Janeiro drug gang called the Red Command. Last year, the alliance fell apart, leading to a spate of prison killings.On Jan. 6, after the Manaus massacre, 33 prisoners were found butchered at a prison in Boa Vista in Roraima State, in the far north of Brazil. The state authorities said the P.C.C. was behind the killings. Four more prisoners were killed in a third Manaus prison after being moved from the site of the first massacre.The riot on Saturday night began when prisoners linked to the P.C.C. rebelled during visiting hours, Ms. Batista said. They were in a separate prison, Rog\u00e9rio Coutinho Madruga, which is next to Alca\u00e7uz and effectively part of the same complex. She said that just six prison agents were on duty, and that they managed to free visitors before retreating to another block.\u201cThe agents saved the visitors and had to retreat\u201d because prisoners set the block on fire, Ms. Batista said.The escaped prisoners then attacked a block inside the Alca\u00e7uz jail that housed men from another gang, the Rio Grande do Norte-based Crime Syndicate, Ms. Batista said.Since 2015, many of the cells inside Alca\u00e7uz have had no bars, and prisoners wander freely 24 hours a day, Ms. Batista said.Police officers and prison guards managed to stop the killing from spreading further, but electricity to the prison was cut. The police decided to wait until dawn before entering, and they restrained desperate relatives who were trying to get inside.Lincoln Gakiya, a state prosecutor from an organized crime unit in S\u00e3o Paulo State who has specialized in the P.C.C., said its split with the Red Command was behind the crisis. The Rio gang has allied with five other gangs around Brazil, including the Crime Syndicate.\u201cThis war is for the hegemony of the drug trade,\u201d Mr. Gakiya said. \u201cThe prison system is not prepared for this gang war. There is no place to separate the gangs. The system is overcrowded, so the tendency is to get worse.\u201dA cellphone video circulating on social media showed a man with his face covered, brandishing what looked like a machete or a sword, walking among a large number of mutilated bodies in what appeared to be a prison yard. The letters P.C.C. were scrawled in what looked like blood on a wall.Although it was impossible to verify the video, the bodies visible were wearing blue shorts similar to those worn by prisoners shown in local news reports. Grisly videos like this have circulated after all of the attacks.Sublieutenant Eliabe Marques, a police officer and the president of a Rio Grande do Norte state association of police and firefighter sublieutenants, said the dispute between the P.C.C. and the Crime Syndicate had grown worse recently.\u201cIn jail, the prisoner has to join one or other of the gangs, P.C.C. or the Crime Syndicate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a phenomenon that is making the situation in Rio Grande do Norte even more serious.\u201dMs. Batista said the prison agents\u2019 union had warned of potentially explosive conditions inside the prison but had been ignored.\u201cIt is very sad, not just for the butchery, but to see organized crime face the state, the power of the state, leaving more scars on prison agents who suffer psychologically and physically from such a stressful profession,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Volvo S90 Is Very Swedish, and Very Appealing", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byDrivenCHANGE in the auto industry is merciless. Several years ago, more than a few analysts and journalists predicted that Volvo would go the way of Plymouth, Oldsmobile, Mercury and Scion, all shuttered brands. Volvo, once an independent Swedish company, was a part of Ford for a spell, and during that period its designs and engineering grew old. Too little change can be lethal.Then in 2010, Volvo was sold to the Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, a Chinese company. Somehow, Chinese investment has produced the most Swedish Volvos ever. Skoal!Looking more Scandinavian than a trip to Ikea, the all-new S90 sedan starts with a solid foundation. It, like the company\u2019s wildly successful XC90 S.U.V., rides on Volvo\u2019s innovative structural platform, called Scalable Product Architecture, or SPA. The only fixed component is the section from the front axle to the firewall (which separates the cabin from the engine bay). All other points \u2014 the wheelbase, front and rear overhangs and width \u2014 can be lengthened or shortened. Think Lego.Now for Volvo, building many of its vehicles, from the coming midsize S60 sedan to the three-row XC90, starts with a trip to the SPA for the engineers. That saves money. How Swedish.If a luxurious sedan is on your mind, the S90, built in Torslanda, Sweden, should be on the test drive list. Other fresh choices include Cadillac CT6, Mercedes E-Class, and Genesis G80 and G90. BMW\u2019s next generation 5-Series is waiting in the wings. There are always the established Audi A6, Lexus GS and Jaguar XF, too.First, though, the complaints. Today\u2019s luxury cars need more than the standard-size sunroof in the S90. In addition, adjusting the steering wheel location is a manual undertaking, and paddle shifters are M.I.A. Finally, when you floor the throttle, the distant engine note sounds like a 4-cylinder \u2014 because it is.Volvo\u2019s SPA vehicles in the United States use one gas engine for now \u2014 a 2-liter 4-cylinder. Buy a T5 model and it\u2019s turbocharged and has front-wheel drive. The tested T6 adds supercharging to the turbo for 316 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque on specified premium fuel. It also grips with all-wheel drive. Both the T5 and T6 employ an 8-speed automatic transmission. A coming T8 plug-in hybrid version adds an electric motor for even more power and efficiency.Drop the throttle and T6 power moves the S90 like a Viking. There\u2019s no lag, and few will want more oomph. Volvo engineers insist the engine has been exhaustively tested for durability in extreme temperatures.Drive modes adjust the usual steering, throttle and transmission mapping (the rear air suspension mainly self-levels the car). And the S90 is quiet. Body motions are well composed, but this sedan is created for comfort, not canyon road carving.E.P.A. fuel economy of the tested T6 model tested is 22 miles per gallon city, 31 highway. I averaged 23 miles per gallon.Volvo has made great progress with its interiors. Sliding behind the heated steering wheel of the tested top-shelf Inscription model makes every trip a Nordic vacation. The dashboard is cut and sewn. Cabin materials are top-notch. The quality and volume of open pore wood trim might lead to the deforestation of Sweden. Volvo\u2019s orthopedically designed seats (heated and vented in the front) are consistently regarded as the best in the business.The same goes for Volvo\u2019s Sensus user interface. The large touch screen has a clear layout and snappy response, just like an iPad. There\u2019s Apple CarPlay as well.The back seat, with its separate climate zone and heated cushions, will tote three tallish passengers. And while this large car has the trunk space of only a midsize sedan, the seat backs split and fold to add more flexibility for cargo.Volvo\u2019s name isn\u2019t Swedish for \u201csafety\u201d (originally a subsidiary of a ball bearing company, the name is Latin for \u201cI roll\u201d) but it might as well be. Auto braking with pedestrian and large animal detection is standard on all S90s. There may not be moose on your commute, but who knows when a Great Dane might leap out unexpectedly.Also standard is the second-generation Pilot Assist. Put simply, this semiautonomous driving system reads the road stripes and traffic ahead and then controls the throttle, brakes and steering. Leave your hands off the wheel for more than 10 seconds and it scolds you to remain fully engaged. Pilot Assist operates at speeds up to 80 miles an hour, but be careful \u2014 it won\u2019t pay your speeding ticket.Those who own an XC90 with the first-generation Pilot Assist system can have it upgraded for a small charge. Wagon fans will want to wait for the V90 Cross Country being released later this year.It\u2019s quite an adjustment to think that Volvo might be known for luxury and style over safety features. But if the company keeps releasing vehicles like this, that seems bound to happen. The progressive sheet metal, penned by Thomas Ingenlath and his team, was selected by Automobile magazine as Design of the Year.Of course, at $66,105 as tested (T5 prices begin at $47,945), this is not the kind of car for everyone. But it is certainly a sign of change \u2014 and welcome change, at that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Rising Market Now Confronts Heightened Risks", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byThe stock market has continued to reach new highs, troubled only fleetingly by rising interest rates, sluggish corporate earnings and new and uncomfortable political realities.Monetary policy is tightening, government spending is expected to expand substantially, and, as the American presidential election and the vote in Britain to leave the European Union show, trade relations and other ties among nations may be fraying. How those trends progress should go a long way to determining the performance of stocks and bonds as the year moves along.These aren\u2019t the only issues for investors to contend with, either. Economic indicators have perked up \u2014 unemployment in December, reported on Jan. 6, was 4.7 percent, and consumer confidence is near multiyear highs \u2014 but the earnings outlook remains subdued, stock valuations remain high and bond yields are low but rising. Under these circumstances, many investment advisers recommend taking only minimal, reasonably priced risks.\u201cI\u2019m hard pressed to locate any investment where you can make a strong argument that it\u2019s undervalued,\u201d said Joe Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard and head of the firm\u2019s Investment Strategy Group. \u201cJust as the economic environment seems to be improving, the investment environment is more challenging. Investors have more risk in their portfolios than at any time since 1999.\u201dBen Inker, co-head of asset allocation at the GMO investment firm, likewise finds \u201cplenty of things to worry about.\u201dThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index early this month traded at about 26 times the earnings that the constituent companies reported in the previous year, higher than at almost any time in history. One reason that investors are willing to pay so much is that they see even less value in other assets.\u201cThe rest of the world looks scarier than the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Inker said. \u201cWho would want to touch Europe? Who would want to touch emerging\u201d markets? As scary as they may appear, he recommends investing in emerging stock markets as the best of a series of difficult choices. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we have high hopes for the emerging world this year,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they\u2019re priced for a really bad outcome. The U.S. is priced for a really good outcome.\u201dAmerican stocks had a really good outcome in 2016. The S.&P. 500 rose 9.5 percent, to 2,238.83, including a 3.3 percent gain in the fourth quarter.The average domestic stock fund in Morningstar\u2019s database rose 3.3 percent in the quarter and 10.9 percent on the year. Leading the way in the quarter, with double-digit gains, were portfolios that focused on financial services, smaller companies, energy and industrials.Whether managers make the most of it, David Kelly, chief global strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management, finds solid prospects in American stocks this year, more than many of his peers do.He favors sectors most sensitive to rising growth, such as financial services, technology and consumer discretionary stocks.\u201cThe general trend of government policy will be pretty pro-business and much more friendly to the U.S. corporate sector than it has been,\u201d he said. But he said that \u201cthe Republicans may get sidetracked by antitrade rhetoric.\u201dPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has proposed raising tariffs on imported goods, and some Republicans in Congress have proposed changing corporate tax rules to reward exporters and punish importers. Economists generally agree that higher tariffs reduce competitiveness and drive up prices of imported goods, including parts supplied to American manufacturers.Mr. Kelly is also wary of Mr. Trump\u2019s pledges to increase government spending on infrastructure projects.\u201cThere isn\u2019t actually any money in the budget to fulfill his agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cCongress may decide not to worry about it and push up the debt, and we\u2019ll end up with more debt and inflation.\u201dAnd we may have higher interest rates, too. The Federal Reserve raised rates in December, only the second time in a decade. Mr. Kelly expects three, possibly four, increases this year.The more forbidding rate environment may account for much of the run-up in bond yields last year. Yields on 10-year Treasury issues rose to 2.44 percent at the end of December from 1.36 percent in early July, with most of the increase occurring just after Election Day, according to Bloomberg.Bond funds lost 1 percent in the fourth quarter, depressed by the 11.8 percent plunge in portfolios that specialize in long-term government issues. For the full year, according to Morningstar, the average bond fund was up 5.9 percent, helped by double-digit gains in riskier categories like high-yield and emerging market debt.Laird Landmann, co-director of fixed income at the TCW fund-management company, said he saw little to recommend to investors because \u201casset prices are getting out of whack with the economy.\u201dInflation is likely to keep rising, he predicted, perhaps exceeding 2.5 percent this year.His advice is to play it safe and stick with Treasury bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities not issued or guaranteed by the federal government, and bonds issued by American banks.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to buy things after eight years of a credit cycle,\u201d Mr. Landmann said. \u201cWait for it to turn; that\u2019s the discipline of being a value investor.\u201dWhen considering any benefits of spending measures introduced by Mr. Trump and Congress, it\u2019s important to remember that they wouldn\u2019t be spread far and wide. Hope that the global recovery might at last get some legs helped emerging stock markets last year, but they gave back about seven months\u2019 worth of gains in the week after the election, as investors weighed the prospect of Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist campaign language being translated into action.The average emerging market stock fund lost 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter but still gained 9 percent for the year. International stock funds over all fell 2.8 percent in the quarter and rose 4.9 percent on the year.Some of the worst-performing stock markets were in countries on which Mr. Trump has focused. Mexico lost 8 percent in 2016, and the Shanghai Composite index in China was down more than 12 percent, although funds concentrating on China and its surroundings rose 0.7 percent.The president-elect\u2019s outlook \u201cis clearly antiglobalization,\u201d said Rick Schmidt, co-manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets Fund.\u201cTrade is going to have a bigger impact on some markets than others,\u201d he said. \u201cIn emerging markets, clearly there are places where risk hasn\u2019t retreated. Mexico is No. 1, China is No. 2.\u201d\u201cWhether he can implement\u201d his agenda \u201cis one thing, but you have to assume he means it,\u201d Mr. Schmidt added. \u201cIt would be dangerous not to take him at his word.\u201dJust as Mr. Inker prefers emerging markets because the risk they entail comes at the right price, Mr. Schmidt sees some of the best opportunities this year in beaten-down markets like Mexico.Elsewhere, he finds India overpriced, and he is avoiding utilities and Chinese banks, although he likes banks in other countries.Mr. Kelly also sees emerging markets as cheap and therefore good long-term plays, and he likes European stocks over the long haul, too.While emerging markets are appealing to many based on their valuations, Mr. Landmann warned that they may be particularly vulnerable to potential missteps in a Trump presidency.\u201cMarkets are not going to crash necessarily, but you could see crashes in more fragile areas like China,\u201d he said.Mr. Davis, at Vanguard, advised investors to make sure they are globally diversified and not overly dependent on American markets. He also encouraged them to expect less. \u201cOne risk for equity markets for 2017 is they are pricing in 4 percent economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s unlikely; they seem to be discounting risks to free trade.\u201dThe economy has been growing at barely half that rate. \u201cI\u2019m not bearish on the economy,\u201d Mr. Davis said, \u201cbut I think expectations on returns need to be lowered.\u201dMr. Inker also suggested that investors keep their enthusiasm in check.\u201cI would have thought that the prospect of surprising statements coming out of the White House in the form of tweets would generate uncertainty, and markets don\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far the U.S. market has not seemed to mind. We\u2019ll have to see. This is uncharted territory.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Wants to Be a Climate Change Watchdog, but Can It Lead by Example?", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byMemo From ChinaBEIJING \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump has called climate change a \u201choax\u201d created by China and said he would withdraw from the global Paris Agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions.That threat has lent new urgency to a question that has loomed over the agreement since it was signed in 2015: whether China will properly report and submit its carbon emissions data for verification.Under President Obama, American officials worked to pressure China and other developing nations to provide more accurate data, viewing that as a difficult but critical part of establishing clear global benchmarks in climate change policy.China has indicated that it wants to take on a leadership role to promote the Paris Agreement. But if Washington withdraws or lets up on its demands, the incentives for Beijing to do that through greater transparency will be greatly reduced.International negotiators are expected to draw up standards that will apply to both developed and developing countries, unlike the bifurcated reporting requirements of older climate deals. This means that China and India will be compelled to provide the same kinds of information as, say, France and Japan.China, he said, \u201cstill has a long way to improve its transparency system.\u201dBut China\u2019s coal statistics are subject to official corrections and changes, and updates are released just once every five years, when the country conducts an economic census.\u201cOver time, it would be desirable if the reporting systems are improved,\u201d said Glen Peters, a scientist at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research-Oslo. \u201cThe fact that the census leads to 10 percent revisions in such an important commodity is a little worrying.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe U.S., for example, also has revisions, but generally less than 1 percent in the first year and maybe 0.1 percent in following years.\u201dAnother problem is that China has been reluctant to release its own calculations of emissions, so other nations rely on calculations made by foreign scientists.There is \u201cno good reason\u201d China is dragging its feet, said Mr. Li, the Greenpeace analyst.Under the Paris Agreement, countries will have to submit estimates every two years. \u201cInternational forces are quite attractive in terms of putting pressure on improving the transparency system,\u201d Mr. Li said.\u201cIt was mentioned in the Paris agreement that a greater degree of flexibility should be offered to developing countries, and, first of all, funding and technical support should be provided to them to help improve their capacity,\u201d Mr. Xie said.\u201cHow to establish a system of transparency should only be considered on this basis,\u201d he added. \u201cChina is also in such a phase of development.\u201dChina will compile emissions data from four data sources: national and provincial governments, businesses, and a planned cap-and-trade carbon market, said Chai Qimin, a senior director at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation.The different areas of reporting \u201ccan be used to check against one another,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least major discrepancies won\u2019t happen.\u201dMr. Chai and other climate researchers and policy advisers played down how large the carbon market would be by the end of 2017. They said Chinese officials had said only that the market would \u201claunch,\u201d not be fully operational.China has been experimenting with seven regional pilot cap-and-trade markets. Mr. Xie, the climate envoy, said that as of September, the cumulative total turnover of carbon dioxide in those pilot markets was 120 million metric tons, and the cumulative transaction amount had exceeded 3.2 billion renminbi, or $473 million.But some experts say a carbon tax would be a better way of putting a cost on carbon. Other scholars say the pilot programs have suffered from operational problems that could bode ill for the national market.\u201cI estimate that it will surely be launched in 2017, although there will be many difficulties, and the progress is unlikely to be fast,\u201d said Jiang Kejun, a senior researcher at the Energy Research Institute, part of China\u2019s Economic Development Agency. \u201cFor it to truly play a vital role, I think we\u2019ll have to wait until 2019 or 2020.\u201dBut Mr. Li said the five-year energy plans constantly overestimated China\u2019s energy needs. Greenpeace calculations show annual coal consumption dropped in 2016, he said, and \u201cit is hard to see how a 100-million-ton growth of coal would be possible.\u201dVanessa Piao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anthony B. Atkinson, Economist Who Pioneered Study of Inequality, Dies at 72", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Anthony B. Atkinson, an acclaimed British economist who pioneered the study of changes in the distribution of wealth and income, allowing for a better understanding of poverty and inequality, died on Sunday in Oxford, England. He was 72.The author of more than 40 books, Mr. Atkinson was mainly known for his creative and exacting use of empirical methods. But in recent years he also put forward bold policy ideas, like creating a \u201cminimum inheritance\u201d to be distributed on reaching adulthood.Mr. Atkinson\u2019s book \u201cThe Distribution of Personal Wealth in Britain\u201d (1978), written with A. J. Harrison, examined inheritance tax records in Britain between 1911 and 1975 to describe changes in the distribution of wealth. That book and an earlier book \u2014 \u201cShares of Upper Income Groups in Income and Savings\u201d (1953) by Simon Kuznets, which drew on income tax records and national accounts in the United States between 1913 and 1948 \u2014 \"are at the origins of all modern research programs on inequality measurement,\u201d Dr. Piketty said.\u201cAtkinson started studying inequality in the late 1960s, at a time when inequality was at a historical low, when there was relatively little interest in it,\u201d Dr. Saez said in an interview. \u201cThe influence and impact of Atkinson\u2019s work grew as inequality made a resurgence in the 1980s and became a serious problem. He dies when inequality is now very high and growing.\u201dHe suggested giving workers, and labor unions, more power to bargain. He called for an explicit target for reducing unemployment, and guaranteed public jobs at minimum wage for those who seek them. He supported setting a minimum wage at a level sufficient to support basic needs.Among his other suggestions: a guaranteed interest rate on savings, via bonds; higher marginal income tax rates, with a top rate of 65 percent (it is currently 39.6 percent in the United States and 45 percent in Britain); and a progressive, rather than uniform, property tax rate.He was a fellow at St. John\u2019s College, Cambridge, from 1967 to 1971, a professor of economics at the University of Essex from 1971 to 1976, and a professor of political economy at University College, London, from 1976 to 1979.He is survived by his wife, Judith Mandeville; three children, Richard, Sarah and Charles; and eight grandchildren.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Repeal and Compete", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byModern conservatism, at least in its pre-Donald Trump incarnation, evolved to believe in a marriage of Edmund Burke and Milton Friedman, in which the wisdom of tradition and the wisdom of free markets were complementary ideas. Both, in their different ways, delivered a kind of bottom-up democratic wisdom \u2014 the first through the cumulative experiments of the human past, the second through the contemporary experiments enabled by choice and competition.In health care policy, however, conservatives tend to simply favor Friedman over Burke. That is, the right\u2019s best health care minds believe that markets and competition can deliver lower costs and better care, and they believe it even though there is no clear example of a modern health care system built along the lines that they desire.But still \u2014 there is no existing system on a national scale that looks like the health care system that Paul Ryan or Tom Price would design, no wisdom of developed-economy experience that proves that such a system would actually keep overall costs low and prevent too many people from being shut out of insurance markets. So embracing even the smartest conservative Obamacare alternative requires a not-precisely-Burkean leap of faith.The essence of Cassidy-Collins, and the reason that many Republicans don\u2019t like it, is that it isn\u2019t actually a full Obamacare replacement. Instead, it\u2019s a federalist compromise. It lets individual state governments decide whether they want to stick with Obamacare or not, which would mean that the law would remain intact in most blue states for the time being, while redder states would have the opportunity to turn roughly the same amount of money (95 percent) to a different end.That end would look like one of the more plausible conservative alternatives to Obamacare: a subsidy to cover the cost of a catastrophic health insurance plan, plus a directly funded health savings account to cover primary care.This system could be layered on top of the existing Medicaid expansion, replacing only the Obamacare subsidies and exchanges, or it could replace the Medicaid expansion as well, offering the poor and near poor the same \u201ccatastrophic insurance plus a subsidy\u201d as everyone else in the individual market. Either way the individual mandate would disappear, but people would be auto-enrolled in a catastrophic plan (with the option to opt out), meaning that coverage would be nearly universal (thus fulfilling one of President Trump\u2019s various promises) even though its benefits would be less comprehensive than Obamacare\u2019s.Taken as a whole, this approach distills both the promise and the peril of conservative health care policy. The promise is that by having people pay for more of their health care in cash and by giving them more freedom in what plans they\u2019re allowed to buy, you would end up with less spending, lower prices and less cost inflation. (And you wouldn\u2019t need the heavy, innovation-squashing price controls that single-payer systems use to get there.)The peril is that there would be too wide a gap between what the money in your health savings account covers and what you need before your catastrophic coverage kicks in. In which case many people with consistent health care costs for chronic problems would rack up impossible medical bills in short order.The extremely serious problems we are seeing now are within the one system that Obamacare created from scratch, the exchange system. That system may not survive, and its condition has a lot to teach us about the problems with liberal health economics. But it is a much smaller system than anyone thought it would be at this point, about half the size that C.B.O. projected, so that the effects of any failure it suffers are likely to be more contained than anyone might have expected.This containment means that conservatives have room and time to be more patient, cautious and experimental than were the Obama Democrats before them. If the Obamacare exchanges aren\u2019t ultimately going to work out, then allowing them to persist in liberal states while an alternative system gets set up in red states is a reasonable way to gradually transition from the liberal model toward the conservative one. If the right\u2019s wonks are right about health policy, the Cassidy-Collins approach should \u2014 gradually \u2014 enable conservatives to prove it.And if the right is wrong, if its model doesn\u2019t match reality, if people are simply miserable as health care consumers because the system has too much of Friedman and not enough of Burke \u2014 well, in that case both the country and conservatism will be better off if we learn that via a voter rebellion in 10 right-leaning states, rather than through a much more widespread backlash against a nationwide health-insurance failure. (Which is something a president with a high self-regard and poor approval ratings might have a particular reason to avoid.)Between this reasonable case and legislative reality, of course, falls a variety of shadows. But more than for the various repeal-and-replace alternatives? I\u2019m not so sure.Right now the Cassidy-Collins compromise has few enthusiastic backers. In a few months, however, it might turn into conservative health care reform\u2019s best hope.Advertisement"}

A law passed in 2014 prohibits local jails from holding immigrants any longer than required by criminal law, with exceptions for violent and other serious crimes. And most counties in the state also prohibit holding immigrants beyond their sentence if federal immigration agents do not have a judicial order. And legislation currently making its way through the Legislature would further expand the law, by prohibiting all state and local law enforcement agencies to respond to requests from immigration authorities.The mayors of San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Berkeley released a joint statement vowing to keep their existing policies in place. Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, who has long shied away from the term sanctuary city, said the Police Department would continue its four-decades-old policy that prohibits officers from questioning people for the purpose of determining their immigration status and arresting them for illegal entry to the United States.\u201cWe all want a nation of laws, but we are also a nation of immigrants,\u201d Mayor Garcetti said in a brief interview.How the executive order will play out over the next several years remains murky.\u2022 What obstacles could the federal government face to cutting off funds to sanctuary cities?Trump will face massive political resistance and challenges in the courts. The Supreme Court has made clear it is the exclusive function of the federal government to enforce immigration laws. Coercing states and localities to perform these functions would also be constitutionally suspect under the 10th Amendment, which safeguards states\u2019 rights.\u2022 How painful could the cuts be?The president has not identified the source of funds at issue. Nor has an amount been specified. He has indicated that he plans to revive a program, commonly known as 287(g), that could provide additional funding to localities that partner with immigration authorities. But participation in the program is voluntary and known to divert resources from local law enforcement priorities.\u2022 How would sanctuary jurisdictions be defined?The president\u2019s order doesn\u2019t say. Trump has suggested he defines them as jurisdictions that fail to honor immigration detainers. However, federal courts have found that such detentions violate Fourth Amendment protections against unlawful search and seizure.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Each year from December through March, colonies of northern elephant seals gather on beaches to perform their birthing and mating rituals.Mr. Menke, 73, leads field trips at Piedras Blancas.

{"Headline": "Lagos Slum Was Razed for Its Waterfront, Residents Say", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byLAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 Dazed and wearing a blood-spattered undershirt, Blessing Dacodonu sat on the floor of a clinic propped above a murky lagoon, wondering where his brother was.The men had been walking past a demolished slum on their morning commute when a mob wielding machetes attacked them, making them the latest casualties in a scramble for land in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest city, that sometimes turns violent. Mr. Dacodonu escaped with cuts to his forehead and a badly swollen eye. But in the chaos, he said, he and his brother were separated.Residents and local activists say the police and a group of young men razed the slum, Otodo Gbame, a poor fishing community on the shores of a lagoon in Lagos, in early November. During the demolition and for a few weeks after, they say, havoc ensued. The mob set houses on fire, as many as 30,000 people were displaced, and anyone who resisted leaving was attacked. A community activist says at least 10 people died in the clashes.The same fate has befallen other slums in Lagos, according to Megan Chapman, a founder of the Justice & Empowerment Initiatives, a nonprofit that monitors land rights in Nigeria. State governments and developers have been descending on these settlements recently, clearing them out to make way for development.Lagos is the commercial capital of one of Africa\u2019s largest economies. Its population, an estimated 21 million people, is thought to grow by thousands each day. The new arrivals, from elsewhere in the country, hope for more opportunities in Lagos. But often they end up no better off than before; in Nigeria, two-thirds of the population lives in poverty.Those who cannot afford to live in the city\u2019s luxury high-rises or even the many rundown housing developments wind up in places like Otodo Gbame, a cluster of wood and sheet-metal shacks behind stylish houses in Lekki.Activists decried the demolition of Otodo Gbame as an officially sanctioned land grab done at the behest of an influential family.The demolitions may have also violated international law, said Leilani Farha, the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to housing, who called the violence that accompanied the settlement\u2019s leveling \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201dMs. Chapman, whose organization investigated the Otodo Gbame demolition, said that when the mob attacked the settlement in early November, it set fire to houses, sending people fleeing in boats onto the lagoon.The community leader called the police to help, but when officers arrived, they started shooting in the air to disperse residents, according to activists and Celestine Ahisu, a resident who witnessed the clashes.Mr. Ahisu said that rather than put out the fires, the police arrested more than two dozen people and later returned with a bulldozer, flattening hundreds of structures, including the community\u2019s mosque and two churches.A teacher and paralegal in the community, Kunnu Paul, said at least 10 people died in the chaos. Most drowned in the lagoon, but two children were trapped in a burning shack.A state government spokesman, Steve Ayorinde, has since denied, however, that local authorities had anything to do with the destruction or the ensuing violence.But the demolition did not come out of nowhere. Weeks earlier, the state governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, pledged to clear Lagos of the packed shantytowns that line its waterways, saying the settlements are havens for criminals.There was then an international outcry over the proposed demolitions and an order from a judge barring the state from carrying out its plan.It proved futile.Activists have accused an influential family \u2014 the Elegushis \u2014 of being behind the demolition of Otodo Gbame. The Elegushi family is a landowning dynasty whose property includes large parcels in the city\u2019s Lekki suburb. The family also has ties to the state government.\u201cThey want the land,\u201d said Sani Mohammed, coordinator of policy and advocacy for the Nigerian federation of the Shack Dwellers International, an advocacy group for people living in poor communities.Ms. Chapman said the Elegushis began claiming two years ago that they had the rights to the land under Otodo Gbame. There have been attempts to resolve the dispute in court, but they have proved inconclusive.The family has argued that it had received a court order granting it a title to the land, according to a statement from the family\u2019s spokesman that was released to the local news media.In the statement, the family blamed fighting within the community for the violence connected to the demolitions. Residents dispute that.Weeks after the demolitions, Mr. Ahisu, a resident who witnessed the initial clashes, watched from afar as a crowd scavenged valuables from the wreckage of their former dwellings.He and other residents said they feared being attacked if they intervened.\u201cWe are worried because we don\u2019t have the police protecting us,\u201d Mr. Ahisu said. \u201cOur life is not safe here.\u201dOtodo Gbame has existed for perhaps a century, said Mr. Paul, the teacher and paralegal in the community, but the people living there do not have full legal rights to the land.People without the complete paperwork for the land they are occupying are easily pushed off, said Ed Keazor, a property rights lawyer who has litigated cases in Lagos.\u201cIn Nigeria, if you have low-income squatters in the property, rather than getting a court order, you just get the police to get them out,\u201d Mr. Keazor said. \u201cIt\u2019s not strictly legal, but it\u2019s done.\u201dMs. Chapman\u2019s organization, which petitioned a police unit based in the capital to investigate the violence, has argued that the police in Lagos have been co-opted by the Elegushis. Shortly after officers based in the capital, Abuja, detained two members of the family suspected of organizing the violence, a separate group of officers based in Lagos tried to arrest six Otodo Gbame residents who had been meeting with the family\u2019s representatives.The Otodo Gbame residents are now suing to gain title to the land. But Nigerian courts are notoriously slow, and the slum\u2019s entrance remains guarded by armed men who attack lone travelers, like Blessing Dacodonu and his brother Yemajlo Ferdinend.Mr. Ferdinend was taken captive by the attackers for three days and beaten before being reunited with his brother Blessing, Mr. Mohammed said.The brothers had lived in Chisco Ikate, a neighboring shantytown where many say they are fearful they will be the next targets of the bulldozers. They have since moved to a community miles from Otodo Gbame, where they hope they can live safely.slide showslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Michigan, a Fight Over the Future of a Fabled Trout River", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byPursuitsThe greatest sign posted at a public fishing access spot in the United States is on the South Branch of the Au Sable River at a place called the Mason Tract. It reads: \u201cSportsman slow your pace \u2026 ahead lies the fabled land of the South Branch. Here generations of fisherman have cast a fly on one of the great trout streams of America. Hunters, too, have roamed these hills in the solitude so bountifully offered. The land is rich in tradition and stands ready to renew your soul. Tread lightly as you pass and leave no mark. Go forth in the spirit of George W. Mason, whose generous gift has made this forever possible.\u201dMy car was parked in front of the sign. I leaned against the hood as I kicked off my wet waders. I had spent a couple of hours fly fishing there and it was a satisfying afternoon, one that thousands of other anglers have experienced on this river. However, there is great worry about the health of the Au Sable, and many people believe the river is threatened by, of all things, more trout.It\u2019s in the form of a fish farm in Grayling, a nearby city. A hatchery was built there in 1914. It was operated by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources back when trout were regularly stocked in the river. When the Au Sable produced sustainable populations of wild trout, the stocking ceased and the hatchery was taken over by Crawford County, which ran it as a seasonal tourist attraction that was difficult to keep in the black.In 2012, the county approached Dan Vogler, a fish farmer, who said he had figured out how to make it a profitable enterprise. It was a decision that would eventually polarize the community and land Mr. Vogler in court.I drove back into Grayling. The river runs through the heart of this town. It runs past Camp Grayling, the largest National Guard training center in the country.It flows past the elementary school, through backyards, next to downtown and eventually out into the country.The Grayling hatchery is right in town, next to the health care center. The gate was locked but from the bridge I could oversee the Au Sable as it flowed into the raceways, a network of regular concrete canals blocked with metal grates that keep the trout in but allow the Au Sable to flow through and out.Nobody was at the hatchery when I visited, but I later spoke with Mr. Vogler by phone. He lives in Harrietta, Mich., about 75 miles away, where he runs Harrietta Hills Trout Farm, also a flow-through hatchery, on Slagle Creek, a tributary of the Manistee River. It, like the Au Sable, is considered one of the best trout rivers east of the Rockies.In 2001, Mr. Vogler and his father bought a private fish farm in Harrietta, which he says is about the same size as the Grayling hatchery. At first, they sold trout to people who wanted to stock their ponds, but now their primary business is growing and selling trout to restaurants and grocery stores.\u201cIt is a discharge permit that does allow for the controlled release of a certain amount of nutrient from our facility, but it\u2019s also an amount that has been determined by the Department of Environmental Quality to be nonharmful to the receiving waters,\u201d Mr. Vogler said in an interview.\u201cAnd of course, that\u2019s where the argument starts. That\u2019s been the thing that\u2019s resulted in a rather lengthy hearing in an administrative law court,\u201d he said, whose ruling he is still awaiting.\u201cHow much fish I produce is in a lot of ways irrelevant,\u201d Mr. Vogler said, explaining that his permit controls how much waste from the fish can be discharged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I raise one fish or one million fish, I cannot exceed those limitations. It\u2019s a hard limit. Thou shalt not discharge more than this.\u201dMr. Vogler is 47, the father of six and a Scoutmaster. He chuckles that he has been described as an aquaculture version of corporate Big Ag. \u201cWe\u2019re a small family business,\u201d he said. \u201cI sit in my office with my dad and our office assistant literally back-to-back in the basement of my house. That\u2019s our world headquarters.\u201cI\u2019ve got dirt under my fingernails, calluses on my hands, and we work hard every day to produce a healthy, affordable, local, fresh food product for people to eat. How does one have local food if one does not allow local production?\u201dI got a tip from a local guide to head to the Ralph A. MacMullan Conference Center, a rustic lodge south of Grayling, on the shore of Higgins Lake. He said a lot of \u201criver people\u201d would be there that night.Mr. Greenberg said that an expert for the anglers\u2019 group indicated that in the summer, the river was already running at levels that exceeded limits for dissolved oxygen set by the State Department of Environmental Quality. \u201cSo any additional phosphorus would only prove detrimental,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me it boils down to: We know this is the most valuable brown trout fishery in the state and this is the largest fish farm. With no great reason economically to do the fish farm, why are we risking the Au Sable fishery for a few jobs?\u201dCrawford County requires Mr. Vogler to have liability insurance for accidents and property damage, but his opponents say that isn\u2019t enough. They want a performance bond in place in the event the river becomes degraded and restoration work needs to be done.\u201cIf you hold up a bottle of Au Sable river water, it\u2019s going to look a lot like a bottle of Evian,\u201d he said. \u201cYou hold up a bottle of agricultural runoff, I wouldn\u2019t want to drink it, but boy you could grow some pretty damn big tomatoes.\u201dThe tomato-enriching water Mr. Partlo refers to contains phosphorus, a universal element in plant growth. In agriculture, phosphorus often comes in the form of animal manure that is later used to enrich farm fields. The effect on an aquatic environment is no different. Before the Clean Water Act, the City of Grayling dumped sewage into the river, which temporarily made the fishing even better, with heavy hatches of insects and fattened trout.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want that?\u201d Mr. Partlo continued. \u201cHere\u2019s what else we know: It\u2019s an artificial fishery. The fishing went through this for a while and everything was fine and all of a sudden, we get this massive weed growth in the right conditions in the summer. That takes the dissolved oxygen out of the water and you get massive fish die-offs.\u201d In those times, more trout would be stocked back into the river, he said, \u201cso then it becomes an artificial fishery.\u201dThe trout are wild. That is a point of pride among anglers on the Au Sable. Much of the river is considered a naturally reproducing trout fishery. There is some stocking near the town of Mio under a dam. The fish get big there. The spot is nicknamed the \u201ctrophy waters,\u201d but purist fly anglers stick upstream to pursue the wild ones.\u201cWhen you catch an old brown trout, he hasn\u2019t been caught since he was 10 inches long and now he\u2019s the crafty old giant whitetail of the woods,\u201d Mr. Partlo said. \u201cYou did something. It\u2019s wild. You\u2019re part of nature. You beat them at their game. That\u2019s what we stand to lose and that\u2019s the problem.\u201cYou don\u2019t stand to lose the fishery. I\u2019d be just as busy. I\u2019d lose a lot of customers, but I\u2019d have a whole bunch more that came in that don\u2019t even care. But that\u2019s not what the Au Sable is about.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d move,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019d literally move away.\u201dThat afternoon, I fished with Terry Warrington on the North Branch of the Au Sable. Huge explosions thundered in the distance. It was like the beginning of \u201cRed Dawn\u201d and rural America was under attack and Terry and I were out fly fishing amid the opening salvos of World War III.\u201cSounds like the National Guard is doing some training over there,\u201d he said as he waved his fly rod past the tree line. The camp is a large contributor to the local economy. Grayling has little industry and poor soil for agriculture. There is limited logging in the forests cut many times over.In 1998, Mr. Warrington retired from teaching biology and chemistry at Michigan Tech and he and his wife moved to the Grayling area to be close to the Au Sable. At 76, he still fishes the river almost daily.In the air were the blue-winged olives, mayflies no bigger than a speck of fuzz. Mr. Warrington cast his zero-weight fly rod \u2014 one of the smallest rods manufactured \u2014 toward a seam of rising trout.His line and rod snapped tight and a small brook trout splattered the water. He brought it in and released it.\u201cSo many people suffer from big fish-itis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that they forget what they are out there for and that is for fun.\u201dFor the next hour, we took turns casting to the feeding trout. I lost count how many I caught, maybe five or six, and I missed plenty of others.\u201cYou were asking about that fish farm,\u201d Mr. Warrington said. \u201cAs you can see now there are hardly any weeds. I remember 40 years ago there were so many weeds you couldn\u2019t even fish. If phosphorus gets into this river it will turn it into a weed bed. And without this river, Grayling wouldn\u2019t exist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "President Obama\u2019s Farewell Address: Full Video and Text", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byPresident Obama delivered his farewell address in Chicago on Tuesday. The following is the complete transcript, as provided by the Federal News Service.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s good to be home!(APPLAUSE)Thank you, everybody!(APPLAUSE)Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Thank you so much, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s good to be home.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)We\u2019re on live TV here, I\u2019ve got to move.(APPLAUSE)You can tell that I\u2019m a lame duck, because nobody is following instructions.(LAUGHTER)Everybody have a seat.My fellow Americans, Michelle and I have been so touched by all the well-wishes that we\u2019ve received over the past few weeks. But tonight it\u2019s my turn to say thanks.Whether we have seen eye-to-eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people \u2014 in living rooms and in schools; at farms and on factory floors; at diners and on distant military outposts \u2014 those conversations are what have kept me honest, and kept me inspired, and kept me going. And every day, I have learned from you. You made me a better president, and you made me a better man.So I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties, and I was still trying to figure out who I was; still searching for a purpose to my life. And it was a neighborhood not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills.It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.(CROWD CHANTING \u201cFOUR MORE YEARS\u201d)I can\u2019t do that.Now this is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, and they get engaged, and they come together to demand it.After eight years as your president, I still believe that. And it\u2019s not just my belief. It\u2019s the beating heart of our American idea \u2014 our bold experiment in self-government.It\u2019s the conviction that we are all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.It\u2019s the insistence that these rights, while self-evident, have never been self-executing; that We, the People, through the instrument of our democracy, can form a more perfect union.What a radical idea, the great gift that our Founders gave to us. The freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat, and toil, and imagination \u2014 and the imperative to strive together as well, to achieve a common good, a greater good.For 240 years, our nation\u2019s call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation. It\u2019s what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny, pioneers to trek west, slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom.It\u2019s what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the Rio Grande. It\u2019s what pushed women to reach for the ballot. It\u2019s what powered workers to organize. It\u2019s why GIs gave their lives at Omaha Beach and Iwo Jima; Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 and why men and women from Selma to Stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well.(APPLAUSE)So that\u2019s what we mean when we say America is exceptional. Not that our nation has been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change, and make life better for those who follow.Yes, our progress has been uneven. The work of democracy has always been hard. It has been contentious. Sometimes it has been bloody. For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back. But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some.(APPLAUSE)If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history \u2014 if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9-11 \u2014 if I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens \u2014 if I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high.But that\u2019s what we did. That\u2019s what you did. You were the change. The answer to people\u2019s hopes and, because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.In 10 days the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy. No, no, no, no, no. The peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected President to the next. I committed to President-Elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.Because it\u2019s up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face. We have what we need to do so. We have everything we need to meet those challenges. After all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on earth.Our youth, our drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours. But that potential will only be realized if our democracy works. Only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people. Only if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interests help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.And that\u2019s what I want to focus on tonight, the state of our democracy. Understand democracy does not require uniformity. Our founders argued, they quarreled, and eventually they compromised. They expected us to do the same. But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity. The idea that, for all our outward differences, we\u2019re all in this together, that we rise or fall as one.There have been moments throughout our history that threatened that solidarity. And the beginning of this century has been one of those times. A shrinking world, growing inequality, demographic change, and the specter of terrorism. These forces haven\u2019t just tested our security and our prosperity, but are testing our democracy as well. And how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids and create good jobs and protect our homeland.In other words, it will determine our future. To begin with, our democracy won\u2019t work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity.(APPLAUSE)And the good news is that today the economy is growing again. Wages, incomes, home values and retirement accounts are all rising again. Poverty is falling again.(APPLAUSE)The wealthy are paying a fair share of taxes. Even as the stock market shatters records, the unemployment rate is near a 10-year low. The uninsured rate has never, ever been lower.(APPLAUSE)Health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years. And I\u2019ve said, and I mean it, anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we\u2019ve made to our health care system, that covers as many people at less cost, I will publicly support it.(APPLAUSE)Because that, after all, is why we serve. Not to score points or take credit. But to make people\u2019s lives better.(APPLAUSE)But, for all the real progress that we\u2019ve made, we know it\u2019s not enough. Our economy doesn\u2019t work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class, and ladders for folks who want to get into the middle class.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s the economic argument. But stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic idea. While the top 1 percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income, too many of our families in inner cities and in rural counties have been left behind.The laid off factory worker, the waitress or health care worker who\u2019s just barely getting by and struggling to pay the bills. Convinced that the game is fixed against them. That their government only serves the interest of the powerful. That\u2019s a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics.Now there\u2019re no quick fixes to this long-term trend. I agree, our trade should be fair and not just free. But the next wave of economic dislocations won\u2019t come from overseas. It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good middle class jobs obsolete.And so we\u2019re going to have to forge a new social compact to guarantee all our kids the education they need.(APPLAUSE)To give workers the power...(APPLAUSE)... to unionize for better wages.(CHEERS)To update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now.(APPLAUSE)And make more reforms to the tax code so corporations and the individuals who reap the most from this new economy don\u2019t avoid their obligations to the country that\u2019s made their very success possible.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)We can argue about how to best achieve these goals. But we can\u2019t be complacent about the goals themselves. For if we don\u2019t create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.There\u2019s a second threat to our democracy. And this one is as old as our nation itself.After my election there was talk of a post-racial America. And such a vision, however well intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent...(APPLAUSE)... and often divisive force in our society.Now I\u2019ve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say.(APPLAUSE)You can see it not just in statistics. You see it in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum. But we\u2019re not where we need to be. And all of us have more work to do.(APPLAUSE)If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and an undeserving minority, then workers of all shades are going to be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves.(APPLAUSE)If we\u2019re unwilling to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don\u2019t look like us, we will diminish the prospects of our own children \u2014 because those brown kids will represent a larger and larger share of America\u2019s workforce.(APPLAUSE)And we have shown that our economy doesn\u2019t have to be a zero-sum game. Last year, incomes rose for all races, all age groups, for men and for women.So if we\u2019re going to be serious about race going forward, we need to uphold laws against discrimination \u2014 in hiring, and in housing, and in education, and in the criminal justice system.(APPLAUSE)That is what our Constitution and highest ideals require.But laws alone won\u2019t be enough. Hearts must change. It won\u2019t change overnight. Social attitudes oftentimes take generations to change. But if our democracy is to work the way it should in this increasingly diverse nation, then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in American fiction, Atticus Finch, who said \u201cYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\u201dFor blacks and other minority groups, that means tying our own very real struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face. Not only the refugee or the immigrant or the rural poor or the transgender American, but also the middle-aged white guy who from the outside may seem like he\u2019s got all the advantages, but has seen his world upended by economic, and cultural, and technological change.We have to pay attention and listen.(APPLAUSE)For white Americans, it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn\u2019t suddenly vanish in the \u201960s; that when minority groups voice discontent, they\u2019re not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness; when they wage peaceful protest, they\u2019re not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment that our founders promised.(APPLAUSE)For native-born Americans, it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today were said, almost word for word, about the Irish, and Italians, and Poles, who it was said were going to destroy the fundamental character of America. And as it turned out, America wasn\u2019t weakened by the presence of these newcomers; these newcomers embraced this nation\u2019s creed, and this nation was strengthened.(APPLAUSE)So regardless of the station we occupy; we all have to try harder; we all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do; that they value hard work and family just like we do; that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own.(APPLAUSE)(CHEERING)And that\u2019s not easy to do. For too many of us it\u2019s become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods, or on college campuses, or places of worship, or especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions. In the rise of naked partisanship and increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste, all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable.And increasingly we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it\u2019s true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.(APPLAUSE)And this trend represents a third threat to our democracy. Look, politics is a battle of ideas. That\u2019s how our democracy was designed. In the course of a healthy debate, we prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them. But without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, then we\u2019re going to keep talking past each other.(CROWD CHEERS)And we\u2019ll make common ground and compromise impossible. And isn\u2019t that part of what so often makes politics dispiriting? How can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on pre-school for kids, but not when we\u2019re cutting taxes for corporations?How do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party, but pounce when the other party does the same thing? It\u2019s not just dishonest, it\u2019s selective sorting of the facts. It\u2019s self-defeating because, as my mom used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.7 PhotosTake the challenge of climate change. In just eight years we\u2019ve halved our dependence on foreign oil, we\u2019ve doubled our renewable energy, we\u2019ve led the world to an agreement that (at) the promise to save this planet.(APPLAUSE)But without bolder action, our children won\u2019t have time to debate the existence of climate change. They\u2019ll be busy dealing with its effects. More environmental disasters, more economic disruptions, waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary. Now we can and should argue about the best approach to solve the problem. But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations, it betrays the essential spirit of this country, the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our founders.(CROWD CHEERS)It is that spirit \u2014 it is that spirit born of the enlightenment that made us an economic powerhouse. The spirit that took flight at Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral, the spirit that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket, it\u2019s that spirit. A faith in reason and enterprise, and the primacy of right over might, that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the Great Depression, that allowed us to build a post-World War II order with other democracies.An order based not just on military power or national affiliations, but built on principles, the rule of law, human rights, freedom of religion and speech and assembly and an independent press.(APPLAUSE)That order is now being challenged. First by violent fanatics who claim to speak for Islam. More recently by autocrats in foreign capitals who seek free markets in open democracies and civil society itself as a threat to their power.The peril each poses to our democracy is more far reaching than a car bomb or a missile. They represent the fear of change. The fear of people who look or speak or pray differently. A contempt for the rule of law that holds leaders accountable. An intolerance of dissent and free thought. A belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or the propaganda machine is the ultimate arbiter of what\u2019s true and what\u2019s right.Because of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform. Because of our intelligence officers and law enforcement and diplomats who support our troops...(APPLAUSE)... no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past eight years.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)And although...(APPLAUSE)... Boston and Orlando and San Bernardino and Fort Hood remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be, our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever. We have taken out tens of thousands of terrorists, including Bin Laden.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)The global coalition we\u2019re leading against ISIL has taken out their leaders and taken away about half their territory. ISIL will be destroyed. And no one who threatens America will ever be safe.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)And all who serve or have served \u2014 it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your commander-in-chief.(CHEERS)And we all owe you a deep debt of gratitude.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)But, protecting our way of life, that\u2019s not just the job of our military. Democracy can buckle when it gives into fear. So just as we as citizens must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are.(APPLAUSE)And that\u2019s why for the past eight years I\u2019ve worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firmer legal footing. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, reformed our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans...(CHEERS)... who are just as patriotic as we are.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s why...(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s why we cannot withdraw...(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s why we cannot withdraw from big global fights to expand democracy and human rights and women\u2019s rights and LGBT rights.(APPLAUSE)No matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem, that\u2019s part of defending America. For the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression. If the scope of freedom and respect for the rule of law shrinks around the world, the likelihood of war within and between nations increases, and our own freedoms will eventually be threatened.So let\u2019s be vigilant, but not afraid. ISIL will try to kill innocent people. But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight.(APPLAUSE)Rivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence around the world \u2014 unless we give up what we stand for, and turn ourselves into just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors.Which brings me to my final point \u2014 our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted.(APPLAUSE)All of us, regardless of party, should be throwing ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions.(APPLAUSE)When voting rates in America are some of the lowest among advanced democracies, we should be making it easier, not harder, to vote.(APPLAUSE)When trust in our institutions is low, we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics, and insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service. When Congress is dysfunctional, we should draw our districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes.(APPLAUSE)But remember, none of this happens on its own. All of this depends on our participation; on each of us accepting the responsibility of citizenship, regardless of which way the pendulum of power happens to be swinging.Our Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift. But it\u2019s really just a piece of parchment. It has no power on its own. We, the people, give it power. We, the people, give it meaning \u2014 with our participation, and with the choices that we make and the alliances that we forge.Whether or not we stand up for our freedoms. Whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law, that\u2019s up to us. America is no fragile thing. But the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.In his own farewell address, George Washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning of our safety, prosperity, and liberty, but \u201cfrom different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken... to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth.\u201dAnd so we have to preserve this truth with \u201cjealous anxiety;\u201d that we should reject \u201cthe first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties\u201d that make us one.(APPLAUSE)America, we weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character aren\u2019t even willing to enter into public service. So coarse with rancor that Americans with whom we disagree are seen, not just as misguided, but as malevolent. We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others.(APPLAUSE)When we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt. And when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them.(CROWD CHEERS)It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy. Embrace the joyous task we have been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours because, for all our outward differences, we in fact all share the same proud type, the most important office in a democracy, citizen.(APPLAUSE)Citizen. So, you see, that\u2019s what our democracy demands. It needs you. Not just when there\u2019s an election, not just when you own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime. If you\u2019re tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life.(APPLAUSE)If something needs fixing, then lace up your shoes and do some organizing.(CROWD CHEERS)If you\u2019re disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clip board, get some signatures, and run for office yourself.(CROWD CHEERS)Show up, dive in, stay at it. Sometimes you\u2019ll win, sometimes you\u2019ll lose. Presuming a reservoir in goodness, that can be a risk. And there will be times when the process will disappoint you. But for those of us fortunate enough to have been part of this one and to see it up close, let me tell you, it can energize and inspire. And more often than not, your faith in America and in Americans will be confirmed. Mine sure has been.(APPLAUSE)Over the course of these eight years, I\u2019ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers. I have mourned with grieving families searching for answers, and found grace in a Charleston church. I\u2019ve seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch. I\u2019ve seen Wounded Warriors who at points were given up for dead walk again.I\u2019ve seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks. I\u2019ve seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees or work for peace and, above all, to look out for each other. So that faith that I placed all those years ago, not far from here, in the power of ordinary Americans to bring about change, that faith has been rewarded in ways I could not have possibly imagined.And I hope your faith has too. Some of you here tonight or watching at home, you were there with us in 2004 and 2008, 2012.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)Maybe you still can\u2019t believe we pulled this whole thing off.(CHEERS)Let me tell you, you\u2019re not the only ones.(LAUGHTER)Michelle...(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)Michelle LaVaughn Robinson of the South Side...(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)... for the past 25 years you have not only been my wife and mother of my children, you have been my best friend.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)You took on a role you didn\u2019t ask for. And you made it your own with grace and with grit and with style, and good humor.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody.(CHEERS)And a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)You have made me proud, and you have made the country proud.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)Malia and Sasha...(CHEERS)... under the strangest of circumstances you have become two amazing young women.(CHEERS)You are smart and you are beautiful. But more importantly, you are kind and you are thoughtful and you are full of passion.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)And...(APPLAUSE)... you wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that I have done in my life, I am most proud to be your dad.(APPLAUSE)To Joe Biden...(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)... the scrappy kid from Scranton...(CHEERS)... who became Delaware\u2019s favorite son. You were the first decision I made as a nominee, and it was the best.(CHEERS)(APPLAUSE)Not just because you have been a great vice president, but because in the bargain I gained a brother. And we love you and Jill like family. And your friendship has been one of the great joys of our lives.(APPLAUSE)To my remarkable staff, for eight years, and for some of you a whole lot more, I have drawn from your energy. And every day I try to reflect back what you displayed. Heart and character. And idealism. I\u2019ve watched you grow up, get married, have kids, start incredible new journeys of your own.Even when times got tough and frustrating, you never let Washington get the better of you. You guarded against cynicism. And the only thing that makes me prouder than all the good that we\u2019ve done is the thought of all the amazing things that you are going to achieve from here.(APPLAUSE)And to all of you out there \u2014 every organizer who moved to an unfamiliar town, every kind family who welcomed them in, every volunteer who knocked on doors, every young person who cast a ballot for the first time, every American who lived and breathed the hard work of change \u2014 you are the best supporters and organizers anybody could ever hope for, and I will forever be grateful. Because you did change the world.(APPLAUSE)You did.And that\u2019s why I leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than when we started. Because I know our work has not only helped so many Americans; it has inspired so many Americans \u2014 especially so many young people out there \u2014 to believe that you can make a difference; to hitch your wagon to something bigger than yourselves.Let me tell you, this generation coming up \u2014 unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic \u2014 I\u2019ve seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America; you know that constant change has been America\u2019s hallmark, that it\u2019s not something to fear but something to embrace, you are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You\u2019ll soon outnumber any of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands.(APPLAUSE)My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won\u2019t stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you\u2019re young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your president \u2014 the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago.I am asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change \u2014 but in yours.I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written:Yes, we can.(APPLAUSE)Yes, we did.(APPLAUSE)Yes, we can.(APPLAUSE)Thank you.

Tucked among the policy prescriptions and infrastructure plans in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s state budget proposal this week were several changes to Start-Up that narrowed the program\u2019s focus to true start-ups and reduced the number of jobs companies were required to create to qualify for tax benefits.And the program had a new name: the Excelsior Business Program, a rebranding that carries some irony. Instead of allowing businesses of any size to apply, the program will now be open only to what most people would define as start-ups \u2014 small companies in their formative stages \u2014 in a move aimed at encouraging the next Google or Facebook to hatch in New York State.Currently, businesses are required to create at least one new job each year to remain in the program, which exempts companies operating in certain tax-free zones from all taxes for up to a decade; under the new proposal, the requirement would fall to creating one new job in the first five years the company is in the program.Empire State Development, the state agency that oversees the program as well as the governor\u2019s other economic development efforts, will be required to update the public on the initiative, as well as a related program known as Empire Jobs, once a year.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has not budged from his support for Start-Up, and the state insisted this week that the program would produce more than 4,000 new jobs over the next several years. State officials say the lower requirement for yearly job creation should allow companies to focus on growing rather than on hitting specific job targets, and argue that the companies will generate so little revenue at first that any taxes the state would pass up in exchange would be negligible.\u201dThis program remains in place and the proposed adjustments, which are based on feedback from businesses, will help it reach its full potential,\u201d Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Empire State Development, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain firmly committed to the model \u2014 innovative academia-business partnerships coupled with performance-based, tax-free incentives.\u201dThe program will still require young businesses to move to tax-free zones, most of them near universities, in the hope that academic centers, with their students, research and equipment, will help seed economic growth. Under the new proposal, companies that add enough jobs during the tax-free period can qualify for even more tax benefits in later years under a sibling program called Excelsior Jobs, which officials hope will induce successful companies to stay in New York as they grow.\u201cIt was never the scale to be a really transformative program,\u201d said E. J. McMahon, the president of the Empire Center. \u201cThe governor basically made it a lightning rod for attention and criticism.\u201dHe said he thought the state\u2019s faith that entrepreneurs would move to and stay in New York State seemed unrealistic. \u201cWhat if they get acquired by a company from California?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re still pretending that they\u2019re venture capitalists who can spot a unicorn, and unicorns will grow generally quite oblivious to whether they\u2019re offering financing in a tax-free zone.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information from a spokesman, misstated the time period over which the Excelsior Business Program intended to create more than 4,000 jobs. It is a period of three to five years, not five.An earlier version of this article misstated how often Empire State Development was required to provide the public with updates on Start-Up New York. It was required to release annual updates, not quarterly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forests Are a Treasure. But Are They Good Investments?", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byTrees don\u2019t watch the stock market. Forests keep growing \u2014 and potentially increasing their value \u2014 even when inflation surges or the market swoons.Big investors, like university endowments and insurance companies, have long allocated money to timberland in places like Oregon\u2019s fir-and-spruce forests, Georgia\u2019s pine plantations and Appalachia\u2019s hardwood groves.Until a few years ago, retail investors were mostly shut out of this market. The deals were too big, involving thousands of acres and tens of millions of dollars.Ordinary investors can now put money into timber without venturing into the woods. Buying shares of an E.T.F. or a R.E.I.T. won\u2019t replicate the benefits of directly owning vast timberlands, but it does enable one to bet on timber.And there\u2019s an old-fashioned option: buying a little woodlot of one\u2019s own. That\u2019s more akin to a part-time job than a passive investment, but it can yield financial gains.\u201cIf you look at the statistics from the U.S. South, close to two-thirds of the timber harvest is coming from small landowners,\u201d said Robert G. Flynn, director, international timber, for RISI, a forest-products research firm.The E.T.F.s are more diversified than their names suggest. They do own timber companies: Both of them count Weyerhaeuser, Rayonier and Potlatch, the leading R.E.I.T.s, among their holdings. But they also invest in International Paper, packaging-maker WestRock and (in Guggenheim\u2019s case) Sealed Air, which is perhaps best known for plastic Bubble Wrap.In terms of returns, the E.T.F.s have looked more like spindly saplings than strong sequoias. The Guggenheim fund failed to match the S.&P. 500\u2019s return in the last three calendar years, and the iShares fund failed to do so in 2014 and 2015. Last year, the Guggenheim fund returned 5.7 percent while the iShares fund returned 10.8 percent, compared with 12 percent for the S.&P., including dividends.William H. Belden III, head of E.T.F. business development for Guggenheim Investments, said his company\u2019s timber E.T.F. targeted a subsector. \u201cTimber is a proxy for the economy and how it\u2019s doing, especially construction and home building,\u201d he said. Some investors want to emphasize timber in their portfolios, and a focused E.T.F. lets them do that, Mr. Belden said.Owning shares of timber R.E.I.T.s is a more direct, if riskier, way to wager on the woods. These companies own forests across the United States. Weyerhaeuser\u2019s roughly 13 million acres approximate the combined area of New Hampshire and Vermont. Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier also have land abroad, the former operating in Uruguay and the latter in New Zealand. Potlatch owns only domestic timberlands.Daniel P. Rohr, an analyst Morningstar, called the R.E.I.T.s a \u201cpretty good substitute\u201d for timberland ownership \u201cbecause the assets are the same.\u201d In both cases, cash flows from the forest, either through the harvest of logs or the sale of land. He cautioned that whenever people buy shares in a single R.E.I.T. or any individual stock, they\u2019re taking on company-specific investment risks, like potential bankruptcy. \u201cIf I\u2019m owning a timberland R.E.I.T., it\u2019s because I\u2019m bullish on U.S. housing, not because I want to add diversification to my portfolio,\u201d Mr. Rohr said.Campbell R. Harvey, an economist at Duke University, likewise warned that timber doesn\u2019t improve a portfolio\u2019s likely return or dampen its risk. Commodities, like timber, can help protect investments against \u201can unexpected burst of inflation,\u201d he said. But timber should be part of a broader commodities fund or E.T.F. that may also invest in oil, natural gas, metals and other agricultural products. \u201cIt\u2019s unwise to think timber alone fills the bucket for commodities,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s analogous to holding 100 shares of I.B.M. and calling that your equity portfolio.\u201dIf investing in a timber E.T.F. or R.E.I.T. can be risky, buying a woodlot is more so. A fire, windstorm or insect infestation can fell your trees (and your investment) in short order. And while timber has produced gains for institutional investors \u2014 the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciary\u2019s Timberland Index has returned an annualized average of about 12 percent since 1986 \u2014 small buyers shouldn\u2019t expect that.\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s not until you get into a $1 million-plus range that you\u2019d start getting into properties that are mostly driven by their investment return,\u201d said Jim W. Hourdequin, managing director of Lyme Timber, in Hanover, N.H.Yet owning a 100- or 200-acre woodlot can make sense for someone who enjoys the land for reasons beyond its financial return, said Tom D. Martin, president of the American Forest Foundation.Mr. Martin and his sister have 200 acres in northern Wisconsin, and they harvest some of their hardwoods, mainly sugar maples and red oaks, every dozen years or so. The income covers taxes, insurance and road-maintenance costs. In the meantime, their families bunk in the cabin on the property. \u201cThe memories and the wildlife are the richest return,\u201d he said.When a novice decides to buy timberland, the first step is hiring a forester, who can help select a plot, said Keith A. Argow, president of the National Woodland Owners Association in Vienna, Va. The forester will evaluate the trees and their quality, the soils and other growing conditions, and even the proximity to potential customers like sawmills, he said. Assuming you find the right property for a good price, you then must manage it. A forester will also help devise a plan for that, including when to harvest and how much.A management plan can help owners tap into other sources of cash, like leasing hunting rights or participating in state programs that provide tax abatements for, say, improving wildlife habitat or water quality, said Raymond A. Lamberton, president of New England Forestry Consultants. In the Northeast, someone with sugar maples might sell maple syrup. But all of those income streams probably won\u2019t add up to big return. \u201cWhere you\u2019ll make the money on is reselling the land,\u201d Mr. Lamberton said.Daniel E. Crocker, an educational administrator in Bangor, Me., didn\u2019t acquire his woodland, in nearby Exeter, Me., to harvest timber. He and his wife, Chris, bought their first 40 acres, in 2002, because they wanted a place to cross-country ski, cut Christmas trees and watch wildlife with their two children.A few years later, they bought two adjacent parcels, bringing their total holdings to 96 acres and total cost to about $75,000. The land hadn\u2019t been logged in 25 or 30 years, and they realized that selling timber could bring in cash, Mr. Crocker said. They\u2019ve since harvested twice, netting about $15,000, he said. The proceeds have been reinvested in the property, in the form of a trout pond, a road and improvements to the wildlife habitat.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to fund your kid\u2019s education or retire at 55 this way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can supplement your income.\u201dThough the Crockers are generating cash, the biggest return has been physical and emotional, Mr. Crocker said. Right now, the softwood market, mostly firs and spruce in Maine, he said, \u201chas gone belly up, but I\u2019ll still be cross-country skiing on our property on Saturday morning, and we can still make maple syrup there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will France Sound the Death Knell for Social Democracy?", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "FeatureAs a presidential election approaches this spring, even workers in the country\u2019s rust belt are embracing right-wing populism.Supported byThe argument was unconvincing to many in Pas-de-Calais, the rural and industrial area in the northernmost tip of France, where Sailliot lives. In the 1970s, France, like other industrialized countries, began a shift away from manufacturing to a services-based economy, and within a few decades, Pas-de-Calais came to epitomize industrial decline. It is now France\u2019s rust belt and coal country all in one. The working-class voters of Pas-de-Calais have long supported France\u2019s Socialists along with the French Communist Party. But as in the United States, where Rust Belt voters no longer embrace the Democratic Party, these workers have increasingly lost faith in the parties of the left.Sailliot\u2019s union, the General Confederation of Labor, or the C.G.T., was among the most strident opponents of the new labor law. The C.G.T., formerly linked to the Communist Party, is one of the oldest and largest trade unions in France. Though its membership and stature, like those of other French unions, have declined considerably from their post-World War II height, the C.G.T. remains unmatched in its ability to mobilize workers. And many of its members retain a far-left ideology and preference for militant tactics. After a draft of the labor law leaked last February, the C.G.T. demanded that it be scrapped and recommended alternative policies: Reduce the French workweek to 32 hours (from the current 35) and give workers raises.The Socialist government tried to appease the C.G.T. and other unions by watering down the original draft of the law, but opposition to it remained fierce. The face-off ignited one of the most sustained and impassioned protest movements in France since the May 1968 demonstrations that nearly brought down the Fifth Republic a decade into its existence. Marches in Paris and cities across the country drew hundreds of thousands of protesters and often culminated in tear-gas-laden street battles between truncheon-swinging riot officers and anarchist groups. Nuit Debout, a French version of Occupy Wall Street, drew large gatherings of young people to nighttime meetings in the Place de la R\u00e9publique in Paris. C.G.T. activists blocked highway lanes and oil refineries, creating fuel shortages. Labor strikes halted train travel and cut output at nuclear-power plants.Sailliot had another reason to protest. The paper mill in Pas-de-Calais where he worked for three decades shut down in 2015, because of what the company called an \u201caccelerating deterioration in market conditions for printing and writing papers.\u201d Sailliot was still technically employed there \u2014 he was a C.G.T. delegate, he explained, so legally it was harder to lay him off \u2014 but it was an unsettling feeling, he said, to think he\u2019d have to find a new industry to work in. He blamed the Socialist government. His resentment was aggravated by the fact that he voted for Hollande in the French presidential election of 2012, enticed by his leftist pre-election rhetoric. These new Socialist laws, Sailliot said, were even worse than what the right was proposing; as for Hollande personally, Sailliot raised his hand in a gesture, not uncommon among Frenchmen, to indicate his testicles\u2019 springing up to his neck in anger. \u201cHe\u2019s a traitor.\u201dAll around his home and workplace in Pas-de-Calais, Sailliot told me, the far-right, anti-immigration National Front was filling the political void that working-class discontent had created. With national elections looming, the party depicted itself as the new defender of the French worker; as part of that effort, its leader, Marine Le Pen, joined France\u2019s hard leftists in condemning the labor law as \u201csocial regression\u201d \u2014 the same term of disparagement used by trade-union leaders and the Communist Party. Le Pen\u2019s economic rhetoric, in fact, is often hard to differentiate from positions normally held by the far left. She rails against free-trade agreements and \u201csocial dumping\u201d \u2014 the practice of domestically hiring foreigners for lower wages than citizens earn \u2014 and her party has vowed to reindustrialize France and protect social benefits. The French newsmagazine Le Point reported that Hollande, when asked to explain the growing popularity of the National Front, often relays a story a former head of the C.G.T. told him: When the union leader read a National Front leaflet to his fellow union members without telling them what party it was from, the union members all approved of the message.Sailliot, a committed Communist, referred to the National Front\u2019s leaders as \u201cimpostors\u201d \u2014 a word that C.G.T. leaders use when describing the party\u2019s effort to appeal to their rank and file \u2014 and dismissed the notion that the far-right party, if elevated to power, would keep its leftist-sounding promises. But he could not deny the political effectiveness of the message. Among his disaffected colleagues, neighbors, even within his own family, the National Front was increasingly popular, he told me. Laid-off workers saw that mainstream parties hadn\u2019t done anything for them, he said, \u201cso they vote for Le Pen.\u201dIn two rounds of voting this April and May, France will elect a new president to succeed Hollande. According to polls, as of this writing, Le Pen remains a viable contender. Her success \u2014 in the coming election and beyond \u2014 hinges in no small part on her party\u2019s effort to supplant the left in places like Pas-de-Calais, and to make the National Front the new voice of France\u2019s working class.Recently, though, European social democrats have witnessed an extraordinary drop in support. In 2009, the Social Democratic Party of Germany suffered its worst election defeat in post-World War II history. In the British general election one year later, the Labour Party received its second-lowest share of the vote since 1918, the year that voting restrictions on women and non-property-owning men were relaxed. Even in Scandinavian countries \u2014 often cited as the apotheosis of social democracy \u2014 center-left parties are struggling. A recent analysis in The Economist showed that across Western Europe, support for social-democratic parties is at its lowest point in 70 years.The answer, at least in today\u2019s Europe, is probably yes. In the 1990s and early 2000s, leaders like Tony Blair in Britain, Bill Clinton in the United States and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der in Germany led a center-left resurgence. Yet in their fight for the political middle ground, they pulled their own parties away from shrinking labor constituencies and toward a fuller embrace of the free market. In Europe, the demise of the old left has been cemented by the strictures of E.U. membership, which sets in stone practices that were once anathema to socialists: free trade, limits on national spending and monetary policies that subordinate employment to price stability. There is no more blatant example of the European left\u2019s inability to be leftist than Greece, where in 2015 voters elected Syriza, a \u201cradical left\u201d party that promised to thwart E.U. austerity policies. Since its victory, however, Syriza has been compelled, under threat of expulsion from the eurozone, to adopt an agenda that is anything but leftist: privatizations, pension cuts and stringent fiscal targets. In a recent interview in the French journal Le D\u00e9bat, Hollande was asked about his own rightward drift: Will he be the president who presides over \u201cthe end of the socialist idea\u201d? Hollande replied that it was impossible to be socialist in isolation, before going on to frame the left\u2019s challenge. \u201cWhat is at stake is whether the left, rather than socialism, has a future in the world, or whether globalization has reduced or even annihilated this hope.\u201dAs center-left parties become more indistinguishable from their center-right opponents, the classical liberal vision \u2014 a well-informed polity making democratic choices along a left-right continuum \u2014 has blurred. The left-right dichotomy has its roots in the French Revolution, when members of the National Assembly physically divided themselves according to their view on the king\u2019s authority: Those members in favor of more royal power stood on the right side of the chamber, and those opposed stood on the left. While the meaning of the left-right divide has since evolved and the concept has often failed to encapsulate complex political movements, it has since come to define democratic politics. Increasingly, however, voters perceive their democratic choices along a different axis, not from left to right but from a fill-in-the-blank centrist party to a populist, radical one, as a choice between parties that wish to tweak the prevailing order and those that seek to overthrow it.Far-right parties are not the only ones offering revolution. Far-left parties remain on ballots across Europe, and in France, the Left Front, an electoral coalition that includes the French Communist Party, has sought to take advantage of the Socialists\u2019 troubles. The Left Front was popular among many of the trade unionists I met, yet as of now, its support has remained limited. With notable exceptions like Greece and Spain, where far-left parties have surged in the face of economic misery, voters in Europe often perceive these parties to be discredited by history, even irrelevant. And now, in countries like France, the far left faces growing competition from the far right.Many believe that the consequences of this political scrambling will be profound. Dominique Reyni\u00e9, a political-science professor at Sciences Po in Paris, described \u201cthe end of the story of the democratic-socialist model\u201d as \u201cvery bad news,\u201d even though he does not identify as a socialist himself. \u201cIf we consider the invention of pluralistic democracy in Europe at the end of the 19th century, it was founded on the possibility of making a choice between the right and the left,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf we have lost this duality, we have probably lost the mechanical principle of democracy.\u201dI struck up a conversation with Bruno Evrard, a 49-year-old whose father had worked at the mill, as had his grandfather. Evrard worked at the plant for three decades and hoped to spend his working life there. Instead, he was now employed at a nearby cardboard factory on a week-to-week basis. Given the growth in online shopping, Evrard said, cardboard was a relatively good business to be in. Still, he didn\u2019t want to get his hopes up. \u201cThey use temporary people like Kleenex,\u201d he said.Evrard asked me how American workers protected their jobs. \u201cEat or be eaten,\u201d I said, trying to draw a laugh. But this seemed only to confirm the unionists\u2019 view of America\u2019s grim reality. \u201cAre there a lot of \u2018insecure\u2019 jobs?\u201d Evrard asked, meaning jobs with no protections from layoffs. Pretty much all private-sector jobs in America are insecure, I said, explaining that it was common for people to change employers many times over the course of a lifetime.\u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do in France,\u201d Evrard snapped. \u201cThe same kind of stupidity.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the labor law,\u201d Sailliot chimed in.\u201cIt\u2019s American,\u201d Evrard said in perturbed agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s American.\u201dEvrard told me that his opinion of the French Socialist Party, which brought this American idea to France, was \u201czero.\u201d I asked him if that meant he would consider voting for the National Front. He came from a staunchly communist family and maintained his allegiance to the left, he told me. But it was an increasingly lonely position. All Evrard ever heard from his new co-workers was how the government took care of foreigners, not French workers. \u201cI\u2019m never on the right side of the conversation,\u201d he said. The National Front has become \u201ctoo big of a phenomenon.\u201dSailliot then gave me a tour of the expansive grounds, walking me past the brick chateau next to an apple orchard that was built, he said, by the wealthy family that once owned the place, and then over to the mill itself, where he pointed out the virtues of the giant machines. Afterward, we walked over to a nearby restaurant for lunch. At our table, not far from a television that blared out the progress of a horse race, we were joined by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lecoustre, a reticent man with a bulldog tattoo on his neck. Lecoustre works with Sailliot\u2019s wife at a nearby glass factory that, he said, had shed thousands of employees since he started working there two decades ago. His own wife worked at a school cafeteria, part time and on a short-term contract. They had two children, 11 and 14. I asked him if he was worried about losing his job. Lecoustre hesitated to answer, taking a gulp from a glass of red wine.\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally.Sailliot shot him a look of disbelief. \u201cCome on, you know you\u2019re afraid of the future.\u201dLecoustre paused, then gave his explanation: Workers with more menial jobs were at greater risk of losing them. But he worked on a machine, and this gave him more security.Sailliot didn\u2019t press the issue. The two men remained friendly, despite glaring political differences. Lecoustre was a supporter of the National Front. I asked him why.\u201cPeople are fed up,\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe we can try to change something.\u201d\u201cFed up about what?\u201d I asked.\u201cA bit of everything,\u201d he said.The National Front has, in recent years, become more popular in many rural areas and small towns like Wizernes, places that are often relatively homogeneous and have few immigrants. Many people, of course, wish to keep it that way and therefore happily embrace the National Front\u2019s nativist message. Yet immigration is also intertwined with broader anxieties that fuel support for the party \u2014 fear of terrorism, fear of economic collapse \u2014 and so the issue becomes an easy, tangible target, even if it remains an abstraction.I asked Lecoustre if immigration had changed his life in any direct way. He thought for a moment. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.Sailliot interjected. This was the absurdity of it all, he said. There were hardly any migrants in the area, and yet somehow, immigration was everybody\u2019s biggest problem. How could that be? Sailliot went on: Politics ought to be about putting all people first, ahead of global markets, ahead of the bottom line, not about getting some people out of the country. Lecoustre listened, but he did not appear convinced.Presidential-election polls in France, as of this writing, show Le Pen likely to make it to the runoff, to be held in May. The pressing question in France now is: Will the \u201crepublican front\u201d once again hold? Given the unpopularity of the Socialists, Le Pen\u2019s chief opponents are now Fran\u00e7ois Fillon \u2014 a center-right, market-oriented social conservative who has promised to cut public-sector jobs and was recently depicted on the front page of the left-wing newspaper Lib\u00e9ration with a Margaret Thatcher hairdo \u2014 and Emmanuel Macron, a young former investment banker who served as the economy minister under Hollande but has now split to form his own neither-of-the-left-nor-of-the-right political movement. This, bewilderingly, makes the far-right Le Pen the only leading candidate with a traditionally leftist economic message, and it leaves many leftists who remain opposed to her hard-pressed to vote for her opponents.The mining life, despite its hardships, had provided security. Miners lived in rowhouses built by the mining company. Their children went to schools built by the company. Coal, electricity and health care were all provided by the company. Now all that remains of the industry in the basin is a collection of mining pits, slag heaps and workers\u2019 estates so archaic that Unesco, in 2012, added the region to its World Heritage List of unique global treasures. The site \u201cillustrates a significant period in the history of industrial Europe,\u201d Unesco noted. \u201cIt documents the living conditions of workers and the solidarity to which it gave rise.\u201dGlorian\u2019s working life is emblematic of the new uncertainty. For a time, he worked at Metaleurop-Nord, a smelter that produced zinc and lead, then at a textile factory that produced carpet thread. Each of those factories closed. The shuttering of the smelter in 2003 was a particularly hard blow to the region, leaving several hundred workers without jobs. The National Front sensed electoral opportunity. Marine Le Pen has run repeatedly for the French Parliament in the area around Lens, narrowly missing a seat in 2012. At the same time, National Front candidates have steadily chipped away at the left\u2019s power, making significant gains in local elections.Glorian acknowledged that the National Front was attracting some C.G.T. members in Pas-de-Calais; in one case, he said, a prominent C.G.T. delegate from a nearby tire shop ran for office on a National Front ticket. The delegate, Glorian added, was kicked out of the union. When C.G.T. members openly expressed sympathy for the National Front, Glorian told me, union leaders tried to \u201ceducate\u201d them about the errors in their thinking. If that didn\u2019t work, they kicked them out, because the union doesn\u2019t tolerate overt racism and nationalism. Glorian said he was afraid that some of his peers hid their favorable feelings about the National Front from him, knowing they wouldn\u2019t go over well. \u201cThe left is to blame,\u201d he told me of the party\u2019s success. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do their job.\u201dThe C.G.T. delegate turned National Front politician, I soon found out, was not an isolated case. A number of National Front politicians in the area claim to come from unions and other traditionally leftist organizations. The party, it appears, often seeks out members with such credentials as part of its strategy to supplant the left. In M\u00e9ricourt, a town a few miles from Lens that is overshadowed by a volcanic-looking slag heap, the Communist mayor is holding together an alliance of leftists who are battling a rising challenge from National Front politicians like these.On the morning of my visit to M\u00e9ricourt, an outdoor market was set up on the main street, with stalls selling cheap clothes, cleaning supplies, sandwiches. In a bar, I met a foreman named Laurent Dassonville who described himself as a former Communist. Now he is the president of the town\u2019s chapter of the National Front. Dassonville and I moved toward the pool table, where his 12-year-old son sat next to him, playing Pok\u00e9mon Go. Dassonville told me that his father had been a Communist, and so had his grandfather. Years ago, he switched allegiance because, he said, the National Front is the only party that still defends workers. Dassonville ran for local office in 2015 on a National Front ticket. He virtually tied his leftist opponents in the first round of voting but came up short in the second round. After his loss, Dassonville published an angry letter in a local magazine, accusing his leftist opponents of siding with \u201cthe big bosses\u201d in order to prevail over the National Front. \u201cYou followed the instructions of the haves and the powerful,\u201d he wrote. A National Front politician was denouncing the area\u2019s hard leftists as if they were neoliberal capitalists.Dassonville sipped his coffee and lit a Marlboro. He called over a man he introduced as a National Front activist, a retiree who presented a new party membership slip to Dassonville. New members were signing up all the time, Dassonville told me. \u201cLook, this one\u2019s a truck driver,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone from the working world.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help wondering if this interaction was being staged for my benefit. \u201cThey say we are an extreme-right party,\u201d Dassonville said. \u201cBut when you look closely at the words of Marine Le Pen and at the program we are now building, there\u2019s a big part of the left in it. The left forgot its tradition. It\u2019s up to us to appropriate it.\u201dI asked Dassonville if he would call the National Front an extreme-right party or an extreme-left party. Like many in the National Front, he objected to the designation \u201cextreme.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a normal political party,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would you say extreme? What does the word \u2018extreme\u2019 even mean?\u201dDassonville thought the whole left-right spectrum was finished anyway. \u201cFor me,\u201d he said, \u201cit has no value.\u201dJames Angelos is a writer based in Berlin.

{"Headline": "What Michelle Obama Wore and Why It Mattered", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byCritic's Notebook51 PhotosIt began with Jay Leno.It began, to be more specific, in October 2008, when Mr. Leno, the host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d at the time, turned to his guest, Michelle Obama, the wife of the Democratic nominee for president, and said \u2014 with glee, with gotcha expectation, because it had just been revealed that the campaign clothes budget for Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, was $150,000 \u2014 \u201cI want to ask you about your wardrobe. I\u2019m guessing about 60 grand? Sixty, 70 thousand for that outfit?\u201dAnd thus was an eight-year obsession born. Not to mention a new approach to the story of dress and power.When Mrs. Obama understood the impact of that early answer \u2014 when she saw the public response to her outfit (which had been chosen specifically as a riposte to the Palin news) \u2014 it set in motion a strategic rethink about the use of clothes that not only helped define her tenure as first lady, but also started a conversation that went far beyond the label or look that she wore and that is only now, maybe, reaching its end.Consider all that, and there is simply no ignoring the fact that during these two terms, clothing played a role unlike any it had ever played before in a presidential administration.A noncomprehensive litany of some of the designers whose clothes the first lady wore during her husband\u2019s two terms in office includes: Carolina Herrera, Narciso Rodriguez, Michael Kors, Maria Cornejo, Thom Browne, Isabel Toledo, Jason Wu, Prabal Gurung, Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs, Oscar de la Renta, Ralph Lauren, Marchesa, Tom Ford, Vera Wang, Tadashi Shoji, Cushnie et Ochs, Tory Burch, Naeem Khan, Brandon Maxwell, Rodarte, Bibhu Mohapatra, Zac Posen, Barbara Tfank, Alexander Wang, Rag & Bone, Joseph Altuzarra, Tracy Reese, Monique Lhuillier, Thakoon, Christian Siriano, Calvin Klein, Sophie Theallet, Reed Krakoff, Diane von Furstenberg, Derek Lam, Proenza Schouler and Alice & Olivia. Also Talbots. And Target. And Ann Taylor. Sheesh.Plus, of course: Gucci, Versace, Givenchy, Ala\u00efa, Junya Watanabe, Christopher Kane, Roksanda, Moschino, Lanvin (those controversial expensive sneakers), Dries Van Noten, Alexander McQueen, Duro Olowu, Lanvin and Kenzo. To name a few.It is, by any measure, an unprecedented list.The twin conditions of the historic nature of this presidency and the fact it occurred alongside the rise of social media, which turned every public second into a shareable, comment-worthy moment, combined to create a new reality where every appearance mattered. Not everyone listened to all of the speeches or read the analysis or considered the context. But everyone paused for a moment to assess the visual. And a couple who had spent their entire lives being scrutinized as pioneers understood what that meant, and instead of bridling at it, leveraged it. If you know everyone is going to see what you wear and judge it, then what you wear becomes fraught with meaning. Certainly Mrs. Obama\u2019s significance as a contemporary role model goes far beyond her image, but no one understood the role of fashion, and the potential uses of that, better than the first lady.\u201cShe realized very early on that everything she did had ramifications,\u201d said Thom Browne, who made the tailored coat and dress Mrs. Obama wore for the inaugural parade in 2013, as well as a dress she wore to the 2012 Democratic National Convention and also during the final debate that year. And she understood, he went on, \u201cthat people did not just want to know how she looked, but what she was about,\u201d and that she could plant subliminal cues to the latter with her clothes.Change was the promise, and change was the look \u2014 far beyond the amount of upper arm on display, or the riot of color and prints. Or the cardigans.Just because something appears trivial does not mean it is any less powerful as a means of persuasion and outreach. In some ways its very triviality \u2014 the fact that everyone could talk about it, dissect it, imitate it \u2014 makes fashion the most potentially viral item in the subliminal political toolbox. Talking heads complained early on in the second term about Mrs. Obama\u2019s allowing the clothes conversation to dominate the substance conversation, but in fact she made the two inextricable.That is not a situation that, as any woman would know, happens by accident. We all tend to gravitate toward certain designers in part because of sheer laziness: We know what suits us, what we like, and so we go there first. To have been so, well, evenhanded in her choices could have happened only with careful calculation.\u201cI am not sure people really realized the extent of what she was doing,\u201d said Tracy Reese, whose custom-made pink and gold silk dress, worn by Mrs. Obama for her speech at the 2012 Democratic convention, became her best-selling dress when remade for sale, and whose black dress with big red poppies, worn by the first lady for the 50th anniversary of the 1963 march on Washington, is now on display at the National Museum of African-American History and Culture. \u201cIt was really about us all.\u201d\u201cShe came in at a time when the economy was particularly tough and really shone a light on fashion in the broadest sense,\u201d said Narciso Rodriguez, whose dress she wore on the night in 2008 that ushered in the Obama era, and recently at the National School Counselor of the Year event when she gave her last speech as first lady. If you think that was an accident, there\u2019s a bridge I can sell you \u2014 just as the fact she wore Jason Wu to her husband\u2019s farewell address in Chicago, a designer she also wore at both inaugural balls, was no coincidence. It was closure.13 PhotosBut above all, her wardrobe was representative of the country her husband wanted to lead.It was about the melting pot and the establishment; the 1 percent and the accessible. There was something in her closet for everyone, yet she was beholden to no designer \u2014 free of any specific allegiance to, or association with, a brand. She worked at a remove, through her aide Meredith Koop, and no designers contacted for this article said they knew when the clothes she bought would be worn (if they were for personal use she did buy them, though often at a discount; if they were for state occasions, they were donated by the designer and archived, either at the National Archives or a museum). They were not told in advance, and they found out at the same time everyone else did. It was a business relationship, not a personal one.It may be because the point of what Mrs. Obama wore was never simply that it was good to mix up your wardrobe among a group of designers, but rather that clothes were most resonant when they were an expression of commitment to an idea, or an ideal, that had resonance. And maybe it shouldn\u2019t really matter if anyone else in her position adopts the same approach. Each administration writes its own catechism, after all. Whether we follow is up to us.Advertisement"}

Harker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said Thursday that he expected that it would be appropriate for the Fed to increase rates three times during 2017, the consensus view among Fed officials.Fed officials have said it is too soon to predict the effect of President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s economic policies. Mr. Bullard said the incoming administration\u2019s fiscal policies were not likely to affect economic growth until 2018 and 2019.In her opening remarks, Ms. Yellen highlighted the importance of preparing students to contribute to the work force and to be what she called \u201cresponsible consumers.\u201d\u201cConsumers skilled in managing their finances are better prepared to weather bad times,\u201d she said, \u201cand stronger household finances over all can help sustain growth, stabilize the economy and mitigate an economic downturn.\u201dLeah Young, who teaches economics and personal finance at Washington-Lee High School in Arlington, Va, said she had jumped at the chance to attend the town hall meeting. She particularly relished Ms. Yellen\u2019s response to a question about why economics remains a male-dominated field.Ms. Yellen dismissed the idea that women were less interested in economics, pointing instead to issues like bias and a lack of role models, and reiterating her hope that change will come.\u201cI liked that she talked about all the reasons why women aren\u2019t in this and she shot those all down,\u201d Ms. Young said.

Citizens in several cities reported that soldiers were patrolling the streets, some firing shots in the air. In Toulepleu, soldiers seized vehicles from citizens, said Serzh Kouehi, a resident there. Shots rang out throughout Friday in the cities of Korhogo and Bouak\u00e9. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\u201cPeople are afraid because the soldiers all have weapons,\u201d said Estelle Koussi, a resident of Man, a city in western Ivory Coast, where the revolt also spread.Early on Saturday, Alain Richard Donwahi, the country\u2019s defense minister, arrived in Bouak\u00e9, where the uprising appeared to have started, for talks with the rebellious soldiers, whose demands included raises, bonuses and shorter tenures of service.After the deal was announced, local news media reports from Bouak\u00e9 said renegade soldiers were preventing Mr. Donwahi from leaving the city. But Mayor Nicolas Djibo of Bouak\u00e9 said late Saturday that the soldiers had never threatened Mr. Donwahi, and that the minister had traveled to the local airport after the talks.The mutiny seemed to have taken Ivorian officials by surprise. Mr. Ouattara was in Ghana on Saturday for the inauguration of a new president there, but he returned to his country for an emergency meeting with his ministers. Mr. Djibo was away from Bouak\u00e9 on Friday and rushed home after the mutiny began.Mamadou Koulibaly, an opposition party leader, criticized the government for not addressing the soldiers\u2019 complaints sooner.The Ivorian military has remained fractured as the government has struggled to integrate the rebels who helped install Mr. Ouattara in 2011 after his predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo, refused to accept an electoral defeat.\u201cThe Ivorian Army for a long time now has been very volatile,\u201d said Rinaldo Depagne, the West Africa project director for the International Crisis Group. He said there was a huge gap in compensation between top- and lower-level officers.A similar revolt occurred in November 2014, when thousands of Ivory Coast soldiers left their barracks to demand back pay and benefits. At the time, the government agreed to meet the demands of the former rebel fighters, but those grievances have lingered.\u201cThe conditions in which these guys live are appalling,\u201d said Mr. Depagne, who visited military barracks around the time of the 2014 mutiny. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t match with the wealth of the country.\u201dJulien Kouaho, an author who has written about Ivorian politics, said the rebellion needed to be resolved quickly or the nation\u2019s economy and political system would suffer. \u201cThe government must take this seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military is not made to be in the streets, but in the barracks.\u201dThe actions of the rebels could have far-reaching consequences, Mr. Kouaho added.\u201cThis is not a situation that can reassure investors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe population is terrified.

{"Headline": "A Tool Kit for the Donor Eager to Grasp All the Risks of Donation", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersSASHA KRAMER, an ecologist, was having success promoting greater sanitation in Haiti when she lost access to her nonprofit\u2019s only composting site in Port-au-Prince: a dump that was being mismanaged.Her group, SOIL, provides toilets to poor households. Each week it sent representatives to empty the five-gallon buckets, bring the waste to the dump and turn it into compost, which was sold to farmers as fertilizer.Nearly nine years into the work, though, the local dump fell into chaos when the private company managing it lost its contract. The government ceased to keep access roads clear and began burning trash to clear it.\u201cWe managed to keep the compost site open, but we could only get in there once every two weeks,\u201d Dr. Kramer said. \u201cThere was so much smoke out there that it was becoming a health risk.\u201dWorse, she said she didn\u2019t know where to turn to get money for another site.Despite the likelihood of problems, leaders of nonprofit organizations rarely lay out the risks of their projects, lest any hint of failure scare away funders. On the flip side, donors often fail to dig deeply enough to discuss the obstacles a project may encounter. Among donors, 76 percent don\u2019t ask recipients about the risks they face, while 87 percent of nonprofit leaders said grant applications had no questions about risks, according to Open Road Alliance.\u201cThis isn\u2019t anecdotal evidence,\u201d said Laurie Michaels, Open Road\u2019s founder. \u201cThis is donors and funders reporting that 20 percent of the projects need more money. Yet no one ever asks about this.\u201dSpurred by this research, and by its experience with shoring up projects in crisis, Open Road Alliance partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation and Arabella Advisors, a nonprofit consultancy, in convening a group of nonprofit executives to think through risk assessment.\u201cWe designed the tool kit very deliberately, so a foundation could take it in total or pick and choose tools \u00e0 la carte,\u201d said Maya Winkelstein, who served as chairwoman of the group, called the Commons. \u201cOur hope is people will print off the tool kit and bring it to their staff meetings or their board meetings or to their C.F.O. of programming.\u201dGiven the spike in philanthropic giving, the time is ripe to discuss the downsides of giving money away. A study released this week by the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy predicted that charitable giving would rise 3.6 percent this year and 3.8 percent next year, based on a strong economy.The biggest increase will come from foundations, which are often financed by wealthy individuals. Foundations will increase their giving by 5.9 percent and 6 percent in the next two years, the report predicted.But with that increase will come the need to apply business fundamentals to grant making and to look at all the potential downsides of a project. FOR the past five years, the Rockefeller Foundation has set aside contingency funding for individual initiatives and broader programs, said Judith Rodin, its president. Her foundation also assesses its grants by low, medium and high risk.\u201cOur tax-advantaged dollars create opportunities for us to take risk, but the evidence shows there isn\u2019t that much risk-taking in our sector,\u201d Dr. Rodin said. \u201cTaking smart risk is essential.\u201dThe risk management tool kit produced by the Commons covers broader areas like helping donors understand their own risk appetite with their grants, and putting together a risk policy statement similar to ones done for a portfolio of investments.But the kit also has seven items dealing with specific conversations donors ought to have with groups they are supporting. These include talking about contingency funding and planning, putting in place their own risk management strategies and monitoring the progress of the project in order to pre-empt problems.\u201cPart of the reason we focused on donors is they have the money,\u201d said Dr. Michaels, a clinical psychologist who is married to David Bonderman, a founder of the private equity firm TPG.\u201cThere\u2019s a power differential,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for a nonprofit to come to a funder and say, \u2018How are you going to insure us if something gets screwed up?\u2019\u201dLess than a year ago, Reclaim Detroit, which trains workers to salvage wood from homes slated for demolition and repurpose it, lost its warehouse to a blaze. With no wood, no equipment and no work space, it had also no plan for dealing with such a total loss and was in danger of folding.Reclaim Detroit partly supports itself through the sale of objects it makes from the reclaimed wood \u2014 something it could not do after the fire. But it also receives grants from companies like the JPMorgan Chase Foundation, the PNC Bank Foundation and others that are directed at its job training program and operational expenses.What it didn\u2019t have, though, was money to rebuild after the fire.Susan Dundon, business innovation director at EcoWorks, the nonprofit parent of Reclaim Detroit, said the group tried to raise money from the community, but then one of its program funders, REDF, directed it to Open Road Alliance, which gave $100,000 as bridge funding so the nonprofit could get running again.\u201cSome of it went for operating funds to continue to pay our crew, who was paid out of our earned revenues,\u201d Ms. Dundon said. \u201cThe main part was to rebuild our mill shop and to buy new equipment.\u201dNot everyone in the philanthropic community thinks such contingency funding is a good idea. Amir Pasic, dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, said nonprofits having to ask funders for money after a crisis can create an additional level of bureaucracy when funds are really needed.\u201cIt\u2019s getting us to continue to think about projects rather than organizations or causes,\u201d Dr. Pasic said. \u201cIt\u2019s allowing us to forget the fact that if you have a really good relationship with your funder and they know what\u2019s going on, it doesn\u2019t have to be a formal contingency plan.\u201dDr. Pasic, who was not involved with the Commons, said he saw a place for such backstop funding with smaller organizations. But in general, he said, he supported the group\u2019s conclusion that larger nonprofits and funders should plan for problems.\u201cYou need a joint conversation upfront,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to create an honest conversation between both sides so we can be productive.\u201dShelley Whelpton, managing director of Arabella Advisors, said that while the tool kit will start those conversations, it will take time to get donors to think differently. \u201cThere is culture change that needs to take place first,\u201d she said. The kit, she added, \u201cis a way to start a conversation.\u201dIN the case of SOIL, which has an annual budget of $1.3 million, Dr. Kramer said she went back to one of its longest-standing funders, the 11th Hour Project, which is backed by Wendy Schmidt, whose wealth comes from Google. Dr. Kramer said she was told the foundation had already made its grants for the year, and she was pointed toward Open Road Alliance, which issued a $100,000 grant for a new composting site.\u201cWith our other donors, I have much more of a traditional grantee relationship, where I wouldn\u2019t go back and say, \u2018I need more money for the same project,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t something I had considered before.\u201dDespite losing its dump, SOIL was lucky. Open Road Alliance gave $3 million last year, mostly in the form of small grants. But it operates by word of mouth and referral; it hopes that with the tool kit, more nonprofits will be able to talk to their donors about crises.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to get people on board saying, \u2018You\u2019re right, we could be backing up our grantees in a more comprehensive way, but where do we start?\u2019\u201d Dr. Michaels said. \u201cOne way to start is to lay out the path and say, \u2018These steps are not so difficult.\u2019 It\u2019s an attempt to make it easier for people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Trump Sees Economic \u2018Disaster,\u2019 Experts See Something More Complex", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has called the American economy a \u201cdisaster.\u201d But in Sioux Falls, S.D., Scott Lawrence, a local businessman and Trump voter, has a different take.\u201cBusinesses that were hunkered down earlier in the year have come on strong,\u201d said Mr. Lawrence, who runs a local advertising firm, Lawrence & Schiller, which employs 95 people. \u201cI\u2019m definitely more optimistic than I was six months ago.\u201dMr. Lawrence is putting his money where his mouth is: His company hired five employees late last year, including digital strategists and content designers, and he plans to add another four in the next three months.Although Mr. Trump was able to capture the White House by portraying an American economy in shambles, many of the economic fundamentals are solid.To be sure, there are some very real shortcomings that Mr. Trump identified in his campaign. They include minimal pay growth for less-skilled workers, near-record numbers of Americans not in the labor force, and disappearing factory jobs. Still, many mainstream economists say that the Trump agenda \u2014 aimed at lowering taxes, peeling back regulations and reopening trade deals \u2014 will not alter those trend lines.\u201cTax cuts are unlikely to boost labor participation rates, nor will they reverse the aging of the population,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cLess regulation could have a positive impact on long-term growth, but it is unlikely to move the needle over the next two years.\u201dMany low-wage workers are getting a break in the new year through something seen as anathema to traditional Republican policies: government regulation. Nineteen states increased their minimum wages as of Jan. 1, with Arizona, Washington and Maine raising the floor by $1.50 or more.This year, 19 states took matters into their own hands and raised the minimum wage.Whatever Mr. Trump eventually decides on the minimum wage, his economic plans may produce mixed results at best for his blue-collar, Rust Belt base.Protectionist trade policies, Mr. Gapen said, will produce losers as well as winners, meaning upheaval for many industries and workers rather than a suddenly improved trajectory for growth and employment over all.At the same time, while Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts could give the economy a lift as measured by gross domestic product \u2014 a prospect that has buoyed Wall Street \u2014 the benefits are likely to flow to the group that has prospered the most during the recovery under President Obama: the wealthiest 10 percent or so of households.Indeed, as a business owner, Mr. Lawrence is thrilled at the prospect of tax cuts. \u201cIn terms of Trump, I voted for the platform as much as the individual,\u201d he said. \u201cPaying less in taxes enables me to invest in my business.\u201dThat filters down to individual decisions about hires and investment. But while the positions Mr. Lawrence is filling are middle-class jobs in Sioux Falls \u2014 they start at $45,000 to $50,000 a year, plus benefits \u2014 all require a college degree or other technical training.Helping workers who lack a college degree \u2014 among Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest supporters, and roughly 60 percent of the American work force \u2014 is much harder.Economists like Nariman Behravesh of IHS Markit, who says Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals could raise growth meaningfully in the next two years, acknowledge this quandary.\u201cStronger growth will help with the low participation rate, but what it\u2019s not going to do is help workers who have been left behind by a lack of education or training,\u201d Mr. Behravesh said.That\u2019s especially true in the factory sector, which is likely to employ more highly skilled workers in the future, albeit in smaller numbers than in the past.\u201cThis is where I have trouble with Trump,\u201d Mr. Behravesh said. \u201cA lot of those manufacturing jobs are gone forever. He is raising expectations, but it\u2019s not going to work. Even if they don\u2019t go to Mexico, a lot of jobs will be automated out of existence.\u201dThe ultimate impact of whatever Mr. Trump proposes and Congress approves will depend on whether the result is heavier on tax cuts and infrastructure spending or protectionist measures like higher tariffs, economists say.In any case, tax cuts and infrastructure spending plans are likely to be whittled down in Congress, especially if deficit hawks return to the fore. At the same time, rising interest rates and a stronger dollar will serve as a headwind no matter what comes out of Washington.The biggest economic danger under Mr. Trump comes from tariffs and other protectionist steps, especially if they provoke a response from the likes of China and Mexico. And unlike taxes and spending, where congressional action is necessary, with tariffs the administration has considerable latitude to impose them on countries it labels as unfair trading partners or currency manipulators.\u201cYou can make a case for leveling the playing field,\u201d Mr. Gapen said. \u201cBut the trade-off is more expensive goods for consumers.\u201d\u201cI could be convinced on 3 percent, but you can\u2019t get there in this environment,\u201d Mr. Behravesh said.Wherever growth ends up, the economy seems to have a feast-or-famine quality, which explains the disconnect between Mr. Trump\u2019s portrayal of conditions and that of Mr. Lawrence, the Trump supporter who is hiring in Sioux Falls.Nationally, the white-collar professional and business services sector, which includes advertising firms like Mr. Lawrence\u2019s, has added more than a million jobs in the last two years.Education and health care employment is up by a similar amount, and construction is showing signs of life.Manufacturing, on the other hand, has struggled, hurt by the strong dollar, automation and the continuing shift of production to cheaper overseas locales, which Mr. Trump has made a signature issue. Over the last two years, factories have shed 51,000 workers.Still, many of the states where recovery from the recession was slowest have gained ground more recently. Rhode Island\u2019s unemployment rate in the summer of 2009 was among the highest in the country at 11.3 percent, with huge losses recorded in the manufacturing sector.Now Rhode Island is benefiting from the opening of technology centers by General Electric, Johnson & Johnson and Virgin Pulse, part of Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin empire. The state\u2019s rate has been more than halved, to 5.3 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re approaching the national average, which is a real accomplishment given Rhode Island\u2019s history,\u201d said Stefan Pryor, the state\u2019s secretary of commerce.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Kerry: What We Got Right", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWith a new administration taking office this week, it is natural to assess the inheritance it will receive from the old.There are some who see nightmares wherever they look and insist that the entire global system is unraveling and that America\u2019s position as world leader is in precipitous decline.As the departing secretary of state, I cannot claim objectivity. But I will leave office convinced that most global trends remain in our favor and that America\u2019s leadership and engagement are as essential and effective today as ever.A major reason is that President Obama has restored assertive diplomacy as our foreign policy tool of first resort and deployed it time and again to advance our security and prosperity.This is evident, first of all, in our campaign to defeat the Islamic State, also known by its Arabic acronym, Daesh. Two and a half years ago, these murderers were on the march across Iraq and Syria. Instead of rushing into a unilateral war, we responded by quietly helping Iraq form a new and more inclusive government, and then assembling a 68-member coalition to support a rehabilitated Iraqi military, the Kurdish Peshmerga and other local partners to liberate territory once occupied by Daesh.We are engaged in a climactic effort to free the largest remaining strongholds in Iraq (Mosul) and Syria (Raqqa). These military steps depended on the diplomatic cooperation we brokered to cut off Daesh\u2019s finances, slow its recruiting and rebut its poisonous propaganda on social media and within the region.When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the United States could have responded as we had six years earlier, when Russian intervention in Georgia was largely met with rhetoric alone. But having repaired diplomatic ties badly damaged by the Iraq war, the Obama administration was able to defy skeptics by working with our European Union partners to impose sanctions that have isolated Russia and badly damaged its economy. We also bolstered NATO with a major expansion of our security assistance to allies in the Baltics and Central Europe.Throughout, we continued to work with Russia when it was in our interest to do so. But because we have stood firm, Russia is now \u2014 despite the boasts of its leaders \u2014 plagued by dwindling financial reserves, a historically weak ruble and poor international relations.President Obama has made clear to our allies and potential adversaries in Asia that the United States will remain a major force for stability and prosperity in their region. We have rallied the world behind unprecedented sanctions against a menacing North Korea, increased our naval presence in the Pacific, worked with regional actors to support the rule of law in the South China Sea and forged a strategic partnership with India. We also united key partners behind a landmark, high-standard trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that we still believe should be ratified by Congress \u2014 all while maintaining an often mutually beneficial relationship with Beijing.When President Obama took office, efforts to protect our planet from the catastrophic impacts of climate change were going nowhere, stymied by decades of division between developed and developing countries. But our outreach to China led to a series of breakthroughs that made last year the most consequential in the history of climate diplomacy. Building on, rather than backing away from, that progress would allow a historic shift toward clean energy and a chance of saving the planet from the worst ravages of climate change.The fruits of this administration\u2019s diplomacy can also been seen in our own hemisphere, where we strengthened our position by normalizing relations with Cuba and helped end Colombia\u2019s decades-long civil war. In Africa, we gained friends by training young leaders and led a successful global effort to contain Ebola.Obviously, we haven\u2019t solved every problem, particularly in the chronically combustible Middle East. But the United States was absolutely justified in stressing the need for a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians.I also remain convinced that the formula we pursued to end the agonizing conflict in Syria was, and remains, the only one with a realistic chance to end the war \u2014 using diplomacy to align key countries behind establishing a nationwide cease-fire, providing humanitarian access, marginalizing terrorists and promoting Syrian-led talks on creating a constitution and democratic government.The response of the international community to the tragedy in Syria will long be debated. For years, United States officials had those same debates in the Situation Room. Some options, such as an enormous deployment of ground troops, were rightly dismissed. Others, including deploying additional special forces in limited operations, were closer calls. Month after month, we weighed the deteriorating conditions and uncertain benefits of intervention against the very real risks, including deeper involvement in a widening war. While I did not win every argument \u2014 no policy maker does \u2014 I can testify that all viable ideas received a fair hearing.I am not a pacifist. But I learned as a young man who fought in Vietnam that before resorting to war, those in positions of responsibility should do everything in their power to achieve their objectives by other means.I just returned from Vietnam, where smart and sustained diplomacy has accomplished what a decade of war never could: developing a dynamic capitalist society, opening an American-style university with the promise of academic freedom and, perhaps most improbably, strengthening ties not just between our people, but also between militaries that once saw each other as enemies.Looking ahead, my hope is that the turbulence still evident in the world does not obscure the extraordinary gains that diplomacy has made on President Obama\u2019s watch or lead to the abandonment of approaches that have served our nation well.Diplomacy requires creativity, patience and commitment to a steady grind, often away from the spotlight. Results are rarely immediate or reducible to 140-character bites. But it has helped build a world our ancestors would envy \u2014 a world in which children in most places are more likely than ever before to be born healthy, to receive an education and to live free from extreme poverty.The new administration will face many challenges, like every administration before it. But it will take office this week armed with enormous advantages in addressing them. America\u2019s economy and military are the strongest in the world, and diplomacy has helped put the wind at our back, our adversaries on notice about our resolve and our friends by our side.John Kerry is the secretary of state.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Old Labour, New Labour, No Labour", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 The British Labour Party is in meltdown. After reviving the center-left in the 1990s, and then dominating British politics until 2010, Labour now faces the gravest challenge in its 116-year history. One of the oldest social-democratic parties in the world is fighting to survive; there is no guarantee it will.Many blame Labour\u2019s radical left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn, for this decline. Since being elected in 2015, and then re-elected last summer after nearly 200 of the party\u2019s members of Parliament staged an unsuccessful coup, Mr. Corbyn seems destined to lead Labour into oblivion. While his supporters point to an influx of new members, mainly middle-class, college-educated people in Southeast England, they ignore an exodus of support in \u201cMiddle England\u201d and Labour\u2019s industrial heartlands.The irreconcilably different views of voters in Hornsey and Doncaster reflect a widening divide that is eroding the electoral power of social democracy. It derives from the incoherence of a coalition that depends simultaneously on middle-class professionals in ethnically diverse liberal enclaves and less-well-educated, working-class whites in communities that feel forgotten or ignored.Today, the dilemma has been sharpened by a further shift, the rise of the new cultural divide that on another level is also cutting across the traditional social democratic base and will, in time, become even more important than the fading distinction between left and right.Social democracy\u2019s electoral crisis has also exposed the left\u2019s intellectual bankruptcy. The Labour Party no longer owns a single area of policy in British politics. When pollsters ask voters about the economy, housing, unemployment, health care, law and order, Brexit or immigration, most say they either support the governing Conservative Party or do not know which party to support. Amid rising inequality and a stagnant economy, the party that was founded for workers does not have a clear lead on any issue. Ideas have left the building.The question of what is to be done is not easily answered. In Denmark, where social democrats have talked tough on immigration, they maintained support but still failed to halt the advances of the populist right. In France, where socialists tried to stick to principle, they face electoral oblivion, while the nationalist right remains strong.In Britain, the Labour Party now faces the unenviable \u2014 some might say, impossible \u2014 task of coming up with a message that retains the backing of those who voted to remain in the European Union while winning back those who abandoned Labour and voted for Brexit. Meanwhile, the party\u2019s base is under attack from the right by the U.K. Independence Party and from the left by the Liberal Democrats. Both are winning voters who would historically be in Labour\u2019s coalition, whether pro-Brexit northern workers or pro-European southern social progressives.Since the Labour Party itself is internally divided, with some members of Parliament calling for controlled immigration while their leader doubles down on a policy of open borders, its prospects for repairing its fractured electoral coalition seem remote. Social democracy faced crises and defeats aplenty in the past, but its future was never in doubt. Labour now raises that doubt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Understand a Tax on Mexican Imports, Consider the Avocado", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byEnjoy the guacamole as you watch the Super Bowl on Feb. 5. Some of the ingredients might be a little more expensive next year.While many details remain unclear, here are a few indications of how the tax might work and how it would affect prices in the fruit and vegetable aisle at the supermarket.A third of all avocados eaten by Americans are grown in the United States and the rest are imported. More than nine of every 10 imported avocados come from Mexico, while most of the rest come from Chile, Peru and the Dominican Republic.The average retail price of an avocado varies considerably. Prices can creep up toward $1.50 for the Super Bowl and Fourth of July, the two biggest spikes in demand. The retail price falls toward $1 apiece around Christmas, as demand falters but the trees, grown in mild, subtropical climates, keep producing. Organically grown avocados have been commanding a premium of about 30 percent lately, a premium that has widened over the last few years.The tax would not end up being 20 percent of a $1 to $1.50 avocado, which would be 20 to 30 cents. That is because the import tax would only be on what is known a the dutiable value \u2014 the wholesale price of the avocado assessed when it crosses the border.That does not include the cost of trucking it from the border to a grocery store in the United States, the store\u2019s rent, the store\u2019s bills for air-conditioning and other utilities, or the wages for the store\u2019s staff. None of these costs would be subject to the tax, but can help determine the retail price of the avocado.For the first 11 months of last year, the average wholesale price of avocados crossing the border was 50 cents apiece.So a 20 percent tax on that wholesale price at the border would only add a dime to the cost of each avocado.It takes four or five years for a newly planted avocado tree to bear fruit. If an import tax were to be imposed on foreign avocados, American farmers could not increase production quickly. That means many Americans might have to pay for taxed avocados imported from Mexico and elsewhere for a few years, or potentially do without.That is right \u2014 a good guacamole needs onions, lime juice and a few other ingredients as well. Just look at onions.Seven out of eight onions eaten by Americans are grown in the United States. They also tend to be grown by companies \u2014 even the smaller-scale onion farmers tend to incorporate their farms \u2014 so they owe corporate tax.With those qualifiers, the introduction of a border tax is expected to produce enough revenue to offset the losses from lowering the tax on corporate profits to 25 percent, 20 percent or even 15 percent, depending on the proposal. That would ultimately help cut the tax bill for onion farmers.The whole idea behind the House Republicans\u2019 plan is that companies producing in the United States should pay lower taxes, so those companies can hire more workers. The tax burden would be shifted toward importers, but also toward people who buy imported goods.Companies tend to pass on the cost of taxes to consumers, while pocketing any tax savings, when there are only a few businesses in the industry and limited competition. The opposite can also be true: companies in highly competitive industries tend to pay extra taxes out of their own profits, because raising prices might result in lower market share. In those cases, they tend to pass on tax savings to consumers.Onion farmers might also use their tax savings to hire more workers and export more. The United States imports a few more onions than it exports, but most onion farmers simply grow for the domestic market. A corporate tax cut linked to a border tax might prompt them to expand globally, which is the whole idea behind a border tax.That is tough to predict, and also depends on inflation and other factors, not just the border tax. The odds are that a border tax would drive up the cost of guacamole, because avocados, not onions, account for most of the cost of making it, and most avocados are imported. But the details of the tax, and how markets respond to it, will also make a big difference.Advertisement"}

A stable democratic Mexico with a strong economy will do far more for our long-term national security than a wall could ever hope to accomplish.Taking actions that strengthen, not damage, Mexican society and its democratic institutions fights extremism and criminal activity. And, for those interested in controlling Mexican immigration, strengthening, not damaging, Mexico\u2019s economy reduces the motivation for Mexican citizens to emigrate from Mexico far more than the expensive concrete Band-Aid proposed by Mr. Trump.Instead of spitting on Mexico and proposing what are, in effect, economic sanctions, we should be working together to advance our shared interests.MICHAEL CURRYAustin, Tex.To the Editor:President Trump first said he\u2019d use taxpayer money to pay for the wall and later get reimbursed by Mexico, despite Mexico\u2019s adamant \u201cno\u201d on that point.Next, he said he\u2019d impose a 20 percent tariff on Mexican goods to pay for it.

{"Headline": "\u2018Gambia Is Back Again,\u2019 but Its New Leader Is Still in Senegal", "Date": "2017-01-22", "News": "Supported byBut first he has to get home.A coalition of other African countries sent troops into Gambia to evict Mr. Jammeh by force if necessary, and on Saturday night, Mr. Jammeh finally let go. He boarded a plane headed for exile, accompanied by the president of Guinea, who had gone to Gambia to persuade him to leave.Mr. Jammeh\u2019s first stop was Conakry, Guinea. But it was not clear where his final new home would be.The departure paved the way for Mr. Barrow to take over, but on Sunday afternoon, he was still at a house he owns in Dakar, trying to sort out the details of his return home. It could take several days yet; security advisers were scheduled to go to Banjul, the capital, on Monday to assess the situation and prepare for his safe arrival.Bleary-eyed after having awakened late in the morning, the unassuming president sank into a giant couch that seemed to absorb him, and spoke of his hopes for his administration.\u201cGambia is back again,\u201d said Mr. Barrow, who wore a shiny brown traditional gown and leather sandals. \u201cWe have been isolated for so many years, and we want Gambia to be very active again in this world.\u201dMr. Jammeh, who took office after a 1994 coup, imprisoned numerous journalists and political opponents during his tenure, some of whom died in jail. His rule was erratic, and made headlines for his claim to have cured AIDS with herbs, a prayer and a banana; he also called for beheading gay people. His actions prompted thousands of Gambians to flee the country, and the nation\u2019s weak economy prompted hundreds more to try to make the dangerous trek across the desert and the Mediterranean to look for work in Europe.More recently, an estimated 45,000 Gambians had rushed across the border to Senegal, fearing violence if Mr. Jammeh were forcibly removed from office, and causing the United Nations to worry about a humanitarian crisis. On Sunday, many of those Gambians began to return home.The document, which refers to Mr. Jammeh by his preferred honorifics \u2014 H.E. (for \u201chis excellency\u201d) Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr. Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh \u2014 goes on to say that the organizations that issued the report are committed to preventing the seizure of assets of Mr. Jammeh and his family and loyalists.And it says the organizations will work to ensure that in whichever countries offer \u201cAfrican hospitality\u201d to Mr. Jammeh and his family, they do not \u201cbecome undue targets of harassment, intimidation and all other pressures and sanctions.\u201dMr. Barrow said he had planned to create a truth and reconciliation commission to look into the Jammeh government. He said he would wait for the commission\u2019s recommendations before taking action.\u201cIt\u2019s a resolution; it\u2019s not an agreement,\u201d Mr. Barrow said of the document.Until last fall, Mr. Barrow ran a real estate agency in Gambia and was a fairly low-level member of an opposition party. But Mr. Jammeh began to jail the party\u2019s leaders, and Mr. Barrow found himself rising from the vacuum, assuming the party\u2019s candidacy for president and winning a surprise victory over the authoritarian Mr. Jammeh.The United Nations and Ecowas, an association of West African states, issued a document in the hope of ensuring an orderly transition of power in Gambia, after Yahya Jammeh, the incumbent president, resisted ceding his office to Adama Barrow, who defeated him in a presidential election in December.Mr. Barrow said on Sunday that his chief priority would be to work on improving the economy in Gambia, where there is widespread unemployment. But he offered no specifics, saying instead that he would assemble a team of experts to figure out how to get the economy back on track.He said he had planned to release anyone imprisoned in Gambia for political reasons, a hallmark of Mr. Jammeh\u2019s presidency and one that alienated him from human rights groups and many Western democracies.\u201cPolitical prisoners will be freed immediately when I get home,\u201d Mr. Barrow said. \u201cAll political prisoners.\u201dWhile a great many people in Gambia will welcome Mr. Barrow when he finally returns, Mr. Jammeh still has supporters. Many turned out in tears Saturday night to bid him farewell at the Banjul airport, where he arrived in his Rolls-Royce. Mr. Barrow said he did not think Mr. Jammeh\u2019s loyalists would present problems for his administration.On Sunday, some Gambians were appalled at the pomp that accompanied Mr. Jammeh on his way out. A military band showed up at the airport to play for him as he walked along a red carpet to a waiting airplane.\u201cThat man should have left this country in handcuffs,\u201d said Alpha Gaye, a taxi driver in Serekunda, just west of the capital. \u201cI will be very angry if Yahya Jammeh goes without punishment. He should die in jail.\u201dDionne Searcey reported from Dakar, and Jaime Yaya Barry from Banjul, Gambia.Advertisement"}

Here are excerpts from the interview, edited for brevity and clarity.The expectations for you from your many, many supporters are huge. What is your chief priority, once you get to the statehouse?The economy is our chief priority. We will get our cabinet in place. We want to get the experts in every area, so that they will design a blueprint for how to move forward. But the economy is No. 1.Your welcome-home speech to Gambians in exile must have been really heartening for them to hear. How can you also lure home the thousands of Gambian migrants who have gone to Europe? How will you dissuade other Gambians from joining them?I think these 22 years have been very, very difficult for everybody, basically, whether you live in Gambia or you live outside. This crusade was like everybody was part of it \u2014 the Gambian diaspora, Gambians locally, residents in the Gambia \u2014 everybody was involved in this. So you want everybody on board. Everybody has the liberty to come back home and offer your services in any area you feel you can contribute.Are there political prisoners to free? Are there human rights violations to mop up?There are a lot of them to be freed. There are a lot of people who are detained without trial. People who have disappeared and they have not been traced \u2014 we don\u2019t know if they are in the prisons. We will free all of them. Political prisoners will be freed immediately when I get home \u2014 all political prisoners.There were a surprising number of Jammeh supporters at the airport last night as he was leaving. Soldiers were crying. People were sad to see him go. Is that going to be a problem in your administration? Is there a divide in the country?They are in the minority. Even the security forces \u2014 they have been there for 22 years. Obviously, yes, he came to have good friends and sympathizers. But I think they are in the minority. It will not be a problem. It will take a little bit of time, but I think that as our government is established, they will see the difference. A democratic government is installed, a democracy that is run on the principle of the rule of law. Soon, everybody will appreciate the new government.It must have been an extraordinary week for you. You became president. You can\u2019t get to your own country until now. And you also lost a young son [who died in Gambia after a dog attacked him]. How are you dealing with all this? It\u2019s a very difficult situation. But if you are a politician, you have got to be strong. I am strong enough. I am in a foreign land, but very soon I will get back home. I have people on the ground who are effective and doing a very good job. So basically, it is not a big problem. But as the leader, I will get back home very soon, sooner than later.When you return, what will your policy be toward Mr. Jammeh and his supporters? Is prosecution still a possibility?Let me just get these things straight. We are not talking about prosecution yet. We want to get to office and have a truth-and-reconciliation commission. You cannot act without getting the truth, getting the facts. It\u2019s what we want to do first, as our first step, and we\u2019ll wait for the recommendation that we\u2019ll get from truth-and-reconciliation commission. Based on that, we will act.Across the world, people are watching the situation in Gambia unfold. There\u2019s been a lot of interest from America and in Europe, as well as in West Africa. What is the message you want to send now about Gambia? The message is, Gambia is back again. We have been isolated for so many years, and we want Gambia to be very active again in this world. We want Gambia to be very friendly, and we want to join all the international organizations, the Commonwealth, and to respect all protocols as the new Gambians.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Today: Trump Is a Blessing and a Curse for Trudeau", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byUsually, when a new president takes office in Washington, the only immediate issue involving Canada is whether the leader\u2019s first foreign trip will be to Ottawa or Mexico City.But after the inauguration of President Trump, Canada quickly became embroiled in more substantive matters.Long before he became prime minister, Mr. Trudeau developed a consistent stance on the energy industry and the environment. Canada can\u2019t deal with environmental issues like climate change without a strong economy, he has repeatedly said. And in Canada, the energy sector is a major part of the economy.Exactly what that means for Canada remains unclear. Mr. Trudeau, whose advisers were quick to reach out to Mr. Trump\u2019s aides after the presidential election, has been playing down the effects on Canada, suggesting by extension that Mexico is the new administration\u2019s target.In The Upshot, Neil Irwin looked into what Mr. Trump could do and what new talks might produce.\u201cThese ethics investigations are wonderfully unimportant,\u201d Ross Johnson wrote from Edmonton, Alberta. \u201cIt shows just how mature and steady Canada is: If this is the best we can do in the scandal department, then there really is nothing going on up here.\u201dOther readers said that while they would like to see fund-raising rules changed, they didn\u2019t think the sessions impaired Mr. Trudeau\u2019s fitness to govern. And several people said that while the vacation should have been disclosed in advance, it still wasn\u2019t an important transgression.But there were a few readers who did find Mr. Trudeau\u2019s actions improper.\u201cRegardless of how arm\u2019s length he says these meetings are, the optics are terrible,\u201d Philip W. Unger wrote from Millbrook, Ontario. \u201cFurthermore, politicians hardly have a sterling reputation for integrity when there is money on the line.\u201dHere are some articles from The Times over the past week, not necessarily related to Canada and perhaps overlooked, that I found interesting:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump Can\u2019t Make It 1981 Again", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byAs if Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory wasn\u2019t surprising enough, the economic reaction has been even more stunning. Despite forecasts of a stock market meltdown if he won, the market registered one of its strongest postelection rallies in more than a century. Now the euphoria is spilling into the wider economy, with business confidence skyrocketing and consumer confidence hitting a 15-year high. Much of this excitement is inspired by a growing consensus that Mr. Trump could be the most-business friendly president since Ronald Reagan.Indeed Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers say that over the next decade, their plans for tax cuts and deregulation could push the average annual growth rate back up to 3.5 percent \u2014 the same as during the Reagan presidency. Mr. Trump says the country can grow even faster. His backers dismiss skeptics as defeatists and have insisted there is \u201cno law of nature or economics\u201d that would prevent the United States from reviving the boom of the 1980s.Only there is such a law. The forces that underlie economic growth have weakened significantly since the Reagan years, worldwide. No nation, no matter how exceptional, can try to grow faster than economic forces allow without the risk of provoking a volatile boom-bust cycle.The potential growth rate of an economy is roughly determined \u2014 and limited \u2014 by the sum of two factors: population and productivity. An economy can grow steadily only by adding more workers, or by increasing output per worker. During the Reagan years, both population and productivity were growing at around 1.7 percent a year, so the potential United States growth rate was close to 3.5 percent. In short, Reagan did not push the nation\u2019s economic engine to run faster than it could handle.When Mr. Trump and his advisers promise to make America great again, they are in effect envisioning Reagan 2.0, while overlooking how much has changed. In recent years, America\u2019s population and productivity growth have fallen to around .75 percent each, generously measured, so potential economic growth is roughly 1.5 percent, less than half the rate of the Reagan era. Any policy package that aims to push an economy beyond its potential could easily backfire \u2014 in the form of higher deficits and inflation.The population and productivity formula is well known and undisputed \u2014 yet widely ignored amid the current euphoria.In the last 1,000 years, no economy has ever broken free of the limits imposed by population growth. Before the late 19th century, global population growth did not exceed half a percent, and global economic growth did not exceed 1 percent for any sustained period. Before World War II, population growth increased to 1 percent, and economic growth accelerated to about 2 percent. After the war, the baby boom pushed population growth toward 2 percent, and economic growth rose to nearly 4 percent for the first and only time in world history.Now, as families around the world have fewer children, global population growth has fallen to about 1 percent. The baby boom has gone bust, and the best any nation can do is contain the economic damage. With the United States population growth rate falling \u2014 last year to the slowest rate recorded since the 1930s \u2014 it is extremely unlikely that any president could juice the economy to grow at a steady 3.5 percent or more over the next decade.Slow population growth undermines the economy by delivering fewer young people into the work force. Nations can partly compensate by raising the retirement age or admitting more immigrant workers. Mr. Trump, however, has no such plans. His advisers focus instead on bringing back the many American workers who have given up on finding jobs and dropped out of the labor force. But this strategy can have only limited effect. The main reason fewer workers participate in the nation\u2019s labor force is not that they are discouraged, but that they are over 55, the age when many people stop working or work less.In general, commentators who believe the United States can go back to the 1980s focus not on population but on productivity. They argue that Reagan-style tax cuts and deregulation can increase investment in new plants and equipment, and substantially raise output per worker. But productivity is much harder to measure and forecast than population.Rather than enter that foggy debate, then, let\u2019s assume Mr. Trump\u2019s team can more than double United States productivity growth to the rate achieved in the Reagan era, 1.7 percent. Given the irreversible fact of slowing population growth, that productivity miracle would still raise the potential growth rate of the domestic economy to only around 2.5 percent. If that doesn\u2019t sound so different from 3.5 percent, consider that every percentage point of growth in the domestic economy is worth more than $100 billion \u2014 the difference between feeling pretty good and Great Again.The nub of the problem here is nostalgia for a bygone era. The postwar world grew accustomed to the rapid growth made possible by the baby boom. Not every country with rapid population growth enjoyed a steady economic boom, but few economies boomed without it. And for most countries, the era of population growth is now over.The pressure of falling population growth means that every class of countries needs to adopt a new math of economic success, and bring its definition of strong growth down by a full point or more. For developed nations like the United States, with average incomes over $25,000, any rate above 1.5 percent should be seen as relatively good.Comparing United States growth unfavorably to China\u2019s, as Mr. Trump has, makes little sense because poorer countries always tend to grow faster. If your starting income is lower, it\u2019s much easier to double it. But slowing population growth is also weighing on countries in China\u2019s income class, and for them the baseline for economic success should also be revised downward, to around 4 percent.The risks of excessive ambition are real. In recent years the actual growth rate of the United States economy has been about 2 percent, which is disappointing in comparison with the 1980s, but far from horrible, given its diminished potential. Often, if a country pushes the economy to grow much faster than its potential, it will start to suffer from rising debts and deficits. Inflation will rise, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates aggressively, which can prompt a recession. This risk is particularly high at a time, like the present, when the United States is already running the largest deficit ever recorded at this stage of an economic expansion.It will be difficult to persuade people to accept the reality of slower growth. Voters in many countries are already turning to populists who are promising miracles and attempting nationalist economic experiments. The coming era is likely to bring more such experimentation and diversion, but the new math of slower growth will remain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ditching T.P.P. Won\u2019t Solve the Trade Deficit", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThese steps make for great optics. But in economic terms, they\u2019re unlikely to move the needle. For the country to improve its trade balance, the president\u2019s going to have to do a lot more.Factors in the trade deficit include how much countries save and invest, the demand for traded goods and services, the relative competitiveness of the companies that produce them and, most important, exchange rates. Even as productive as they are, our manufacturers can\u2019t compete in foreign markets if exchange rates \u2014 the value of the dollar in terms of the currencies of our trading partners \u2014 are tilted against them.Next, countries have long used capital controls (e.g., taxing foreign asset purchases; limits on currency purchases) to block unwanted inflows of money that made their currency rise. There\u2019s a risk here: Such inflows can be a valuable source of investment capital. But they can also increase the value of the dollar, worsen the trade deficit, and inflate credit bubbles. I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised to see the Trump administration consider this route.As part of corporate tax reform, House Republicans are pushing a plan that subsidizes exports and taxes imports. That certainly sounds as if it\u2019s doing something about the trade deficit, but that may not be the case: In response to complaints by companies that depend on cheap imports, like big retailers, proponents of the tax argue that it will increase the value of the dollar enough to offset the tax (that is, it will lower the price of imports). If they\u2019re right, the trade deficit won\u2019t shrink.These are all big steps, but they may be worth it, given the global headwinds that are likely to drive up the deficit.Because America is growing faster than other advanced economies, and because the Fed has increased interest rates while other central banks are holding them at zero or below, the value of the dollar has risen by over 20 percent since mid-2014. That appreciation helped put the brakes on manufacturing jobs; employment fell 45,000 in the factory sector last year.And the dollar\u2019s rise has accelerated since the election, up 3.5 percent since Nov. 7. If this trend continues unabated, we could lose over 200,000 more manufacturing jobs over the next few years, my estimates indicate.In the 1970s and \u201980s, as trade deficits became persistent, politicians did not hesitate to respond through these sorts of interventions. Our obsession with unfettered markets has since precluded such efforts, even though our trading partners have not been nearly so constrained. President Trump\u2019s ascendancy may change that equation. The question is whether his administration will get it right.Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, was the economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Trade: Extreme Tactics in Search of a Point", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneJohn Mearsheimer, a noted political scientist at the University of Chicago, has long believed that China\u2019s rise will not be peaceful. Tensions with the United States will simmer as the Asian giant expands its influence.On Nov. 8, the odds of war with China got shorter.From his provocative phone call with Taiwan\u2019s president that infuriated Beijing \u2014 which considers Taiwan a rogue, breakaway province \u2014 to his heated claims that China steals American jobs, President Trump \u201cseems to be pursuing policies that raise the risk of an actual shooting war,\u201d Mr. Mearsheimer said.War would be a uniquely bad idea. China, after all, has nuclear weapons. But perhaps what troubles the professor most is that Mr. Trump\u2019s stand seems pointless. \u201cOne can justify provocative moves if they serve an important strategic goal,\u201d Mr. Mearsheimer told me. \u201cIt is not clear what purpose these moves are designed to serve.\u201dAnd yet pointlessness is coming to define American foreign policy. Mr. Trump lacks an end game.Security experts in the United States are baffled by Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order abruptly barring entry by citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries, noting that it will ultimately put the security of the United States at risk by sending a uniform message of hostility to 1.6 billion followers of Islam.In Mexico, government officials are scratching their heads about what Mr. Trump hopes to achieve by threatening to walk away from the trade agreement that has cemented bilateral relations for the last quarter-century. And who knows what Mr. Trump thinks the United States would stand to gain by leaving the World Trade Organization?\u201cWhat is a better Nafta?\u201d asked Douglas Irwin, a trade historian at Dartmouth College. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said.\u201dThe posturing is not entirely surprising. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals to wall off the United States from a variety of foreign influences fit the promises he made to his base of working-class white voters, resentful of how trade and immigration have changed the country they claim as their own.But Mr. Trump seems not to have grasped how consequential his proposals are. He is offering to kick down the set of understandings that shaped the cooperative equilibrium among the Western market democracies for more than half a century \u2014 a network of military alliances and trade agreements that underpinned the global order after the end of World War II.What\u2019s more, he shows no evidence of knowing what kind of alternative order he would like to build in their place. He is proposing a series of self-inflicted wounds with no ulterior goal in mind.Trade has contributed to economic growth, but changing dynamics have also prompted concerns about lost jobs and the trade deficit. But when something is manufactured in the United States, it is often made up of parts from around the world.Why did the United States enter into Nafta? In part because it believed it stood to gain from trade but also because it thought Mexico would gain, too, and understood the benefit of helping its southern neighbor into the club of prosperous market democracies. Why did it allow China into the World Trade Organization? Perhaps because it benefited from binding what would inevitably become the world\u2019s largest economy with a set of American-designed trade rules.Cordell Hull, President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s long-serving secretary of state and a key architect of postwar foreign strategy, once wrote, \u201cif we could increase commercial exchanges among nations over lowered trade and tariff barriers and remove unnatural obstructions to trade, we would go a long way toward eliminating war itself.\u201dMr. Trump has little patience for this thinking. The president understands international relations as zero-sum competitions. To win at trade, one must export, he believes. Importers lose. Mutually beneficial, win-win solutions are a figment of some diplomat\u2019s imagination. The idea that the Trans-Pacific Partnership might serve American interests by cementing critical alliances with China\u2019s neighbors in Asia is nonsense.Can he shape foreign policy around a worldview like that? \u201cThe trade deficit is the number that determines for him who wins and loses,\u201d Professor Irwin said. \u201cBut trade deficits are not determined by trade agreements. Trade agreements just determine the rules for trade.\u201dThere is, of course, the possibility that Mr. Trump is a strategic genius, out to gain an edge over the nation\u2019s rivals by convincing them he is prepared to engage in irrational, self-defeating behavior. \u201cIn foreign affairs, it makes sense to be insane,\u201d noted David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.And yet it is difficult to see the genius in Mr. Trump\u2019s first days in office. For starters, the crazy-person strategy works only in pursuit of some rational objective. What\u2019s his? Mr. Trump has yet to articulate one. Having a zero trade deficit is not it.Then there is the fact that Mr. Trump\u2019s macroeconomic strategy, which looks set to marry increased government spending with high interest rates, is in some tension with his objectives on trade: By strengthening the value of the dollar, it will make the trade deficit bigger.Finally, the problems that the president has resolved to tackle have largely petered out on their own. More Mexican immigrants are leaving the United States than coming in. And Chinese exports to the United States are actually declining.What if every other country goes down this path? A new tit-for-tat world would most likely be uncomfortable for the United States as well. To end in a war with China would hardly be inconceivable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dow\u2019s Record Rise Sends a Former Wall Street Stock Broker Back in Time", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byI returned to January 4, 1982, the day I began my short but illuminating career as a Wall Street stockbroker.On that day, the Dow Jones, an average of 30 blue-chip stocks that are industry leaders, closed at 882.52. Not 8,000. Eight hundred.Yes, before I became a financial reporter, I was what they used to call a customer\u2019s man. That\u2019s Wall Street parlance \u2014 from the early 20th century anyway \u2014 for people who bought and sold securities for investors.A glance at the nearby photograph of my graduating class of fellow stockbrokers in late 1981 shows that \u201ccustomer\u2019s man\u201d was still a fairly accurate term even when I entered the industry. Fact is, most brokers were male.Taken on Dec. 18, 1981 at the World Trade Center headquarters of Dean Witter Reynolds, the photograph shows 59 people who had just passed their regulatory exams and training programs and were ready to become brokers. (I am seated on the floor in the front row, fifth from left.)Ten were women, or roughly 17 percent of the class. Only one was African-American.My classmates came from all over the country, but I worked in Midtown Manhattan at a big branch of Dean Witter, a 1920s-era brokerage firm whose name disappeared after being swallowed up by Morgan Stanley in 1997.I spent only two years as a customer\u2019s man, but in that short span I learned an immense amount about how the financial world works and doesn\u2019t. I witnessed both the wonders and the woes of capitalism. I saw firsthand how the stock market can create wealth and take it away.When I took my seat at Dean Witter I didn\u2019t know that United States stocks were about to take off on their longest bull run in history. It didn\u2019t happen right away, of course \u2014 by August 1982, the DJIA had fallen about 100 points from its January level. But after that, it was off to the races, churning its way to over 2,700 by 1987. My timing was pretty good.On October 19, 1987, came the scary 500-point drop. But that turned out to be a hiccup, and soon the Dow was back in positive territory. It hit the 10,000 milestone in 1999.By then, I was no longer on Wall Street. Instead, I was on the outside looking in and writing about what I saw for The New York Times. Thanks to my years as a broker, though, I understood what was going on behind the scenes and could explain it to readers. It didn\u2019t matter that my experience had come decades earlier because very little on Wall Street ever changes.Soon after Dow 10,000, the average began to stumble. In 2000, the internet bubble burst, hammering investors\u2019 portfolios; then came 9/11 and the devastating accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Adelphia. That was a chastening period.So was 2008 and 2009, when the mortgage meltdown drove the economy into the ditch and markets to steep declines. Once again, the markets rebounded.Now, with the Dow topping 20,000, it seems a worthwhile moment to compare what\u2018s happening in the economy and on Wall Street today versus when I first inhabited that planet. There are some similarities but many differences.Today, we have a president who is also pro-business. But this time interest rates are in the cellar and rising, the economy is robust and investors are tripping over themselves to buy stocks. The upside from here, therefore, seems more limited.What about the Wall Street culture? Are things different today for women than they were in the 1980s? Yes and no.As my class photo indicates, customers\u2019 women were in the minority at investment firms back then. Across the nation, Bureau of Labor Statistics show, women made up approximately 24 percent of sales representatives in the securities and financial services industry in 1983. Blacks made up 3 percent.By 1995, women accounted for one-third of securities and financial services sales representatives, BLS statistics show. African-Americans made up just 6 percent.Those figures would seem to indicate that women have made strides at infiltrating Wall Street. But whether they are truly welcomed on trading desks and in brokerage firm offices is another question entirely. I wonder, for example, if more women on Wall Street means none of them has to endure, as I did, performances by female strippers brought into the office to honor a colleague on his birthday.Ah, the good old days.The bottom line about my experience on Wall Street: I got a lot more out of it than it got out of me.Wall Street learned that I was O.K. at bringing in customers. But I wasn\u2019t much good at generating commissions. My name was usually at the bottom of my branch\u2019s monthly revenue runs.Be wary of initial public offerings of stock, often propelled by investor exuberance whipped up by sales representatives wearing rose-colored glasses.And what if a top company executive comes across as a dope or dishonest? Trust your judgment and sell the stock.These are lessons that remain useful as we look forward to Dow 30,000.Advertisement"}

But how relevant are these examples to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s America?Allende, for example, was a real populist, who seriously tried to push up wages and drastically increased spending. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chilean government consumption spending as a share of GDP:That\u2019s huge; in the U.S. context it would mean boosting spending by almost $1 trillion each year.Is Trump on course to do anything similar? He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s selected a cabinet of plutocrats, with a labor secretary bitterly opposed to minimum wage hikes. He talks about infrastructure, but the only thing that passes for a plan is a document proposing some tax credits for private investors, which wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involve much public outlay even if they did lead to new investment (as opposed to giveaways for investment that would have taken place anyway.) He does seem set to blow up the deficit, but via tax cuts for the wealthy; benefits for the poor and middle class seem set for savage cuts.Why, then, does anyone consider him a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpopulist\u00e2\u0080\u009d?

{"Headline": "2016\u2019s Winning Investors Talk About 2017, and Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseLast year was one of unusually big surprises for markets \u2014 none more so than the election of Donald Trump. Not only were many money managers and experts dead wrong about his chances, but they were doubly wrong in betting on a big market sell-off in the event he won.Mr. Trump\u2019s victory kicked off a continuing stock rally that left the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index up nearly 10 percent by the end of the year, a gain few anticipated a year ago.Again this year, I turned to some prominent investors and market experts who successfully maneuvered through what turned into a treacherous year, asking them for insights into how they did it and what they expect in 2017.\u201cI was ridiculed,\u201d Anthony Scaramucci told me this week, referring to his early and vocal support for Donald Trump. Unlike many on Wall Street, the outspoken Mr. Scaramucci \u2014 the founder of SkyBridge Capital, host of a revived \u201cWall Street Week\u201d television show on the Fox Business Channel and author of several books on business and investing \u2014 went all in for Mr. Trump after initially backing Jeb Bush.Nor did the so-called Trump rally come as a surprise to him. \u201cTo put it simply, if you get a 35 percent corporate rate reduced to 15 percent or even 20 percent, you\u2019re looking at a 30 percent earnings increase for most companies,\u201d he told me as he took a short break from the Trump transition team.SkyBridge focuses mostly on hedge funds and other so-called alternative investments, but also offers a high-yielding stock mutual fund, the SkyBridge Dividend Value Fund. The fund gained over 15 percent last year, handily outpacing the S.&P. 500.As a long-only fund \u2014 one that invests in securities for their potential gains and doesn\u2019t short stocks, or bet on potential declines \u2014 \u201cwe benefited enormously from the Trump win,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that contrarians often get things wrong. But when they get it right, there\u2019s a tidal wave. Trump is an example. The conventional wisdom was that he couldn\u2019t win. Assets were priced relative to the conventional wisdom. So when he did win, there was huge upside.\u201dMr. Scaramucci attributes his contrarian view of Mr. Trump in part to the fact he lives on Long Island, a stone\u2019s throw from his working-class parents, and not among the Manhattan elite, even though he\u2019s an alumnus of Harvard Law School and Goldman Sachs. \u201cEveryone in the local bar, from the bluest- to the whitest-collar workers, was voting for Trump,\u201d he said.But Mr. Scaramucci isn\u2019t blindly contrarian. He did initially bet wrong on Mr. Bush. \u201cI pivoted,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone makes mistakes. The question is, How do you adapt? All entrepreneurs have to do that.\u201dNow Mr. Scaramucci is in the Trump inner sanctum as a member of the transition team, in a position not only to predict the future, but also to help shape it.Not surprisingly, he\u2019s bullish on the economy and stock market for 2017. He expects the kind of high-dividend, value-oriented stocks his fund invests in (some of its biggest holdings last year were Best Buy, Caterpillar and Boeing) to do well unless \u201cwe get to hyper-growth, in which case there will be a rotation to growth stocks.\u201dHe said fears of a Trump-induced trade war were overblown. \u201cNo one wants a trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we\u2019re calling for are fairer free-trade arrangements around the world.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re not coming at this from a position of ideological purity. There are a lot of practical business people in the room. We\u2019re not asking if something is right or left, but whether it\u2019s right or wrong.\u201dJerome L.

He champions the notion of doing well by doing good. \u201cCertain social and environmental values are really important to us,\u201d he told me this week.His fund doesn\u2019t invest in fossil fuels. He seeks out companies that treat their employees well and where turnover is low.In a highly competitive world where cutthroat capitalists scoff at such values, he\u2019s also emerged on top: His Parnassus Endeavor Fund is ranked by Morningstar as the No. 1 fund in its category (large-cap growth) over one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods \u2014 a remarkable feat.Mr. Dodson follows a highly disciplined approach that considers only companies trading at less than two-thirds of their intrinsic value \u2014 a subjective assessment of the actual value of a company, without regard to its market price \u2014 which makes him as much a value investor as a growth investor.He doesn\u2019t worry much about typical macro events or predictions, like the outcomes of presidential elections, the direction of interest rates, or oil prices. He doesn\u2019t claim to be much of a forecaster, and said he was surprised that two of his fund\u2019s positions \u2014 John Deere, the farm equipment icon, and Cummins, the engine maker \u2014 ended up doing so well last year. \u201cAll you can do is look for good companies that are undervalued,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to know when they\u2019re going to go up.\u201dA typical investment for his fund was the chip maker Micron Technology, whose shares had been battered by declining revenue and a global chip glut. Mr. Dodson calculated that Micron shares were trading at just one-third of their intrinsic value when he bought them for an average of $10.80 a share. Equally important, Micron \u201cis a great place to work, with good employee benefits and relatively low turnover,\u201d he said. Last year it was the Endeavor Fund\u2019s largest holding.This week it was trading above $22, more than double the fund\u2019s average cost. \u201cWe are holding onto the stock but wouldn\u2019t buy a lot more today,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.Indeed, with the market so high, it\u2019s getting hard for Mr. Dodson to find stocks that meet his intrinsic value criteria. Ideally, he\u2019d like to have about 40 stocks in the fund. Currently he has just 25.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say I\u2019m cautious about the coming year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s because valuations are so high.\u201dStill, \u201cif Trump can deliver some of what he\u2019s talking about, which is tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and the economy starts growing at 3 percent, then earnings will increase, causing the price-to-earnings ratio to come down,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would make me more positive about 2017.\u201dWill resurgent oil prices continue to drive markets?In all likelihood, yes, said Damien Courvalin, head of energy research for the Goldman Sachs\u2019s global investment research commodities team. Mr. Courvalin makes a rare return appearance this year, after pretty much nailing it in his forecast for 2016. Last year he predicted further weakness in oil prices, followed by a recovery by the year\u2019s end \u2014 which is just what happened.This year Mr. Courvalin and his team are predicting $59 a barrel for Brent crude over the next three to six months, with prices stabilizing in the longer term at $55 to $60.That\u2019s because a price much above $60 is likely to cause a supply surge, especially from United States shale producers.But Mr. Courvalin said investors should focus less on price than on inventory. When high current inventories drive down spot prices, high-cost producers are at a disadvantage, but can still sell forward futures contracts at a premium. More normalized inventories lower or eliminate that incentive and reduce price volatility, which is a benefit to low-cost producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia.Because of that shift in the forward futures curve, there is upside potential for oil and commodities investors even if price gains in the spot market are modest. \u201cYou want to see demand levels that are strong, and we\u2019re getting there,\u201d he said.This has little to do with Mr. Trump or his policies. While the president-elect is seen as likely to encourage higher United States energy production, a higher supply will be offset by stronger demand and a stronger dollar. In any event, it\u2019s likely to take years for any Trump policies to affect market supply and demand.\u201cWe expect oil demand to be good next year,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point in the business cycle where you can expect to see much better returns from commodities than from equities, based on historical patterns.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silence on Abortion Equals Death", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIn one of his first acts as president, Donald Trump introduced a ban on funding for any international organization that, anywhere in its health care programs, provides or even discusses abortions with patients, other than in cases of rape, incest or life endangerment.Known as the global gag rule because it prevents talking with women about the procedure, this ban has been enforced and revoked by different administrations since it was first imposed in 1984. It has been illegal to fund abortions as a method of family planning with U.S. money since 1973, but the gag rule pulls other family planning funding \u2014 for H.I.V. prevention or contraception, for example \u2014 if an organization even advises a patient on where to get an abortion. President Trump\u2019s rule goes even further, and pulls all global health assistance, including for programs that address infectious diseases like malaria, Zika and Ebola.Whenever this rule is instated \u2014 always by Republican presidents \u2014 health clinics around the world are often forced to close their family-planning programs because they are dependent on funding from the United States. Not providing abortion counseling to patients because of the political agenda of a donor means abandoning a standard of care that women rely on for basic health needs. Though technically the law allows for exceptions for rape, incest and life endangerment, organizations on the ground have insufficient guidance on how to follow those rules. Many either cut abortion counseling altogether or forgo funding.This is costly for everyone.A growing body of research over the past few decades shows that family planning services contribute to healthier lives and stronger economies. If President Trump really respected women the way he claims, he would support their health rather than endangering it.Serra Sippel is the president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facing Trump, Mexicans Think the Unthinkable: Leaving Nafta", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Not long ago, any suggestion that Mexico might walk away from the North American Free Trade Agreement would have been met with utter disbelief.\u201cThere could be no other option,\u201d Mexico\u2019s economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Tuesday in a televised interview. \u201cIf we go for something that is less than what we have, well, then there is no sense in staying.\u201dExactly how Mr. Trump\u2019s government is proposing to renegotiate that flow is still unclear. The Mexican government says that Mr. Guajardo and Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, expect to get a first look when they arrive in Washington on Wednesday for two days of talks with officials in the Trump administration.Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, is then scheduled to meet Mr. Trump on Jan 31.The Mexican government\u2019s talk of walking away from Nafta if the Trump administration demands terms that are too tough could be strategic bluster, a tactic to begin the discussions on stronger footing.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s government is trying to present \u201ca package deal\u201d to the Trump administration, in a tacit warning that the proposed wall would be an inadequate replacement for Mexico\u2019s help on migration and security.The message Mexico hopes to deliver is that \u201cif you build your wall, the wall will have to substitute everything that we used to do,\u201d said Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a former Mexican foreign minister.And by tying trade to security, Mexico will also be able to buy time in negotiations, contended Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, an adviser to former President Felipe Calder\u00f3n.More time could allow businesses in the United States that depend on Nafta, along with states like Texas that send billions of dollars in exports to Mexico, to make their own case for preserving the agreement.During the election campaign, Mr. Trump called Nafta \u201cthe single worst trade deal ever approved in this country\u201d and promised to renegotiate it or pull the United States out of it. He has threatened to impose a \u201cborder tax\u201d on companies that move factories to other countries and send their products back to the United States.So far, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has offered a ringing affirmation of Mexico\u2019s commitment to free trade.\u201cWe must preserve free trade among Canada, the United States and Mexico,\u201d he said Monday, laying out Mexico\u2019s foreign policy in the face of the Trump policy. \u201cTrade among the three countries must be free of any tariff or quota.\u201dBut the emerging belief that no Nafta may be preferable to years of fractious negotiations came into the open during a discussion this month at the elite university that is the brain trust of Mexico\u2019s free trade gospel.Many of Mexico\u2019s government ministers have studied or taught at the university, the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, or ITAM, and some of those who were the architects of Nafta were on hand to hear the rector, Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez, say the unthinkable.\u201cIt would be, perhaps, preferable to leave Nafta aside rather than a long process of negotiation and tension,\u201d Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez said.Many businesspeople have made peace with that idea.\u201cWe have our own principles that we have to defend,\u201d said Juan Pablo Casta\u00f1\u00f3n, the president of Mexico\u2019s Business Coordinating Council, a coalition of business groups.\u201cIf there aren\u2019t the right conditions, then we have to contemplate the possibility of not staying within the treaty and working with international rules instead.\u201dWithout Nafta, trade between Mexico and the United States would be governed by World Trade Organization rules, Mexican trade experts say. Tariffs for imports of Mexican goods into the United States would probably rise to an average of about 3 percent, an increase that experts say is not enough to deter trade.\u201cIt will not be the end of the world,\u201d said Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, the former adviser. Knowing this, he said, means that \u201cMexico can negotiate standing up.\u201dNot everybody is convinced that the government is prepared to walk away from the table.\u201cIn reality, up to now this is a negotiating tactic and not a position that they intend to take to its final consequences,\u201d said Carlos Heredia, a professor at CIDE, a Mexico City university. \u201cMaybe I am mistaken.\u201dLuis de la Calle, a former Mexican trade negotiator, said renegotiation may be limited to several technical issues, including the complex rules allowing products like cars and electronics \u2014 which contain parts from all over the world \u2014 to move duty-free through North America.\u201cWe need to try and keep emotions out of the negotiations,\u201d he said.Even with the barrage of Twitter messages and statements against Nafta from Mr. Trump, Mexico may have leverage in any renegotiation because it is such an important customer for American goods.\u201cOn the trade side, we understand what Trump says, but on the other hand, we have cards to play because we\u2019re the second-largest market,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister. \u201cWe can find much of what we buy from the U.S. elsewhere.\u201dMr. de la Calle argued that Mexico will become the largest market for American exports within five years, surpassing Canada. \u201cThe structural reasons for integration won\u2019t change,\u201d he said.\u201cWe Mexicans have patience; we take the long view.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexicans Are the Nafta Winners? It\u2019s News to Them", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byAPODACA, Mexico \u2014 In 30 years at Whirlpool, working at the company\u2019s manufacturing plant in this industrial Mexican town, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rico has witnessed some pretty major changes.The work force has grown, churning out refrigerators that look more like robots than the simple models of his early career. Fueling the changes was a free-trade agreement among Mexico, Canada and the United States that promised to lift Mexico into the future.What did not seem to go up, however, was Mr. Rico\u2019s salary. After a handful of raises, he still earns well under $10,000 a year \u2014 a sum, he argues, that hardly makes Mexico the big winner of the North American Free Trade Agreement that President-elect Donald J. Trump says it is.In fact, to Mr. Rico and many other Mexican workers, politicians and economists, Nafta does not feel much like a win at all.\u201cIt\u2019s more like survival,\u201d Mr. Rico said. \u201cI thought it would make my life better, that this agreement would create opportunities for everyone.\u201d\u201cMaybe it has,\u201d he added, nodding toward the Whirlpool logo on the entrance to the complex. \u201cJust not for us.\u201dHis argument has driven the narrative that where the American worker lost, the Mexican economy gained.But here in Mexico, there is an increasing belief that Nafta, despite drawing an enormous amount of investment to the country, has been a big disappointment.\u201cAt the end of the day, as a development strategy, it should have led to higher sustained growth, generated well-paid salaries and reduced the gap between Mexico and the United States,\u201d said Gerardo Esquivel, an economist at the Colegio de M\u00e9xico. \u201cIt has remained well below what was hoped for.\u201dMexico\u2019s economy has grown an average of just 2.5 percent a year under Nafta, a fraction of what was needed to provide the jobs and prosperity its supporters promised. More than half of Mexicans still live below the poverty line, a proportion that remains unchanged from 1993, before the deal went into effect.Wages in Mexico have stagnated for more than a decade, and the stubborn gap between the nation\u2019s rich and poor persists. A majority of workers in Mexico toil in the obscurity of under-the-table jobs at workshops, markets and farms for their survival.New technologies, meanwhile, have cut many jobs while increasing productivity, which is good news for businesses but a blow to the work force.\u201cMexico is seeing exactly the same phenomenon as in the United States,\u201d said Timothy A. Wise, a research fellow at Tufts University. \u201cWorkers have declining bargaining power on both sides of the border.\u201dIn part, Nafta\u2019s failure to achieve its potential falls on the Mexican government\u2019s shoulders, experts say. Rather than use the agreement as a launching point to grow and invest in many sectors of the Mexican economy, successive governments viewed the trade deal as a silver bullet for the country\u2019s economic woes.All of this is not lost on Mexicans, despite their government\u2019s defense of Nafta. A recent poll by Parametr\u00eda, a respected Mexican pollster, found that more than two-thirds of respondents believed that Nafta had benefited American consumers and businesses, while just 20 percent believed it had been good for them. The poll, consisting of 800 interviews in people\u2019s homes, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\u201cThere is a grand narrative in the United States that Mexico was the great winner of Nafta,\u201d said Fernando Turner D\u00e1vila, the secretary of the economy and labor in the industrial state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. \u201cMeanwhile, here in Mexico, they only see the benefits, which are glorified. They never see the downsides, much less talk about them.\u201dMr. Turner cited the loss of nearly two million jobs in the agricultural industry because of the treaty, which benefited highly subsidized industries in the United States like corn to the detriment of Mexican farmers. And while the federal government lauds the increase in manufacturing exports, Mexico still relies on a tremendous number of imports from the United States.\u201cThe Mexican government has not established policies to protect Mexican businesses,\u201d said Mr. Turner, himself a businessman, with factories in a half-dozen countries.That said, even critics like Mr. Turner do not want to see Nafta gutted. It is an imperfect deal, one that has failed to deliver on its promise, he said. But to terminate the treaty would be a disaster, he said, hurting both Mexico and the United States and creating even more job losses.It would also not happen easily, critics contend.After two decades, the two economies are tightly braided together. Goods manufactured by companies operating in both countries \u2014 whether speakers, cars or airplanes \u2014 cross the border multiple times during production, a shared manufacturing process that, if destroyed, would mean shared job losses.\u201cA lot of people are taking solace in the reality that it\u2019s very difficult for the U.S. to impose tariffs on Mexico without damaging the U.S. economy as well,\u201d said Christopher Wilson, a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Institute. \u201cYou need something to replace Nafta. Otherwise you\u2019re going to leave a lot of American workers out in the cold.\u201dThe agreement has certainly brought positive changes to Mexico, economists note. Since it went into effect at the beginning of 1994, billions of dollars in investment has been pouring into Mexico every year.Sleepy provincial towns have become manufacturing hubs. Workers assemble Ford Fusion Hybrid cars in the city of Hermosillo and Whirlpool refrigerators outside Monterrey. Tijuana sends flat-screen televisions across the border and the state of Quer\u00e9taro hammers out parts for helicopters and corporate jets.For two decades, those exports have been the main driver of growth in Mexico, which is why Mexico\u2019s government is so eager to defend the country\u2019s trade relationship with the United States.Without the agreement, the foreign investment that creates new jobs will slow, or even vanish, some fear. Mexicans got a forewarning of the possible effect this week. After poor sales and criticism from Mr. Trump, Ford announced that it would cancel a planned car plant in San Luis Potos\u00ed, a state that Nafta has transformed into a hub for auto manufacturing.\u201cMexico has done a lot right,\u201d said Gordon H. Hanson, a trade expert at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cIt has a lot to be proud of. It has developed a middle class that lives in cities, that educates their children. It\u2019s not the Mexico of 1993.\u201dThe image of these bustling factories feeds the idea that Mexico is responsible for the hollowing out of America\u2019s industrial heartland. But the reality has turned out to be much more complicated.In Mexico, the hope was to mimic the success of East Asia\u2019s so-called tigers, using free trade as the catalyst to modernize and overhaul the economy through exports. Instead, Mexico produced the exports, but not the growth. It even fell behind most other countries in Latin America during the 2000s.But Nafta was not necessarily the problem. Much of the misstep, experts say, was the Mexican government\u2019s belief that the agreement would be enough to transform the economy all by itself. Thinking of the trade deal as a panacea, the government failed to come up with a broader policy or make the investments needed to use the trade agreement as a lever to transform the whole economy.Investments in research and development, for instance, have failed to materialize in both the public and private sectors. Government spending on infrastructure has dropped to its lowest level in seven decades, experts say, leaving an unreliable network of ports, highways and even internet connections across the country. Burdensome regulation and corruption stifled investment, while the nation\u2019s banks lent far less than their Latin American peers, leaving small companies to scramble for credit.Even where Nafta is succeeding, it is not pushing wages up, or creating enough needed jobs.Rodolfo de la Torre, an economist with the Espinosa Yglesias Center for Studies in Mexico City, said officials initially hoped Nafta would bring jobs to the mass of poorly educated workers in Mexico. But by the early 2000s, much of that low-skilled work had left for China, where labor was cheaper.Jobs for better-educated workers in Mexico remained, in part because of the technological advances in the industrial plants.Now, in many of the manufacturing hubs of Mexico, wages, and hopes, have been frozen.For 10 years, Jorge August\u00edn Mart\u00ednez has driven a forklift for Prolec, a joint venture with General Electric that makes transformers. A father of two, he earns about $100 for a six-day workweek.Though he has received modest cost-of-living increases, his last raise was five years ago, when gas, food and household items were far cheaper, he said. It was also before his second son was born. Between housing, insurance, savings and other requisites, he is left with about $40 a week to buy food and other necessities for his family, he said.Some of the engineers in the plant make more, he said, but no one is thriving.\u201cWe\u2019re all the same, fighting to make ends meet,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who is very comfortable.\u201dAzam Ahmed reported from Apodaca, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Radical Right\u2019s United Front", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSocial and traditional media were, as usual, eager to spread the right wing\u2019s message, referring to a \u201cPopulist International\u201d led by Mr. Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin. This united front, many liberals worry, constitutes an existential threat to the world order.Skeptics seem to be proven right by post-World War II history, which shows a long trail of failed initiatives at nationalist collaboration.The clearest example of the disunity of today\u2019s radical right can be found in the European Parliament, where right-wing parties have been trying to build a strong coalition since the late 1980s. These efforts have largely failed, as member parties got into fights over ideological, personal and strategic issues.There\u2019s little reason to believe they\u2019ll be more successful collaborating now. As soon as Frauke Petry, the leader of Alternative for Germany, the party that played host to the conference in Koblenz, announced that Ms. Le Pen would attend, the German party\u2019s vice chairman criticized the decision, saying in an interview that Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front \u201cdoes not fit us at all.\u201dMost important, Europe\u2019s radical right parties do not always support one another. While all on the far right, they run a spectrum of extremism. More moderate parties, like UKIP, are uneasy being affiliated with more extreme groups, like the National Front. Other parties, like Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn, are beyond the pale for the National Front.These parties do share some common enemies, like an ill-defined \u201cglobalism,\u201d the Western political establishment and, most specifically, the European Union. But even on this core issue there\u2019s significant room for disagreement. Ms. Petry acknowledged as much in Koblenz: \u201cTogether with parties represented here we want a subsidiary Europe of the free home countries. We agree on this even if there are some differences in the details.\u201d Indeed, some of the parties represented on stage want to take their countries out of the European Union entirely, while others want only to \u201creform\u201d it.Still, the European radical right is in a better situation than it once was in terms of its international standing. In 2000, when Austria\u2019s Freedom Party became part of the governing coalition, the 14 other European Union member states boycotted its ministers. Moscow and Washington also strongly denounced them. In 2017, Europe\u2019s radical right leaders find that they are increasingly welcomed in capitals around the world, from Budapest to Tel Aviv, Moscow to Washington.Russia has taken a particular liking to the European radical right. Several of its leaders are regular guests on RT, a Kremlin-backed English-language television news channel. Representatives of Mr. Putin\u2019s United Russia Party have met on many occasions with European radical right leaders. And rumors swirl about Russian financial support for radical right parties, though so far the only evidence is of a loan from a Russian bank to France\u2019s National Front in 2014.But the specter of an ideologically coherent and organizationally united Populist International \u2014 one that already controls Moscow and Washington \u2014 wrongly suggests that right-wing populism is an unstoppable electoral force.In reality, liberal democrats are still much more united, ideologically and organizationally, than the right-wing populists. Europe\u2019s center-right and center-left parties continue to dominate politics both in individual countries and in European Union institutions. Despite recent tensions, they agree on the fundamentals of a social market economy, a tolerant multiethnic society and an integrated Europe.The way to fight the radical right is not to inflate its strength by seeing ideological alliances where they don\u2019t exist. Rather, liberal democrats should work together to exploit their opponents\u2019 ideological and personal divisions. For example, challenging them to provide more details on their desired \u201csubsidiary Europe of the free home countries\u201d or their plans to address refugees and terrorism, two key issues in their propaganda, will make the inconsistencies of their national and international plan more visible.This approach will not just weaken the radical right, it will force liberals to stop behaving defensively and, finally, put forward visions for liberal democracy based on their own issues and values rather than on overblown fears of a radical right on the march.Advertisement"}

He has said this before, his promise soaring as high as 80 percent.Most incoming administrations promise to streamline government, and most also freeze last-minute rules that their predecessors have been unable to finalize. Mr. Trump\u2019s blanket federal hiring freeze is a proven loser tried by presidents of both parties, and his talk of slashing most regulations is pure fantasy.Unfinished Obama rules swept up in the freeze include regulations aimed at making certain appliances more energy efficient, saving consumers money and reducing greenhouse gases.Unfinished rules, however, are the easy prey. Cutting three-quarters of the 90,000 federal regulations already on the books is sheer folly. To roll back even one rule requires a whole new rule-making procedure \u2014 writing a draft rule, taking public comment, writing a final rule, more comment, and so on \u2014 that takes many months. The process, while imperfect, is designed to prevent a president or Congress from capriciously slashing regulations which, after all, were created to protect Americans, their workplaces and environment.Mr. Trump\u2019s team, aiming to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental record, has targeted a lot of important stuff \u2014 greenhouse gas regulations for power plants, fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, a long overdue rule updating the Clean Water Act. But Mr. Trump cannot eliminate or even modify these rules with the simple stroke of a pen.Can Mr. Trump do better? The prospects are poor.

Kaufman, managing director for fixed-income strategy at Osterweis Capital Management. \u201cThe question is: Does it continue?\u201dMr. Kaufman said that investors aren\u2019t likely to find that out until at least the first few months of the Trump presidency. But he said he thought \u201cthe markets are going to take a breather and see what happens until then.\u201dIn the meantime, market strategists warn investors not to dramatically overhaul their core fixed-income strategy.To be sure, many investors believe that the smartest strategy in 2017 is not to fight the Federal Reserve or fiscal stimulus.With the Fed indicating that there could be three modest rate increases in 2017, after the central bank\u2019s quarter-point rise in December, investors are generally being advised to \u201cshorten up\u201d their bond portfolios by putting new money to work in short-term debt that will lose less value than long-dated bonds when market rates rise.Even if the Fed is overestimating the number of rate increases to come \u2014 as policy makers did in 2016, when they entered the year forecasting four rate increases but only delivered one \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re not being paid a lot to extend out\u201d in terms of maturities, said Jeff Klingelhofer, a portfolio manager and managing director at Thornburg Investment Management.At the same time, the Trump administration\u2019s calls to lower household and corporate tax rates and to increase spending on infrastructure projects are expected to energize growth \u2014 or at the least breathe some new life into an aging economic recovery that\u2019s been unfolding for nearly eight years. And these stimulative policies are generally viewed as a sign that it\u2019s safe to bet on institutions with less-than-pristine credit.But within this framework, fixed-income strategists advise investors to err on the side of caution.\u201cThe markets have mostly overreacted at this point,\u201d Mr. Klingelhofer said. \u201cMost investors would agree that we\u2019re in the later stages of this recovery \u2014 maybe we\u2019re in the seventh inning, maybe the eighth, but we\u2019re not in the second inning when it comes to growth.\u201dTherefore, he said, even if investors want to add to their high-yield exposure, the prudent move may be to focus on the higher-quality end of the junk bond spectrum \u2014 for instance with a bond rated BB or B.Andrew C. McCormick, head of T. Rowe Price\u2019s United States taxable bond team, said that with the Fed poised to continue lifting short-term rates, there may be a more attractive way to gain exposure to the noninvestment grade market: bank loan securities with interest rates that float with market rates.Bank loan funds post gains when rates are on the rise, but this is particularly true now that the Fed\u2019s December increase has pushed the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, up to 1 percent. While rates on bank loan securities generally float with the market, in many cases that only happens if Libor is at or above 1 percent.With Libor at that threshold, this form of noninvestment grade debt should have more appeal.Moreover, the typical bank loan fund has about one-tenth the exposure to the energy sector as high-yield bond funds do. While energy prices have recently stabilized, plummeting prices in 2015 led to a jump in the default rate for high-yield debt early last year.Bank loans also sport ultrashort maturities. The average bank loan fund has a duration of less than 0.4 year, implying that if market rates were to rise by 1 percentage point, these funds would fall less than 0.4 percent in value. By contrast, the average duration of a junk bond fund is 3.6 years.\u201cYou\u2019re taking virtually no duration risk in bank loans,\u201d says Kathy A. Jones, chief fixed-income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Meanwhile, she adds, bank loan debt hasn\u2019t had the run-up that high-yield bonds have enjoyed.Kate Warne, an investment strategist with the brokerage Edward Jones, said investors shouldn\u2019t assume too much when it comes to the bond market.For example, while it may seem certain that rates are poised to rise, \u201cthe Fed has overestimated the number of rate hikes they expect pretty consistently,\u201d she said. Moreover, with bond yields generally higher in the United States than overseas, foreign money will continue to pour into domestic bonds, which should keep a lid on how high rates can rise.This is an argument for sticking with a traditional strategy like a bond ladder, she said, in which investors divide their fixed-income stake into bonds maturing in routine intervals to mitigate interest rate risks.Rather than abandoning the laddered approach by selling longer-dated bonds, investors may choose to add to their cash stake to take advantage of rising rates sooner. \u201cBut don\u2019t ignore intermediate- and long-term bonds,\u201d she said.Ms. Jones of Charles Schwab said that investors may think they know what\u2019s to come in the economy or from the Trump administration in 2017, \u201cbut in reality, we are operating under a cloud of uncertainty. Everyone may be expecting taxes to be cut or counting on infrastructure spending, but we simply don\u2019t know what the specific policy prescriptions will be,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Sudan Cannot Be Allowed to Collapse", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCOLLEGE STATION, Tex. \u2014 If the conflict in Syria tops the list of the world\u2019s worst civil wars today, the one in South Sudan is a close second. Over the past three years, more than three million South Sudanese civilians have been displaced inside the country or have fled abroad because of fighting and atrocities \u2014 including more than 340,000 just to Uganda over the past six months.A special commission of the African Union concluded in October 2015 that war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed, by the government of South Sudan \u201cpursuant to or in furtherance of a state policy,\u201d and by opposition forces, too. Famine is spreading. The state is effectively bankrupt, and the economy is collapsing. The inflation rate reaches triple digits.South Sudan formally seceded from Sudan in July 2011 after more than two decades of a civil war that killed over two million people, a peace agreement and a referendum. By December 2013, fighting had broken out again in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, between rival militias supporting President Salva Kiir and the recently dismissed vice president, Riek Machar. (Mr. Kiir alleged that Mr. Machar was plotting a coup, but no credible evidence of that has surfaced.) The political struggle between Mr. Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and Mr. Machar, an ethnic Nuer, soon took on tribal overtones, causing tens of thousands of deaths in communal fighting.In the summer of 2015, mediators from the East African organization known as IGAD imposed a peace settlement, with support from the United Nations, the United States and the European Union. I say \u201cimposed\u201d because Mr. Kiir\u2019s faction only signed it under the threat of individual financial sanctions and an arms embargo. The agreement divvied up positions in the government of South Sudan among the recalcitrant leaders of the main groups, who balked at sharing power with the very people they had just fought. Many smaller groups were left out.The deal promptly collapsed. Hatred and distrust were too deep-seated. No institution was given authority or adequate leverage over the parties to enforce the extraordinarily complex peace agreement or resolve any related disputes. The parties committed flagrant violations of the cease-fires to which they were ostensibly bound. In July 2016, fighting erupted again in Juba between the forces of Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar. Mr. Machar fled abroad after being hunted down by the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army (S.P.L.A.). The conflict has since taken on even more ethnic and tribal dimensions, and caused more mass atrocities, most recently in Equatoria, a southern province.There can be no military solution to the conflict today: Neither the government nor any other group has enough power to impose one. The army is trying to hold the country together by brute force, but is failing, because it is fracturing itself and its combat strength is deteriorating.The multitribal coalition that won the civil war against Sudan is dead. Between the late stages of the conflict between north and south, in the late 1990s, and South Sudan\u2019s independence in 2011, the S.P.L.A. attracted young men from most southern tribes. By now, it has devolved into a militia of Dinka soldiers from the southwestern province of Bahr el-Ghazal, the home region of Mr. Kiir and the S.P.L.A. chief of staff. Troops from most other tribes have regrouped to form their own militias. The army is balkanizing. The only effective weapons it still has are helicopter gunships and fixed-wing bombers, which can cause much destruction but cannot win a war.Any solution to the current crisis must be political. Yet the bloodletting since December 2013 has been so terrible, the atrocities so horrific, that current leaders on all sides have lost too much credibility to form a new government, or even usefully participate in negotiations over a political settlement. They are lightning rods for the grievances of other tribes and groups. And the 2015 agreement\u2019s failure is evidence that settlements imposed by outsiders without broad local support ultimately fail.The only way forward, in other words, is for new local actors to broker a new political settlement, with outsiders acting as only supporting cast during the negotiations but guaranteeing its enforcement after it is signed. A similar model was used successfully during the 2002-4 negotiations between north and south, leading to the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended the war. (I was involved as the U.S. government\u2019s special humanitarian assistance coordinator for Sudan and the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development.)Current leaders on all sides would have to be offered a graceful exit toward a foreign country and guarantees that they would not face criminal prosecution. An interim national government comprising leaders not involved in the crisis would have to be formed to allow for a cooling-off period.And enough with all the useless African Union and United Nations resolutions. By my count, the U.N. Security Council has passed at least 27 resolutions on Darfur since 2004, appointing study committee after study committee, and repeatedly warning the Sudanese government in Khartoum to stop committing atrocities. Yet President Omar al-Bashir, for one, has flouted them, and fighting and abuses continue in Sudan.The new U.S. administration should promptly appoint a high-profile public figure as special envoy for South Sudan \u2014 perhaps a former governor or member of Congress \u2014 whose role would partly be to deliver a tough message: A zero-tolerance policy for atrocities committed by any side. The U.S. government should back that warning by threatening to confiscate ill-gotten wealth held abroad by South Sudanese leaders; negotiating a way for leaders involved in the current crisis to leave the country; jamming hate speech broadcasts on the radio; shutting down cellphone towers used to encourage ethnic cleansing and monitoring military activities via spy satellites.The chances of success are slim, but the alternatives are even less promising and the current situation will surely deteriorate. If the violence worsens, or simply continues, refugees will keep pouring out of South Sudan and destabilize the region. The word in diplomatic circles is that some neighboring states are already devising plans for occupying parts of South Sudan if the chaos spreads.The world\u2019s youngest country must not be allowed to go from independence and great promise just a few years ago to war and famine today, and occupation and collapse tomorrow.Andrew S. Natsios is director of the Scowcroft Institute of International Affairs and executive professor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. He was United States special envoy for Sudan in 2006-7.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Its Third Month, India\u2019s Cash Shortage Begins to Bite", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byThen the 29-year-old lost his job when the ensuing cash crunch hit demand for motorcycles and scooters sold by the company where he worked, Hero MotoCorp Ltd. After that, the prospective in-laws refused to let the wedding go forward until he found another job.\u201cSo I lost my job and I lost my marriage,\u201d he said in an interview at a protest, where he shouted slogans with more than 100 red-flag-waving workers let go by Hero.Mr. Rathore is one among a large number of Indians \u2014 the precise number is not known \u2014 who have lost their jobs since Nov. 8, when Mr. Modi abruptly banned 86 percent of the country\u2019s currency in a bid to eliminate \u201cblack money,\u201d currency on which taxes had not been paid.For the sake of secrecy, the government largely avoided printing replacement notes in advance. So there has been an acute and protracted shortage of cash as the government struggles to catch up. That, in turn, has proved economically damaging.Exactly how harmful remains hard to determine, but the available data is not reassuring. Demand for vegetables is declining because people don\u2019t have the money to pay for them, for example, and some service industries are reporting steep job losses.The International Monetary Fund this month cut its projected growth rate for India by one percentage point for the current fiscal year, to 6.6 percent. While the full impact is still difficult to discern, there is little doubt who is suffering the most. \u201cThis has actually hurt the poor enormously,\u201d said Nasser Munjee, chairman of DCB Bank and a company director at HDFC and Tata Motors.Many of them, even children, are forced to go without fruit, vegetables and milk \u2014 now unaffordable luxuries. Most had not paid apartment rents and their children\u2019s school fees in the months since the cash ban. Many had sent their families back to their villages, and were ready to give up and follow if things did not turn around soon. Sending cash to the elderly parents they had long supported is now out of the question.As is common in India, the workers said that although they had worked on Hero MotoCorp\u2019s shop floor, wearing company uniforms, they had been formally employed by other contractors, meaning they could be let go more easily without benefits.Sunil Kumar, 28, who had been earning 15,000 rupees a month, about $220, at Hero, said he had been supporting his wife and two children when he lost his job without notice Nov. 29. They immediately cut milk, green vegetables and fruit from their diets, including for their 3-month-old and 3-year-old children. Paying rent is out of the question.\u201cThis is like a massacre for us,\u201d he said. \u201cMy livelihood is gone after the cash ban. What do I do now?\u201dThe decline in vegetable demand is so steep that the prices of eggplants, potatoes, cauliflower and tomatoes dropped between 42 percent and 78 percent, the NCDEX Institute of Commodity Markets and Research said.In the first month alone after the currency ban, micro and small-scale service industries cut staff by 35 percent, the All India Manufacturers\u2019 Organization said, based on a survey. It released a study this month saying that job losses in a variety of industries, including automobile parts, infrastructure and construction, would swell to as much as 35 percent by March.The anecdotal evidence is painful. Mr. Rathore, whose wedding was postponed, is among 582 workers who reported losing their jobs at Hero MotoCorp in November and December, as the company suffered a 34 percent drop in two-wheeler sales in December from a year earlier. Hero did not respond to requests for comment.Most economists believe the economy will rebound, but nobody knows how long it will take.In Noida, a satellite city of New Delhi, hundreds of unshaven men in rumpled clothing stood recently at a three-way intersection called Khoda Labor Chowk that is a gathering place for people seeking work.Before the currency ban, they told us, they would be hired most days, earning 400 to 600 rupees, about $6 to $9, for a day of carpentry, floor tiling or masonry. But since the ban, most interviewed said, they had worked for only a week each month, at best, and even on the few days when they were hired their wages had fallen by half.Rafiq Ali, 46, said that, having worked only 12 days in the last two months, he had sent his wife and two children back to his native village about 200 miles away, where it is cheaper to live.\u201cI am surviving on roti and potato with salt,\u201d Mr. Ali said, referring to the flat Indian bread that is a staple in the Indian diet. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped taking milk, even in tea, and eating vegetables.\u201dBut what hurt him most, he said, was a recent call from his wife, back in the village, who wanted money to take their sick daughter to a doctor. Mr. Ali said he had nothing to send.\u201cA sense of desperation and helplessness is emerging,\u201d he said. \u201cThis currency ban is not helpful for poor people.\u201dHoti Lal, a 38-year-old father of three, said he could get work for only six days during the last two months, forcing his family to survive on money his 18-year-old son made cleaning offices. Mr. Lal had hoped his son could give up that job to go to college, but that dream is fading fast.His son\u2019s salary of 7,000 rupees a month, a little over $100, is about half of what he used to earn regularly, Mr. Lal said. So, Mr. Lal said, his family has cut back entirely on green vegetables and milk.Almost every man we interviewed said he was a migrant who had been sending a portion of his salary home to support his parents in his native village \u2014 and had been unable to do so since the currency ban wiped out work.Vikas Sahu, 30, who had been working at Hero for four years, has been unable to send money back to his parents, wife and children, who live in his village about 100 miles west of New Delhi. His first grader\u2019s school fees are overdue by months, and his father took out a loan of 70,000 rupees, about $1,000, for agricultural expenses, including paying for repairs on the family\u2019s tractor.\u201cHow long I can survive like this?\u201d he asked.With little else to do, Rakesh Yadav, 28, shows up most days to protest, hoping for some relief from the government or some upbeat economic news that might induce Hero to begin rehiring. He had worked there for eight years as a machine operator on the shop floor.To cut costs, his wife and daughter went home to his village. He gave up the one room they had shared at a monthly rental of 3,300 rupees, or about $50, and moved in with four other men who share a room.\u201cI do not know where to go or what to do,\u201d he said.Mr. Rathore said he thought about giving up and returning to his village in Bilaspur district, about 750 miles south of Delhi, but he just cannot bear to do so, at least not yet.\u201cWhat can I do in my village?\u201d he asked.Follow Geeta Anand on Twitter @goanand and Hari Kumar @HariNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Along New York Harbor, \u2018On the Waterfront\u2019 Endures", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byOn an overcast Friday morning last January, longshoremen all over New York Harbor walked off the docks, bringing the port nearly to a stop for a day. What were the longshoremen\u2019s grievances? What were their demands? Many of the men seemed not to know. They hung around the food trucks and milled about the parking lots, unsure why they had stopped working and unsure what it would take for work to resume.\u201cNo one knew what that was about,\u201d one recalled recently.A year later, the reason for the strike remains unclear, even as the agency tasked with ridding the waterfront of organized crime, the Waterfront Commission, has questioned dozens of longshoremen under oath. One told the commission he learned of the strike early that morning, when it was too dark to see the face of the man giving the order. It could have been anyone.It was the old D & D \u2014 Deaf and Dumb, the classic longshoreman\u2019s response, popularized in the 1954 film \u201cOn the Waterfront.\u201dIn that movie, the longshoremen were reluctant, even frightened, to talk to the authorities, whether a priest or a detective, because the mob controlled the waterfront. In the years since, much has changed around New York Harbor; the heavy lifting is done not by hand but by cranes, and human voices are scarcely heard amid the beeping of the straddle carriers, giant insectlike machines that move containers back and forth. But even as New York and New Jersey\u2019s increasingly valuable shoreline is claimed by luxury development, investigators say the mob is still present.It is where the daughter of one of the mobsters made famous in the 1997 film \u201cDonnie Brasco\u201d is up for a job; where the nephew of another famous mobster pulled down more than $400,000 in a single year because he was almost never off the clock, not even when he was at home sleeping; where three consecutive presidents of a Newark longshoremen\u2019s union were convicted of extortion. There is physical evidence as well, like the $51,900 wrapped in cellophane that was discovered buried in the backyard of a longshoreman. It was, according to federal agents in a 2010 affidavit, the tribute that a group of Newark longshoremen paid the Genovese crime family each Christmas.\u201cYou will need another generation or two to get the mob out of this port, because they are very well entrenched,\u201d said one longshoreman who requested anonymity because of a concern for his safety and his livelihood. Those who step out of line, he said, face being reassigned from high-paying jobs unloading container ships to the cruise ship terminals, where the work and the pay is far less.Container ships generally head across the harbor to New Jersey, toward the ports of Elizabeth, Newark and Bayonne. They unload at a number of terminals, one of which is owned by a Canadian teachers\u2019 pension fund. The pay is pretty good on the docks \u2014 plenty of longshoremen make well over $100,000 \u2014 but the work is often dreary and dangerous.\u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing about this port,\u201d a hiring agent at Port Newark named Pasquale Pontoriero was overheard saying in a 2009 wiretap, a few years before his license was revoked because he had associated with organized crime figures. \u201cI call it the Broadway of broken dreams.\u201dPerhaps the starkest difference at the port today is in how many machines there are, and how few people. A century ago New York Harbor employed 40,000 longshoremen, who unloaded ships with hook and sling and brawn. Today, the entire workforce is just under 3,400 longshoremen, many perched behind the controls of cranes and straddle carriers.Yet amid all the transformation, some investigators say, racketeers and mobsters are still as present as the barnacles attached to the piers.In the view of Walter M. Arsenault, the executive director of the Waterfront Commission, the fundamental relationship between the waterfront and the mob remains unchanged since \u201cOn the Waterfront.\u201d\u201cThe only difference is now, it\u2019s in color,\u201d Mr. Arsenault said.He based that assessment on several indicators, such as the number of relatives of organized-crime figures who continue to hold choice jobs, many of which involve little work and pay unusually high salaries, like the union shop steward position held by Ralph Gigante, the nephew of the boss of the Genovese family, the late Vincent (Chin) Gigante. Ralph Gigante earned $419,000 in 2014, and has said he believes he holds the union office for life \u2014 \u201cuntil death do us part.\u201dThere is also the fact that some of the same New York and New Jersey union officials whom federal prosecutors have in the past accused of racketeering have since risen to the top ranks of the East Coast waterfront union, the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association.The Justice Department, which has lost two cases against Mr. Daggett, has described him as an \u201cassociate\u201d of the Genovese crime family whose rise through the union ranks was part of the mob\u2019s plan. A good portion of the Justice Department\u2019s evidence against him came from the testimony of an aged mob turncoat, George Barone, who had once been a waterfront enforcer for the Genovese family and who described Mr. Daggett as thoroughly under the mob\u2019s control.During that trial, one of Mr. Daggett\u2019s co-defendants, a reputed mobster named Lawrence Ricci, went missing. Several weeks after the men were acquitted, Mr. Ricci\u2019s decomposing body was found in the trunk of a car outside a New Jersey diner. The murder, which Mr. Arsenault said is the last known waterfront killing, remains unsolved.But Mr. Daggett\u2019s lawyer in that 2005 trial, George Daggett (his cousin), said in a recent interview that \u201cthe mob on the waterfront is a myth\u201d \u2014 something that has not been true for half a century. Mr. Daggett, who frequently represents longshoremen in litigation with the Waterfront Commission, said that the agency prefers to pretend \u201cwe\u2019re still in the \u201950s.\u201d\u201cThey can\u2019t say, \u2018We got rid of the mob,\u2019 because then there\u2019s no reason for them to be in existence,\u201d George Daggett said. \u201cI challenge them to prove mob influence on the piers. What have they come up with? A couple of guys here and a stray guy there?\u201dThe mob\u2019s grip over the New York waterfront began nearly a century ago and was predicated on a few simple facts: The work was uneven, depending on a ship\u2019s arrival time, and yet the cargo needed to be unloaded quickly, so that produce did not spoil and the shelves of America\u2019s stores could remain stocked. Gangsters quickly realized that the piers were the choke point of the economy, and that a dizzying array of rackets were available to them. They pilfered cargo as it came ashore and extorted truckers who had come to collect cargo or drop it off. And, most cruelly, the mob controlled which of the longshoreman would be selected to work.Theirs was some of the most dangerous work in the country, but longshoremen had to beg to get it. At the shape-ups on the piers, where longshoremen would gather each morning in the hope of joining the group that would work on an arriving ship, it was common for a man to place a toothpick behind his ear, a signal that he would kick back some of his pay.All this began to change with containerization, as goods were no longer shipped loose but packed into containers that stacked efficiently, and transferred easily between ships and trucks and trains. With cranes doing the lifting, the number of longshoremen plummeted by more than 90 percent. Today, advances in automation threaten to reduce the number of longshoremen even further.As the workforce dwindled, the remaining jobs became well paid. This was a result of a shrewd move by the longshoremen\u2019s association: The union negotiated a flat fee, today roughly $5 a ton, that the shipping industry would pay into various funds to provide an income for laid-off longshoremen and supplement the benefits and income of those who would work fewer hours as a result. As global trade has soared, the few longshoremen who remain have seen their paychecks grow.The waterfront today has largely receded from the city\u2019s consciousness and even its geography. And to some extent, so has the mob. Decimated by mass prosecutions over the last three decades, New York\u2019s five crime families have struggled to adapt. While there have been some new, profitable ventures, like online gambling, the waterfront still exerts its own pull. Mr. Arsenault referred to the waterfront as the mob\u2019s \u201clast candy jar.\u201dIn recent years, the union has brazenly recommended friends or relatives of organized crime figures for jobs on the docks, said Phoebe S. Sorial, the general counsel for the Waterfront Commission. She said the union has sought waterfront jobs for \u201cpeople who posted bail for organized figures\u201d and \u201cpeople who are in business with organized crime figures,\u201d along with any number of relatives.In 2014, for instance, the union recommended the 62-year-old daughter of one of New York\u2019s most famous mobsters, Benjamin (Lefty) Ruggiero (played by Al Pacino in the film \u201cDonnie Brasco\u201d), Mr. Arsenault said, adding that other such cases abound.\u201cYou can\u2019t throw a rock on either side of the waterfront without hitting a brother, son or daughter of a made member,\u201d Mr. Arsenault said, using the terminology for someone who has been inducted into a crime family.The bi-state Waterfront Commission was formed in 1953 to fight organized crime on the docks. For many years, before it came under new leadership in 2008, it was a scandal-scarred and sleepy agency. Since then it has focused on extensive background checks, mapping the familial relationships between mobsters and longshoremen \u2014 an elaborate genealogy project.The Gigantes, for instance, have 10 relatives \u2014 mostly nephews, in-laws and grandsons \u2014 working on the waterfront, according to the commission. This kind of blatant nepotism was impressive if not especially unusual.And yet Mr. Daggett, the union president, objects to the assumption that these sorts of arrangements necessarily signal corruption. \u201cThere is an old saying,\u201d he once proclaimed at a public hearing, slightly stretching the degree of kinship in the adage, \u201c\u2018The son or a nephew should not carry the sins of a father or an uncle.\u2019\u201dMany of those with relatives in organized crime say the insinuation that they themselves are mixed up in racketeering is hurtful, untrue and yet maybe inescapable.\u201cWhen I started out, people were a little standoffish because of fear, because of my ancestors,\u201d James Anastasio said. His father\u2019s uncle was Albert Anastasia, once the head of what the press called Murder, Inc.; he was \u201cLord High Executioner,\u201d as his 1957 obituary in The Daily News put it. \u201cAlthough once they got to know me and realized I had nothing to do with that, they treated me as a normal person.\u201d Mr. Anastasio, who runs a training institute for longshoremen and is also an executive at a crane company, said that in his long career on the waterfront, \u201cI\u2019ve never really come across the mob.\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, no, the mob is no longer on the waterfront,\u201d he added. \u201cI can\u2019t say there are not small pockets of bad people, but as far as big influence \u2014 not that I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime.\u201dThe union has complained about such aggressive tactics, and the longstanding antipathy between the longshoremen\u2019s association and the Waterfront Commission may have been the driving force behind the strike last year. And yet a spokesman for the longshoremen\u2019s association, James McNamara, said the union did not give the order for the strike and urged the longshoremen to return to work. \u201cWhat we had heard,\u201d Mr. McNamara said, \u201cwas the men were seemingly protesting against the Waterfront Commission and what was perceived as harassment.\u201dAs for the presence of organized crime along the waterfront, Mr. McNamara said the mob had no influence anymore. \u201cThey just don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly automated, highly sophisticated industry.\u201dHe added, \u201cYou just don\u2019t hear about that at all anymore.\u201dYet just a few years later, Mr. Catucci, now locked in a battle over a contract to operate the Red Hook port, accused the longshoremen\u2019s union of threatening him during negotiations. He had been told he would be taken out \u201cin a box,\u201d according to a lawsuit he filed. One vice president of the union \u201cshoved me and threatened to knock me out,\u201d Mr. Catucci said in a 2014 affidavit, in which he claimed that some of the waterfront\u2019s most powerful figures \u201care, or are associated with, thugs who get their way by intimidation and force.\u201dInvestigators insist that the same rackets that gave life to \u201cOn the Waterfront\u201d continue today. Mr. Arsenault checked off the various forms of thievery and extortion, both big and small, that he learned of through his investigations. Forty-foot-long containers occasionally disappear, most likely the result of theft. Truckers, in order to be allowed to retrieve their container and leave the port, have been encouraged to buy overpriced bottles of water, or even Girl Scout cookies from the longshoremen, he said.Robert Stewart, a longtime anticorruption prosecutor who until last year had worked in a court-appointed role for 13 years to rid a longshoremen\u2019s local in Bayonne of organized crime, said that mob influence on the waterfront was \u201ca tad better\u201d than in the past. \u201cYou don\u2019t have bodies showing up,\u201d he said.But he said he wondered whether the mob had not simply directed its attention to a different source of income.For years, investigators have suspected that the mob\u2019s most lucrative targets on the waterfront are the longshoremen benefit funds, including what is known as the \u201ccontainer royalty fund,\u201d the fund that pays extra wages to longshoremen each year as compensation for the diminished work that came with containerization. The funds are worth a great deal of money; one received more than $95 million in 2014. They also tend to be rather opaque.\u201cIt is an awfully inviting target, and knowing the cast of characters involved here, to think they\u2019re not getting a piece of this is unrealistic,\u201d Mr. Stewart said.The list of employees at the benefits fund, said one law enforcement official, include an accountant and a director of operations who are the children of dead organized crime figures.But John Nardi, the president of the New York Shipping Association, a trade group that has a role in managing the funds, said he had seen no evidence of misconduct. \u201cBased on people\u2019s names you can make a lot of assumptions,\u201d he said. However, he said, \u201cAll monies are accounted for.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Pipelines, Donald Trump Looks Backward", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOn questions of jobs and industry, he looks back at least to the 1950s. If something is big and made of steel, then it\u2019s great. Like some Soviet Realist painter, Mr. Trump seems to have an image stuck in his head of brawny men building a nation. Those are real jobs, and all the other innovation in the economy doesn\u2019t amount to much.On questions of energy economics, Mr. Trump is stuck somewhere in the Reagan era, when energy independence at any cost was the watchword. He\u2019s lost the plot of modern technological development. It\u2019s sun and wind that are going to be our dominant sources of power as their prices continue to plummet. In fact, his approach may be even more antique: Fixating on Canada\u2019s tar sands \u2014 where the economics of extracting low-quality crude have driven one big company after another out of that oil patch \u2014 is roughly equivalent, in its energy logic, to planning a sperm whale expedition.And on the question of relations with the people who first inhabited this continent \u2014 well, he would fit in just fine with Andrew Jackson. Standing Rock, the scene of the battle over the Dakota pipeline, stands with Flint., Mich., as the flash points of environmental racism in our recent history. The Obama administration made a significant stride forward when it took seriously the complaints of Native Americans; Mr. Trump clearly prefers a world where Indians are simply colorful set decorations in the diorama of American history.It\u2019s impossible to predict exactly how these pipeline battles will play out. Each is a complex mix of commercial, political and legal calculation. TransCanada, the company behind Keystone XL, said Tuesday that it was \u201cfully committed\u201d to building the pipeline, even though the planned expansion of oil extraction in the tar sands isn\u2019t happening. So we\u2019ll see. In the case of the Dakota pipeline, it\u2019s unclear whether President Trump can simply wave away the environmental impact review that the Army Corps of Engineers has begun on that project.What is clear, however, is that there will be enormous resistance. Many Indian nations were represented at the Standing Rock camp, and they drew big contingents of clergy members, military veterans and young people as allies. Farmers and ranchers across the heartland are far more sophisticated than they were a decade ago in standing up to eminent domain actions by foreign corporations. Demonstrations against the pipelines were popping up around the country within hours of the president\u2019s action. There will be a major gathering in the capital on April 29 to demand a clean energy revolution.It\u2019s easy enough to imagine that, even if he gets them built, Mr. Trump\u2019s pet pipelines will be relics long before their life span is over, rusting reminders of what happens when countries get mesmerized by the past and take their eye off the future.An earlier version of this article included an incorrect description of the size of the solar power industry work force. It is larger than the work force employed in the generation of electricity from coal, gas and oil, not than the work force employed in extracting those fossil fuels.Bill McKibben is a founder of 350.org and teaches environmental studies at Middlebury College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A City Built on Refugees Looks at Trump\u2019s Plan With Fear", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byLOWELL, Mass. \u2014 When Hawo Ahmed, her two sisters and their mother arrived here late Wednesday night, the Somali family could hardly believe their good fortune.\u201cIt\u2019s like a dream come true,\u201d said Ms. Ahmed, 24.Their arrival was all the more remarkable because they were among the last refugees allowed into the United States before President Trump closed the borders. He signed an executive order on Friday suspending the nation\u2019s resettlement program temporarily, with an eye toward shrinking it when it resumes. The action touched off widespread protests around the globe.Ms. Ahmed and her family had never heard of Lowell, an old mill city about 30 miles northwest of Boston with red-brick factories lining its canals, until they searched for it on Google from Kenya two weeks ago.But if Lowell is strange to them, having them here is not strange for Lowell.Immigrants, including many refugees, are part of the fabric of life in this city of 108,000, which boasts a kaleidoscope of cultures. Downtown is bursting with restaurants serving Portuguese, Mexican, Greek, Cambodian, Thai and Japanese fare. Lowell features a statue of Buddha, a plaque honoring Nelson Mandela and a big sign in the high school that welcomes visitors in multiple languages. Colorful flags of various nationalities hang in the windows of homes here, and ethnic festivals are common. Arabic is regularly heard in shops.For a city with such a heavy refugee presence, Mr. Trump\u2019s order is not an abstract political issue, but one that could alter families\u2019 lives and even the community itself \u2014 especially if, as people here fear, the temporary policy is made permanent.Farouq Ali, an Iraqi refugee who arrived in Lowell in 2009 and works with new refugees, said he and other Iraqis in the area had been exchanging near-constant Facebook messages about Mr. Trump\u2019s impending policy. Over the weekend, he said, dozens of Iraqi and Syrian women gathered at a restaurant to share their fears.\u201cMost Iraqis have some of their families back in Iraq, so they are struggling to bring them to Lowell, to America,\u201d Mr. Ali said. Mr. Trump\u2019s policy, he said, could shatter their hopes.Lowell and its many nonprofit organizations devoted to refugees and immigrant groups are haltingly coming to terms with the idea that, at least for now, the flow of refugees here could stop or slow, a startling turnaround for a city built by immigrant labor.People from French Canada, Ireland, Portugal and Poland powered Lowell\u2019s once-mighty textile mills starting in the 1800s, and immigrants and refugees have found homes here ever since. It is a place where the history of immigration in America is writ large. Many of the mills closed before World War II, and the city\u2019s population declined, but it picked up again in the late 1970s as a wave of Cambodians fleeing the Khmer Rouge came to the city. Today, Cambodians make up about 13 percent of the population, and Lowell has the second-largest Cambodian community in the country, after Long Beach, Calif. A Cambodian represents part of Lowell in the state legislature.\u201cLowell has been replenished and re-energized by refugees and immigrants for generations,\u201d said Jeffrey Thielman, the president and chief executive of the International Institute of New England, which works with the federal government to resettle refugees in Lowell, Boston and Manchester, N.H.\u201cWe won\u2019t feel it right away,\u201d Mr. Thielman said of a halt in refugees, \u201cbut businesses will not have enough workers, and not having enough workers will inhibit Lowell\u2019s ability to grow.\u201dThe region\u2019s economy and its immigrants are closely intertwined. Southwick, a factory in nearby Haverhill that makes suits for Brooks Brothers, offers four English classes per week for about 70 refugees and other immigrants who work there. Thithi Aye, a Burmese refugee who arrived here in 2010, car-pooled from Lowell to her job at Southwick every day with other refugees, including one from Iraq. Eventually, she was able to buy her own car, and then a condo.Employers see hiring refugees as a win for everyone, as supply meets demand.\u201cThey use us as a steppingstone for the betterment of their families,\u201d said John Martynec, Southwick\u2019s senior vice president for manufacturing.Because there are so many nonprofit organizations, volunteers and government services here to support refugees, a decline in the number of refugees could lead to a withering of those support services.\u201cIf everything\u2019s closed off for a period of time, the problem would then be figuring out how to rebuild the infrastructure to welcome people in,\u201d said Robert Forrant, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, whose classes include third-generation Cambodians.The possibility of closing the borders has unsettled some residents who are not part of the refugee community. Samantha Cail, 49, the owner of HyperText Bookstore and Caf\u00e9, said she found it \u201chorrifying.\u201d\u201cThis administration\u2019s ability to demonize the \u2018other\u2019 is very frightening to me,\u201d said Ms. Cail, who voted for Hillary Clinton.The vast variety of cultures and ethnicities was one reason she was attracted to Lowell, where she has lived for 11 years.\u201cThere\u2019s always Cambodian operas or amazing, yearlong festivals that really add color and depth to the community,\u201d she said.Ms. Cail said she was not worried that terrorists would slip through, in part because the vetting process, which takes at least two years, seemed so rigorous.But Cheryl Carville, 54, a longtime Lowell resident who works in retail and voted for Mr. Trump, was more concerned. She said that her philosophy was \u201clive and let live,\u201d but that she could not think of a reason the borders should not be closed for 120 days. \u201cYou got to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said, adding that she wondered how many refugees the city could really absorb. \u201cYou got to know who\u2019s coming in here.\u201d\u201cAt some point,\u201d she asked, \u201chow much can you take in, and how much before it starts hurting everybody else?\u201dDavid Donovan, 25, an electrician and longtime Lowell resident, agreed that it was \u201creasonable\u201d to suspend the resettlement program, even though he had voted for Mrs. Clinton.Cambodians in particular, he said, had done much to enrich Lowell. But, he added, \u201cgiven that we\u2019re in a state of war, it\u2019s O.K. to freeze the border.\u201dIn the meantime, the city is continuing to absorb refugees like the newly arrived Ahmed family. On Thursday, the International Institute of New England helped organize a job fair here at which 18 other refugees met employers who were looking for workers in the health care field.Lisa Gurgone, executive director of the Home Care Aide Council, told the refugees that the aging of New England virtually guaranteed them jobs in health care. \u201cWe need all of you,\u201d she said.Among the refugees who attended the job fair was Zainab Abdo, 21, who came in May from Syria, where her home in Aleppo had been bombed. She said she was relieved to be here, had been treated well and was taking nursing classes at Middlesex Community College.\u201cThere is security here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel safe.\u201dAnd yet, with Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order in the works, she remains nervous about the future, especially for relatives still in Syria and Turkey, who she had hoped would be able to join her family here.Luis Pedroso, an immigrant from the Azores who helped found an electronics factory, said that he had employees who were refugees and that he viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s order as an overreaction.\u201cLowell has been known as a location for so many different, diverse parts of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Mr. Trump sees that he needs to be doing this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make America\u2019s Robots Great Again", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtFactories play a central role in President Trump\u2019s parade of American horrors. In his telling, globalization has left our factories \u201cshuttered,\u201d \u201crusted-out\u201d and \u201cscattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.\u201dAnd there\u2019s another wrinkle to this story: The robots won\u2019t be made in America. They might be made in China.In 2013, China became the world\u2019s largest market for industrial robots, according to the International Federation of Robotics, an industry trade group. Now China is working on another big goal: to become the largest producer of robots used for factories, agriculture and a range of other applications.Robotics industry experts said that goal could be a decade away, but they see few impediments to China\u2019s eventual dominance.\u201cIf you look at the comparisons in investment between China and the U.S., we\u2019re going to lose,\u201d said Henrik Christensen, director of the Contextual Robotics Institute at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThe investments in China are billions and billions. I\u2019m not seeing that investment in the U.S. And without that investment, we are going to lose. No doubt.\u201d\u201cWe better do something, or we\u2019re going to be behind the gun,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be in the robot business, not just users of foreign robots.\u201dIf we don\u2019t, robot scholars said the president\u2019s plans for a resurgence in manufacturing could backfire. Today, we buy a lot of stuff made in China by Chinese people. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll buy stuff made in America \u2014 by Chinese robots.Like other centrally planned initiatives, China\u2019s robotics initiatives have not proceeded without trouble. There have been overinvestment and waste, and many Chinese robotics companies aren\u2019t making very good robots.\u201cMany are low quality, and safety and design standards are really not good,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, an organization that aims to improve Asian-American relations. \u201cThere are supposedly a bit more than 100 Chinese robot companies. I would say about 50 of these companies may survive.\u201dBut the Chinese government and its companies are persistent. Mr. Ernst expects slow, steady gains in the Chinese robotics industry. And in five to 10 years, he predicts, China\u2019s robot business will be producing industrial robots that are on par with those from Germany and Japan.Pushing a robotics revival in the United States would be more difficult than in China, where there hasn\u2019t been much outcry from workers over the government\u2019s embrace of automation.\u201cThere is not a public conversation in China about the pluses and minuses of automation,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThey don\u2019t talk about the losers in society from globalization or potential automation.\u201dIn the United States, on the other hand, losing is all we seem to talk about. Mr. Trump rose to power in part because he crystallized a feeling among voters that we have lost our edge to China. He promised to bring jobs back to America. In a hot-take political climate that can\u2019t stomach nuance, an investment in robots would be seen as a betrayal of the manufacturing workers he promised to save.But that would be a mistake. Mr. Christensen of the University of California, San Diego, pointed out that even the most automated of factories still employ people. To the extent that an investment in robotics might make it easier for companies to build their factories in the United States rather than in China, it might well create new jobs in the United States.What\u2019s more, America enjoys many advantages in robotics that China lacks. Some of the world\u2019s leading roboticists work at American universities. The United States has a start-up culture that knows how to create big new companies. And America has a head start in the most advanced robotics technologies. For instance, American companies are the leading purveyors of surgical robots, and they are at the forefront of \u201ccollaborative robotics,\u201d in which robots can work side by side with humans.\u201cAll of this robotics technology was invented in the U.S., but we basically let other companies take it from us and make it cheaper, and now we\u2019re buying it from them,\u201d Mr. Christensen said. \u201cIn some sense, we\u2019re not being very good at making sure we remain competitive in areas that we\u2019re leading.\u201dAnd that\u2019s how huge government funding can help, the robot experts said. As in China, an infusion from Mr. Trump could turn some of the most far-out ideas in robotics into a structural advantage for the American economy.\u201cWhat we can learn from the Chinese example is that the government plays a nurturing and fostering role for developing the robotics industry,\u201d Mr. Ernst said. \u201cWe can do the same. We must do the same.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And on Friday, as so often in the past, he blamed foreign trade for that decline.\u201cOne by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that we left behind,\u201d the new president said.While at odds with most economic assessments, Mr. Trump\u2019s words find an audience in places that have been left behind.\u201cPresident Trump made it clear that he understands that, despite a declining federal unemployment rate and a rising stock market, there are certain industries and communities that are still struggling,\u201d said M. Robert Weidner III, chief executive of the Metals Service Center Institute, a trade group for producers and distributors of industrial metals.\u201cI\u2019m more hopeful today than I have been in a long time,\u201d Mr. Weidner added.But it is a misleading diagnosis of the reasons for the decline of factory work.There were more than 17 million factory workers in the United States two decades ago; now there are slightly more than 12 million. Some kinds of manufacturing, like textiles and furniture, have largely disappeared. And increased foreign trade did play a role in the decline.But most economists agree that technological progress is the primary cause. The value of America\u2019s industrial output is at the highest level in history, but those goods are produced by fewer workers, a trend that cannot be reversed by changes in trade policy.Mr. Trump and his advisers have promised legislation to cut taxes, a rollback of regulations and changes in trade policy aimed at reducing imports of foreign goods and services.But his administration started with a smaller step. On Friday, it suspended a plan to reduce the fees that borrowers pay on some federally backed mortgage loans.The Obama administration announced the cut last week to make homeownership more accessible to lower-income borrowers. A family that borrowed $200,000 would have saved $500 in annual fees. Republicans had decried the change as risky. The fees cover the cost of defaults, so the change would have reduced the money available to cover such losses.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mubi: A Streaming Service With a Ticking Clock", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byStreamingSpeaking as a user, I consider it an interesting, compelling and sometimes maddening strategy. Recently, while browsing the site\u2019s \u201cNow Showing\u201d page, I spotted a Russian science-fiction film from 2011, \u201cTarget,\u201d directed by Alexander Zeldovich. I saw a screening of it a couple of years ago and have wanted to revisit it ever since. The left-hand corner of the screen read \u201c6 Days Left.\u201d (It\u2019s off the site now, as you read this.) There\u2019s something about that ticking clock that produces anxiety.On the other hand, the diversity and the quality of the selections are exhilarating. Mubi is one of several first-rate sites that cater to cinephiles, and its mix of current and vintage films, the global scope of the selections, and the truly eclectic array of genres is great. (There are films from Australia, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, Israel, Italy and Britain as I write, and none from Senegal, Mali and Morocco, but there have been, and I\u2019m sure there will be others.) You could watch one movie a day and never feel aesthetically pigeonholed.Mubi started about 10 years ago under the name the Auteurs. It ran a small number of films and had a feisty editorial section called (then and now) the Notebook, which I know a bit about because I was one of its early regular contributors. Its social network component was vibrant, but its identity as a film provider in those early days struck me as a little murky. The site was founded by Efe Cakarel, a voluble entrepreneur who, in a recent phone conversation, described the process that led to Mubi\u2019s way of doing things. \u201cIn the beginning, we wanted to be like Netflix, but the unit economies of an \u2018all-you-can-eat\u2019 site is very capital intensive,\u201d Mr. Cakarel said. \u201cThe question becomes, how do you create a compelling experience? If you can\u2019t get 10,000 titles, how about a limited selection?\u201d\u201cAlthough we started as an online site, we have a consistent belief in cinema as a theatrical experience \u2014 films should be seen on a big screen \u2014 so this was a culmination of an ambition,\u201d Mr. Cakarel explained.A few years ago at the Cannes Film Festival, I was having a conversation with a revered veteran French film critic about a movie that had just screened, one that he jocularly wrote off as \u201ca film festival film \u2014 financed with festival money, aimed at festival audiences; no couple living on the Upper West Side is going to say, \u2018Let\u2019s see this film\u2019 on any weekend night.\u201d While I don\u2019t personally include a film such as \u201cBaden Baden\u201d in the category he so disdained, it is true that a lot of movies that do well with festival audiences don\u2019t get far enough out into the marketplace to even start to find a broader audience.Which is where Mubi hopes to offer something: Mr. Cakarel says he\u2019s going into the festival season this year with substantially more money than last year. As for \u201cBaden Baden,\u201d he says it will be available after its Mubi run, on different platforms.\u201cWhen some great film premieres at Cannes, and the rights are bought piecemeal, what typically happens is that after a theatrical run, the movie enters a transactional window \u2014 iTunes, DVD, Blu-ray and so on \u2014 and then a pay TV window, where it will stay exclusively for about 18 months,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring that time, Netflix, with all the money in the world, won\u2019t be able to stream that film. The only way to break this up is to get all the rights to the film, even to go into production.\u201d Netflix and Amazon have made strong impressions in film production, and Mr. Cakarel expressed an ambition to do the same.In February, Mubi will start a \u201cDiscoveries\u201d program, which, as its title implies, focuses on new films that have impressed its programmers at film festivals; it kicks off with \u201cLe Parc,\u201d directed by Damien Manivel, a surreal animated date movie. One film it has in the series for April is a short by the acclaimed French director Bertrand Bonello. Its next theatrical release, slated for spring, is \u201cThe Happiest Day in the Life of Olli M\u00e4ki,\u201d a boxing movie directed by Juho Kuosmanen, about a real-life Finnish fighter and his 1962 world featherweight championship match against the American Davey Moore. (Yes, that\u2019s the same Davey Moore who in 1963, a year after the events of the film, inspired songs by both Phil Ochs and Bob Dylan.)I mentioned to Mr. Cakarel that his approach to brand identity reminded me of certain record labels of the 1970s, specifically Island, which had an eclectic roster of artists and put out products of such consistent quality across the board that even if you bought one of its records without having heard a note of it, you were still likely to have gotten something interesting. He laughed. \u201cI was at a dinner last week where I met [the Island Records founder] Chris Blackwell, and he told me that Mubi reminded him of what he had tried to do with the label.\u201dAdvertisement"}

More than a million people had come to Washington, and the Mall was alive with a sense of hope for the country\u2019s future. I saw it from my seat on the west front of the Capitol. I felt the historic sense of the day and the optimism it promised as we in Congress went to work that January.Shortly before that Inauguration Day, President-elect Obama came to the Capitol to meet with the Republican and Democratic leaders to discuss how we could work together to get the economy moving again. In that meeting, Mr. Obama asked John A. Boehner, then the House minority leader, and me to provide his team with our thoughts on how to put people back to work after the severe financial crisis of 2008. Given that my party had fought hard to elect someone else to the presidency, I was struck by this gesture and hopeful that it meant we could work together.John and I established a working group on the recovery. We knew many of the traditional Republican policies had been consistently rejected by the Democrats, so we aimed to formulate policies that both sides could embrace.The centerpiece of our plan was a 20 percent reduction in taxes for small businesses. We believed that small businesses were going to be the engine that powered America out of the economic downturn.We didn\u2019t know how the White House would receive our plan, but we knew the president was wildly popular and could use the bully pulpit against us.News outlets, along with the Democrats, labeled us the \u201cParty of No.\u201d But that didn\u2019t reflect the reality. Our goal was to offer a viable alternative to every major piece of legislation the Democratic majority put forward. We wondered if the president would embrace our efforts to bridge the policy divide, and if he did, what that might mean for Republicans in Washington.A few weeks later, John and I, along with the other congressional leaders, met with President Obama at the White House to discuss our plan as well as his proposed stimulus bill. Bringing along a one-page outline of our working group\u2019s recommendations, I rather brazenly asked the president if I could hand it out at the meeting. The president agreed, and after glancing at it, he said to me, \u201cEric, I don\u2019t see anything crazy in here.\u201dI was hopeful. But later in the meeting, when I mentioned that a stimulus package built around government spending would be too much like \u201cold Washington,\u201d the president\u2019s tone changed. He said: \u201cElections have consequences, and at the end of the day, I won. So I think on that one I trump you.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long afterward that we learned that Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, were well on their way to having a final stimulus package drafted, and they weren\u2019t really interested in any of our ideas.And so it went with the year\u2019s next significant policy debate: health care reform. For a long time, Republicans had been working on proposals to utilize high-risk pools to help patients with pre-existing conditions, to lower overall costs, and to expand coverage in the small employer market \u2014 policies that were compatible with the president\u2019s public goals.Early in the legislative process, a senior member of the Obama administration came to see me. Ostensibly it was to share ideas and seek a bipartisan way forward on health care reform. The official presented the administration\u2019s preferred policy approach \u2014 including mandates, and the \u201cpublic option,\u201d in which government would compete with private insurance plans. I insisted that none of this would go over well with the Republican members, and as the whip I knew that the public option was a nonstarter. Nonetheless, I was told the president and his team were intent on doing it their way.The attitude wasn\u2019t much different in public. In February 2010, the president invited the bipartisan congressional leadership to Blair House for a discussion surrounding the health care bill that the Senate had passed. Unlike our meeting on the economy a year earlier, this one was to be televised. It was obvious that the session was more about creating public pressure on Republicans than soliciting our ideas.In November 2010, Democrats suffered defeat at the ballot box, as Republicans retook the majority in the House.As I look back on that first meeting, and what transpired after, I see an opportunity lost. President Obama started with an outstretched hand, but pulled it back with a policy lurch leftward to a place we could not go.Next week, Donald J. Trump will assume office as the 45th president of the United States. He will govern with Republican majorities in the House and Senate.Democratic leaders must decide whether they will offer solutions that they hope won\u2019t be rejected out of hand by Republicans, or whether they want to oppose everything that comes down the pike.If they choose the former, President Trump will have to decide whether to work to include them in the governing process.It is too early to say what choices each side will make, but we know what\u2019s in store for our country if the Democrats opt for pure obstruction or if Mr. Trump and Republicans exclude the minority from policy decisions. We\u2019ll get four years of hyper-partisanship and further erosion of public confidence in our governing institutions.As Americans witness the swearing in of a new president this week, it\u2019s another reminder that our founding fathers wanted elections to have consequences, but they also created a system that requires factions to work together even after a decisive election. It is my hope that the new president and leaders in Congress live up to our founders\u2019 expectations.Eric Cantor is a former Republican House majority leader and vice chairman and managing director at Moelis & Company.Advertisement"}

But now the players in their yellow shirts and blue shorts begin every match in a somber prayer circle under the shade of a baobab tree.Three months ago, the team\u2019s star goalkeeper, Fatima Jawara, 19, was presumed drowned off the coast of Libya while trying to escape to Europe, dreaming of finally breaking her family free of poverty and of finding a broader stage for her skills.Now, both her team and her family are struggling to make sense of their loss.\u201cThe only thing she would talk about was how one day she would make our mother and all of us happy,\u201d said her sister, Oumi Jawara, recounting how Ms. Jawara was haunted by the suffering their mother went through over the family\u2019s struggles for subsistence.Hers is a fate shared by hundreds of others from her country and across West Africa who have died crossing the Mediterranean Sea or somewhere along the thousands of miles of treacherous desert to get there.They were trying to escape the seemingly endless repression and lack of opportunity in Gambia, where President Yahya Jammeh has jailed or killed his opponents for years.Ms. Jawara defies the stereotype of the kind of African migrant \u2014 typically rural, male and married \u2014 who sets off on the so-called back way to Europe. Yet a surprising number of migrants include athletes hoping to join a European team for more attention and a better paycheck.In November, Ali Mbengu, a popular Gambian wrestling champion, died along the migrant route. And in the past two years alone, the Gambian soccer federation said, more than 70 percent of players from various clubs have left the country, forcing teams to recruit amateur players to keep the competition going.The Gambian federation has been bombarded with requests from Italian and Spanish soccer clubs for information about Gambian players living in Europe who want to try out for their teams. The European clubs need a transfer certificate from the Gambian federation to allow the players to join new clubs in Europe.A stack of requests is piled on the desk of Victoria Roberts, the competition officer for Gambia\u2019s soccer federation.\u201cMost of the players are not registered in known clubs in Gambia, so they are free to recruit them over there in Europe,\u201d she said.Before she set out for Europe, Ms. Jawara was a star for the Red Scorpions. Her bubbly personality was the glue that held her team together. Her silly dance moves cracked everyone up. And her shouts of encouragement and her field skills inspired her teammates.As a goalkeeper, Ms. Jawara helped her team in winning several trophies in Gambia\u2019s National Female Football League and had represented the country during the Women\u2019s Under-17 World Cup in 2012 in Azerbaijan.\u201cI have not seen anyone that loves football more than Fatima,\u201d said Fatou Fatty, the team\u2019s captain. \u201cShe is the one that always encourages us to play. She even brought most of the girls into the team.\u201dStories circulated among the Red Scorpions about other athletes who had fled to Europe and found success on teams there. But Ms. Jawara loudly encouraged her teammates to remain in Gambia. Maybe a scout would visit one day and sign them all to a European club, she would tell them. But surely their own country was bound to better organize its leagues. Bigger salaries could not be far off.But at home, Ms. Jawara\u2019s family was barely able to survive.In Serekunda, where she lived with her mother and a large extended family, Ms. Jawara struggled to make her life better. Every night, she sat alongside her mother while she sold fried fish and cakes outside their green painted mud brick house. Between cooking large meals and giving her mother and sisters the small earnings she received from soccer matches, Ms. Jawara was the family\u2019s main source of hope.Their family, and so many others here, were caught in the deteriorating Gambian economy, where the cost of living has soared even while most of the population makes less than $1.90 a day, according to the World Bank. Even young teenagers have been left to fend for themselves or in some cases become the sole breadwinners for their large families.Friends say that, in retrospect, Ms. Jawara most likely began to seriously consider leaving for Europe last April, after a brawl on the field over a referee\u2019s call during a major tournament. Ten players, including Ms. Jawara, were each suspended for 12 months. The team was fined and knocked down a division.Ms. Jawara\u2019s plan to save her family through her soccer career were shattered. She started looking for options to play elsewhere.Awa Tamba, a Red Scorpions teammate, recounts how Ms. Jawara had told them she had been contracted by a soccer club in Dakar, Senegal, to play for two weeks. Short-term contracts in Senegal were typical for the team, and her friends thought nothing of it when she headed to Dakar.Ms. Jawara called her family and teammates several times from Senegal. Then she set out on the long journey to Europe. News that she was headed there leaked out to her incredulous teammates. Just the year before, she had harshly scolded her brother for trying to make the trip.\u201cI said it is a lie, because Fatima will never do that,\u201d Ms. Tamba said. \u201cShe said her brother is stupid for traveling the back way.\u201dOn a recent day at the field where the Red Scorpions practice, Kawusu Drameh, Ms. Jawara\u2019s boyfriend, emerged from a corner and dropped a bag of balls on the field.Mr. Drameh, 25, is now the team\u2019s chief source of inspiration. He was asked to join the team\u2019s trainers in honor of his girlfriend\u2019s death.Since Ms. Jawara\u2019s death, both her family and her teammates from the Red Scorpions Football Club have tried to keep her memory alive. For now, the only link that binds them all is Mr. Drameh.\u201cIt is hard for me to be here and have to not see Fatima again for the rest of my life. But I believe it is the best place to be also,\u201d Mr. Drameh said, wiping tears from his eyes with his shirt. \u201cThis is where Fatima would have been if she was alive. So today and every other day I want to be where she would want to be \u2014 and it\u2019s here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beno\u00eet Hamon Wins French Socialist Party\u2019s Presidential Nomination", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 France chose an idealistic, traditional left-leaning candidate in Sunday\u2019s primary to represent the Socialist and center-left parties in the presidential election this spring.The candidate, Beno\u00eet Hamon, 49, who ran on the slogan that he would \u201cmake France\u2019s heart beat,\u201d bested Manuel Valls, the former prime minister, whose campaign has promoted more free-market policies and who has a strong law-and-order background.Mr. Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin, with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr. Valls\u2019s 41 percent.\u201cTonight the left holds its head up high again; it is looking to the future,\u201d Mr. Hamon said, addressing his supporters.\u201cOur country needs the left, but a modern, innovative left,\u201d he said.The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7.The Socialist Party is deeply divided, and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting. About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday, in contrast with about 2.9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left, in 2011.However, much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week, because the leading candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who represents the main right-wing party, the Republicans, was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide. While nepotism is legal in the French political system, it is not clear that she actually did any work. Prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case.France\u2019s electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting, but only the top two vote-getters go on to a second round.Mr. Hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left, with candidates who include Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon on the far left, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent who served as economy minister in Mr. Hollande\u2019s government and who embraces more free-market policies.Unless he decides to withdraw, Mr. Fillon, the mainstream right candidate, will also run, as will the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen. The two have been expected to go to the runoff.Mr. Hamon\u2019s victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people. Unlike Mr. Valls, he also clearly distanced himself from some of Mr. Hollande\u2019s more unpopular policies, especially the economic ones.Thomas Kekenbosch, 22, a student and one of the leaders of the group the Youth With Beno\u00eet Hamon, said Mr. Hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left.\u201cWe have a perspective; we have something to do, to build,\u201d Mr. Kekenbosch said.Mr. Hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals, such as support for workers, that many left-leaning voters believe in, according to Mr. Kekenbosch.Mr. Hollande\u2019s government, under pressure from the European Union to meet budget restraints, struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage French businesses to expand in France.The measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes, but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving France\u2019s roughly 10 percent unemployment rate and its nearly 25 percent youth joblessness rate.Mr. Hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income, which would especially help young people looking for work, but would also supplement the livelihood of low-paid French workers. The end goal would be to have everyone receive 750 euros per month (about $840).\u201cWe have someone that trusts us,\u201d Mr. Kekenbosch said, \u201cwho says: \u2018I give you enough to pay for your studies. You can have a scholarship which spares you from working at McDonald\u2019s on provisional contracts for 4 years.\u201dMr. Hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones.His leftist pedigree began early. His father worked at an arsenal in Brest, a city in the far west of Brittany, and his mother worked off and on as a secretary. He was an early member of the Movement of Young Socialists, and he has continued to work closely with them through his political life. He also worked for Martine Aubry, now the mayor of Lille and a former Socialist Party leader.Aurelien Breeden and Benoit Morenne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Built in 2000, the 4,489-square-foot home has four bedrooms and five bathrooms. It sits on a gated fifth of an acre of land with sweeping views of Waitemata Harbor and Waiheke, Rangitoto, Browns and Motuihe islands.Wide sidelights bracket the front door of the three-story villa. Inside, a skylit atrium has Carrara marble floors. A two-level glass-enclosed water feature accents the stairwell, said Robbie Robson, a salesman with Harcourts Charlton Realty in Auckland, which has the listing. Half a level up, an open-plan living-and-dining area includes an entertaining kitchen with a cooktop and bar island. Glass doors open to a large wraparound terrace.On the other side of the landing are a media room with a separate balcony, two bedrooms and two bathrooms: one, in travertine marble, has a double vanity, tub and separate shower and a private commode; another, in gray and black marble, has a single vanity and a shower.Half a level down from the foyer is a chef\u2019s kitchen with Bosch appliances, black granite countertops, lacquered cupboards, a green-glass backsplash and a walk-in pantry. A center island divides the kitchen from a living/rumpus room.Down the hall from the foyer, a lounge opens through sliding doors to a sandstone tile terrace with an in-ground pool, spa and barbecue. Also on the foyer level is a bedroom, a study, a bathroom with a shower, another bathroom with a Swedish-style sauna, a laundry room and access to a two-car garage.Wall-to-wall glass sliders in the third-floor master bedroom open to east- and north-facing balconies. The private full-floor suite also includes a study and a spa bath with black and gray marble, a free-standing tub and a separate shower.The house is in the upscale seaside suburb of Glendowie, a four-minute drive from a picturesque beach and a waterfront promenade with cafes, bars, restaurants and boutiques in nearby St. Heliers village, Mr. Robson said.

The number of people from the U.S. with inquiries in the first month after the election was seven times the normal inquiry rate.\u201dNew Zealanders moving from smaller towns and country locations to Auckland, the main city center, for work, as well as empty nesters and baby boomers seeking a \u201clock-up-and-leave lifestyle\u201d are boosting the apartment market, Mr. Hawkins said. Among the luxury buildings under construction is the International, a 17-story, 88-unit structure wrapped in a white steel exoskeleton; prices for some of the three-bedrooms there top $6.7 million.According to year-end data from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, Auckland\u2019s $830,000 median sales price from January through November 2016 rose 11 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, while the number of sales decreased 12 percent; days on the market increased 10 percent compared with that of a year earlier, to 33 days.

{"Headline": "The Age of Fake Policy", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byOn Thursday, at a rough estimate, 75,000 Americans were laid off or fired by their employers. Some of those workers will find good new jobs, but many will end up earning less, and some will remain unemployed for months or years.If that sounds terrible to you, and you\u2019re asking what economic catastrophe just happened, the answer is, none. In fact, I\u2019m just assuming that Thursday was a normal day in the job market.But why am I telling you this? To highlight the difference between real economic policy and the fake policy that has lately been taking up far too much attention in the news media.In other words, it may have sounded as if Mr. Trump was doing something substantive by intervening with Carrier, but he wasn\u2019t. This was fake policy \u2014 a show intended to impress the rubes, not to achieve real results.So why are such stories occupying so much of the media\u2019s attention?The incoming administration\u2019s incentive to engage in fake policy is obvious: It\u2019s the natural counterpart to fake populism. Mr. Trump won overwhelming support from white working-class voters, who believed that he was on their side. Yet his real policy agenda, aside from the looming trade war, is standard-issue modern Republicanism: huge tax cuts for billionaires and savage cuts to public programs, including those essential to many Trump voters.So what can Mr. Trump do to keep the scam going? The answer is, showy but trivial interventions that can be spun as saving a few jobs here or there. Substantively, this will never amount to more than a rounding error in a giant nation. But it may well work as a P.R. strategy, at least for a while.Bear in mind that corporations have every incentive to go along with the spin. Suppose that you\u2019re a C.E.O. who wants to curry favor with the new administration. One thing you can do, of course, is steer business to Trump hotels and other businesses. But another thing you can do is help generate Trump-friendly headlines.Keeping a few hundred jobs in America for a couple of years is a pretty cheap form of campaign contribution; pretending that the administration persuaded you to add some jobs you actually would have added anyway is even cheaper.Still, none of this would work without the complicity of the news media. And I\u2019m not talking about \u201cfake news,\u201d as big a problem as that is becoming; I\u2019m talking about respectable, mainstream news coverage.Sorry, folks, but headlines that repeat Trump claims about jobs saved, without conveying the essential fakeness of those claims, are a betrayal of journalism. This is true even if, as often happens, the articles eventually, quite a few paragraphs in, get around to debunking the hype: many if not most readers will take the headline as validation of the claim.And it\u2019s even worse if headlines inspired by fake policy crowd out coverage of real policy.It is, I suppose, possible that fake policy will eventually produce a media backlash \u2014 that news organizations will begin treating stunts like the Carrier episode with the ridicule they deserve. But nothing we\u2019ve seen so far inspires optimism.Advertisement"}

After a 0.2 percent increase in November\u2019s index, analysts are expecting a 0.3 percent rise for December, primarily because of rising gasoline prices. The core C.P.I., which strips out the more volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 0.2 percent, the same gain as the previous month. While the overall index inched up for a total 1.7 percent over the previous 12 months, the year-over-year rate for the core measure ticked down to 2.1 percent. Consumer confidence has continued to surge since the election. Patricia CohenEUROPEAN ECONOMYThe European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council will meet on Thursday and is likely to debate whether to begin weaning the eurozone from stimulus measures. No big moves in monetary policy are expected, but minutes from the last Governing Council meeting indicate that some members have begun arguing that the bank should begin easing off on its large purchases of government and corporate bonds. Those arguments gained traction in December, when inflation in the eurozone rose above 1 percent for the first time since 2013, bringing the rate closer to the official target of 2 percent. Jack EwingOIL INDUSTRYMinisters from OPEC countries are scheduled to join their counterparts from Russia and Oman in Vienna over the weekend to discuss whether oil producers are complying with the agreement reached last year to cut production to prop up prices, now $56 per barrel for Brent crude.

Britain\u2019s vote in June to leave the bloc struck a stinging blow against regional unity at a time when confidence was already flagging in the European Union.But Mr. Vassilev and his fellow citizens paint a different picture \u2014 one of regional officials who hold domestic authorities to account, set higher standards and are more trustworthy than their local counterparts.Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007, along with Romania. At the time, polling indicated that a slim majority of its population was in favor of membership, hopeful that it would strengthen the Balkan country\u2019s economy and political institutions.\u201cBulgaria has clearly benefited since it joined the European Union,\u201d said Ruslan Stefanov, an analyst for the Center for the Study of Democracy, a Sofia-based think tank. \u201cWe\u2019re richer, with a wider choice in terms of jobs and education across the bloc.\u201dThe average Bulgarian now earns 440 euros, or about $470, a month, twice as much as when the country joined.

Exports to European Union countries have doubled in the years since Bulgaria joined, and sales to other member states now account for two-thirds of all exports.There have been other benefits. Tens of thousands of Bulgarians are studying elsewhere in the 28-member European Union \u2014 a greater proportion of its population than comparably sized member states like Austria, the Czech Republic or Hungary (this is partly a result, however, of the poor quality of Bulgaria\u2019s education system).Even more Bulgarians work and travel throughout the bloc, taking advantage of the region\u2019s free movement of labor. That, according to Mr. Stefanov, has helped keep unemployment relatively low at around 8 percent \u2014 if Bulgarians cannot find jobs at home, he noted, they look abroad.The European Union has also pumped in billions of euros in aid to help the country build new highways and roads, develop agriculture and rural areas, and protect the environment. Regular reports published by the European Commission on corruption and organized crime \u2014 persistent problems in Bulgaria \u2014 have kept local politicians on their toes (though Sofia has made little progress when it comes to uprooting graft and reforming its judiciary).\u201cThe fact that Bulgaria is an E.U. member and there are a number of reforms on the way makes us believe that Bulgaria is definitely on the right track,\u201d said Olivier Marquette, managing director for the Bulgarian operations of AES, a power company with its headquarters in Arlington, Va.AES began considering projects in Bulgaria in 2000, when the country was still only a candidate to join the European Union. In the years since, it has invested around \u20ac1.6 billion in three projects here \u2014 a 600-megawatt thermal power plant, a wind farm and a waste disposal center.It has not always been smooth: It took two years to resolve a dispute with the state-owned utility company, which owed \u20ac300 million. Mr. Marquette nevertheless says AES is happy with its bet on the country.A combination of European Union aid, guidance and oversight has meant that within Bulgaria, trust in the bloc and its institutions remains strong, and markedly higher than in most of the rest of the bloc.About 49 percent of Bulgarians say they trust the E.U., compared with 33 percent who do not, according to a 2016 survey by Eurobarometer, which carries out polling in the region. That is the third-highest level of trust of any member state (behind Lithuania and Malta), and around twice as much trust as Bulgarians have in their own government, public institutions or legal system.\u201cPeople don\u2019t recognize the state as theirs and thus see Brussels as the external power on their side,\u201d said Marin Lessenski, director of the European Policies and Civic Participation Program at the Open Society Institute.The heft of Brussels came into play in 2014.In June of that year, Corporate Commercial Bank, or K.T.B., experienced mass withdrawals after a feud between a local politician and the lender\u2019s largest shareholder. As confidence flagged, a fifth of K.T.B.\u2019s assets were pulled within a week, and the bank was taken into central bank supervision.The panic soon spread and the next month, Bulgaria\u2019s central bank said it would begin bankruptcy proceedings against K.T.B.Mr. Vassilev was one of many account holders whose lives were thrown into chaos. Lured by the promise of high interest rates, he instead lost access to his savings for months. More than two years on, an investigation into K.T.B.\u2019s collapse continues.\u201cThe mere existence of such a bank indicates some serious deficiencies of regulations and transparency in Bulgaria,\u201d said Dimitar Bechev, the director of the European Policy Institute in Sofia.The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, and the European Banking Authority, a regional financial watchdog, repeatedly called on Sofia to fulfill a government guarantee on depositors\u2019 savings. Both opened investigations into whether Bulgarian authorities had breached regional law by delaying payouts.Facing the prospect of formal charges, the government finally began paying back account holders in December 2014 (both inquiries have since been closed).Businesses also benefit from Brussels\u2019s acting as a bulwark against Bulgaria\u2019s politicians, as well as being able to gain access to the region\u2019s single market, able to export their wares without restriction to the rest of the bloc.In recent years, several major manufacturers of vehicle components \u2014 with clients including Volkswagen, Daimler, Mercedes and Renault \u2014 have set up shop in Bulgaria. The number of companies in the auto parts sector has tripled since Bulgaria joined the European Union, now numbering around 120 businesses, and last year the industry accounted for 3.5 percent of the country\u2019s economy.A small start-up community is also being built, and two Sofia-based funds have invested more than \u20ac20 million in around 200 companies over the last four years, thanks to a European Union-sponsored initiative.The businesses that have received funding include an online marketplace connecting small farms with potential customers; a toymaker whose products use energy generated by children playing with them to activate lights and sounds; and a company that has developed image-recognition and organization software.It is not just fledgling enterprises that see advantages \u2014 older ones do, too.\u201cSince we joined the E.U., the country has become a more stable and less risky place to do business,\u201d said Manol Peykov, who manages his family\u2019s publishing house in Bulgaria\u2019s second-biggest city, Plovdiv.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for E.U. directives and rules, Bulgarian politicians would be untouchable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon to Add 100,000 Jobs as Bricks-and-Mortar Retail Crumbles", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byAmazon\u2019s new warehouse in Baltimore is a rare economic bright spot there, employing 3,000 people full-time in a city ravaged by poverty and a lack of opportunities for less educated workers.And with Amazon\u2019s announcement Thursday that it plans to hire 100,000 new employees in the next 18 months, the Baltimore facility and at least 70 other Amazon fulfillment centers across the country stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries.Fifteen miles away in the suburbs, all that is left of Owings Mills Mall is rubble, demolition having started in the fall, after the last anchor stores, Macy\u2019s and J. C. Penney, closed within months of each other.The contrast between the two scenes is an example of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter termed \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d the inevitable process in which new industries rise and replace old ones.But creation tends to get more press than destruction, and the announcement from Amazon is no exception.The company\u2019s hiring plans are certainly good news. But to understand the forces roiling the American economy, it\u2019s key to remember that online retailing has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America.That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing over the long term. Greater productivity is essential for economic growth, and, according to the company, the 100,000 figure includes highly paid engineers and software developers in addition to hourly warehouse workers. But for people caught on the wrong side of that transition in the short term, it\u2019s the equivalent of an economic hurricane.\u201cThere are huge benefits to consumers from Amazon,\u201d said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard who studies labor and technological change. \u201cBut the workers they are hiring aren\u2019t the same ones being laid off.\u201dEven since New Year\u2019s Day, the traditional retail sector has absorbed more blows. Macy\u2019s said last week that it would eliminate 10,000 positions, and the Limited announced this week that it would close all 250 of its stores, eliminating 4,000 jobs.The Amazon announcement comes as the company is introducing automation that could one day cost jobs. It uses robots in many of its warehouses, though it says they work in conjunction with people instead of replacing them.One place to start, Mr. Katz said, would be for the government to provide more funding for retraining and also develop a wage insurance program to cover differences in salaries as workers migrate to new, lower-paid jobs from disappearing, higher-paid ones.\u201cThe economy as a whole gains from creative destruction, but we don\u2019t put many resources into training displaced workers,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a real problem, and in practice, we need to do much more.\u201dThe half-full glass in all of this is greater productivity \u2014 an economic force that has been otherwise lacking during the recovery from the Great Recession, said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at J. P. Morgan.Productivity in the retail sector, online and offline, jumped 3 percent in 2015 compared with a measly 0.8 percentage point for business over all, he said. The typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores.Along with making online retailers much more efficient, that difference also helps explain why Amazon is a stock market darling while Macy\u2019s and J. C. Penney are laggards.\u201cYou can\u2019t complain about low productivity and then complain about job reallocation in the same breath,\u201d Mr. Feroli said.Still, a lot of jobs are being reallocated in a fairly short time, in an economy that has only begun to pick up speed recently for many Americans.Mr. Feroli calculates that if it were not for online retailers, of which Amazon is by far the biggest, there would be 1.2 million more retailing jobs in the United States. There are 16 million retail workers in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a figure that includes online sellers like Amazon and traditional stores.In the last four years, traditional retailers have cut more than 200,000 jobs, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago outplacement firm.The seasonal bump in store hiring, a familiar economic story each fall, is also ebbing, according to Challenger. During the holiday shopping season last year, stores added 100,000 fewer temporary workers than in 2013.\u201cThe number of jobs we are losing in retail outpaces the number being created in the sectors that are taking their place,\u201d said Andrew Challenger, vice president of the firm. For example, transportation firms and warehouses are hiring, but not as quickly as bricks-and-mortar stores are laying off workers, he said.Many of the jobs included in the figure Amazon announced on Thursday had already been disclosed by the company, which routinely reveals how many people it plans to hire in different localities when it opens new fulfillment centers.The company has become far more vocal about telling its employment story over the past half-decade, which is partly a reflection of the rapid expansion of its network of warehouses devoted to packaging and shipping products to customers. The expansion began in earnest around 2011, when Amazon began hammering out agreements with state governments to collect sales tax from Amazon customers in those states.At the same time, Amazon decided to make fast shipping a priority, something possible only if it opened more warehouses closer to where customers live.The 100,000 hires it plans for the next 18 months represent a 56 percent increase in the 180,000 full-time United States employees it had at the end of 2016. Amazon has more than 300,000 full- and part-time employees globally.That attention could be politically beneficial for Amazon as Donald J. Trump assumes the presidency. Last year during the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump singled out Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, as having a \u201chuge antitrust problem.\u201d Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Bezos was using his ownership of The Washington Post to discourage political scrutiny of Amazon.But Mr. Bezos was among a group of technology-sector executives who met with Mr. Trump last month, and after Amazon\u2019s announcement of its hiring plans on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary said \u201cthe president-elect was pleased to have played a role in that decision.\u201dDrew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.Amazon has said that its employment figures alone do not capture its full effect on jobs. On Thursday, the company said its marketplace business, through which independent merchants sell goods on the company\u2019s site, sustained 300,000 additional jobs in the United States.In the meantime, a new open-air shopping center is planned for the vast rubble-strewn site in Owings Mills, Md., where shoppers once flocked to Macy\u2019s and J. C. Penney. The demolition should wrap up by spring, although no date has been set for the opening of the new mall, nor have tenants been announced.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.C.B., Facing Monetary Policy Complications Worldwide, Holds Firm", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe official inflation rate is rising, emboldening conservatives who want the bank to print less money. Britain will soon open divorce proceedings with the European Union. The American president-elect, Donald J. Trump, who predicted this week that more countries would defect from the bloc \u2014 undercutting the central bank\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2014 will take office on Friday.The European Central Bank has been a bastion of stability in the eurozone, equipped with powerful financial weapons and less susceptible to the political infighting that often paralyzes decision making at European Union headquarters in Brussels.But holding the 19-nation currency bloc together may be trickier than ever in the months to come. Here are some of the issues facing the bank and the eurozone:\u201cThere are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation.\u201d\u2014 Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank.It has been said that the European Central Bank focuses on three things: inflation, inflation and inflation. That differs from the Federal Reserve in the United States, which also pays close attention to employment.So a jump in the official eurozone inflation rate to 1.1 percent in December, the first time since 2013 that the Consumer Price Index has exceeded 1 percent, was a big deal in monetary policy circles.The increase, from 0.6 percent in November, could have bolstered the argument by several members of the Governing Council that the central bank should begin backing away from the de facto money printing it has undertaken since 2015.Mr. Draghi said, though, that members of the Governing Council were not yet convinced that the rise in prices would continue in months to come. \u201cThe council decided to look through it,\u201d Mr. Draghi said of the inflation data \u2014 central bank jargon meaning that the members would not pay attention to the monthly number until they believed it signaled a trend.He said there had been no discussion on Thursday about so-called tapering, or winding down the central bank\u2019s purchases of government bonds and other assets using new money. Those purchases have been used in an effort to strengthen economic growth.Mr. Draghi portrayed a harmonious meeting in which council members were unanimous in their belief that central bank policy was doing its job. \u201cThere was a sense of satisfaction toward the monetary policy stance we have been pursuing since 2015,\u201d he said.\u201cKeeping it together is not going to be as easy as a lot of people think.\u201dAnd Mr. Trump did not offer a ringing endorsement of the wavering European project when, speaking to two journalists this week, he complained about the Brussels bureaucracy he encountered while building a golf course in Ireland.The European Central Bank is supposed to be aloof from politics. But the strains on European unity make it even more difficult than usual to develop a monetary policy.Mr. Draghi refused to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of faith in the common currency. \u201cIt\u2019s very early for us to comment on President Trump\u2019s statements,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.\u201cWhile Trump introduces higher uncertainty, this is better than the near certainty of the continuation of a mediocre status quo.\u201dSome economists have expressed optimism that Mr. Trump could pursue policies that would increase growth in the United States, which would be good for the rest of the world and particularly Europe. The United States is the European Union\u2019s biggest trading partner.Mr. Trump\u2019s policies could also increase inflation in the United States, leading to higher market interest rates. That would probably spread to European bonds and other assets, making it more expensive for regional governments and companies to borrow.While refusing to respond to anything Mr. Trump has said, Mr. Draghi gave a relatively upbeat assessment of the eurozone economy. He pointed out that unemployment was falling, surveys of business and consumer confidence were at their highest levels in years, and he said it had become easier for businesses and consumers to get loans.\u201cThe recovery is resilient,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Obama Legacy", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byIf you had set out to assess Barack Obama\u2019s legacy four years ago, when he won re-election convincingly over Mitt Romney, the assessment might have gone like this. On foreign policy, reasonably high marks: Osama bin Laden dead, disengagement from Iraq without disaster, no major wars or catastrophic blunders.In electoral politics, likewise: a successful re-election that seemed to betoken a sustained realignment for the Democrats. On the economy, lower grades: a depression averted, but record deficits, stagnant growth and stubborn elevated unemployment. On Obamacare, his signature achievement, a grade of incomplete, awaiting its implementation.What\u2019s interesting is that four years later, as the president leaves the White House, several of those assessments could be essentially reversed. His economic stewardship looks more impressive than it did in 2012: The United States hasn\u2019t escaped the stagnation trap entirely, but unemployment has fallen well below the levels that even Romney promised to deliver. His foreign policy record, on the other hand, looks worse: The Iraq withdrawal paved a path for the Islamic State, Vladimir Putin repeatedly seemed to outmaneuver the Obamanauts, and globally the Pax Americana is at its wobbliest since the Cold War.And in electoral politics, instead of the great Obama realignment, we have a Democratic Party reduced to rubble and the staggering ascent of Donald Trump.The swift shifts should make us cautious about assuming that the landscape of early 2017 can tell us anything too dispositive about how the departing president will be remembered \u2014 especially given how much of Obama\u2019s policy legacy now depends upon the still-unknowable intentions and capacities of President Trump.But with that proviso, here are a few guesses as to how that legacy will ultimately be judged.First, the core domestic agenda that Obama actually enacted, from the stimulus to the health care law to the auto bailouts and lesser maneuvers, may be remembered more favorably than most conservatives assume. Its flaws were manifold (I may have written about some of them here and there), and one can spin a happier counterfactual \u2014 for the Democratic Party\u2019s political fortunes, especially \u2014 involving a more modest health care bill, a sharper focus on the middle class and jobs, and some sort of clear outreach to the center right instead of the pushes on cap and trade and gun control and immigration.But at the same time the American economy did recover, slowly but more robustly than in much of the developed world, and again and again the dooms predicted by Obama\u2019s Republican adversaries failed to materialize. The stock market rebounded and then surged, there was no hyperinflation in response to the Obama deficits and the various monetary easings (quite the reverse), and the much-prophesied debt crisis, in which the United States was supposed to go the way of Greece, never actually arrived.My guess is that less retrospective credit will be extended to Obama\u2019s foreign policy, however. Hawks and doves will bicker about whether he intervened too much or too little, but the reality is that he was simply halfhearted and ineffective in far too many cases, pursuing pre-existing ambitions (Iran, climate change, a settlement-obsessed approach to Israel-Palestine) when the crises of the day required more resolute attention.Nothing in all this was as disastrous as the previous administration\u2019s Iraq invasion, and his \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid [stuff]\u201d motto was not as wimpy as its critics charged. (Trump essentially made the same promise en route to winning the supposedly more hawkish party\u2019s primary.) But a lot of small failures, no less than one major one, can leave the world less safe \u2014 and there were enough failures that Obama very clearly did.Not that this will prevent him from being a liberal icon, years or generations hence. If John F. Kennedy\u2019s blundering imperilment of world peace was buried under hagiography, there will be a similar forgetting spread over Obama\u2019s foreign policy setbacks. As the first black president, the politician who passed health care reform and the man who personally embodied upper-class liberalism\u2019s cosmopolitan self-image, he will almost certainly regain, in what is sure to be an active post-presidency, some of the cult that surrounded him during his ascent.This will be true regardless of whether Donald Trump\u2019s reign pushes America decisively toward a grim post-liberal war of Bannonites against Bernie Bros or ends in some kind of glorious cosmopoliberal restoration. If the former, Obama will be remembered by liberals as the last good king, the man who for eight years did battle with the dark heart of white America. If the latter, he will be hailed as the man who saw the liberal future clearly even amid a temporary backlash.The fears helped give us both the zeal of the Tea Party and the alienation of the Trumpistas. The expectations gave us a late-Obama left prone to fits of despair whenever they were losing and cultural authoritarianism wherever they could claim the upper hand (the bureaucracy, the universities, the media). They also fed into a persistent sense that liberalism should no longer even engage with its deplorable dead-ender dustbin-of-history adversaries.But then again such an Obama, a man of more modest promises and somewhat more Bill Clintonian flexibility, might not have been elected in the first place.As is often the case with political lives, in his beginning was his end.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sears Clings to Catalog Thinking in an Online World", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe Sears Holdings Corporation, which is projected to lose more than $2 billion this year, is in the retailing dead pool. As its prospects for a turnaround appear to grow dimmer, it may seem to be another morality tale for bricks-and-mortar retailers in the age of Amazon.Yet it is a lesson that even Sears recognizes. Like other retailers, the company is scrambling to adapt to today\u2019s internet market. The question is whether it can do so before its cash runs out and the deal-making of its hedge fund chief executive, Edward S. Lampert is not enough to create more.Everyone knows Sears, which has been around for over 130 years. It started as a catalog business, the Amazon of a century ago, where you could buy just about anything. And I mean anything. I lived for several years in a Sears catalog home, shipped to my town by Sears at the turn of the 20th century.But in recent years, Sears has struggled. The company has lost over $9 billion in the last five years. Since 2011, it has shut more than 150 of its big Sears stores and over 350 Kmart stores, and it has just announced the closing of another 150 stores. Its revenue has fallen to a projected $25 billion in 2016, from $42.6 billion in 2011, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.The outlook is grim for Sears. This month, the company said that comparable sales had declined by 12 to 13 percent over the holiday shopping season. Its stock price has fallen to $8.75, from a high of over $190.Amazon, in the meantime, has soared. Its revenue is on track to reach $136 billion in revenue this year, according to S.&P. Global Market Intelligence, up over 30 percent from the previous year. Amazon has a market value of $395 billion as it dominates internet retail. And Amazon is on a roll, not just with sales but also with new products like the Echo that are must-haves, at least if you want your children to be screaming for Alexa to play Disney tunes all day.Other bricks-and-mortar retailers are struggling as well because of the Amazon juggernaut. Macy\u2019s has announced store closures and a revenue decline. J. C. Penney has reported disappointing sales.Still, Sears is a special case. Since 2008, it has been directly run and at times aided by Mr. Lampert.Despite a decade of decline, Mr. Lampert \u2014 who is after all a person who can read numbers even if he seldom leaves his compound in Florida \u2014 still seems to believe in a future for Sears, whose headquarters is in the Chicago suburbs. What is he up to?Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund acquired Kmart out of bankruptcy and combined it with Sears. At first, it looked like a miracle as the stock and sales rose. But the financial crisis was grim for Sears.Over the years, Mr. Lampert has managed the company directly \u2014 some say micromanaged \u2014 by dividing managers into segments and pitting them against one another. In addition, he has tried to refocus Sears onto the internet. This has involved the Shop Your Way strategy, in which Sears is to become an \u201casset light\u201d company with \u201cmembers\u201d who can shop online and at more streamlined stores.Despite the conventional wisdom, though, it is not Amazon that is primarily to blame for Sears\u2019s plight. Sears is being squeezed by changing economies and technology. Shoppers go to Walmart for discount items or to Target for discount items with a touch of style. The high end stays at stores like Nordstrom. The middle is smaller and increasingly shops online.(Sears, when asked to comment, referred to recent news releases.)Lots of financing transactions have included a rights offering and letters of credit and loans from Mr. Lampert\u2019s own hedge fund. The financial engineering has been extreme, while the turnaround has been slow to realize.In all of this, Sears itself has declined in value while Mr. Lampert\u2019s net worth has fallen to $2 billion from about $3 billion.So why doesn\u2019t he just try to liquidate the company instead?After all, Sears has $5 billion in inventory alone, lots of real estate still to monetize and beloved brands like Kenmore and DieHard that it has yet to sell. This is a classic 1980s play; the breakup value is much more than that of the existing company.One explanation is that it would be expensive to liquidate Sears. Shutting down 1,600 stores would be chaotic, and selling $5 billion worth of inventory at liquidation value would yield much less. Seritage, which mostly holds Sears property, would be significantly affected.But another explanation is that whatever you think of the execution, Sears is onto something. Bricks-and-mortar retail is not going away\u2014 it still dominates online sales and most likely always will. But retail is fragmenting and shifting into branded stores.Sears was once the Amazon of its day through its catalogs, and it successfully migrated to stores. Companies like Allstate, Dean Witter and Discover were spun out of Sears. Back then the company was everything to all consumers. Now, at a time when Amazon is everything to all customers, $24 billion in sales is still nothing to sneeze at, and surely some Sears stores are still profitable.This is ultimately Mr. Lampert\u2019s strategy \u2014 leverage a huge ground footprint to extend into the internet. A ground footprint is valuable not just because people still mostly shop by ground but also as a delivery vehicle. Amazon itself is opening up some physical stores.Here, Mr. Lampert is betting that Sears can transform itself by leveraging its ground footprint and streamlining it. It has invested in a newer, more streamlined store format selling appliances. The first of these opened in Fort Collins, Colo.But that belies the question of whom Sears is marketing to: discount shoppers or a more upmarket crowd? In today\u2019s day and age it is impossible to be everything for everyone in a physical store when the internet is simply much better at it.All of this must be done when Amazon or Walmart could buy the retailer for pocket change at this point. If Sears intended to dominate the internet, it should have started 15 years ago when it had the brand recognition to do so.In the end, the problem with Sears may be that while Mr. Lampert may be sure of Sears\u2019s value, the public just isn\u2019t sure of where it stands in the hierarchy of retailers when a ground store selling everything just isn\u2019t what it used to be. No amount of Wall Street alchemy and deal-making can fix this problem.Advertisement"}

(It is hard to tell from the tangle of announcements from Mr. Trump and his advisers whether they are planning a broad new tax regime that would affect all exports and imports. That, too, would most likely invite challenges at the W.T.O.)Mr. Trump, of course, has also talked about taking the United States out of the global trade accord. But that might seem a bit too drastic just to get Mexico to pay perhaps $20 billion for a wall. It is likely to impose enormous costs on the American and world economies, opening the door for a free-for-all trade war. But if the president did it anyway, the people paying the 20 percent tariff would not be Mexicans, but American consumers. That 2017 Ford Fusion built in Hermosillo, Mexico? It would no longer cost $22,610. It would cost $27,132.So what about the other ideas? The big one Mr. Trump mentioned early on is remittances. Mexico receives about $25 billion a year from Mexicans living abroad, mostly in the United States, in myriad transfers of a few hundred dollars apiece channeled primarily through services like Western Union and MoneyGram.Mr. Trump originally threatened to simply impound remittances, a matter of dubious legal standing and some logistical complication. Later he suggested a more sophisticated strategy. He would just threaten to change rules under the Patriot Act antiterrorism law to prohibit immigrants who couldn\u2019t prove legal residence from wiring money abroad. Under threat of losing these resources, the reasoning went, the Mexican government would soon cave and offer to pay for the wall.Remittances are indeed a big deal for Mexico. In a foreign policy speech delivered on Monday, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said that ensuring \u201cthe free flow of remittances from our compatriots living in the United States\u201d was one of 10 core Mexican objectives in the renegotiation of its relationship with America.What Mr. Trump seems not to reckon with is that people find a way around barriers like these. Mexicans would come up with other conduits to send the $100 a week that their parents, children or siblings back home rely on to pay the bills. As the Government Accountability Office noted in a report published last year, these sorts of obstacles often have the effect of \u201cpushing remittances out of formal financial systems to less detectable methods.\u201dAnd it might be illegal, too. Kathleen Newland of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group, said that taxing remittances just to Mexico would probably be challenged as discriminatory on the basis of national origin. After all, many people who send remittances are American citizens or legal residents. Taxing remittances only by illegal immigrants would be, to say the least, implausible.What about charging Mexicans more for visas and border cards? It would take a lot of them to add up to the cost of Mr. Trump\u2019s barrier. What\u2019s more, visa fees are dedicated by statute to finance United States consular activities around the world.Mr. Trump could probably find some Mexican money somewhere. Twelve million Mexicans live in the United States. Mexican companies have invested nearly $20 billion in the country. There are tons of flows of money between the two. The question is whether Mr. Trump can get at it without breaking the law.Gordon Hanson of the University of California, San Diego, notes that the two countries have an income tax treaty. That means that Washington agrees to tax Mexican residents subject to United States income tax at a reduced rate.\u201cI suppose Trump could simply violate this treaty and subject Mexican residents in the United States at a higher rate and call this part of the payment,\u201d he said.Perhaps none of this matters. Mr. Trump has acknowledged that how Mexico pays might be complicated, which suggests he may be open to calling any flow of money part of this payment. Or as Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations suggests, Mr. Trump may not actually be looking for good ideas to subtly draw money from Mexico to pay for a wall, but instead to prove strength and to humiliate the United States\u2019 southern neighbor.\u201cTrump is focused on the optics,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is not in the market for clever schemes.\u201dMaybe cutting all aid to Mexico could help serve this purpose. It wouldn\u2019t pay for much. And it would amount to shooting oneself in the foot. What little aid Mexico gets from Washington is mostly destined to help finance Mexico\u2019s efforts to stop migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras from traveling across Mexico and into the United States.But that might not matter anymore. When the dust settles on Mr. Trump\u2019s rearrangement of relations with Mexico, Mexico is unlikely to keep lending a hand. The United States\u2019 most effective tool to curb illegal immigration will be lost. And then his wall might come in handy.The Economic Scene column on Friday, about President Trump\u2019s options for making Mexico pay for a border wall, referred incorrectly to Oklahoma\u2019s fee on money transfers abroad. The fees began in 2010 and continue; the state did not \u201cbriefly\u201d impose the fee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Plan Sows Confusion as Tensions With Mexico Soar", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 President Trump\u2019s decision to build a wall along the length of the United States\u2019 southern border with Mexico erupted into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday, leading to the cancellation of a White House visit by Mexico\u2019s president and sharply rising tensions over who would pay for the wall.With the conflict escalating, Mr. Trump appeared to embrace a proposal by House Republicans that would impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters that the proceeds would be used to pay for the border wall, estimated to cost as much as $20 billion.But a furious uproar prompted Mr. Spicer to temper his earlier remarks, saying the plan was simply \u201cone idea\u201d that might work to finance the wall. Mr. Spicer said it was not the job of the White House to \u201croll something out\u201d on tax policy, while Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said the administration was considering \u201ca buffet of options.\u201dIf Mr. Trump does eventually announce his support for the tax plan, it could have a broad impact on the American economy, and its consumers and workers, by sharply increasing the prices of imported goods or reducing profits for the companies that produce them. Other nations could retaliate, prompting a trade war that could hit consumers around the globe.Retail businesses could see their tax bills surge, said David French of the National Retail Federation, who predicted that those costs would be passed on to consumers. He called the idea \u201cvery counter to the way consumers are feeling at the moment.\u201dIf nothing else, the rapid-fire developments showed Mr. Trump that international diplomacy and a top-to-bottom overhaul of the tax code would not be as easy as an announcement before a campaign microphone. The events unfolded after Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to strengthen the nation\u2019s deportation force and start construction on a new wall along the border.Adding to Mexico\u2019s perception of an insult was the timing of the order: It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington, and just days before a scheduled meeting between Mr. Trump and the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.The sense of chaos and confusion about the tax issue added to the fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s conflict with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, his first direct clash with a world leader since becoming president a week ago. The Mexican peso bounced sharply with each new development.Tensions between the two have been simmering for months, despite comments by both men that they were trying to work together. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration and border-wall decisions on Wednesday appeared to shatter the remaining good will between them.\u201cI regret and condemn the United States\u2019 decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said.Mr. Trump responded on Twitter, \u201cIf Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.\u201dWithin hours, that is just what happened. Blasting Mr. Trump for sowing division between the countries, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto angrily backed out of the White House meeting, which had been scheduled for next week.In remarks at congressional Republicans\u2019 retreat in Philadelphia, Mr. Trump portrayed the decision to cancel the meeting as his own and issued a stern warning to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto about the consequences of refusing to cooperate with him on financing the wall.\u201cUnless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to go a different route,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have no choice.\u201dIn the same remarks, Mr. Trump alluded to the idea of a border tax, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports, and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route.\u201dAfter the speech, in a brief, impromptu news conference as Mr. Trump flew back to Washington, Mr. Spicer told reporters that the president now favored the plan to impose a 20 percent border tax as part of a sweeping overhaul of corporate taxation. Only last week, Mr. Trump had dismissed the tax as too complicated, favoring his own plan to impose a 35 percent tariff on manufactured goods made by American corporations in overseas factories.Mr. Spicer said that the plan for the tax was \u201ctaking shape\u201d and that it was \u201creally going to provide the funding\u201d for the wall.Mr. Spicer said that was a direct reference to the centerpiece of House Republicans\u2019 proposal to overhaul the tax code. They have been pushing the idea for months, but with little evidence, until Thursday, that Mr. Trump was interested in it.But by the time Mr. Spicer returned to the White House two hours later, he had already recanted. In another hastily arranged conversation with reporters, he called the proposal \u201cone idea\u201d that might work and said it was not the job of the White House to \u201croll something out\u201d on tax policy.\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked over and over again: \u2018How could you possibly do this? There\u2019s no way that Mexico will pay for it,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cHere\u2019s one way. Boom. Done. We could go in another direction. We could talk about tariffs. We could talk about other custom user fees. There are a hundred other things.\u201dThe White House and House Republicans have been hashing out their respective tax proposals as they press forward with Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda to revive American manufacturing and increase exports.The House proposal would replace the current system of corporate taxation with one that more closely resembles the approach taken by many other developed nations. The government would impose a 20 percent tax on corporate income earned in the United States, which would have the effect of taxing imports while exempting exports.The approach, known as border adjustment, creates the appearance of taxing trade deficits. The goods that the United States imported from Mexico in 2015 were worth about $60 billion more than the goods it exported to Mexico, so federal revenue in the short term would increase by roughly $12 billion.But the House plan would offset that revenue by reducing the 35 percent corporate income tax rate, and would thus generate no new federal revenue over all. It was unclear how that fit with Mr. Spicer\u2019s repeated contention Thursday afternoon that revenue from the tax adjustment would help finance construction of the border wall.By siphoning off that revenue, Mr. Trump would make it impossible to reduce the tax rate as far as Republicans wish. He is pressing for a 15 percent corporate tax rate.Moreover, the tax would not be paid by Mexico. It would be paid by companies selling Mexican goods in the United States. Some might raise prices, imposing the cost on consumers, while others might be forced by competitive pressures to absorb the tax, reducing their profits. Many economists also doubt that the change would end up penalizing imports or encouraging exports. They predict that the value of the dollar would rise, offsetting those effects.Nonetheless, many businesses in industries such as retail and energy, which rely heavily on imports, were in a panic.Representative Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who wrote the plan, told Fox News on Thursday afternoon that he was pleased that Mr. Trump appeared to be on board with it after his appearance in Philadelphia.\u201cWhat I heard today from this president was that in tax reform, that they would level the playing field for imports around the world and level it with the U.S. products here in America at the exact same rate,\u201d Mr. Brady said.Michael D. Shear reported from Philadelphia, and Binyamin Appelbaum and Alan Rappeport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Corner, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico Punches Back", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Hunkered down in the presidential palace, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the unpopular leader of Mexico, was besieged on both sides.For months, though his ratings hovered near the single digits, the worst of any Mexican president in recent history, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto resisted the temptation to saber-rattle, arguing that the relationship with America was simply too important to fall prey to a war of words.He wanted to give diplomacy one last try. By Thursday morning, the effort had officially failed.In a blitz of Twitter messages from the two presidents, fired off over the past two days, the first full-blown foreign policy standoff of the Trump administration has taken shape.The public sparring came after months of simmering tensions between the two men. For decades, the United States and Mexico have expanded their cooperation and increasingly entwined their fortunes. Now the relationship between America and one of its most important allies and trading partners is being rewritten \u2014 on Twitter \u2014 culminating in a remarkable back-and-forth as the world looked on.It began with Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamation to build the wall. Next came a diplomatic response from Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, urging unity, accompanied by suggestions from his aides that the meeting might be scrapped over the offense.Mr. Trump followed on Thursday morning with a threat to cancel the meeting himself. Soon after, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto officially announced that he would not attend, effectively beating Mr. Trump to the punch.The exchange offered insight into the evolution of Mexico\u2019s president, who began his term with great fanfare in 2012, only to be hounded by scandal, the violence engulfing his nation, a steady decline in the polls and, now, perhaps the worst period in Mexican-American relations since President Calvin Coolidge.\u201cMost illegal immigration is coming from our southern border,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a Republican retreat. \u201cI\u2019ve said many times that the American people will not pay for the wall, and I\u2019ve made that clear to the government of Mexico.\u201dNow Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto must find a way to preserve his nation\u2019s economic interests while confronting an unpredictable, and at times hostile, American president.In some respects, Mexico has become a trial run for Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to place America first on the global stage.In his dealings with Mr. Trump, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has found himself in a bind: trapped between his own people, who have demanded a vehement response to Mr. Trump\u2019s taunts about Mexico, and a foreign leader who controls much of his country\u2019s destiny.\u201cPe\u00f1a Nieto has made a superhuman effort,\u201d said Jesus Silva-Herzog, a professor at the School of Government at Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey. \u201cHe has gone above and beyond to preserve the friendship with America and has done everything possible, while risking all of his prestige and popularity, to try to find a common ground of trust with Mr. Trump.\u201dDuring the campaign and now as president, Mr. Trump has taken aim at perhaps the most prized possession of Mexico: its image. Throughout his presidency, the Mexican leader has tried to portray his country as a place of economic opportunity, a cultural capital and a nation rising on the world stage. Mr. Trump has sought to show the opposite, characterizing Mexico as a bastion of crime, illegal immigration and unfair trade.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has faced a dilemma: to defend Mexico\u2019s honor, or to defend its national interests by preserving ties with the United States at all costs.For months, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto made his choice clear. To the growing anger of many Mexicans, he avoided responding rashly to Mr. Trump. Calls for the building of a wall, promises to deport millions and threats to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement have been met with measured, understated responses. Adding to his vulnerability are the millions of Mexican citizens living in the United States, whom Mr. Trump appeared to target in his executive orders on Wednesday.For Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the economics were particularly difficult. Having begun his presidency with a focus on the economy, the idea of canceling Nafta or leaving Mexico a less desirable place for foreign investment was an existential crisis waiting to happen.Dialogue, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said, was the only way forward. It was in keeping with the start of his administration, when he negotiated the passage of several major economic reforms with two rival political parties, paving the way for needed changes to the nation\u2019s antiquated systems of telecommunications, energy and education.By the time Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto invited Mr. Trump to Mexico for a visit during the American presidential campaign, his own image was as tarnished as the one Mr. Trump had painted of Mexico. The Mexican leader was trying to find common ground and engage in dialogue with the candidate, but at home, it was a political miscalculation. His reputation in Mexico sank even further.\u201cIt would have been like a cousin inviting us to dinner and then uninviting us, or worse, said we were only allowed to come if we paid for dinner,\u201d Mr. Silva-Herzog said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated promises to make Mexico pay for the wall.Now, despite the tensions with the United States and the problems they may cause, there is a silver lining, especially for the perception of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto at home.\u201cThese are ugly times, and things will get uglier. I don\u2019t really see a way out it, but in this context, our great advantage will be that Mexicans are united,\u201d Javier Sol\u00f3rzano, a prominent journalist, said in a video posted online. The country, he added, \u201cis now united around the president.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Heineken Sets Sights on Brazil", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsHeineken hopes that Dutch courage will succeed where Japanese adventurism did not. The beer company is in talks to buy the Brazilian unit of Kirin, and may pay $872 million, according to Japanese news media. Landing a deal would give the company close to a 20 percent market share, still well behind its dominant rival, Anheuser-Busch InBev. The target is loss-making, but Heineken has reason to believe it could do a better job.The Amsterdam-based beer giant got a perch in the Brazilian market in 2010 when it bought Femsa, owner of the Kaiser and Sol brands. It is currently the No. 3 player, holding around a 10 percent market share, according to MarketLine research. AB InBev looms large with 70 percent.Although Heineken does not break out details on how it is faring in the country, Brazil has been a headache for brewers. AB InBev said beer volumes declined by 4.1 percent in its third quarter, year on year, as a tough economy squeezed consumer incomes. However, the country\u2019s huge beer market will be worth close to $60 billion by 2020, up from $40 billion in 2015, according to MarketLine. Heineken is maneuvering for a bigger slug of that growth.A sale would also suit the target\u2019s Japanese owner, which is keen to offload a 2011 investment gone sour. Brasil Kirin is forecasting a full-year operating loss for 2016, although the extent of its losses will narrow on 2015. Its market share has fallen to 12 percent from over 15 percent since the acquisition, according to Jefferies.The price looks commensurate. An $872 million price tag, reported by the business daily Nikkei, implies a valuation of 0.9 times the forecast 2016 revenue \u2014 around $980 million. Heineken trades on a multiple of 2.5 times sales, Eikon data shows. Kirin, back in the day, paid 2.2 times forecast revenue for the business, then called Schincariol.Heineken has a few options for hauling the unit back to profitability. AB InBev\u2019s 38 percent third-quarter profit margin, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, gives something to aim for. The Dutch group may have scope to slash operating costs by combining Brasil Kirin with its existing brewery and distribution network in the country. And the extra market heft, as well as one rival fewer, may bring pricing power. By getting into position now, Heineken can profit when Brazil gets its swing back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sweden, Happiness in a Shorter Workday Can\u2019t Overcome the Cost", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byThere\u2019s just one catch. The practice is too expensive and unwieldy to become widespread in Sweden anytime soon.The two-year trial, which took place in the southern city of Gothenburg, centered on a municipal retirement home where workers were switched to a six-hour day, from eight hours, with no pay cut. Seventeen new nursing positions were created to make up for the loss of time, at a cost of around 700,000 euros, or $738,000, a year.Although it was small, the experiment stoked a widespread discussion about the future of work, namely whether investing in a better work-life balance for employees, and treating workers well rather than squeezing them, benefits the bottom line for companies and economies.\u201cThe trial showed that there are many benefits of a shorter working day,\u201d said Daniel Bernmar, the leader of the Left party on Gothenburg\u2019s City Council, which had pushed for the experiment. \u201cThey include healthier staff, a better work environment and lower unemployment.\u201dBut the high price tag, and political skepticism about the practicality of a shorter workday, was likely to discourage widespread support for taking the concept nationwide.\u201cThe government is avoiding talking about the issue,\u201d Mr. Bernmar said. \u201cThey\u2019re not interested in looking at the bigger picture.\u201dWhile a growing number of countries and companies are studying the concept of employee happiness, the idea of improving it through shorter work hours has by no means gained broad traction. In Gothenburg, the City Council\u2019s conservative opposition parties derided the experiment as a utopian folly and sought to kill it, citing high costs for taxpayers and arguments that the government should not intrude in the workplace. The current government is also not backing a shorter workweek.Even the handful of progressive political groups aligned with Mr. Bernmar\u2019s Left party have not made a six-hour workday in Sweden a priority in their platforms. Nor have large Swedish companies, including multinationals active around the world, embraced the idea. Other Swedish towns that previously conducted limited experiments with a shorter public-sector workweek eventually abandoned the concept, citing high costs and flawed implementation.A similar model in France has been controversial for more than 15 years, ever since a Socialist government made a 35-hour workweek mandatory.Still, some large companies are beginning to explore the argument that happy workers may make better, more productive employees.In the experiment at the Gothenburg retirement home, employees reported working with greater efficiency and energy when their hours were cut to six from eight a day. They called in sick 15 percent less than before and perceived their health to have improved at least 20 percent, according to a preliminary review issued last year.At a nearby municipal retirement home, where a control trial left working conditions unchanged, employees reported increased blood pressure and said they perceived no improvement in their health, peace of mind or alertness, the review showed. A final report is scheduled to be released in March.The program increased Gothenburg\u2019s costs by 22 percent, mostly to pay for new employees. But around 10 percent was offset by reduced costs to the state from people being taken off the unemployment rolls and paying taxes into the system, rather than receiving state subsidies, Mr. Bernmar said.Modest experiments are moving ahead in a handful of small towns in Sweden, mostly in the public health care sector, to see if the results from Gothenburg can be duplicated. This year, four additional Swedish municipalities are expected to start research programs.A small but growing number of private Swedish companies, mainly technology start-ups, are also dabbling with the concept, following the lead of some established companies, including a Toyota service center in Gothenburg that has successfully operated on a six-hour day for more than a decade.The question, Mr. Bernmar added, was \u201cshould we work to live, not live to work?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Most Economists Are So Worried About Trump", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byDismal ScienceIf the November election was intended as a rejection of elites, of expertise and of the sort of technocratic advice that economists often give, it\u2019s a punch that has landed.Few see useful channels for influence. Partly this reflects President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s legislative plans. On issues like restricting trade, directly intervening to assist specific industries or corporations, targeting tax cuts to the wealthy, his agenda stands as a rejection of the advice that mainstream economist have typically offered.And partly this reflects Mr. Trump\u2019s appointments. Few of his key economic advisers have any economics training, and the only official who identifies as an economist \u2014 Peter Navarro, who earned a Harvard Ph.D. in economics and will head up the newly formed National Trade Council \u2014 stands so far outside the mainstream that he endorses few of the key tenets of the profession.Concern about the role of economic advice translated into concern about the economy. Over three days of intense discussions, I didn\u2019t encounter a single economist who expressed optimism that Mr. Trump\u2019s administration would be good for the economy. The optimists were those who thought Mr. Trump would not have the energy to actually implement his agenda; the pessimists\u2019 thoughts veered toward disaster.I\u2019m not quite sure how to reconcile these conflicting signals. One possibility is that Mr. Trump remains something of an unknown, and each group is filling in the blanks differently. Small businesses, pleased to see a businessman in the White House, might be tempted to believe the best. By contrast, there\u2019s a reason that economics is called the dismal science, and few economists trust politicians \u2014 of either stripe \u2014 to get things right. Greater uncertainty gives economists a broader canvas upon which to project their pessimism.But it may also be that these groups are describing different things. Businesses and markets care about profits. Economists focus on workers as well as the businesses they work for, on buyers as well as sellers, and on new firms as much as existing firms. Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-regulatory zeal may help businesses but hurt workers; his anti-trade agenda could help sellers but hurt buyers; and his instincts to protect existing jobs may advantage existing businesses at the expense of the next generation of entrepreneurs.Perhaps this fear makes sense: It\u2019s the double whammy that worries economists, that Mr. Trump\u2019s populist pose assigns less value to economic expertise, while also creating the conditions under which it\u2019s most likely to be needed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Traffic Deaths Dip Again. It\u2019s Not Enough, Mayor\u2019s Critics Say.", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byAfter two years of major declines in New York City\u2019s traffic deaths, the number of people killed in crashes dropped slightly last year while pedestrian deaths rose, leading to questions about whether Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s ambitious campaign to eliminate traffic fatalities has stalled.Making streets safer has been near the top of the agenda for Mr. de Blasio, who pledged to cut traffic deaths to zero by 2024. While city officials said traffic deaths were at their lowest level in a century, the uneven results last year suggest that the mayor\u2019s goal will be very difficult to achieve.\u201cWe are very committed,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on the cable news channel NY1 this month. \u201cI believe in Vision Zero 110 percent, and now we have three years running where it\u2019s produced better results each year.\u201dThe early days of the new year have gotten off to a deadly start, with at least four fatal hit-and-run crashes in the city. On Monday, an 85-year-old man was hit and killed by a truck in Brooklyn, and the driver left the scene, the police said. A few hours later, a 43-year-old man was killed when a driver hit him and several parked cars in Brooklyn.The city has managed to make progress on Vision Zero even as there has been a sharp increase in traffic fatalities nationwide. \"I think it\u2019s remarkable that the city has seen three years in a row of reduced traffic fatalities, very much bucking the national trend,\u201d Ms. Trottenberg said.Mr. Rosekind blamed a strong economy, the persistent problem of drunken driving and distractions like smartphones, among other factors.\u201cMore people are working, and more people have money they can spend, and all of that puts more people on the road,\u201d Mr. Rosekind said. He praised New York for reducing traffic deaths.In New York City, the greatest drop in traffic fatalities last year involved people who were riding in motor vehicles; the number fell to 48 deaths, from 59 in 2015. Motorcyclist deaths also dropped last year to 19, from 22 in 2015.Paul Steely White, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group, said he was concerned about the increase in pedestrian and cyclist deaths. He called on Mr. de Blasio to include additional financing in his budget this year to improve dangerous streets.\u201cThat\u2019s really job No. 1 for the mayor \u2014 to fix those badly designed streets,\u201d Mr. White said.Austin Finan, a spokesman for the mayor, said the city would continue to make improvements. \u201cThe city is firmly committed to Vision Zero investments in street redesigns and enforcement that save lives,\u201d Mr. Finan said in a statement. \u201cNo legal decision will change that.\u201dAfter having grown disillusioned with former Police Commissioner William J. Bratton for not moving aggressively enough on Vision Zero, some safety advocates are hoping for a fresh start with Police Commissioner James P. O\u2019Neill. The Police Department is a critical partner on safety because officers handle traffic enforcement and investigate serious crashes.The department issued more than 40,000 summonses for failure to yield last year, and more than 135,000 summonses for speeding, city officials said. Both numbers are up slightly from 2015, but essentially flat. More than 1.3 million speed camera violations were issued last year from cameras stationed near schools \u2014 a program the city wants to expand.Mr. White said he was encouraged because Mr. O\u2019Neill was a bicycle rider and likely understands the perspective of New Yorkers who navigate the city outside of cars.\u201cPeople who only drive are more inclined to blame a pedestrian, or think they\u2019re always in the way,\u201d Mr. White said.\u201cThere are no words in the dictionary to explain it,\u201d Ms. Williams said in an interview. \u201cThis morning, I cried and cried.

The economy at the time was suffering from high unemployment, and with monetary policy operating close to its limits, I pushed (unsuccessfully) for fiscal policies to increase aggregate demand and job creation. Today, with the economy approaching full employment, the need for demand-side stimulus, while perhaps not entirely gone, is surely much less than it was three or four years ago. There is still a case for fiscal policy action today, but to increase output without unduly increasing inflation the focus should be on improving productivity and aggregate supply\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, through improved public infrastructure that makes our economy more efficient or tax reforms that promote private capital investment.But he gently expresses doubt that this kind of thing is actually going to happen:In particular, will Republicans be willing to support big increases in spending, including infrastructure spending? Alternatively, if Congress opts to reduce the deficit impact of an infrastructure program by financing it through tax credits and public-private partnerships, as candidate Trump proposed, the program might turn out to be relatively small.Let me be less gentle: there will be no significant public investment program, for two reasons.First, Congressional Republicans have no interest in such a program. They\u2019re hell-bent on depriving millions of health care and cutting taxes at the top; they aren\u2019t even talking about public investment, and would probably drag their feet even if Trump came forward with a detailed plan and made it a priority.But this then raises the obvious question: who really believes that this crew is going to come up with a serious plan? Trump has no policy shop, nor does he show any intention of creating one; he\u2019s too busy tweeting about perceived insults from celebrities, and he\u2019s creating a cabinet of people who know nothing about their responsibilities. Any substantive policy actions will be devised and turned into legislation by Congressional Republicans who, again, have zero interest in a public investment program.So investors betting on a big infrastructure push are almost surely deluding themselves. We may see some conspicuous privatizations, especially if they come with naming opportunities: maybe putting in new light fixtures will let him rename Hoover Dam as Trump Dam? But little or no real investment is coming.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China Seeks Bigger Role on World Stage, Xi Jinping Will Go to Davos World Economic Forum", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byBut it is unclear whether Mr. Xi, who rarely ventures beyond platitudes in discussing the strategies of the world\u2019s second largest economy, can take advantage of this time of transition when the rest of the world is gauging whether the United States is pulling back from global leadership.Mr. Xi may sense an opening during a historic inflection point. He plans to deliver a speech at Davos at a moment when the incoming United States president, Donald J. Trump, has suggested that the United States should withdraw from the traditional superpower role it has played since World War II, including its leadership of a global free trade agenda.In recent years, Davos had come to embody that American-led agenda \u2014 a gathering at an Alpine ski resort of some of the world\u2019s most powerful figures in the realms of politics, media and technology. Discussions each year have been set by Western leaders, not Asian ones.But events of the past year brought into sharp focus a rise in populist denunciations of globalization, free trade and inequality in some Western nations, including the United States, with Davos frequently mentioned by critics as a symbol of the root causes of their countries\u2019 ailments.China has benefited greatly from access to international trade markets since its entry in 2001 into the World Trade Organization, and it could now become the most vocal proponent of that system. Mr. Trump campaigned on opposition to the existing global trade system and has denounced China for competing unfairly against the United States.People\u2019s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, published an article Wednesday that said China could become the \u201ctorchbearer of the open trade system\u201d and boasted that Mr. Xi\u2019s visit \u201cwill boost the world\u2019s confidence in global governance.\u201dHis appearance is a logical step in his country\u2019s evolution into a globe-spanning superpower, a rapid transformation that has been marked by bold symbolic gestures and events in the past decade, including the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing under President Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessor.Premiers of China, including the current one, Li Keqiang, have attended Davos before, but the nation\u2019s president \u2014 and head of the Communist Party \u2014 has never been to the gathering.\u201cClearly it signals that Xi Jinping is now interested in writing both China and himself in a grander way on the global diplomatic horizon,\u201d said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cHe feels it\u2019s time to really come out. Behind that probably is an assumption and wishful thinking that the U.S. is in disarray, Europe is feckless, and so on.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll be received almost as the number one citizen at Davos,\u201d Mr. Schell added.Mr. Xi plans to attend Davos on Jan. 17, during a state visit to Switzerland from Jan. 15 to 18, said Lu Kang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. Mr. Xi is expected to speak at the opening session of the forum, which runs from Jan. 17 to 20.Strong anti-globalization sentiments erupted last year in the movement in Britain that culminated in the popular vote by British citizens to leave the European Union. But it was Mr. Trump\u2019s election in November that was the apotheosis of the move in the West toward isolationism, and meetings and conversations at Davos \u2014 whose theme this year is \u201cresponsive and responsible leadership\u201d \u2014 will take place in the shadow of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises and rhetoric.Victor Shih, a scholar of China\u2019s political economy at the University of California, San Diego, said there are actually some global agenda matters on which China\u2019s influence \u201cmight have peaked in the medium term.\u201dHe pointed to China\u2019s push in recent years to have the renminbi counted as an international currency. That has been undermined in the past year by efforts of the Chinese central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, to withdraw large quantities of offshore renminbi from circulation. The bank has been doing that in order to try to prop up the value of the renminbi and limit capital flight from China, including the transfer of money to Hong Kong by wealthy Chinese.\u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China continues to claim that renminbi internationalization is important, and of course, at Davos, President Xi may continue to pay verbal homage to that agenda because it would be an important sign of China\u2019s ascendance on the world stage,\u201d Mr. Shih said. \u201cYet, in the past year, we have seen renminbi deposits outside of mainland China decline by hundreds of billions of renminbi.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seven Questions About Health Reform", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsOn Tuesday, Donald J. Trump said he wanted Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act right away and replace it with a new plan \u201cvery shortly thereafter.\u201d But before they abandon all the work that has gone into the health care law since 2010, President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress owe Americans a detailed explanation of how they plan to replace it. They should not repeal the law until they have submitted their replacement proposal for analysis by nonpartisan authorities like the Congressional Budget Office and the Tax Policy Center to determine how it will affect health insurance coverage, state and federal finances and individual tax burdens.Vague promises are not enough when we are considering enormous changes in this country\u2019s $3 trillion medical economy. Here are seven important questions that Congress must answer about its replacement plan before repealing the Affordable Care Act: 1. How many millions of Americans will lose coverage? The A.C.A. expanded Medicaid coverage to around 12 million people in 31 states and the District of Columbia, and provided financial assistance for moderate-income Americans to buy insurance. These measures have reduced the percentage of Americans who are uninsured to the lowest levels in history. Proposals by Tom Price, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to run Health and Human Services, and by the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, would repeal the expansion of Medicaid and replace the A.C.A.\u2019s income-based subsidies with less generous tax credits. Another plan from the House Republican Study Committee would offer deductions. We particularly need to know how this would affect low-income Americans, to whom tax deductions are nearly worthless, and who would generally not be able to afford coverage under these plans.4. What other services are likely to be cut? Before the A.C.A., about a third of individual insurance market enrollees lacked coverage for the treatment of addiction, and nearly 20 percent lacked mental health coverage. One recent Republican proposal would require coverage only for hospital, physician and emergency care services. Will insurers be allowed to exclude any other services that they choose not to cover?6. What will happen to the more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions? Among the most important \u2014 and popular \u2014 provisions of the A.C.A. are its requirements that insurers cover and not charge higher premiums to people who have pre-existing conditions like cancer.7. Finally, how much more will those with costly illnesses or injuries have to pay in out-of-pocket costs? Critics of the A.C.A. often argue that the law has made health care unaffordable. But many Americans would pay much more without it. The A.C.A. capped out-of-pocket spending at $7,150 for individuals and $14,300 for families for 2017. Republican proposals appear to offer no protection from high deductibles and other cost-sharing.This is a short list. One might ask many other important questions about changes to Medicare, Medicaid and insurance bought through employers. Before Congress leaps off the precipice of repeal, Americans have the right to ask, \u201cWhere will we land?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans\u2019 4-Step Plan to Repeal the Affordable Care Act", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President-elect Mike Pence and the top Republicans in Congress made clear on Wednesday, more powerfully and explicitly than ever, that they are dead serious about repealing the Affordable Care Act.How they can uproot a law deeply embedded in the nation\u2019s health care system without hurting some of the 20 million people who have gained coverage through it is not clear. Nor is it yet evident that millions of Americans with pre-existing medical conditions will be fully protected against disruptions in their health coverage.But a determined Republican president and Congress can gut the Affordable Care Act, and do it quickly: a step-by-step health care revolution in reverse that would undo many of the changes made since the law was signed by President Obama in March 2010.The Senate intends to pass a budget resolution next week that would shield repeal legislation from a Democratic filibuster. If the Senate completes its action, House Republican leaders hope that they, too, can approve a version of the budget resolution next week. Whether they can meet that goal is unclear.The resolution contains seemingly innocuous language, instructing four committees that control health care policy \u2014 two in the Senate, two in the House \u2014 to draft legislation within their jurisdiction that would cut at least $1 billion from the deficit over 10 years. But that language has real teeth. The legislation produced to meet those instructions can pass the Senate with a simple majority \u2014 51 votes if all senators are present \u2014 obliterating the power of the Democratic minority to block it.Those four committees would have just a few weeks, until Jan. 27, to produce legislation repealing major provisions of the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans have some practice at this, because they have voted more than 60 times since 2011 to repeal some or all of the law.The budget blueprint will guide Congress but will not be presented to the president for a signature or veto.The committees \u2014 House Energy and Commerce, House Ways and Means, Senate Finance, and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \u2014 will quickly assemble legislation intended to eviscerate the health care law.Instead, the legislation would:\u25a0 Eliminate the tax penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees.\u25a0 Eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid.\u25a0 Repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges.It could also repeal some of the taxes and fees that help pay for the expansion of coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But some Republicans have indicated that they may want to use some of that revenue for their as-yet-undetermined plan to replace the health care law.The 2010 law imposed taxes and fees on certain high-income people and on health insurers and manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and medical devices, among others. Republicans have not said for sure which taxes they will scrap and which they may keep.Within days of taking office, President-elect Donald J. Trump plans to announce executive actions on health care. Some may undo Obama administration policies. Others will be meant to stabilize health insurance markets and prevent them from collapsing in a vast sea of uncertainty.\u201cWe are working on a series of executive orders that the president-elect will put into effect to ensure that there is an orderly transition, during the period after we repeal Obamacare, to a market-based health care economy,\u201d Mr. Pence said at the Capitol on Wednesday.He did not provide details, and Trump transition aides said they had no information about the executive orders. But some options are apparent. The federal government could continue providing financial assistance to insurance companies to protect them against financial losses and to prevent consumers\u2019 premiums from soaring more than they have in the last few years.Even as they move full speed toward gutting the existing health law, Republicans are scrambling to find a replacement. At the moment, they have no consensus.Mr. Pence said on Wednesday that the replacement would probably encourage greater use of personal health savings accounts and make it easier for carriers to sell insurance across state lines. Also, he said, it would encourage small businesses to band together and buy insurance through \u201cassociation health plans\u201d sponsored by business and professional organizations.Some type of subsidy or tax credit for consumers, to help defray the cost of premiums, is also likely. States would have more authority to set insurance standards, and the federal government would have less.Mr. Trump has also endorsed the idea of state-run \u201chigh-risk pools\u201d for people with pre-existing conditions who would otherwise have difficulty finding affordable coverage.Many experts have said that repealing the health law without a clear plan to replace it could create havoc in insurance markets. Doctors, hospitals and insurance companies do not know what to expect.Without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance, and without subsidies to buy it, supporters of the law say many healthy people would go without coverage, knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it.Democrats in Congress say they will do everything they can to thwart Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. They plan to dramatize their case by publicizing the experiences of people whose lives have been saved or improved by the law.In the Senate next week, Democrats will demand votes intended to put Republicans on record against proposals that could protect consumers. Defenders of the law also hope to mobilize groups like the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association to speak up for patients.The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, are encouraging their colleagues to organize rallies around the country on Jan. 15 to oppose the Republicans\u2019 health care agenda.And to buttress their case, Democrats are compiling statistics from the White House and from researchers at liberal-leaning groups like the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Commonwealth Fund and the Urban Institute, which warn of catastrophic consequences if the law is repealed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pressure From Trump May Delay a Factory\u2019s Exit, but It Won\u2019t Stop It", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewEven if President Trump\u2019s industrial-policy-by-Twitter-post fails over the long run to create jobs or prevent companies from moving offshore, there\u2019s a good chance that it will appear, at first, to be a success.But this is a dangerous illusion, the result of companies responding strategically to the new president\u2019s threats. And it could lead to more bad policy if voters or policy makers draw the wrong conclusions.That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to understand precisely how these new policies are likely to shape the numbers over the next few years. Some simple economics can help.Moreover, Mr. Trump is targeting the asset that corporate bosses tend to protect most jealously: their personal reputation. Which makes them edgy.But this doesn\u2019t mean that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets have saved jobs. At least not in a lasting sense.If enough companies follow this script over the next couple of years, the number of factory jobs in the United States should stabilize, or even rise. Mr. Trump\u2019s eventual successor may well inherit a manufacturing sector that is superficially stronger, though it will hide an underlying weakness: thousands of C.E.O.s ready to move production offshore. As soon as Mr. Trump leaves the stage, several years worth of pent-up demand for offshoring may erupt, and as these plans are followed and factory jobs return to more normal levels, expect a sharp drop in manufacturing employment.Now imagine what all this will look like to a future policy wonk. Manufacturing jobs seemed to be scarce before Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure, improved while he was at the helm, and then shrank sharply as soon as he left office. It might seem as though his angry tweets actually caused manufacturing to thrive.But it would be a mistake to infer that businesses really perform better when threatened. Rather, the fluctuating jobs numbers reflect the ease with which cuts can be delayed, not prevented. Sure, a delay is, in itself, good news for factory workers who keep their jobs a little longer, but it doesn\u2019t address their longer-term problems.The cost of hiring crisis managers to deal with Mr. Trump raises the cost of doing business just as surely as a tax hike would. By making it more expensive to leave the market, he also creates a disincentive for foreign companies thinking of building plants in the United States.The difficulty with trying to use the bully pulpit to create a lasting change in corporate behavior is that words \u2014 even a president\u2019s \u2014 don\u2019t much alter a company\u2019s bottom line. Corporate decisions are driven by the balance of costs and benefits, and the benefits of offshoring are typically large and enduring.Still, for short periods, even relatively minor incentive shifts can cause large reactions when what is involved is merely a delay, not fundamental change. For example, imagine two people who love Canc\u00fan and have decided to vacation there; if the cost of a flight rises by $100, they will go anyway, because the cost isn\u2019t enough to deter them. But if the airfare rises by $100 on Sunday, the day they had planned to go, but was to remain at the original price on Monday, the travelers may well decide to wait a day. So fewer people may fly to Mexico on the weekend, when it\u2019s more expensive, yet there will be no long-term impact on travel. Temporary policies often look as though they have disproportionately large effects, but they aren\u2019t meaningful.That is the odd truth here: Mr. Trump\u2019s approach may appear to have had a big effect precisely because it\u2019s not viewed as a permanent solution. In fact, the more temporary his threat-based industrial policy is thought to be, the more likely it is that chief executives will delay job cuts until the climate changes. Perhaps corporate bosses are currently pliant because they expect that this storm will pass.But bad economics can be good politics. We may see some spectacular short-run effects, even if Mr. Trump undermines the long-run competitiveness of America\u2019s factories. The political upside will be obvious in the monthly employment numbers, while the economic downside will be difficult to disentangle from the decades-long trend of declining factory jobs. Yet we shouldn\u2019t be deluded. C.E.O.s will ultimately move jobs abroad if that\u2019s what it takes to churn out profits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Recovery Finally Yields Big Gains for Average Worker\u2019s Pay", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byIt has been a long time coming \u2014 eight years, in fact \u2014 but the economic recovery is finally showing up in the average American worker\u2019s paycheck in a big way.There have been plenty of winners in the recovery, which began in mid-2009: companies, homeowners, investors and, especially, households at the apex of the economic pyramid. But the paucity of gains in take-home pay has stoked anxiety and frustration for many others, a factor in the wave of discontent that President-elect Donald J. Trump rode to victory in November.And many economists expect the trend to gain momentum this year, as a tighter labor market forces employers to pay more to hire and retain workers. \u201cThis is a turning point for the overall economy,\u201d said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago.While wage growth was robust last year, government data for December showed a more tepid increase in employment, with 156,000 jobs added during the month, and a slight uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.7 percent.Until recently, a rise in salaries one month would peter out the next, but the upward trajectory in 2016 reflects wage gains even for Americans at the low end of the pay scale, Ms. Swonk said. Leisure and hospitality workers, for example, saw hourly earnings jump 4.4 percent from a year earlier, equal to the increase enjoyed by employees in the surging technology sector.\u201cStrong economic growth doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s not widely distributed,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cYou can have a better economy but still not good enough for people who aren\u2019t participating at all.\u201dA more comprehensive government barometer of unemployment, which includes workers forced to take part-time jobs because full-time positions were not available, stood at 9.2 percent in December, a much higher level than at this point in past recoveries.But rising wages should counter the economic undertow, especially if the gains remain broad-based. And while a 2.9 percent increase may not sound like much, it goes much further because inflation is about 1.7 percent.Economists expect wages to rise by up to 3.5 percent in 2017 \u2014 still below the gains many workers saw in the recovery of the mid-2000s, and in the tech-fueled boom of the late 1990s.Even in California, where, at 50 cents an hour, the wage gain is not as steep, one in 10 workers has gotten a raise. And minimum-wage gains can have a spillover effect, pushing up pay for workers just above the bottom salary tier.On Friday, Wall Street embraced the not-too-hot, not-too-cold labor market figures, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average close to 20,000 and a new nominal record.Investors and traders are watching the jobs data closely for clues about when the Federal Reserve Board may next raise interest rates.Monthly job creation last year was well below the 236,000 average for hiring in 2014 and 2015. But with the economy close to what Fed policy makers and other experts consider full employment, employers are increasing wages, to retain workers and to attract new ones.While the minimum wage increases provide a floor when it comes to pay, the ceiling continues to rise in fields like financial services, sales and technology, said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing company.\u201cAcross the board, I see more aggressive salaries being offered by corporations than at any time in the last 10 years,\u201d Mr. Gimbel said.Seasoned sales representatives are drawing base salaries of $150,000 a year, compared with $125,000 two years ago, according to Mr. Gimbel. Entry-level software developers who once started at around $50,000 a year can now command $70,000.Other executives in the Midwest also report upward pressure on wages, including in grittier settings than the white-collar fields where engineers and financial professionals cluster.At Lou Malnati\u2019s Pizzeria, which has 46 restaurants in the Chicago area and one in Phoenix, entry-level pay in hourly positions like server, cook and dishwasher is now about $11.50 an hour, compared with $10 an hour three years ago.\u201cWe want to stay ahead of the minimum wage because we want to attract the best talent,\u201d Mr. Agnew said. A substantial portion of the chain\u2019s 3,000 workers have been with the company for more than 10 years, a rarity in the high-turnover restaurant industry that is another benefit of the slightly higher wages.Economists and politicians have long debated whether raising the minimum wage ultimately hurts workers as companies cut positions or leave them unfilled in the face of rising labor costs.So far, that has not been the case at Lou Malnati\u2019s, Mr. Agnew said. The chain has opened about a dozen new locations in the past three years, adding about 600 workers to its payroll over all.\u201cIt\u2019s very tricky, and I know the minimum wage may erode job creation in some industries,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in my own company, it hasn\u2019t hurt hiring.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s one of their best qualities, and often one of their most frustrating qualities, too. They live in the moment. They don\u2019t think ahead. If they\u2019re upset or happy, you can\u2019t just ask them to hold the emotion until you\u2019re done with a phone call.

Those smaller companies, which are franchisees of the big delivery companies, sign up drivers as employees or contractors. Some of those drivers subcontract their work to other drivers.Those arrangements often result in couriers who drive under the name of a big delivery company but whose hours and terms are only loosely managed, experts say. For example, many drivers lack workers\u2019 compensation benefits or insurance in case of accidents, said Jin Yingjie, a professor specializing in labor law at the China University of Political Science and Law.Delivery companies \u201cshould work to bring the industry into the confines of the labor law,\u201d she said.\u201cThe delivery companies are pushing drivers to the point of taking collective action,\u201d Mr. Elmer said.In December, a weeklong strike brought deliveries by one package company partly owned by Alibaba, YTO Express, to a halt in Baoji, a city in Shaanxi Province.\u201cWhere\u2019s our October pay?\u201d one of the deliverymen told a local TV station. \u201cThere needs to be someone in charge handling this. There\u2019s nobody.\u201dA spokeswoman for YTO Express said the strike was caused by a franchisee who did not promptly calculate fees or properly communicate with couriers.\u201cAlibaba is a leader in big data technology,\u201d an Alibaba spokesman said in a statement. \u201cTaking advantage of that strength, we are committed to helping the logistics industry improve its efficiency and the working conditions for couriers and other industry participants.\u201dMost couriers make about $300 to $600 a month, according to the Jiaotong study \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the wages of China\u2019s migrant factory workers. They can deliver 150 packages on a weekday, drivers said, sometimes helped by making mass deliveries to office buildings.Couriers generally make about 15 cents per package delivered, according to drivers and reports in the state news media, though they can make more by picking up outgoing packages from customers or through other tasks.The work initially appealed to many as package volume boomed. But their pay per package has barely budged in recent years as competition intensified and more drivers entered the market. About 40 percent of couriers quit within a year, according to the Jiaotong study.\u201cMost deliverymen are like me,\u201d said Lu Yong, who quit in December. \u201cThey work for three months and realize it\u2019s no good.\u201dMr. Lu, 29, of Henan Province, spent years assembling electronics in the southern province of Guangdong before going to work for a ZTO Express franchisee in Beijing. \u201cThe factories lack the same freedom as delivery, but it\u2019s not cold like here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every month you get four days of rest, too.\u201dMr. Lu\u2019s November pay slip showed that he was paid $382 on 4,291 packages delivered, after fines and other expenses including his uniform. He says he pays for maintenance on his cart, which bears ZTO\u2019s logo, including new tires, replacement batteries and new brakes. He also said he never signed a labor contract.James Guo, the chief financial officer of ZTO Express, said that it required its franchisees to comply with local laws but that \u201cit\u2019s not up to us to manage or control the compensation of our deliverymen.\u201dSome thrive. Li Pengbo, 21, from Henan Province, drives for Best Express, another large delivery company in which Alibaba owns a stake. He dominates the area he subcontracted from a Best Express franchisee, he said, and earns about $2,000 a month.\u201cSince the sixth day of the last Chinese New Year until now I haven\u2019t rested, not a single day,\u201d Mr. Li said, describing an 11-month stretch. \u201cI work from 6:30 in the morning until 11 or 12 p.m. at night.\u201d\u201cMy family is poor. This bitterness is nothing compared to what they\u2019ve gone through,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman for Best Express said its franchisees were required to follow labor laws.Franchisees say they have borne the brunt of declining delivery prices. \u201cIf we can turn a profit eight months of the year, that\u2019s not bad,\u201d said Wang Lin, a franchisee in Beijing for another delivery company, STO Express.Ms. Wang said her franchise does not pay for driver benefits because the drivers are contractors, not employees.\u201cFrankly it\u2019s not a very good job,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely tiring, the salary is not high, and the responsibility and risks are great.

{"Headline": "The Untimely Death of an Iranian Pragmatist", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byEditorialAyatollah Rafsanjani played a major role in getting Hassan Rouhani, a reformer, elected president. He was instrumental in persuading Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to agree to the 2015 deal, under which Iran has curbed its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions.His absence leaves Mr. Rouhani and other moderates without a powerful champion and eminence gris capable of standing up to and outmaneuvering forces determined to keep the West at bay. Some experts say Ayatollah Rafsanjani\u2019s death could also mean that the hard-line Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, charged with maintaining Iran\u2019s revolutionary character, will play a larger role in selecting a successor to Ayatollah Khamenei, who is ailing.A pragmatic and skilled behind-the-scenes operator, Ayatollah Rafsanjani remained committed to the revolution that deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi but felt that establishing relations with the United States was the best way to ensure the future of Iran\u2019s theocratic system.To that end, he advocated not only a warmer attitude toward the West but also more personal freedoms and free-market reforms at home. He sometimes ran afoul of the hard-liners, but generally got away with it because of his close ties with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who spearheaded the 1979 revolution, and his successor as supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei.Despite his considerable influence, Ayatollah Rafsanjani was blocked from running for president himself in 2013. But his support helped secure the election of Mr. Rouhani, as it had for Mohammad Khatami, a former president who has been sidelined by conservative opponents for years. Without Ayatollah Rafsanjani\u2019s help, Mr. Rouhani may have a tougher time winning re-election in May.Mr. Rouhani has other problems apart from the loss of a valued ally. He promised Iranians that he would turn around the economy, which had suffered from sanctions imposed by the United States and other major powers, including lack of access to the international financial system. Many of these sanctions were lifted after the nuclear deal, and foreign businesses seem eager to do business. But the country has not seen the quick growth many expected and Mr. Rouhani had hoped for.Mr. Trump has vowed to tear up the nuclear deal. He has threatened to make sure that Revolutionary Guards boats in the Persian Gulf are \u201cshot out of the water\u201d if they \u201cmake gestures\u201d at American destroyers there. He has chosen a national security adviser and a C.I.A. director who are both adamantly opposed to the deal, regardless of the consequences of ending it. And his nominee for defense secretary has made it clear that he views Iran as the primary threat.It makes no sense to create a crisis with Iran where none exists and to kill an agreement that even Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and once a leading opponent of the deal, says would be prudent to enforce. One result would be to undercut the voices of moderation that, after years of hostility, Washington should be most eager to encourage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Colonial-Era Wound Opens in Namibia", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported bySWAKOPMUND, Namibia \u2014 The statue, depicting a German marine holding a rifle in his hands and standing guard over a dying comrade, has stood undisturbed for decades in the most prominent spot in Swakopmund, a city on Namibia\u2019s coast.It has survived the end of colonial rule in this corner of southern Africa, the subsequent occupation by apartheid South Africa, independence in 1990 and the present government by the black majority.But a few months ago protesters spilled red paint over the monument, which stands in front of a colonial building that is now known as the State House and serves as the summer residence of Namibia\u2019s president.The push for the removal comes as the governments of Germany and Namibia are engaging in negotiations to close one of the grimmest chapters in Africa\u2019s colonial history, the genocide of tens of thousands of Herero and Nama between 1904 and 1908. After decades of denial, German officials say they are ready to acknowledge the genocide formally, issue an apology and offer compensation.German reticence is not the only reason the reckoning has taken so long. Namibia\u2019s complicated internal dynamics have contributed as well. The Herero and Nama are minorities in a nation led since independence by the liberation party, the South West Africa People\u2019s Organization, or Swapo, which is dominated by the Ovambo ethnic group. If Swapo has historically shown little interest in highlighting the colonial-era genocide, Namibia\u2019s tiny but economically powerful German-speaking minority has shown strong resistance.A desert city facing the Atlantic, Swakopmund is the center of Namibia\u2019s German-speaking minority. It has what is perhaps the best collection of well-preserved colonial buildings in Africa, as well as a Bismarck Street and other thoroughfares named after German figures. Menus in hotels and restaurants are in German, catering to Namibia\u2019s German minority as well as to German tourists.\u201cIt\u2019s essential for our tourism industry,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople come here to see this.\u201dGermany ruled Namibia, then known as South-West Africa, from 1884 to 1915. Alone among Germany\u2019s African colonies, it attracted thousands of settlers, who grabbed land from locals. Between 1904 and 1908, the Herero and Nama launched the biggest \u2014 and last \u2014 rebellion against the Germans.Mr. Groenewald argued that the Germans alone were not to blame for the cruelty of the war between 1904 and 1908.\u201cThe conflict, of course, was there,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Groenewald said. \u201cBut who started the war? Was it Hereros who killed the German settlers? There was a past from all sides. Everybody had a bad side.\u201dSince independence they, like other white Namibians, have experienced a shrinking of their once outsize role in the country. Politically, they have been marginalized; economically, their dominance has been eroded by new groups, ranging from a new black elite to Chinese businessmen.\u201cOur children are leaving Namibia,\u201d Mr. Groenewald said.\u201cThe thing that worries the German speakers in Swakopmund in particular is that this is a site where they have annual commemorations,\u201d Professor Zuern said of the marine monument. \u201cIt\u2019s not just this monument with all the symbolism that entails, but actually a site they go to to commemorate the deaths of the marine troops and to rally the community.\u201dProfessor Zuern said the German-Namibian community was stuck in the past. Unlike Germans, who have slowly come to terms with their colonial past, many German-Namibians reflexively seek to defend the era, minimize its harmful legacy or even deny the genocide, she said. In public \u2014 and even more so in community meetings held in German \u2014 some German-Namibians still express the kind of racist views that would be unthinkable in South Africa or other neighboring countries, Professor Zuern said.\u201cThe ideological mainstream is antiwhite,\u201d Mr. Vogt said. \u201cIt is very easy to say that it was the white people who stole our land, and it is the white people who have all the wealth, and it is the white people whose kids go to better schools, and it is the white people who have everything while we have nothing.\u201cThis is a very simple statement,\u201d he continued, \u201cand I understand it fully, because the people of Africa, the majority, are of simple mind.\u201dBut he changed his mind after an incident last year that he and other Hereros regarded as an insult to their culture. In their section of the municipal cemetery, the Herero, traditional cattle herders, exhibited the horns of a cow belonging to their late paramount chief \u2014 drawing complaints, presumably from people tending to the cemetery\u2019s German section. The City Council eventually ordered the horns removed, angering many Hereros.As for the marine statue, which has two German-language plaques explaining that, with God, the colony\u2019s soldiers fought for the \u201cKaiser and empire,\u201d and was declared a national monument in 1969, the Council has referred the matter to the National Heritage Council.Mr. Kaapehi, the councilor pressing for the removal, acknowledged that it was a difficult fight. Like many Hereros, he believes that Swapo, which controls the City Council and dominates the rest of the country, is interested only in a narrative that promotes it as the liberator of blacks from white-minority rule. Any reminder of the Herero and Nama resistance to German rule diminishes the Swapo-centric national founding myth, he said.\u201cIs this a concern of Hereros only?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2016 in Charts. (And Can Trump Deliver in 2017?)", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byBy any measure, 2016 was a momentous year, capped by the shocking victory of Donald J. Trump. As his choices for his cabinet were unveiled, a sea change in the path of government policy appeared inevitable. What is less clear is whether Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals will help those who put him in office; the postelection stock market euphoria was more about an expected surge in corporate profits than new hope for the working class.Lost in the Trump tsunami was the strong economy that President Obama will be leaving him. Unemployment is down to 4.6 percent, the lowest since August 2007 and a stunning decline from the 7.8 percent when Mr. Obama took office. The economy has expanded by nearly 15 percent (adjusted for inflation), the stock market has nearly tripled, auto sales have notched records, the federal deficit has been cut by more than half and house prices nationally are above past peaks. Even real median incomes ended marginally higher.To be sure, for many, the news remained bleak. Manufacturing jobs, which recovered weakly after the recession, fell by 60,000 this year through November, keeping totals well below past highs. Michigan had about 900,000 factory jobs in 2000; that\u2019s now down to just 600,000. Pay increases remain elusive. Real wages for manufacturing workers in Michigan have dropped from $28 per hour in 2003 to $20 now. The culprits: increased automation and competition from lower-wage countries like China and Mexico. No surprise that so many Americans workers are unhappy.Here\u2019s a shocker: Death rates for middle-aged white Americans have been rising, even as they have been falling for their counterparts in almost every other developed country. The principal reasons are not disease, but suicides and drug and alcohol overdoses. In the same vein, while rich Americans have been living longer, the least well-off are experiencing shorter life spans. It\u2019s not hard to understand how for many working-class people, the stresses of lost jobs and declining incomes have led to significant health problems and even death.More Americans died in domestic terrorist incidents in 2016 than in any year since 2001. However, those 63 deaths, while tragic, are about the same as the number of Americans killed annually by lawn mowers. For those elsewhere in the world \u2014 particularly the Middle East \u2014 the news was much worse; deaths from terrorism are still very much on the rise.The emotions stirred by Mr. Trump were also manifested in a surge in racial tensions. Through early November in New York, for example, the police department recorded 345 reports of hate crimes, compared to 253 during the same period last year. In just the two weeks after the election, 30 were reported, compared to only six in the same two weeks of 2015. A spate of hate crimes was also reported nationally for a similar period. More complete national data for 2016 is not yet available, but in 2015, anti-Muslim hate crimes jumped by 67 percent, the highest level since the 2001 terrorist attacks.The Republican efforts to get rid of the Affordable Care Act received a boost just before Election Day with the release of statistics showing that typical midlevel premiums for those who purchase insurance through the federal health care exchange will rise by 25 percent in 2017. In some states, the jumps will be far larger; 116 percent in Arizona, for example. But lost in the uproar was the fact that only about 3 percent of Americans buy unsubsidized insurance \u2014 and the remarkable accomplishment that more than 20 million people have received insurance through Obamacare while the proportion of uninsured Americans has dropped to less than 9 percent, the lowest on record.Election Day exit polls were revealing. Among voters with a high school education or less, Mr. Trump improved on Mitt Romney\u2019s margin in 2012 by 12 percentage points. Amazingly, Mr. Trump also outperformed Mr. Romney among all nonwhite groups: blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Equally surprisingly, Hillary Clinton improved upon President Obama\u2019s support among women by only a single percentage point. On the other hand, Mrs. Clinton did better than Mr. Obama among higher-income Americans and those with college educations. All told, while Mrs. Clinton lost the Electoral College vote, she won the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million, compared a margin of about five million for President Obama in 2012.Much to the surprise of stock market analysts (myself included), share prices turned upward almost immediately when Mr. Trump\u2019s win became evident. The market quickly concluded that the president-elect\u2019s plans for huge tax cuts \u2014 especially for business \u2014 combined with his determination to lessen Washington\u2019s heavy regulatory hand augur well for corporate profits. For example, bank shares jumped on the prospect for both a repeal of the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law as well as anticipated higher interest rates stemming from larger projected budget deficits. Similarly, industries like steel would benefit from Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to ramp up spending on building projects.The incoming president has said repeatedly that he would provide the middle class with a \u201cmassive tax cut\u201d; his selection for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has maintained that the wealthy would receive \u201cno absolute tax cut.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, as published on his campaign website, says otherwise. It includes a $6 trillion tax reduction over the next decade, vastly tilted toward business and the wealthy. An estimated 83 percent of the benefits would go to the top 20 percent of Americans and 51 percent to the top 1 percent by 2025. A middle-class taxpayer would receive an average tax benefit of $1,090; a typical member of the top 1 percent would get $317,100.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Did We Take Low Interest Rates for Granted?", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byEditorialBondholders would take a hit because bond prices fall when interest rates rise, but that should not take investors by surprise. Corporations, which have gorged on debt in recent years, are also likely to find rate increases manageable, because many have issued long-term bonds or amassed large cash cushions, thus shielding themselves from rate shocks.But the end of rock-bottom rates represents a huge missed opportunity for generations of Americans. Congress could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 used those near-zero rates to borrow money to rebuild the country\u2019s decrepit infrastructure, which would have sped up the recovery by creating jobs and set the stage for growth long into the future.That chance was squandered. After Republicans won control of the House in 2010, they managed to shift the debate from economic-recovery spending to deficit reduction. They did this despite evidence that the still-weak economy required more, not less, federal aid, and even threatened to default on the national debt unless federal spending was slashed. In 2013 and 2014, the budget was cut so deeply that the government sector subtracted from economic growth. In 2015, the government added nothing to growth. In 2016, it added a smidgen.The result has been a lopsided recovery. Prices for stocks, bonds and real estate, which benefit from monetary stimulus, have surged. Wages, which would have benefited from federal spending to bolster the economy, have lagged, widening the gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else.The policies Donald Trump talked about in the campaign, if enacted, would take a different route to the same disturbing place. For example, deregulation would stimulate the economy \u2014 in part, by removing restraints on reckless lending, borrowing and production. Tax cuts for the rich are likely to send asset prices even higher while worsening the budget deficit.A growing economy accompanied by a growing deficit is a recipe for still higher interest rates. Since Mr. Trump was elected, the yield on a benchmark 10-year Treasury bond has already risen to 2.4 percent from 1.8 percent, a sign that investors expect inflation.With interest rates rising, a big infrastructure plan becomes increasingly less feasible, which reinforces the pro-tax cut, anti-spending attitude of congressional Republicans. This week, top Republicans dismissed the possibility of near-term action on infrastructure, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to make it part of his first-100-days agenda.The Federal Reserve\u2019s policy of rock-bottom rates helped to avert what would have been even greater devastation from the Great Recession. Even now, the Fed should continue to keep rates as low as possible for as long as possible to help bring down underemployment: The number of working people who cannot find full-time hours remains elevated even as unemployment has declined.Still, the Fed cannot by itself repair a badly damaged economy. So the country is in an unhappy position. Interest rates are poised to rise, but there is no credible plan from Mr. Trump for broad and stable prosperity.Advertisement"}

Yokozuna, a rare honor, is the highest of the sport\u2019s 10 ranks.The promotion, by the Japan Sumo Association, was a top news story in the country on Wednesday. At a train station in Ushiku, Kisenosato\u2019s hometown northeast of Tokyo, banners read, \u201cCelebrate the victory.\u201d\u201cMany Japanese have been awaiting a Japanese yokozuna,\u201d Koichi Hagiuda, deputy chief cabinet secretary for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said at a news conference in Tokyo. \u201cI hope he will do well so that his dignified character and ability are remembered by history.\u201dKisenosato, who weighs about 385 pounds, becomes the fourth active yokozuna in professional sumo wrestling. The other three are Mongolian. The last Japanese yokozuna, Takanohana, retired in 2003 after losing a match.\u201cMany people have expected too much of him, which must have added huge pressure, and he must have been frustrated with himself,\u201d Shuhei Mainoumi, a sumo analyst in Tokyo, said by telephone.But after Kisenosato won his first championship title on Sunday, in his 73rd professional tournament, the Yokozuna Deliberation Council recommended that he be promoted.At a Tokyo hotel on Wednesday, Kisenosato, 30, told officials from the Japan Sumo Association that he had accepted the designation with humility.\u201cI will devote myself and try not to disgrace the yokozuna name,\u201d he said.A 2015 survey by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry found that sumo wrestling was the most popular spectator sport in Japan, ahead of baseball, soccer, boxing and golf.But sumo\u2019s reputation has suffered in recent years because of a series of gambling and match-fixing scandals, and foreign wrestlers, mainly from Eastern Europe and Mongolia, have increasingly dominated its top ranks. Analysts say that Japan has lost its standing because its wrestling techniques are increasingly old-fashioned and because fewer young people are training for competitions.\u201cThe number of Japanese wrestlers is not growing, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Mr. Mainoumi said. \u201cBut if Kisenosato does well in upcoming tournaments, sumo might become popular again and attract new young wrestlers.

{"Headline": "Trump Orders a Wall Built, but Congress Holds the Checkbook", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With Twitter posts, leaks and executive orders, President Trump is moving quickly to show he will make good on some of his key campaign pledges. Within a 24-hour period this week, he ordered or signaled significant new policies on border security, terrorism, crime and voting.But as Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor learned in 2009 when he ordered the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay closed, implementing policy is not as easy as the stroke of a pen.Details to carry out security policies exceed Twitter\u2019s 140-character limit and in some cases the public can only infer Mr. Trump\u2019s plans. Here is what he has promised, and what authority he has to carry it out.No political promise came to symbolize Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy like his pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. The costs and logistical headaches of such a project \u2014 which would cut through private property \u2014 have always been daunting, but Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters were unfazed: \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d they chanted.The president can announce whatever plans he wants. But whether the plan is \u201cbuild a wall\u201d or \u201cclose Guant\u00e1namo,\u201d if Congress does not go along, it can amount to wishful thinking. As one Republican lawmaker said of Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 order on Guant\u00e1namo, \u201cThis is an executive order that places hope ahead of reality.\u201dMr. Trump, a real estate developer by trade, seemed undeterred. \u201cWe do not need new laws,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cWe will work within the existing system and framework.\u201dWhile that appeared to mean that he intended to shift some already appropriated money to the wall\u2019s construction, it was unclear where the funds would come from. He cannot easily cannibalize one program to pay for the wall.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work out like that,\u201d said William C. Banks, a Syracuse University law professor.So is Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order meaningless? Not entirely. The Department of Homeland Security can start planning and discussing the project now and ask for the bulk of the money later. And if Mr. Trump really wants to break ground immediately and avoid Congress, there is \u2014 as always in Washington \u2014 a workaround that would let him do so at least in theory.Two laws, the Economy Act of 1932 and the Feed and Forage Act, give the president some spending wiggle room. The Economy Act allows presidents to move money between departments in some circumstances.The Feed and Forage Act, first enacted in 1799, was intended to allow military leaders in the field to spend money on essential clothing and medical supplies. But presidents have used that power broadly. Former President George H. W. Bush started the first gulf war under that authority, Mr. Banks said.In theory, Mr. Trump could order the military to spend extra money to protect national security, then move around the funding within the bureaucracy to pay for a wall built by the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Banks said. But such an accounting trick has never been used to go around Congress on such a large scale, Mr. Banks said. Lawsuits would be inevitable. It would be much easier to simply ask Congress for the money.But for now, Mr. Trump gets to say he is making good on a political promise. And if Congress scuttles the plan later or lawsuits hold it up? \u201cHe can say he did his part,\u201d Mr. Banks said. He compared the move to the playbook of former President Barack Obama: \u201cIt is very Obama.\u201dAccording to a draft of the order, Mr. Trump also intends to review the agency\u2019s now-defunct interrogation program, in which interrogators tortured some suspected terrorists through waterboarding and extensive sleep deprivation. Other suspects were shackled in painful positions, doused with water and menaced with dogs.Mr. Trump can revoke the current ban on C.I.A. prisons, but it would take much more than his signature to restore the interrogation program. Federal law now restricts interrogation techniques to those authorized by the Army Field Manual.Mr. Trump could try to ignore all this, saying he has the authority to do so as commander in chief. But his cabinet nominees seemed to reject that theory in their confirmation testimony. As a practical matter, reopening the secret prisons would require finding countries willing to host them. Those who did so for former President George W. Bush have faced a decade of investigations, lawsuits and recriminations.Mr. Trump threatened federal intervention in Chicago if the city does not address violent crime. Chicago saw at least 762 homicides in 2016, the highest figure in two decades \u2014 more than Los Angeles and New York combined.It was not clear what Mr. Trump meant by \u201cfeds.\u201d But Mr. Trump has wide latitude in this area. The Justice Department could dispatch more agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration to Chicago.In more extreme situations, presidents and governors have activated the National Guard, but usually to keep the peace during riots and unrest.In a series of Twitter posts, Mr. Trump reiterated his false assertion that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2.8 million ballots only because undocumented immigrants and others voted illegally. There is no evidence of such widespread fraud (as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign lawyers have acknowledged), and Mr. Trump offered none. Nor did he say what sort of investigation he had planned.Charlie Savage contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Norwegian Expands in the Trans-Atlantic Market", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byItinerariesJust three and a half years ago, Norwegian was an upstart discount carrier entering the long-haul market. Now it is the 10th-largest trans-Atlantic airline by percentage of seats offered. The growth of Norwegian is a sign of the competitive threat on trans-Atlantic routes faced by legacy carriers like British Airways, Delta and American.Norwegian is about to announce details of a plan that is poised to lower fares and expand the cities it serves in the United States and Europe. Last month the United States Transportation Department approved a Norwegian subsidiary in Ireland, enabling the plan to go forward. The approval took three years, leading to criticism that the agency was bending to pressure from the big airlines and labor unions.Later this year, Norwegian plans to begin flying out of new American cities to include Newark; Newburgh, N.Y.; and Providence, R.I. On the other side of the ocean, it will begin to operate out of new cities including Barcelona; Belfast, Cork and Shannon in Ireland; and Edinburgh, Scotland. Average fares on the new Irish routes are expected to be $300 to $350 round trip, tax included.Longer term, the carrier is considering starting trans-Atlantic service out of D\u00fcsseldorf, Berlin and Rome, said Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian\u2019s chief executive.Norwegian already serves American cities like New York; Los Angeles; Boston; Las Vegas; Oakland, Calif.; and Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. In Europe its airports include London, Paris, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo.Along with Norwegian, discount carriers like WOW Air, Condor, Thomas Cook Airlines U.K. and Eurowings (a subsidiary of Lufthansa) have been able to muscle their way into the trans-Atlantic market because of a decade-old revision of the \u201copen skies\u201d pact, which eased various restrictions on routes and fares.The ascent of the low-cost carriers has been aided by fuel-efficient, two-engine aircraft and a willingness by some passengers to forgo some customary amenities in exchange for appealingly low fares.Naturally, the behemoth legacy carriers are not sitting idly by as the upstarts gnaw away at their market share. This year British Airways will begin flying between Gatwick Airport and Fort Lauderdale and Oakland, routes served by Norwegian. BA\u2019s parent company, the International Airlines Group, plans to start a long-haul, low-cost operation out of Barcelona this summer, also to compete with Norwegian. And Air France KLM recently said it would begin a long-haul operation that would be \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cinnovative.\u201dIn the United States, JetBlue is considering entering the European market. Philip Stewart, a spokesman, said that the airline had the option to take delivery of Airbus A321LR aircraft and that the plane \u201ccould potentially fly to Europe from the East Coast.\u201d He said Europe suffered from a lack of competition and high fares, \u201cand that is certainly an environment that JetBlue competes well in.\u201dAmerican carriers that already fly to Europe are focusing on new in-flight products to challenge airlines like Norwegian, which offers a \u201cpremium\u201d in-flight service with more legroom, meals and airport lounge access, along with three different economy fares. Condor also offers flights with three classes of service.The president of Delta, Glen Hauenstein, said last week that by next year the carrier would fully roll out its \u201cbasic economy\u201d fare \u2014 for which seats are assigned at check-in and the ability to make changes or cancel is prohibited \u2014 on international flights. In addition, starting this year Delta will begin offering a higher-priced \u201cpremium select\u201d service on Airbus A350 and Boeing 777 aircraft, with improved seat pitch and upgraded meals, among other amenities. For its part, American recently began offering a \u201cpremium economy\u201d service on 787-9 Dreamliner flights from Dallas to Madrid and Paris, and will eventually introduce it on all international wide-body aircraft.\u201cTravelers occasionally close deals worth millions of dollars, and a trip of that significance justifies a business-class seat,\u201d he said. \u201cAt other times, low-cost, lowest-fare options can make the trip practical. I frequently see this with smaller companies and start-ups where budgets are extremely tight,\u201d he said.Anders Lindstrom, a spokesman for Norwegian, said almost one-third of its trans-Atlantic flight bookings in Europe were made by corporate customers, a figure it hopes to match in the American market once it expands its sales activities there.Norwegian faces challenges as it continues its aggressive trans-Atlantic strategy.\u201cThere is the risk of overexpansion and fuel prices skyrocketing,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, travel analyst at Atmosphere Research. Budget airlines appeal to very price-sensitive travelers, he noted, \u201cand if something bad happens to the economy, these travelers will be most affected by the downturn.\u201dAndrew Lobbenberg, who follows Norwegian for HSBC in London, said he was concerned about the carrier\u2019s substantial number of future aircraft deliveries, which he said placed \u201cconsiderable burden on its balance sheet.\u201dIn 2012, it placed one of the airline industry\u2019s largest aircraft orders ever, and by next year it is set to receive 20 more planes that can operate trans-Atlantic flights.Mr. Kjos, the Norwegian chief executive, is confident about the airline\u2019s ability to expand. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very favorable financial situation,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThe best hedge you can have is flying new airplanes that have much less fuel consumption.\u201d\u201cThe market is stimulated by lower fares,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a new layer of people flying that normally can\u2019t afford to fly trans-Atlantic.\u201dCraig Jenks, an aviation consultant based in New York, detects signs of \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d in the trans-Atlantic market. The low-cost airlines, he said, \u201care putting on lots of new capacity. They say they can just keep on doing this indefinitely, with a new business model and low costs and fares that can stimulate new traffic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Kia Soul Exclaim Adds Pep to Its Boxy Figure", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byDrivenIN 2009, when the Kia Soul was introduced, it was roundly criticized as a blatant copy of the square-shaped Scion xB. At the time, Toyota\u2019s youth brand had sold an average of 46,000 xBs annually over six years to coveted younger buyers, a good reason for Kia to go to the square-shaped well.The combination of practicality, affordability and hipster-hamster marketing has made the Soul so successful it\u2019s often neck and neck with the Optima as Kia\u2019s best-selling car. On track to sell more than 150,000 copies in North America for 2016, the Soul has outlived other boxes such as the Nissan Cube, the Honda Element and, of course, the xB (R.I.P. Scion).How do you improve a sales powerhouse? Well, add power of course.That is what Kia has done with the 2017 Exclaim model (or \u201c!\u201d in Kia-speak), dropping in a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. This motor runs exclusively with a sure-shifting 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The lower-rung Plus (or \u201c+\u201d) model has a standard 6-speed automatic.At 201 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque, the Exclaim increases the Plus\u2019s 2-liter 4-cylinder by 40 horsepower and 45 pound-feet of torque. Consider it your hamster on speed.This is not, though, South Korea\u2019s answer to the vaunted Volkswagen GTI. The German GTI is built of not just metal, glass and plastic, but a dash of magic as well. The Soul is quick (0 to 60 miles an hour in about 7.7 seconds), but its taller stance and numb steering keep it from being quite as nimble.Still, the Soul turbo is fun enough to fling about town. Its size is perfect for urban skirmishes, and the slightly retuned suspension keeps comfort up and body movements buttoned down. Enthusiasts will demand more road feel through the steering wheel, a sporty D-shaped version that lacks transmission paddle shifters. Hello? Marketing department?There is also lag when the pedal hits the carpet hard. That can be reduced by switching to sport mode, but it still remains to a degree. Torque steer, that tugging of the steering wheel that powerful front-drive cars can exhibit, is commendably low. All-wheel drive is not available. At speed, there is plenty of passing power.The Soul\u2019s shape is as aerodynamic as a house, so freeway speeds bring some wind noise, but the vehicle is otherwise moderately quiet. Its form factor scrubs off fuel economy, too. Still, the turbo engine is the most fuel-efficient way to move a Soul. The Environmental Protection Agency rates its mileage at 26 city and 31 highway, about a mile per gallon better than the other two available engines. I saw 27 m.p.g. on specified standard grade gas in a week\u2019s worth of spirited driving.The cabin is constructed of quality soft-touch materials and rich-looking piano-black trim. A penalty box this is not. Well-bolstered and wide leather-trimmed seats have cloth inserts with a fashion-forward houndstooth pattern. Tall people looking for a small car will appreciate the lofty headroom.Fully loaded with the $3,000 tech and $1,000 sunroof packages, the Exclaim sells for $27,500. Seem steep? Some luxury cars lack this car\u2019s kit. There is navigation, a heated steering wheel, heated seats front and back, blind-spot warning, cross-path detection, a loud (if not overly accurate) Harman Kardon sound system with LED pulsing speaker grilles and a full glass roof that makes the Soul a rolling greenhouse. A mercifully simple touch-screen user interface that rodents could master features Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.Oddly, this top Exclaim model cannot be equipped with forward collision warning, an increasingly common safety feature, the way the Plus models can.Passengers in back get seats that support thighs well and a USB port to charge phones. There\u2019s ample room for two people, and it is not bad for three, considering the Soul\u2019s size.That means the cargo area, as tall as it is, is somewhat shallow. But drop the 60/40 split seat backs and it opens up a box so large, Pandora might lure those evil spirits she freed back for roomy residence. The rest of us will comfortably stash bikes and Ikea furniture.A base Soul equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission and a 130-horsepower 4-cylinder engine retails for $16,840 if all you need is an affordable way to haul people and cargo. The Exclaim\u2019s turbo power earns its \u201c!\u201d designation. The design might be polarizing, but Soul shapes up as a decent deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Steven Mnuchin, Treasury Nominee, Failed to Disclose $100 Million in Assets", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe revelation came hours before Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, began testifying on Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee, which has historically been bipartisan in its demands for transparency from nominees. Mr. Mnuchin was ready to outline his vision for the economy and defend himself against claims that he headed a bank that ran a \u201cforeclosure machine\u201d during the financial crisis.\u201cThe Treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all Americans, including those who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the committee. \u201cWhen I look at Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s background, it\u2019s a stretch to find evidence he\u2019d be that kind of Treasury secretary.\u201dIn a hearing marked by sharp exchanges, Mr. Mnuchin struggled to answer questions about his use of tax havens as a hedge fund manager and whether he thought such loopholes should be closed.Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, pointedly asked Mr. Mnuchin if he was using Cayman Islands corporations to avoid taxation. He responded that he was working on behalf of his clients, in accordance with the law.\u201cLet me just be clear again: I did not use a Cayman Islands entity in any way to avoid paying taxes for myself,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cI would love to work with the I.R.S. to close these tax issues that make no sense.\u201dHe added: \u201cI would support changing the tax laws to make sure they are simpler and more effective.\u201dRepublicans came to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s defense, suggesting that none of his omissions were willful, and they gave strong indications that they would vote for him.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, defended Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s business record and described him as extremely qualified for the job.\u201cObjectively speaking, I don\u2019t believe anyone can reasonably argue that Mr. Mnuchin is unqualified for the position,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cIf the confirmation process focused mainly on the question of a nominee\u2019s qualifications, there would be little, if any, opposition to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s nomination.\u201dBut the process was also focused on Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s financial disclosure form, and that prompted intense scrutiny.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.\u201cIn his revised questionnaire, Mr. Mnuchin disclosed several additional financial assets, including $95 million worth of real estate \u2014 a co-op in New York City, a residence in Southampton, New York, a residence in Los Angeles, California, and $15 million in real estate holdings in Mexico,\u201d Democratic staff members of the Senate Finance Committee wrote in a memo on Thursday. \u201cMr. Mnuchin has claimed these omissions were due to a misunderstanding of the questionnaire.\u201dAccording to the memo, Mr. Mnuchin also initially failed to disclose that he is the director of Dune Capital International, an investment fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands, along with management posts in seven other investment funds.And he belatedly disclosed that his children own nearly $1 million in artwork.Asked about the omissions at the hearing, Mr. Mnuchin described them as a simple mistake made amid a mountain of bureaucracy.\u201cI think as you all can appreciate, filling out these government forms is quite complicated,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, noting that he had handed over 5,000 pages of disclosures. \u201cLet me first say, any oversight, it was unintentional.\u201dBut Democrats pounced and tied Mr. Mnuchin to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington.Pressed as to whether his failure to disclose the information was an ethical lapse, Mr. Mnuchin insisted that he was following the guidance of his lawyers and made an innocent error.\u201cI assure you that these forms were very complicated,\u201d he said, explaining that he had pledged to be forthcoming to \u201cthe best of my knowledge.\u201dSenator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, was unsatisfied with the response and shot back, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to understand the words \u2018list all positions.\u2019\u201dTo that, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, added: \u201cNever before has the Senate considered such an ethically challenged slate of nominees for key cabinet positions. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s failure to disclose his Cayman Islands holdings just reeks of the swamp that the president-elect promised to drain on the campaign trail.\u201dAnd American Bridge, the so-called Democratic super PAC, said Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s holdings were a sign that Mr. Trump\u2019s government would not look out for working class Americans.\u201cBy slamming through Mnuchin, Senate Republicans are becoming accessories to Trump\u2019s future corruption, helping him stack his cabinet with shady billionaires who, like Trump, will rig the government to serve their own interests at the expense of the American people,\u201d said Shripal Shah, vice president of American Bridge.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Airlines, Now More Proactive on Weather, Allow Fliers to Shift Own Travel Plans", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byItinerariesA few days before his flight home to Seattle from Tokyo in October, Bruce Ryan learned that a windstorm might disrupt air travel in the Pacific Northwest.Mr. Ryan and his wife, Karen, didn\u2019t want to risk getting stuck, \u201call jet-lagged and waiting to see if the flight to Seattle was going to happen,\u201d from Los Angeles, their connecting city.So he went with some trepidation to the Alaska Airlines website to find the cost of changing his tickets.\u201cI expected the fare and change fees to end up around the cost of a whole new booking,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.So he was pleasantly surprised to find that Alaska Airlines had issued a \u201cweather waiver\u201d in advance of the possible storm. It allowed passengers flying in or out of the affected area to make no-cost changes to their itineraries on their own, without speaking to a representative.Many other airlines are now doing likewise, recognizing that they can make life easier for themselves and their passengers by anticipating weather delays and putting travel changes in the hands of their customers (and their smartphones) before the situation escalates into an act-of-God crisis.Airline passengers used to go to airports as storms brewed, hoping that their flights would be able to depart, then enduring long rebooking lines if they were canceled. Now, airlines are notifying customers, sometimes days in advance, of a potential disruption and giving them online ways to change their own flights.Weather waivers generally give several options to ticketholders planning to use affected airports. Passengers can cancel their trips and obtain refunds. Or they can move their travel up or back a few days, or reroute via a different connecting city.Nearby arrival and departure cities can be selected as alternatives, too, with no difference in airfare. So, for example, Delta Air Lines passengers in upstate New York who are snowed in at the Ithaca airport might depart from Syracuse or Elmira in the following days instead. Or they could even pay their own way on a five-hour bus ride to New York City and depart from one of the airports there.It\u2019s up to the passenger to do the research on the company\u2019s website or phone app to determine the most convenient, time, routing or departure/arrival city. Otherwise, the airline systems will automatically book the passenger on the next available flight on the original route.Airlines are not obliged to compensate travelers with lodging or meals for delays because of extreme weather.So in the case of the Ryans, traveling back from Tokyo, Mr. Ryan used the hotel and car rental apps on his phone to estimate the cost of spending an extra day and night in Los Angeles. That made it possible for them to carefully consider their choices.\u201cOn the phone with an agent, we\u2019d have to decide right when they give us our options,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cNow we can research everything on our time frame \u2014 not the airline\u2019s.\u201dThe pair decided to stay in Los Angeles for the day and try a new restaurant they had read about.That is pretty much how the airlines say they want passengers to respond to weather waivers: by deciding themselves what works best.\u201cWe are trying to put as much control as possible in the hands of customers,\u201d Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American Airlines, said. The company wants customers to look at alternatives \u201cwhile they\u2019re still at home, before they come to the airport,\u201d he said.About a year ago, American updated its phone app with the ability to change itineraries when weather waivers were issued. Mr. Feinstein said that calls to the reservation center during storms had decreased significantly as a result of the new self-serve option.Delta Air Lines last year added the same capability to its phone app. \u201cWe used to just rebook passengers on the next available flight,\u201d said Michael Thomas, a Delta spokesman. \u201cNow we let them choose.\u201dSome passengers want to use Twitter to send their requests, so the company\u2019s social media team has added staff members to handle rebookings through that channel.The industry\u2019s apps and the waivers are still being refined. American Airlines plans to offer customers the ability to change departure or arrival cities themselves, something that currently has to be done by talking to an agent on the phone.The company is also expanding the weather waivers to cover summer thunderstorms, because of the \u201cbigger weather events we are experiencing now,\u201d Mr. Feinstein said.While the new approaches to weather disruptions can make travel easier for passengers, the airlines are not doing it just to keep customers happy. They have a financial incentive.\u201cIf customers make the changes,\u201d he said, \u201cthe airline doesn\u2019t have to pay its employees to spend time finding them alternative routes.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, economy fliers \u2014 like retirees who change their weather-affected tickets to shift their trip to the following week \u2014 open up valuable inventory that can be sold at premium prices to those who must fly no matter what.\u201cLast-minute seats for business travelers bring in critical revenue,\u201d Mr. Kelly said, and can help make up for weather-related losses.International airlines also offer weather waivers, which is particularly crucial for carriers that have partnerships with domestic airlines. For example, a passenger flying on United Airlines to Chicago and from there on Lufthansa Airlines to Germany, will encounter consistent policies in cases of inclement weather.What only the travelers can decide, of course, is whether to heed a weather warning and change itineraries \u2014 or take a chance that the trip can proceed as planned.Sometimes there is only so much an airline can do. Passengers booked on a delayed Delta Air Lines flight from Ithaca to Detroit in December received a series of email messages, pushing back their 5:30 p.m. departure bit by bit because of a snowstorm.At midnight, it was canceled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justice Department Toughened Approach on Corporate Crime, but Will That Last?", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byWhen the dust settled on the 2008 financial crisis, not a single top Wall Street executive went to prison.Over the past two years, the Justice Department, loath to be seen as treating the corporate world with kid gloves, began changing its approach. Two prosecutors with specialties in white-collar cases joined the administration and helped spearhead the push: Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates, who created new guidelines for prosecuting corporate employees, and Leslie R. Caldwell, who took over the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division.The changes started with a few big banks pleading guilty and built to a flurry of activity this week, when Ms. Yates\u2019s new guidelines appeared to bear fruit.But whether these changes set a lasting precedent is not up to Ms. Yates or Ms. Caldwell. As expected, the officials announcing the white-collar cases are leaving the Justice Department, like the student whose popularity suddenly soared in the final week of school.On Thursday, Ms. Caldwell announced that this was her final week. The Volkswagen case was one of her last acts.Now, the Obama administration\u2019s legacy falls into the hands of Jeff Sessions, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general. Mr. Sessions, a Republican senator from Alabama, who faced a confirmation hearing this week, is expected to receive Senate approval.In a recent interview, Ms. Yates said that she expected that the Justice Department\u2019s focus on managers and executives would endure in the Trump administration.\u201cI don\u2019t think that the concept of holding individuals accountable who actually committed crimes is a particularly controversial concept,\u201d she said.Indeed, when Mr. Sessions was a United States attorney in Alabama, he had a reputation as a tough-on-crime prosecutor.And while Mr. Trump has promised far more business-friendly policies than the Obama administration, he also thrives on populist commentary. Even as Obama political appointees leave, many of the rank-and-file prosecutors who build these investigations are expected to stay.Yet even if Mr. Sessions seizes the building momentum against corporate crime, there is reason to doubt that it can be sustained. Top bankers remain unscathed, even as their banks pay big fines. Experts on corporate crime also cautioned not to draw too many conclusions from the Justice Department\u2019s recent aggressive streak. The Volkswagen case, they say, may present a rare opportunity for prosecutors to follow wrongdoing up the chain when a company breached a legal duty to report misconduct.\u201cIn a normal case, a manager learns of a problem and has to interpret how serious it is and whether to report it,\u201d said Jennifer H. Arlen, a New York University law professor who is founder and director of the program on corporate compliance and enforcement.\u201cWhat\u2019s delicious about the Volkswagen case,\u201d she said, is that prosecutors \u201chave a situation where the managers completely knew the problem because they allegedly intentionally created it.\u201dIn the financial crisis investigations, Justice Department officials argued that they always pursued individual wrongdoing aggressively, and that the failure to charge top bankers was not owed to a lack of will, but a lack of evidence.Without such evidence \u2014 say, a damning email or a cooperating witness \u2014 prosecutors might find it too risky, or even unfair, to file criminal charges.A lack of criminal prosecutions of banks and their leaders fueled a public outcry over the perception that Wall Street giants are \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201dThese officials point to the early years of the Obama administration, long before the Volkswagen case, when the criminal division under Lanny A. Breuer filed charges against BP employees linked to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. They also note that Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, led a sweeping crackdown on insider trading.Even so, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was blamed for being soft on corporate crime.For much of his tenure, banks were paying billions of dollars for their misdeeds in the mortgage market and beyond, but the Justice Department mostly stopped short of extracting guilty pleas. In some cases, prosecutors cited fears that charging a big bank could cause collateral damage for the broader economy.Ms. Caldwell, who spent nearly two decades as a federal prosecutor and led the Justice Department\u2019s Enron task force, promised to apply a tough-on-crime approach to the corporate investigations.As part of the manipulation case involving the London interbank offered rate, the global benchmark known as Libor, the criminal division under Ms. Caldwell also forced a British subsidiary of Deutsche Bank to accept a guilty plea.In addition to the banks, the Justice Department has charged 15 people in connection with that scandal.Foreign bribery cases, which are handled by the criminal division, have also yielded charges against individuals \u2014 about 100 people since the start of the Obama administration.\u201cUnder her leadership as assistant attorney general, the criminal division energetically prosecuted a number of successful cases against perpetrators of financial fraud, foreign hacking, corruption and kleptocracy,\u201d Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said in a statement underscoring Ms. Caldwell\u2019s focus on white-collar crime. \u201cIn these and in so many other ways, Leslie has played a crucial role in advancing the cause of justice, and she leaves behind a proud legacy of service.\u201dIn a recent interview, Ms. Caldwell highlighted her division\u2019s decision to increase the staffing of its foreign bribery unit by 50 percent. She also designed a foreign bribery \u201cpilot program\u201d that seeks to provide credit to companies that \u201cvoluntarily self-disclose\u201d misconduct and fully cooperate with an investigation. And more broadly, Ms. Caldwell said she sought to clarify the Justice Department\u2019s approach to resolving corporate investigations and accelerate the pace of these cases.\u201cWe obviously don\u2019t want to rush, but I\u2019ve always had a view that there\u2019s no reason why a white-collar case needs to take four years,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cThe more cases you bring quickly, and good cases, the quicker you can move on to the next case.\u201dThe memo also explained that prosecutors should refuse to award companies any credit for cooperating without full disclosure of individual wrongdoing.\u201cWe\u2019re not looking at it as some faceless multinational corporation, but recognizing that companies can only act through flesh-and-blood people,\u201d Ms. Yates said in the interview.Parts of Ms. Yates\u2019s memo codified practices that some prosecutors already followed in the criminal division and in United States attorney\u2019s offices like Mr. Bharara\u2019s and the one in Brooklyn, which are accustomed to white-collar prosecutions. But other offices were less consistent, and the new guidelines underscored the importance of focusing on individuals.Because Justice Department memos do not have the force of law, incoming attorneys general can revoke them. But Ms. Yates said she expected this policy would persist during a Trump administration.For his part, Mr. Sessions has also criticized the too-big-to-jail philosophy since joining the Senate.\u201cThis is a dangerous philosophy,\u201d he said in 2010 amid the investigations into the banks at the heart of the financial collapse. \u201cNormally, I was taught, if they violated the law, you charge them. If they did not violate the law, you do not charge them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And it demeans the office of the presidency.\u201dThe new initiation fee went into effect on Jan. 1, although the annual dues remained the same \u2014 $14,000 a year, he said.The club has 482 members, with a cap of 500.\u201cIt enhances it,\u201d Mr. Lembcke said of Mr. Trump\u2019s new job and its impact on the value of the membership. \u201cHis presidency does.\u201d\u201cBut we are very careful in vetting them,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump was pretty broad with his definition of voter fraud when he took to Twitter Wednesday morning to request an investigation of the nefarious conduct of the 2016 electorate \u2014 with no evidence to support it.There is, in fact, a difference between investigating actual voter fraud and cleaning up the voter rolls. If you move states, you aren\u2019t usually required to tell the state you are leaving that you no longer want to be on the roster.And so it goes that Mr. Bannon is registered in Sarasota County, Fla., and New York City. Mr. Mnuchin appears on the rolls of New York and California. And Tiffany Trump, should she choose, could potentially vote in Pennsylvania and New York. If she did, of course, that would be fraud.Now Melania Trump is fielding her own foreign leader calls. Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, called Mrs. Trump on Wednesday to congratulate her on becoming the first lady, according to the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201cThe two of them look forward to seeing each other soon in Washington and to working together to strengthen the ties between Israel and the United States,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office said.Their husbands spoke by telephone earlier in the week, and Mr. Trump invited Mr. Netanyahu to visit him in Washington next month.President Trump announced that he will nominate businessman and former military intelligence officer Philip Bilden as secretary of the Navy.Mr. Bilden, who ran a private equity firm in Hong Kong until retiring three years ago, has expertise in both maritime affairs and Asia \u2014 two areas that are of central importance to the Navy. He was picked over an early Trump campaign backer, former Rep. J. Randy Forbes of Virginia.Mr. Bilden received a Masters of Business Administration from Harvard in 1991.First came the reposting of photos by the National Park Service that clearly showed that President Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd was smaller than former President Barack Obama\u2019s in 2009. That was followed by a contrite apology and lots of pretty pictures.But the national parks took up the cause, with a Twitter storm on climate change from the Badlands that was quickly taken down.And lots more:Now, with word that Mr. Trump is moving to shut down the flow of refugees and halt immigration from Muslim-majority nations, is the Defense Department joining the fray?Incidentally, the National Park Service now says those Twitter posts from the Badlands came from a disgruntled former employee who had commandeered the account without permission. A National Park Service official said Tuesday:\u201cSeveral tweets posted on the Badlands National Park\u2019s Twitter account today were posted by a former employee who was not currently authorized to use the park\u2019s account. The park was not told to remove the tweets but chose to do so when they realized that their account had been compromised.\u201dNo official word on why so many other parks chimed in.Mr. Trump may have thought he was being constructive when he weighed in on Chicago\u2019s terrible murder rate, but his offer (or threat) of federal support has not gone over well \u2014 either with Chicago Democrats or small-government Republicans.Rep. Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez, Democrat of Illinois was miffed.\u201cWhen the President wants to work with states and localities on public policies to reduce gun-violence, he will find partners in cities like Chicago, but I think he\u2019d rather spend his time on Twitter. The President wants publicity and to be seen beating up on Democratic elected officials and appearing hostile to a big city like Chicago in the eyes of his suburban and rural voters. I get that. But I doubt he has any serious intention to solve the national problem of guns killing young people.\u201dBut Republicans weren\u2019t too keen on the notion of the federal government swooping into to fight city crime.The Republican media consultant Rick Wilson noted the obvious:\u201cYou didn\u2019t get elected to debate the crowd size at your inaugural,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cNow, obviously, I wasn\u2019t a supporter of then-candidate Trump. He got elected to make sure that people have a job, the economy continues to grow, people have security as it relates to their kids\u2019 education, etc. And it wasn\u2019t about your crowd size. It was about their lives and their jobs.\u201d\u201cThe speech missed an opportunity to speak to our better angels as a country,\u201d he said of the president\u2019s inaugural address.Or maybe Mr. Trump was just watching Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox News.Another update: Mr. Mook says no way, he never would have agreed to this buddy show.His press aides won\u2019t say what exactly is bothering Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but something clearly has gotten his goat.It might be that the new administration has been slow to answer requests that date back to the Obama administration.Then again, his committee still hasn\u2019t voted out the nomination of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama.With the Trump Organization under a very public microscope, the company said Tuesday that it has appointed two monitors \u2014 Bobby Burchfield and George Sorial \u2014 to keep tabs on any ethical issues that may arise.The former has strong ties to Republican politics and the latter to President Trump.Mr. Burchfield, a Washington lawyer who has represented George H.W. Bush and the Republican National Committee, was appointed as independent ethics adviser to the Trump Organization, meaning he will advise on avoiding conflicts of interest, with the power to sign off on certain transactions.A longtime Trump Organization executive, Mr. Sorial will now be chief compliance officer, giving him a lead role in ensuring that the company complies with ethics rules and standards, while also implementing new policies.The two will assume their roles at a time when Mr. Trump has said he is trying to remove himself from the activities of the business that carries his name. Mr. Trump said during a news conference on Jan. 11 that he would place his business in a trust controlled by his two adult sons \u2014 but some ethics experts have chided the plan for not going far enough to avoid conflicts.Advertisement"}

The election of Donald Trump to the presidency was a rude awakening. On Saturday, at the Women\u2019s March in New York City, I marched proudly with people of all ages, races and nationalities.A normal president would have acknowledged the hundreds of thousands of people who turned out and reassured us that he heard us and would do his best to take care of us. Instead, Mr. Trump ranted about the dishonest media that undercounted the number of people who turned out for his inauguration. He can\u2019t stand it that more people protested against him than celebrated him. His fragile ego can get us into deep trouble.ELLEN SUSSMANBrooklynTo the Editor:This past weekend millions who did not vote for President Trump marched in the streets ostensibly protesting for their rights. Protesting when your rights have not been violated but rather because your team lost is called a \u201ctemper tantrum,\u201d regardless of your age. These same people are now demanding that the president listen to them rather than the people who actually voted for him or you will \u2026 what, not vote for him again next time?During the past eight years, Democrats have lost more than 1,000 seats at the federal and state level.

{"Headline": "The Dow Hit 20,000. Now What?", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byYes, it is just another number.But in an industry that lives and dies by the power (seen and unseen) of sums in all their varieties, that the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 20,000 on Wednesday was enough to give even the most hardened stock market watchers reason to smile. The Dow finished the day at 20,068.51.\u201cIt blows me away,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management. \u201cI can remember when people wondered if we would ever get through Dow 1,000. It\u2019s amazing \u2014 we are up 20-fold in my career.\u201dAnd that is a big deal, Mr. Paulsen explained, because it means that for all the worry and doubts that have sprung from the market collapses in 1987, 2000 and 2008, if investors just held to a core portfolio of large American stocks they would have done pretty well.Of course, the usual caveats apply.It is also true that the Dow represents just 30 companies \u2014 including stalwarts like Goldman Sachs, Apple and Walmart \u2014 compared with the 500 that make up the Standard & Poor\u2019s index or the 2,000 of the Russell market tracker.After all, from the perspective of a financial adviser seeking maximum diversification for a client, an E.T.F. that tracks just 30 stocks is not as compelling as the alternatives that represent a broader swath of the American economy.The E.T.F.s that follow the S.& P. 500 and the Russell 2000 turn over 92 million and 32 million shares, respectively.Still, even if the power of 20,000 is more psychological than quantifiable, that should not necessarily weaken its punch, especially today when there are so many different forms of media that can advertise the accomplishment.\u201cI think it is meaningful,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, an independent and longstanding market strategist. \u201cNo matter what your politics are or what fears you may have \u2014 this index is one of the more reliable indicators we have in terms of where the economy is heading.\u201dAs did Mr. Paulsen, Mr. Yardeni underscores the durability factor in describing why 20,000 should be recognized.It is this very point, however, that worries some market seers.\u201cIt has taken over 17 years to get here,\u201d said David Kelly, head of global strategy at JP Morgan Asset Management. \u201cWe hit 10,000 on a wave of enthusiasm but we have had to climb a wall of worry all the way up to 20,000.\u201dMr. Kelly makes some cautionary points in terms of urging investors not to get carried away with the number.The recent postelection surge toward 20,000 has been driven by what investors are calling a reflation trade, or a bet that the economy under President Trump will benefit from proposed tax cuts and a move toward more aggressive government spending. Earlier Wednesday, responding to an Associated Press report on Twitter that the index had traded above 20,000 for the first time, Mr. Trump sent a tweet from the president\u2019s official Twitter account that said, \u201cGreat!\u201dPeople should also be aware, Mr. Kelly said, that expected cuts in capital gains taxes has kept many investors from taking profits during the rally. The thought being, that if they were to wait several months, they could dump their stocks and face a lighter tax bill in the process.\u201cThe exit door is jammed,\u201d he said.Mr. Kelly also warns that this rally has been unusually focused on the United States. This will be the fourth consecutive year that domestic stocks have outperformed their counterparts in overseas markets \u2014 developed and emerging.Such a streak is rare indeed, and it highlights the extent to which the dollar\u2019s strong run of late has bolstered the market\u2019s performance.Then there are the \u201cperma-bears\u201d who see Dow 20,000 as just the latest sign that the end is nigh.Mr. Stockman disputes the notion, embraced today by stock market bulls, that Mr. Trump can cut taxes and increase government spending while leaving Medicare and Social Security alone without creating a debt and deficit crisis.And he is putting his money where his mouth is. Since the election, he has made bets that the market will fall sharply from these levels.\u201cThis is the greatest short of all time,\u201d Mr. Stockman said.Advertisement"}

The government questions the administrative court\u2019s right to rule on the matter, its lawyers said.\u201cThe administrative courts have no business reviewing such decisions in the first place,\u201d said Rafik Sherif, the deputy head of the State Lawsuits Authority, the official body that represents the government in this case and in all legal disputes. \u201cThese are sovereign acts, and the judiciary has no right to question them.\u201dRights groups have accused Egypt\u2019s judges of being deferential to the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi since he came to power in 2013.

They lie at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, a strategic corner of the Red Sea that gives them control over the only sea route to the Israeli port city of Eilat and the Jordanian port city of Aqaba.Tiran and Sanafir were virtually unknown to the Egyptian public until Mr. Sisi\u2019s government announced in April that it would hand them over to Saudi Arabia.The move struck a nationalist nerve and was immediately perceived as a sellout, sparking street protests and a continuing furor.In televised video of the verdict session, people in the court were seen erupting in jubilation after the verdict was announced, shouting, \u201cEgyptian!

{"Headline": "China Can Thrive in the Trump Era", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBEIJING \u2014 President Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are in a bind. Mr. Trump\u2019s slogan is to \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d while Mr. Xi\u2019s motto is \u201cGreat Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation.\u201d The phrases have the same meaning: Each leader suggests his country has declined and claims that he will restore it to the top position in the world. But the triumph of one country is built on the failure of the other. It\u2019s a zero-sum game.But while a trade war, military skirmishes in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, or other diplomatic crises could cause a hiccup in China\u2019s rise, the Trump era will offer plenty of opportunities for Beijing. China has a chance to become a full-fledged superpower if it responds to the Trump presidency by opening up more to the world economically and politically.China has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of globalization, which helped bring hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty in the past three decades. And as much as Mr. Trump would like to freeze the forces of free trade, the world will keep globalizing.Mr. Trump\u2019s scrapping of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a chance for Beijing to strengthen its position as the economic leader of East Asia by bolstering regional trade. China is party to a free-trade agreement with Southeast Asian nations, and Beijing should encourage South Korea and Australia to join that pact. Japan is reluctant to become part of a trade group that includes China, so Beijing should leave Tokyo behind.If China were to form meaningful bilateral military pacts with Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and especially the Philippines, America would have more difficulty joining a potential war in the Taiwan Strait \u2014 a very real possibility given Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to the status quo.An East Asian trade agreement and a raft of new formal alliances would help Beijing take the position as the leader of East Asia and make the region safer.Mr. Trump\u2019s antidemocratic tendencies in the domestic arena, along with his threats to build a wall across America\u2019s border with Mexico, offer another opportunity for China in immigration policy.An illiberal turn in the United States could drive talented Americans to seek careers abroad, while skilled workers the world over may start looking somewhere other than the United States to make a better life. By adopting a more open policy toward immigrants \u2014 including the creation of a path to citizenship for some categories of immigrants \u2014 China could expand its economy while improving its moral standing globally. In doing so, Beijing could greatly reduce America\u2019s soft-power advantage.On the bilateral front, a trade war between China and the United States seems likely under Mr. Trump. Still, Beijing should be considering ways to reduce its trade surplus with the United States and avoid a battle. Meanwhile, if the Chinese bought fewer American bonds, the Trump administration would find it harder to pay for its plans to rebuild domestic infrastructure.Relations between China and the United States will inevitably deteriorate with Mr. Trump at the helm. The nuclear deterrent should still prevent an all-out war, but confrontation will be the core of these two giants\u2019 relationship for the foreseeable future.Yan Xuetong is the dean of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Set to Choose Sharp Break From European Union", "Date": "2017-01-15", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 If British plans for leaving the European Union have been a dance of the seven veils, the British government removed one of them on Sunday, letting slip to news media that Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to choose to exit Europe\u2019s single market and its customs union \u2014 a so-called hard Brexit.Officially, a government spokesman on Sunday called the reports \u201cspeculation\u201d and emphasized only the extracts of the speech that were leaked by Downing Street itself, with Mrs. May calling for British unity \u201cto make a success of Brexit and build a truly global Britain.\u201dThose extracts were not explicit on the single market or the customs union, but the Sunday newspapers, which receive their own briefings from the government before publication, took much the same line: that Britain is headed for a sharp break with Europe after a transitional period.Downing Street dislikes the term \u201chard Brexit,\u201d but an outcome along those lines is not unexpected, because it flows logically from the priorities Mrs. May has set out, particularly about controlling the country\u2019s borders. Being outside the single market could damage Britain\u2019s important financial services sector and is likely to hit the value of the pound again, at least temporarily.\u201cOften people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the E.U. but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership,\u201d she said then. \u201cWe are leaving. We are coming out. We are not going to be a member of the E.U. any longer.\u201d She added, \u201cWe will be able to have control of our borders, control of our laws.\u201dShe and her officials have made it clear that her two main priorities are ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice over British law, and restoring British control over its borders and immigration, including from the European Union.Those decisions mean that Britain could no longer be a part of the single market for goods, capital, people and services of the European Union, because the rules for that market are adjudicated by the European Court of Justice.The situation is similar for the customs union, which applies only to goods. Membership in the customs union would mean that Britain would have to obey European Union regulations on manufacturing standards and would be banned from making separate trade deals with countries \u2014 two of the most important reasons pro-Brexit forces have cited for leaving the bloc.Another implication of leaving the single market and the customs union would be Britain\u2019s desire to negotiate a new trade deal with the European Union as a special partner of some kind, but one different from those held by countries like Norway and Turkey. It would also seem to mean trying to negotiate a transitional deal with Brussels while the larger trade deal is being haggled out, which could take many years.Under a transitional deal, which would extend beyond the two-year limit for negotiating the exit, Britain would presumably continue to have a relationship much like the current one, including paying into the European Union\u2019s budget.\u201cIf it proves necessary, we have said we will consider time for implementation of new arrangements,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the E.U. to fail, we want it to prosper economically and politically, and we need to persuade our allies that a strong new partnership with the U.K. will help the E.U. to do that.\u201d\u201cThe British people are not going to lie down and say, \u2018Too bad, we\u2019ve been wounded,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe will change our model and we will come back, and we will be competitively engaged.\u201dThose comments, from an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, were interpreted as a warning that Britain could use its corporate tax as a form of leverage in Brexit negotiations.In a television interview on Sunday, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said that Mr. Hammond \u201cappears to be making a sort of threat to the European community,\u201d calling it \u201ca recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe in the future.\u201dBut Mrs. May\u2019s speech on Tuesday, judging from the excerpts, is also meant to assuage European Union colleagues by committing Britain to a close, friendly and constructive future relationship.Britain would prefer a duty-free customs relationship with the European Union if one can be negotiated on British terms, which would mean limits on the bloc\u2019s citizens working in Britain and the ability to do separate trade deals. European Union leaders have been largely dismissive of such efforts, but both sides are setting out hard positions before the real negotiations begin, sometime after Britain invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to officially begin the process of leaving the bloc.Mrs. May insists that that will take place before the end of March, even if it requires a vote of Parliament, setting off two years of complicated talks on extracting Britain from a union it joined more than 40 years ago.Mr. Hammond is known to have argued strongly inside the government for Britain to keep its access to the single market to protect its financial sector, which accounts for 10 to 12 percent of Britain\u2019s economic output.Bankers and brokers in the City of London are sometimes reviled by many Britons but are also highly paid, so their tax receipts are important to the Treasury. If a significant number of them moved their operations to European Union cities or New York, the pressure on the British government\u2019s budget to pay for health care, pensions, welfare benefits and military spending would increase substantially.Britain already runs a significantly higher yearly deficit than most European countries, about 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, and its cumulative debt is estimated at nearly 85 percent of G.D.P. Mainstream economists \u2014 under fire for wrongly predicting an immediate recession after the Brexit vote last June \u2014 say those figures are likely to worsen as the pound falls and the economy slows from the delayed effects of Brexit and the uncertainty around it.Mrs. May has also emphasized an interest in working with the incoming American administration of Donald J. Trump, and her government trumpeted its success in arranging a Washington meeting with the new president before the end of February.But her officials were not likely to be happy to discover that Michael Gove, who strongly favored Brexit and whom she fired from the cabinet, had secured the first British interview with Mr. Trump, scheduled to be printed in The Times of London on Monday.That interview comes after Mr. Trump had a series of meetings with Brexit advocates like Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, and Arron Banks, who gave millions to fund UKIP and an alternative \u201cLeave\u201d campaign in the June referendum. Both men are expected to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.Advertisement"}

The landscape is part sci-fi dystopia, part Wild West; the silhouettes of oversize wheels and pile drivers grind slowly against the horizon, while strange pods and skeletal boxes rise from the sand.So far there is little to see but fragments: the outlines of a restaurant complex, the foundations of a mall, an army-owned hotel clad in wooden scaffolding. Each section is managed by a different conglomerate of companies, most of which are enmeshed with the higher echelons of the state. The only completed element appears to be the ceremonial platform from which Mr. Sisi will one day inaugurate his alternative metropolis, a stony mound thrust high into the air that overlooks a neat grid of parking spaces and helipads in the foreground, and emptiness beyond.From some angles, the platform projects solidity and permanence; try to fit it in with its surroundings, however, and it looks like a rickety stage set that could collapse in an unexpected gust of wind. I clambered up the steps and across the plastic sheeting with an Egyptian colleague. \u201cWe are building our home in the apocalypse,\u201d he said eventually, after staring around him in silence for some time.Six years after the start of the revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak and sent the Arab world\u2019s most populous nation into turmoil, Egypt\u2019s foundations are less secure than they might first appear. True, the trappings of old-school authoritarianism are more in evidence now than ever \u2014 from the 60,000 political prisoners believed to be languishing behind bars to the spate of forced disappearances to the government crackdown on authors, journalists, cartoonists and human rights defenders. Unauthorized protest is illegal, and a sweeping antiterrorism law gives the state the power to designate anybody it doesn\u2019t like as a militant. Tired regime survival tool kits have been sharpened with fresh intensity.Certainly to his many Western allies, including President Trump \u2014 who has described his Egyptian counterpart as a \u201cfantastic guy\u201d and accepted a congratulatory phone call from him on election night, ahead of any other foreign leader \u2014 Mr. Sisi appears to be a recognizable face in an increasingly unrecognizable region: the Middle Eastern strongman offering a binary choice between tyranny and chaos.The reality is different. Egypt\u2019s 2011 revolution was not an aberration that can now be buried under tons of cement, but rather the first manifestation of an extraordinary historical moment in Egypt. Its central fault line is a struggle over whether politics is to remain the preserve of elites, or whether the defenses around the existing model of power can be swept away by a tide of popular sovereignty from below. This struggle has deep roots, and it has now been out in the open for more than half a decade. It will continue, in different forms, for many years to come.Mr. Sisi\u2019s ruling project, which justifies itself with an appeal to stability, is curiously unstable: It lurches from crisis to crisis, each revealing new cracks in the architecture of political authority, each accompanied by new levels of official violence as part of a futile attempt to beat the state\u2019s contradictions back into submission.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Sisi is reigning over the ashes of a broken political order; more so than Mr. Trump, however, he is a creature of that broken order and incapable of articulating the new. Egypt\u2019s younger generation, weaned on television images of barricades and tear gas, and veterans of their own personal battles with patriarchs in the classroom, mosque, factory floor and family dining room, do not accept the status quo as immutable.\u201cThe future now seems very vague and foggy,\u201d a young activist named Tarek Hussein told me late last year, \u201cbut we won\u2019t abandon the fight to make it our own.\u201d Mr. Hussein\u2019s peers live out Egypt\u2019s paradoxes on a daily basis: He was incarcerated under the former Muslim Brotherhood president, Mohamed Morsi, for allegedly opposing the government, and then again under Mr. Sisi for allegedly being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. I met him in a downtown Cairo cafe in the company of his younger brother, Mahmoud, who as a teenager spent more than 700 days imprisoned without charge for the crime of wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan \u201cNation without torture.\u201d\u201cWhen I was eventually released, they told me I should go home and keep quiet,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cBut here I am.\u201dOur conversation was interrupted by the arrival of what appeared to be a police informant, listening in and occasionally muttering into a phone. Tarek and Mahmoud, used to navigating the complexities of Mr. Sisi\u2019s Egypt, deftly steered us outside so that we could continue talking elsewhere. The future they want to create is irreconcilable with the one represented by the police informant, and the system that sponsors him; the future Egyptian capital in the Eastern Desert, with its neatly demarcated segments of conventional authority and V.I.P. parking for those with private helicopters, is incompatible with the messy, contested Cairo from which the Hussein brothers have emerged.No one knows what twists and turns will come next in Egypt\u2019s era of unrest, but it is clear that stasis is not a long-term option. \u201cFor these kids, the revolution was a new parent, something that brought them into the adult world and would make them, and which they believed they would eventually remake in turn,\u201d a friend who teaches political sociology to undergraduates at a major Egyptian university said recently. \u201cThey are the orphans of the revolution, and they will never be content with life as it stands.\u201dThe future is indeed vague and foggy, far more so than the confident proclamations of Egypt\u2019s rulers suggest. And who will shape that future remains fundamentally up for grabs. Driving back from the ceremonial platform to the main road, we passed a group of day laborers huddled around a fire. Behind them loomed pieces of a huge wall, more than 20 feet high, which is intended to eventually encircle the new city.\u201cThis is Sisi\u2019s wall, and Sisi\u2019s capital,\u201d one of the workers grinned when I asked him about it, jerking his finger at the construction site. \u201cEverywhere else is Egypt.\u201dJack Shenker is the author of \u201cThe Egyptians: A Radical History of Egypt\u2019s Unfinished Revolution.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Threat to U.S. Democracy: Political Dysfunction", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIs American democracy broken?There are precedents around the world for the kind of political jolt the United States experienced in November. They usually include a political firebrand who promises to sweep away a system rigged to serve the powerful rather than the interests of ordinary people. They usually end badly, when the popular champion decides to read electoral victory as an invitation to bend the institutions of democracy to the force of his will.I\u2019m skeptical that the United States is about to careen down the path taken by, say, Venezuela, governed by the whim of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2014 the handpicked successor of the populist champion Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who was elected in the late 1990s on a promise to sweep away an entrenched ruling class and proceeded to battle any democratic institution that stood in his way.Still, the embrace by millions of American voters of a billionaire authoritarian who argues that the \u201csystem\u201d has been rigged to serve a cosmopolitan ruling class against the interests of ordinary people does suggest that American democracy has a unique credibility problem.The United States resisted the temptations of Nazism, fascism and communism that beguiled Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Extreme parties like France\u2019s National Front or the United Kingdom Independence Party never established an American toehold. Populist candidates running as outsiders \u2014 Pat Buchanan, Ross Perot, Ralph Nader \u2014 could only tip the balance between the two parties of the establishment.And yet, when the 21st century brought about a populist insurrection, the United States government was quick to cave.But for all the reasons Americans may have to rebel against the status quo, what made the political system so vulnerable to a populist insurrection in November was that \u2014 for all its institutional strengths \u2014 the political system itself has come to be seen by too many voters as illegitimate.\u201cThere is persistent lack of confidence in U.S. political institutions which allows populists to make hay,\u201d said Pippa Norris, a political scientist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the University of Sydney in Australia. \u201cAnd the institutions need a major overhaul because some, like elections, are badly broken.\u201dThis is not just about the Electoral College system, which awarded the presidency to the candidate who lost the popular vote. It is not just about money\u2019s growing influence in politics, though that plays a part, too.The problems are embedded in the design of America\u2019s political institutions \u2014 with all their checks and balances ostensibly designed to slow down policy-making and prevent political extremists from swiftly taking over the gears of government. These institutions have produced a polarized government, paralyzed by partisan gridlock, unable to govern effectively. They have built a system easy to demonize as rigged.Based on the average evaluations of the elections in 2012 and 2014, the United States\u2019 electoral integrity was ranked 52nd among the 153 countries in the survey \u2014 behind all the rich Western democracies and also countries like Costa Rica and Uruguay, the Baltic states, and Cape Verde and Benin in Africa.The fact that each state has its own set of electoral regulations \u2014 covering things like the type of technology used and opening hours of the polls \u2014 means that Americans\u2019 voting rights can change substantially from state to state. And the party polarization that has gripped statehouses across the country has stymied attempts to build sensible, effective electoral regulations and bred mistrust.The patchwork of electoral systems \u2014 run by politically appointed local officials managing part-time workers \u2014 is hardly a recipe for competence. \u201cAmong mature democracies, the nuts and bolts of American contests seem notoriously vulnerable to incompetence and simple human errors,\u201d Ms. Norris notes.And there is little upon which to build consensual, bipartisan solutions. A system of political finance in which many candidates are funded by deep-pocketed single-interest groups like gun rights advocates and environmentalists will increase political polarization, even as it reduces public confidence in the system. So will electoral districts gerrymandered so narrowly for partisan benefit that even holding elections can seem pointless.Independent studies have found almost no instances of voter fraud in American elections. Still, Republicans consistently assert that it remains a clear and present danger. A consequence is that the number of states requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls has increased to 32, from 14 in 2000, making it more difficult for poorer, less educated voters to cast their ballots.Professor Norris says she believes that American political institutions can be fixed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t rocket science,\u201d she told me. For instance, to move the drawing of electoral districts out of partisan hands, as California has done, would greatly improve the nature of political contests.The difficult question, though, is whether the American political system can overcome political gridlock to fix itself. Here\u2019s hoping it can be done before the United States takes another turn down the path blazed by Venezuela.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Work to Limit Mergers May Stop With Trump Administration", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A nascent effort by the Obama administration to limit corporate consolidation, begun after officials concluded that a lack of competition was hurting the American economy, appears to be coming to an abrupt end as the Trump administration takes charge.President-elect Donald J. Trump railed against media company mergers on the campaign trail, promising to block the proposed combination of AT&T and Time Warner, but conservatives and liberals alike say they see no evidence Mr. Trump will be worried about the continuing rise of megacompanies in other parts of the economy once he takes office.\u201cSo far the pattern seems to be a pretty traditional deregulatory agenda, which is at odds with the campaign but not at odds with the Republican Party,\u201d said K. Sabeel Rahman, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School who writes about antitrust issues. \u201cSo I\u2019m pretty skeptical that there will be an aggressive push on these issues.\u201dOn President Obama\u2019s watch, companies have combined at a frantic pace in recent years, although the dollar volume of mergers fell slightly in 2016 after reaching record heights in 2015.And some experts see evidence that less competition may be weighing on economic growth, letting companies hold down wages and reduce investment in innovation, a conclusion seconded by the Obama White House last year.\u201cConsumers and workers would benefit from additional policy actions by the government to promote competition,\u201d according to a report released by the White House in April.The new administration will inherit oversight of a number of deals in progress. The Justice Department is suing to prevent a pair of mergers uniting health insurers \u2014 Anthem with Cigna, and Aetna with Humana. The Federal Trade Commission, which also oversees competition, has taken a particular interest in hospital mergers.Also looming is the AT&T merger with Time Warner, which Mr. Trump promised to prevent.\u201cAs an example of the power structure I\u2019m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it\u2019s too much concentration of power,\u201d he said after the deal was announced in October.Mr. Trump has privately reiterated his opposition to the deal in recent weeks, but his objections are seen as case-specific, rooted in his tense relationship with CNN, rather than representative of any broader views about corporate combinations.Companies pursuing mergers may see an opportunity in reaching out to Mr. Trump directly. The cellular phone companies Sprint and T-Mobile flirted with a merger in 2014, but backed down when the Obama administration signaled concerns about further consolidation in the industry, which already is dominated by a few big players.A change in administration can affect individual cases. The George W. Bush administration, for example, quickly wrapped up the Clinton administration\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, and on lenient terms. Presidents can also exert illicit influence, as when President Richard M. Nixon scuttled a federal antitrust lawsuit against International Telephone and Telegraph, a major contributor to his campaign.For his part, Mr. Sessions said in response to a question at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that he had \u201cno hesitation to enforce antitrust laws.\u201d He added, \u201cThere will not be political influence in this process.\u201dIn one important respect, Mr. Trump has said that he is determined to reduce competition: He has repeatedly promised to reduce imports from foreign countries. Economists have long viewed free trade as one of the most important checks on the market power of domestic companies. It was the availability of Japanese and German cars, for example, that forced American car companies to pay attention to quality. Reduced foreign competition could help to increase the wages of American workers, but at the expense of higher prices and less innovation.The government\u2019s approach to antitrust enforcement shifted sharply in the early 1980s, with the adoption of economic tools to evaluate mergers. Instead of assuming bigger was bad, the government increasingly sought evidence that consumers would be harmed by higher prices. The result was an era of consolidation as the government basically gave corporations the benefit of the doubt.In its April report, the White House Council of Economic Advisers highlighted evidence that older and more established firms were increasingly profitable, while business creation was in decline, suggesting a dearth of competition.\u201cWe have a growing body of empirical evidence that suggests very strongly that there\u2019s a relationship between increased market concentration and various measures of economic inequality or declining economic dynamism,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. The culprit? \u201cA couple decades of lax and spotty enforcement,\u201d he said.\u201cThere is this big difference between the rhetoric at the top and the day-in, day-out practice in the trenches of antitrust,\u201d said Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University. \u201cEven though there may be some vaguely more pro-enforcement mind-set, a lot of mergers have been approved over the last eight years.\u201d\u201cIf we required particularized and quantified proof of consumer harm in every case, we would simply make it more difficult to stop harmful conduct,\u201d she said.But whatever might have come of that line of logic is now likely to be nipped in the bud. Alden Abbott, a longtime F.T.C. official and now a Heritage Foundation fellow, said he expected the Trump administration to affirm the status quo.\u201cGiven what happened in the election, any thought that a new head of the agency would try to come up with an enforcement policy less focused on economics and facts and more focused on notions of fairness, I think that\u2019s not very likely,\u201d he said.Two years later, Mr. Trump, then the owner of several casinos, was the defendant in an antitrust action. He paid a $750,000 civil penalty to settle charges that he had purchased stock in two rival casino operators without telling regulators.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding His Flock: A Rural Writer\u2019s Book Club", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byAuthor\u2019s NoteIt is an idea universally indulged that escaping to a far-flung spot, preferably surrounded by landscapes of stunning natural beauty, will spark bouts of unnatural creativity. Four years ago, I tested that proposition when my wife and I left London for a tiny cottage in a remote valley in the Black Mountains of South Wales. It felt like another world. The view from the window was of sheep rather than the top deck of red London buses. Our nearest neighbor was a farm a 20-minute walk across three fields. We couldn\u2019t hear them watching television or smell what they cooked for supper. I found that, true enough, with no job, no friends and no television, a lot of writing is possible. I never stopped to consider the cost. Social interaction was so rare that after weeks alone in my writing shed, my ability to regulate conversation atrophied: A friendly question in the post office would elicit a three-minute response. I began to fear the prospect of friends visiting as a threat to my hard-won \u201cspace.\u201dThen, after a year or more, just as the arrival of our first child transformed our isolation from a creative asset into a psychological liability, Rachel, our midwife, came with news. \u201cOh, there\u2019s another author round here whose baby I just delivered.\u201d Loneliness and prideful smugness did battle: An unspoken obligation loomed. The author in question turned out to be Owen Sheers. In due course, we admitted to each other the drawbacks of our rural situation. Yes, with nothing but my wife and sheep for company, I had written a second book much faster than the first. But I did like talking about books as well as writing them. In the now popular saying, cities are where ideas go to have sex. So much of contemporary cultural production and consumption takes place in urban settings, and, globally, the pace of urbanization is accelerating. Owen and I shared a latent fear: What were we missing out on? Owen knew several other writers in the area, the nonfiction writer Oliver Balch and the novelist Tom Bullough. I suggested a writers\u2019 book club to discuss a different book every month from the perspective of craft, technique, style. \u201cYes, a few of us tried that before,\u201d said Tom, wearily. \u201cBut someone said something unforgivable about Gogol, and that was the end of it.\u201dBefore the first meeting, we went to a reading and met two more. They, in turn, spread the word further and the net wider. In these hills, writers, it seemed, were more common than vermin. And their enthusiasm for the book club was palpable.To taciturn writers for whom small talk is a kind of torture, it was, I think, a convenient alibi for company. British sociability can often be a perilous obstacle course of implicit obligation; where the goal of social occasions is to emerge unscathed without being caught in a web of suffocating reciprocity. We were explicitly gathered not to talk about ourselves, but about books.Now each month we assemble like a clandestine congregation of nonconformists in the basement of a charming local pub: the Bridge End Inn, Talgarth. After several months, we quickly overwhelmed our allotted table and colonized the whole room. Our membership is now pushing 18. Ideas, it seems, are desperate for their monthly hookup. So what of the product? Do the magic ingredients of peace, quiet and stimulating company make any difference to creative output? It\u2019s hard to say. The main factor, we\u2019d all agree, is the cost of time. Money vaporizes in London before you\u2019ve even put your hand in your pocket. But will we write different books outside the city? Maybe not immediately, but the constellation of serious writers in a rural setting is an interesting phenomenon that, I think, reflects wider changes in the global economy and climate. Artists are getting priced out of global cities, and climate change has politicized the rural in new ways.The first book we read was \u201c10:04,\u201d by Ben Lerner. Although the group on the whole reacted badly to the narrow New York focus of the book, the example of the author\u2019s supreme self-confidence of place (it is taken as self-evident that Brooklyn is where anyone would want to live) has struck a chord in many discussions since. Away from the city, climate change as a totalizing political and cultural concern is hard to avoid. \u201cHow can anyone, now, justify writing a book that is not, in some way, about our relationship to this planet,\u201d our dear late member Rebecca Loncraine said. It would be difficult, here, to write one of those neo-Romantic nature books, with which Britain is currently awash, idealizing the natural world as a zone of innocence untouched by human influence.Lately, we have spent time talking, as all writers do, about the inadequacy of language; of the need for a new vocabulary to describe things that humans have denatured, violated. The sea is no longer the same sea that the word initially signified. The air is no longer the air it once was, and so on. Pretentious perhaps, but urgent too.Strangely, I have met more writers in these hills than I ever knew in all the global cities in which I have lived: New York, Chicago, Nairobi, London. Not only has moving away from the city increased my productivity, but I am blessed with that rare thing: a fresh view. My citybound friends still refer to where I live as \u201cthe middle of nowhere,\u201d but to me, it increasingly feels at the heart of things.

{"Headline": "Why Women Quit Working: It\u2019s Not for the Reasons Men Do", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byThe go-to explanations for why so many men \u2014 even in their prime working years \u2014 have dropped out of the labor force do not apply to Krystin Stevenson.Rather, she gave up her $40,000-a-year job as a customer service representative at a real estate firm in the summer of 2015 when her fragile support network collapsed. Her mother, a part-time home health care aide, took care of the children, picking up the older one from elementary school in the afternoon. But after she had a stroke, she was the one who needed to be taken care of, and Ms. Stevenson stepped in to manage her aging mother as well as her young children.\u201cI ended up just quitting my job,\u201d said Ms. Stevenson, who lives outside Denver. \u201cI was trying to work and help her, but the job wasn\u2019t flexible.\u201dMore than seven years into the recovery, it has failed to bounce back. Only 73.7 percent of prime-age women \u2014 those roughly 25 to 54 \u2014 were in the work force in 2015.But women are still the primary caregivers \u2014 for children, aging parents and ailing relatives.\u201cChild care, that\u2019s my main thing,\u201d Krystin Stevenson said, explaining why she had not yet returned to the work force.\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that women were reacting to the lack of paid family leave and child care,\u201d said Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. They found it too much trouble to work, she said, \u201cso they were dropping out.\u201dEven though men dominate the disability rolls, their health problems have a ripple effect on the women in their lives. Women tend to be the ones managing their husbands\u2019 care, driving or accompanying them to doctor appointments and therapies that eat into a day.Women\u2019s lower wages and family responsibilities have always batted them in and out of jobs \u2014 and in and out of the labor force \u2014 with much more frequency than men. A sick child or a family emergency can quickly push someone out of a job.And as wages, particularly at the lower end of the scale, have stagnated, the payoff from working decreases, as does the level of attachment. Women who ended their education at high school graduation, or earlier, dropped out of the labor force at even greater rates than their male counterparts between 2000 and 2015, according to a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.To some analysts, the single-minded focus on sidelined men without a closer look at women has placed too much attention on the failings of potential workers instead of the quality of the jobs.They argue that the combination of missing women and relatively limp wage growth point to a weak economy as the primary culprit, and not, say, the heavy consumption of painkillers or video games.\u201cI\u2019m sure the quality of jobs is part of the story,\u201d said David Madland, a senior adviser on the American Worker Project at the liberal Center for American Progress. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be worth your while.\u201dBoth women and men complain they are unable to find full-time, secure jobs that pay a middle-class wage. Krystin Stevenson, for example, needs to solve her child care problem, but echoing the comments of many men, she also does not want to settle for just any job.\u201cI have two degrees\u201d \u2014 a bachelor\u2019s in public relations and an associate degree in human services \u2014 \u201cso I don\u2019t want to work at McDonald\u2019s or Jiffy Lube,\u201d she said.In the meantime, she has been paying the bills with a combination of family help, savings, child support from a former partner, temporary unemployment insurance and food stamps.For others, whether men or women, who may be getting by on a disability check with health insurance from the government, a minimum-wage job without benefits isn\u2019t all that appealing when it fails to add up to much more.Before the recession, for example, Tonya Pinkston, 43, had a full-time job at a warehouse logistics company and a part-time position at night at a post office near her home in Lawrenceville, outside Atlanta. After a diagnosis of lupus, and with a kidney condition that requires dialysis treatments three times a week, she is now on disability.\u201cIf I could find something flexible, I could work part time,\u201d she said.Her health has stabilized, but she is cautious. A friend with lupus who went back to work as a custodian when she felt better ended up losing much of her government assistance, including a housing subsidy and Medicare. Now she is starting to get sick again, missing work and at risk of being fired.\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, no, I just don\u2019t want that to happen to me,\u2019\u201d Ms. Pinkston said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t think about the long haul.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Bhutan, Happiness Index as Gauge for Social Ills", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byTHIMPHU, Bhutan \u2014 As a downpour settled into a thick fog outside, Dasho Karma Ura let his eyes flicker at the ceiling of a wood-paneled conference room and began expounding on the nature of happiness.\u201cPeople feel happy when they see something ethical,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you think you have done something right and brave and courageous, when you can constantly recharge yourself as a meaningful actor.\u201d\u201cAnd lastly,\u201d he added, thumbing Buddhist prayer beads, \u201csomething which makes you pause and think, \u2018Ah, this is beautiful. Beautiful, meaningful, ethical.\u2019 \u201dAs nations struggle with what Mr. Ura called more \u201cguns, bullets and bombs\u201d than at any other time in history, he said it was imperative that many more countries devise indicators that look beyond economics.\u201cWe have to find new ways of organizing our drives and energies toward peace and harmony,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to sincerely find a way out of it, out of this mutual insecurity. Because you have more guns, I have to have a little more guns. The long-term collapse is facing us.\u201dWhile Gross National Happiness has become a political tool around election time, Mr. Ura believes the index has drawn greater attention to social problems. And the results appear to be positive, he said.Those who were educated and lived in urban areas reported higher levels of contentment than their rural counterparts. Men reported feeling happier than women.Bhutan\u2019s Constitution, which went into effect in 2008 with the transition to democracy, directs the kingdom\u2019s leaders to consult the four pillars of Gross National Happiness \u2014 good governance, sustainable socioeconomic development, preservation and promotion of culture, and environmental conservation \u2014 when considering legislation.Born into an agricultural community in central Bhutan, Mr. Ura said his childhood was marked by changes that brought him closer to a world beyond farming. In the 1960s and 1970s, Swiss investors, taken with his district\u2019s alpine terrain, helped develop road and water systems. The introduction of a formal education system in Bhutan gradually upended the mind-set of many villagers, who felt schooling took away from responsibilities at home.After graduating at the top of his class in Thimphu, Bhutan\u2019s capital, Mr. Ura was sent to St. Stephen\u2019s College in India, where he at first pursued history. By the time he reached Oxford in 1983, he had begun a longer foray into philosophy, economics and politics.When he returned to Bhutan in 1988, he was taken aback, first with the condition of the country\u2019s libraries, which he called \u201cextremely rudimentary,\u201d and then with the way an \u201cindustrializing, Cold War\u201d focus on materialism had started to threaten the country\u2019s Buddhist traditions.\u201cThe metrics of international development agencies were seeping into our language, into our consciousness, into our accountability system,\u201d he said.During this period, the standard metrics for measuring a country\u2019s progress on the global development scale had come under scrutiny in Bhutan, Mr. Ura said. Indicators that looked exclusively at income or a country\u2019s investments were found to miss out on some larger, moral truth, \u201cthat aggregate final optimal value which we call happiness.\u201dThe term \u201cGross National Happiness\u201d had already been coined by King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who ruled Bhutan until 2006. But the vocabulary remained imprecise, Mr. Ura said, and the task of developing criteria to measure happiness as a development tool was passed down to him and his staff members.Mr. Ura maintains that his work has never been about mathematics, but instead about understanding the immediacy and intimacy of a person\u2019s experiences, which he believes get a country closer to measuring true progress. With something like air quality, for instance, Mr. Ura said he was fascinated with people\u2019s perceptions.\u201cMaybe air is very unpolluted across the country, we know this in Bhutan, but in some pockets you may be breathing very bad air,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it is not the objective measurement of air quality, but how do you feel your air quality is around you.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Ura was quick to defer credit for developing Gross National Happiness to King Wangchuck. But he has become a more visible advocate internationally.But Mr. Ura acknowledged that questions have arisen about whether a happiness indicator was nothing more than a thought experiment praised in elite academic circles and among wealthy nations. Even as the index caught on outside Bhutan, Mr. Ura said, persuading other developing countries to look past development conclusions driven by income has been difficult.\u201cAfter we become rich. Let\u2019s discuss after per capita income is $10,000,\u201d he said, giving an explanation for why some nations have taken longer to embrace the indicator. \u201cLife is not sequential like this. You don\u2019t say that I want to become rich first and happy later.\u201dAlthough Bhutan has its own economic challenges, including one of the world\u2019s highest debt to G.D.P. ratios and a lopsided reliance on India for development, Mr. Ura believes a happiness index has remained popular in the country partly for religious and historical reasons.A Buddhist belief in alleviating suffering has had an effect, he said. But so, too, has the absence of colonialism and extreme poverty. Countries that have been slow to carry out the measure, he said, are often unable to move beyond the \u201coverhang\u201d of traumatic pasts.\u201cIf you go back to the newspapers, continually, under the banner of G.N.H., these sorts of things are raised which would not otherwise be raised,\u201d he said. If Bhutanese read about an assault, he continued, \u201cpeople write, \u2018In the G.N.H. country, why is this happening?\u2019\u201dGoing forward, Mr. Ura seemed realistic about the challenges facing Bhutan\u2019s own implementation of the indicator. As the country has developed, large-scale hydropower projects have driven the economy forward, but they have also displaced some farmers and those living in rural communities, he said.Mr. Ura said ensuring that maximizing aggregate happiness did not come at the expense of those on the margins would have to remain a priority. But as Bhutan looks to expand and diversify its economy, he acknowledged that it was difficult to predict the exact calculus for harmonizing Gross National Happiness and gross domestic product.As for the calculus of his own \u201cperfect happy day,\u201d Mr. Ura said it involves six hours of \u201cprofoundly deep\u201d sleep, an hourlong afternoon walk to a forest and avoiding what many of his fellow citizens might consider a fifth pillar of happiness: Bhutan\u2019s very hot chilies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Trump Stronger Than He Seems?", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported byPopularity ContestNew polls suggest that Donald J. Trump has the lowest approval and favorability ratings of any incoming president in the polling era \u2014 by a lot. Unsurprisingly, he is not buying it.He tweeted that the polls are \u201crigged\u201d just like the \u201cphony\u201d pre-election polls that showed Hillary Clinton on track for victory.Mr. Trump\u2019s point is not persuasive. The pre-election polls weren\u2019t off by much over all: Mrs. Clinton won the popular vote by about two percentage points, not far from her edge of three to four points in the final national polls.But there might be some merit to his sentiment about the polls, even if his specific argument isn\u2019t credible.Mr. Trump\u2019s ratings are poor for an incoming president, no matter how you cut it. The question is whether his ratings are merely poor or disastrous. If his approval rating were taken at face value, there would be an argument that his presidency could be in jeopardy before it even started.In general, the postelection period is about as good as it gets for an incoming president. But recent surveys put Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating around 40 percent \u2014 as bad or even worse than President Obama\u2019s approval ratings heading into the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, when Democrats were dealt huge losses.Mr. Trump, to some extent, has incurred expected and inevitable losses in advance of his presidency. Years of controversial remarks have given him the political baggage that typical presidents of this era, like Mr. Obama, inevitably pick up over their first two years.But Mr. Trump\u2019s ratings aren\u2019t just below those of past incoming presidents; they\u2019re also below re-elected presidents like Mr. Obama and George W. Bush. The postelection honeymoon phase lifted Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush\u2019s approval ratings well over 50 percent after their re-elections, despite all of the scars of their first terms.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s polling weakness can also be attributed to the difference between adults and likely voters. The adult population is much younger, more diverse and likelier to have been born outside the United States than the voting electorate. Most of the recent polls have measured Mr. Trump\u2019s ratings among all American adults, not registered or likely voters.This can make a sizable difference. Mr. Trump\u2019s favorability rating was seven points higher (his net-favorability rating was nine points higher) among likely voters than adults in New York Times/CBS News surveys last summer that asked all adults whether they had a favorable impression of Mr. Trump. If the gap between adults and likely voters is as large as it was in those surveys, it would bring Mr. Trump\u2019s ratings pretty close to his 46 percent share of the national popular vote.Still, starting with a 46 percent approval rating would be a sign of profound weakness.It would be easy enough to say that Mr. Trump enters as an unprecedentedly unpopular president. But how many times over the last year and a half were the polls cited as evidence that Mr. Trump was historically unpopular? I don\u2019t mean the horse race numbers, which generally showed Mr. Trump competitive for the nomination and the presidency. I mean the questions about character, which painted a far more pessimistic picture of his chances.One could brush all this aside by attributing his victory to the weakness of his opposition. From this point of view, Mr. Trump is a historically weak political figure who benefited from historically weak opposition.The other possibility is that there\u2019s something about Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal that\u2019s not captured in the traditional approval ratings or the character questions.One piece of evidence seems consistent with this possibility: the seeming optimism about his presidency.Take the most recent Quinnipiac poll. At first glance, it\u2019s bleak for Mr. Trump. Just 37 percent of registered voters \u2014 a narrower group than the adult population \u2014 view him favorably or approve of his performance. But just about every other question is better for Mr. Trump: 45 percent think he\u2019ll take the nation in the right direction, and 52 percent of registered voters are optimistic about the next four years with Mr. Trump as president.Just about every new poll tells a similar story. The most recent CNN poll says that just 40 percent of adults approve of his performance, but 48 percent say they think he\u2019ll do a \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201cfairly good\u201d job as president. And 48 percent say his policies will move the country in the right direction. An even larger 61 percent say that he\u2019ll bring back well-paying jobs to economically depressed areas.An ABC/Washington Post poll found that a majority of Americans expect he\u2019ll do a good or excellent job handling the economy, jobs, terrorism, the budget deficit, and in helping the middle class.I don\u2019t have a brilliant explanation for the disconnect between these numbers and his approval ratings. Maybe his postelection honeymoon has made people more optimistic about the next four years, but it hasn\u2019t led people to reassess their deeply held views of his character and ability.Maybe Republican partisans who have long been skeptical of Mr. Trump are nonetheless optimistic about his economic agenda. That suggests that Democrats might have a harder time benefiting from skepticism of Mr. Trump than one might guess.Or maybe these measures are hinting at something about Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal that helps explain the disconnect between his electoral success and his historically bad ratings.No matter what, Mr. Trump is president as of Friday. Most presidents who run for re-election get it. He inherits a healthy and growing economy, which has been the most important predictor of the president\u2019s approval rating. He may enter weaker than any president in memory, but the office and the state of the country will afford him plenty of opportunities to improve his standing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Key Moments From Today\u2019s Confirmation Hearings", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byHearing BriefingWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats continue their rigorous questioning of President Trump\u2019s nominees for cabinet positions and other important posts. Here are key moments from today:\u25a0 Representative Tom Price of Georgia, nominated to be health and human services secretary, defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company during his time in Congress. \u201cThe reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,\u201d he said.\u25a0 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, lamented \u201cthe hyper-politicization of the nomination process.\u201d\u25a0 Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the nominee for budget director, said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities.\u25a0 The toughest questions that Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending and appeared to be shocked when Mr. Mulvaney could not remember those votes.\u25a0 Linda E. McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment and Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Small Business Administration, said her entrepreneurial background suited her for the job.\u25a0 Ms. McMahon assured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations.The findings emerged from a review of Mr. Price\u2019s tax returns and other official documents by committee staff members from both parties.In a questionnaire in December, the committee staff said, Mr. Price understated the value of 400,613 shares of the Australian company that he purchased in August 2016 through \u201ca private placement offering.\u201dThe value of the shares was listed on the questionnaire as $50,000 to $100,000, but that reflected the purchase price, the staff reported. At the request of the committee, Mr. Price recalculated the value of his holdings to reflect their market price. The revised value was $100,000 to $250,000.In addition, the committee staff said, Mr. Price \u201ctook improper deductions on his 2016 tax returns\u201d for the depreciation of land associated with condominiums that he owns in Washington and Nashville.Moreover, the staff said, Mr. Price and his wife, both physicians, claimed \u201cmiscellaneous employment deductions totaling $19,034\u201d for various expenses in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Neither Mr. Price nor his wife work as a physician, the staff report said, and \u201cproper documentation could not be located,\u201d so Mr. Price\u2019s tax returns will be amended to remove the $19,034 in deductions.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, questioned Mr. Price over his trades of health care stocks during his time in Congress.\u201cIt is hard to see this as anything but a conflict of interest and an abuse of position,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.In particular, Mr. Wyden pressed Mr. Price over his investments in Innate Immunotherapeutics, which the senator said could be affected by legislation that comes before Congress.Mr. Price said he had done nothing wrong.\u201cThe reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,\u201d he said.Just how involved is Mr. Price as the Trump administration plots how it will replace the Affordable Care Act?Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, tried to find out.\u201cPresident Trump said he\u2019s working with you on a replacement plan for the A.C.A., which is nearly finished and will be revealed after your confirmation,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that he said that, yes,\u201d Mr. Price responded, drawing laughter in the hearing room.\u201cNot that he\u2019s ever done this before, but did the president lie?\u201d Mr. Brown asked. He added: \u201cI know we don\u2019t use the word lie here, because we\u2019re polite, when presidents say statements that aren\u2019t true. But did he lie to the public about working with you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with the president about health care, yes,\u201d Mr. Price replied.Senator Hatch lamented \u201cthe hyper-politicization of the nomination process.\u201d He said Democrats\u2019 attacks on Mr. Price\u2019s ethics were \u201cspecious and distorted.\u201dHe said lawmakers should not \u201cinvent new standards for finances, ethics and disclosure that are different from those that have generally applied in the past.\u201d\u201cNone of those who say they oppose Dr. Price\u2019s nomination seem to be talking about whether he is qualified,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, also came to Mr. Price\u2019s defense. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been asked to be a character witness in a felony trial in the sentencing phase of a conviction,\u201d he said. He called Mr. Price \u201can honorable man.\u201dMr. Mulvaney said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities if he were confirmed as Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director.\u201cI believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said in prepared remarks to be delivered to the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cI also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy.\u201dWhile Mr. Mulvaney is a big believer in spending cuts, he made it clear that he wanted to protect America\u2019s social safety nets. \u201cA strong, healthy economy allows us to protect our most vulnerable,\u201d he said.Mr. Mulvaney was asked about his failure to pay nanny taxes in his opening question, and said that it had been an innocent mistake.\u201cIn 2000, we had triplets. When we came home, we hired someone to help my wife, to help take care of the children,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cIn my mind, she was a babysitter.\u201dHe added, \u201cI did not consider her a household employee for purposes of withholding.\u201dMr. Mulvaney said he had realized his error when filling out a questionnaire related to his nomination to be Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director. He said that he had quickly notified his accountant, the president and his colleagues so that he could correct the mistake.The toughest questions Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came not from a Democrat but from Senator McCain.He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending, and appeared shocked when he could not remember those votes.\u201cBoy, I\u2019ll tell you, I would remember if I voted to cut our defenses the way you did, congressman,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t take it with the seriousness that it deserves.\u201dMr. McCain was also unimpressed with Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s explanation for wanting to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan. After giving the congressman a history lesson on the roots of the Sept. 11 attacks, he offered a final note of disapproval.\u201cI am deeply concerned about your lack of support for our military,\u201d he said.Mr. Mulvaney was forced to address suggestions he had made in the past that Social Security was akin to a Ponzi scheme, and he played down that characterization.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t read too much into it, as describing it as a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he said, explaining that he had merely been referring to the fact that the program takes money from people and gives it to other people.As for keeping the program solvent, Mr. Mulvaney said he would not recommend cuts that would cause current retirees to lose benefits. However, he said that he could see raising the age for receiving benefits in the future.Ms. McMahon reassured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations, promising to work to put in place \u201cthe right regulations\u201d to spur economic growth if she is confirmed as head of the Small Business Administration.Senator Jim Risch, the Idaho Republican who leads the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said the regulatory structure of government today was \u201cstrangling businesses.\u201dMs. McMahon presented herself not as the billionaire former chief executive of W.W.E. but instead as an entrepreneur who had weathered the most difficult moments of building a business from the ground up.\u201cSmall businesses want to feel they can take a risk on expansion or a new hire without fearing onerous new regulations or unexpected taxes, fees and fines that will make such growth unaffordable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to renew optimism in our economy.\u201dIntroduced and endorsed by the two Democrats who defeated her in her failed Senate bids in Connecticut \u2014 Senators Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy \u2014 Ms. McMahon seems likely to sail to confirmation, with the committee expected to approve her next week. The introduction and endorsement of a Republican nominee by two Democratic senators is unusual at the outset of a confirmation hearing.Mr. Murphy, who defeated Ms. McMahon in 2012, expressed \u201cconfidence that she is going to give good, sound counsel to President Trump.\u201d\u201cI saw firsthand the fight that Linda brings to any endeavor she takes on,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opening Salvos in President Trump\u2019s Trade War", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byEditorialForeign countries would almost certainly respond if Mr. Trump tried to impose a border tax. They would file cases against the United States at the World Trade Organization, which has the power to authorize retaliatory tariffs on American products, potentially hurting exporters like Boeing, General Electric and farmers in the Midwest. The leaders of some countries, including China, which Mr. Trump frequently criticizes, could create a similar tax to force American manufacturers to set up more factories in those countries. Such tit-for-tat would inevitably harm American workers who make goods for export as well as businesses that rely on raw materials and parts from other countries.In his inaugural speech, Mr. Trump railed against trade: \u201cThe wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the world.\u201d But the protectionism he champions assumes trade provides no benefits.

{"Headline": "As the E.U.\u2019s Language Roster Swells, So Does the Burden", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byWhat in the WorldIt\u2019s not easy to speak with one voice in 24 languages.When what is now the European Union first took root in the 1950s, it included just six nations, and in three of them many people spoke French. It could sidestep national jealousies without trouble by designating most of the member nations\u2019 main languages as official languages.But that set a precedent, and as the union has grown much larger, so has the official language roster \u2014 not to mention the bill for translation and interpretation, which now runs to about 1 billion euros, or more than $1 billion, a year.Defenders of the policy say it preserves diversity and promotes language learning. They contend that it is not to blame for the bloc\u2019s repeated failure to speak as one over issues like migration, the economy and Russia.Still, the polyglottery can be a bit of a strain, especially when it comes to tongues like Irish, which only a few Irish citizens use frequently outside the education system. Though Irish has been an official language of the union for a decade, member nations keep postponing the deadline for providing full Irish translation and interpretation services.There is also a push to recognize Luxembourgish, the only national language of a member state that the union has not made official. Yet Luxembourgers also use German and French, and even their laws are all written in French. So the authorities are looking for a way to enhance the language\u2019s status that would not entail a lot of translation and interpretation expense.The European Union may add Turkish as its 25th official language, even if Turkey never becomes a member. The reason is Cyprus.The island has been divided for decades between the mainly Greek-speaking Republic of Cyprus and a breakaway Turkish-speaking region in the north. The two sides have been in painstaking talks to reunite the island, and the republic, which belongs to the European Union, has requested official status for Turkish as a gesture to the north.There is no assurance that the unity talks will succeed, so no vote has been held yet by member governments on the language request.As you might expect, some official languages are more official than others. To save time and money, officials and staff members at the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, usually write internally in only three \u2014 English, French and German \u2014 and often speak in English, to the annoyance of the French.But when lawyers looked into it, they concluded that it would take a unanimous vote, and there is almost no chance of that. Ireland and Malta rely on English, and it is extremely popular in Central and Eastern Europe. Somebody would be sure to veto the move.Advertisement"}

How will you remember our current president? What is his legacy, as both a man and as a leader?Last week, The New York Times invited readers to reflect on President Obama\u2019s successes and failures, and how they will remember him. Selected Letters to the Editor were published Sunday, Jan. 8.Just as Jackie Robinson was perfectly cast for his historic breakthrough, so, too, was Barack Obama. He emerged from relative obscurity as a beacon of hope and change. And, despite the roadblocks and setbacks, he remains so. The Obama presidency has been consequential. Especially impressive is his bold leadership on some of the most significant issues of our time, from health care reform to climate change to a nuclear deal with Iran that was once unimaginable. But it is Mr. Obama the man I will remember most. The personal indignities to which he was subjected, from \u201cbirtherism\u201d to other acts of disrespect and contempt, are a disgrace. Yet he never lost his own dignity or grace. It was an \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d epitomized by his leading this hymn at the funeral for nine African-Americans massacred in Charleston. Now, with his successor inspiring more fear than hope, President Obama is urging us not to despair. Rather than apocalyptic, he\u2019s still optimistic. Let\u2019s follow his lead. Those of us who share his values should continue to work tirelessly toward the progressive ideals he has espoused. Barack Obama\u2019s story will always represent the unique promise of America.SAM BROMBERG, Delray Beach, Fla.President Obama\u2019s domestic legacy is one of thoughtful policy successes, and a failure to publicize and celebrate those achievements. This contradiction is best illustrated by the fact that the majority of Americans polled opposed Obamacare despite overwhelming public support for its individual provisions. More than $800 billion was spent under the 2009 stimulus package, but ordinary Americans couldn\u2019t point to a single bridge built or job saved by it. Mr. Obama, a cerebral technocrat, seemed to operate on the assumption that his nuanced policy solutions would speak for themselves. Despite his soaring speeches, he never learned how to convince Americans that his agenda was working. Mr. Obama\u2019s shortcomings in flaunting his achievements are further accentuated by his successor\u2019s flair for it. The economy added 156,000 jobs in December, but it was 800 jobs at a Carrier factory in Indiana that captured the national spotlight.SAM SKOVGAARD, Denver\u2014 What will you remember about President Obama, both as a man and as a leader?\u2014 The letters from Times readers expressed both positive and negative remembrances of Mr. Obama.

{"Headline": "With MoneyGram, China\u2019s Ant Financial Gets an American Base", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsJack Ma\u2019s Ant Financial has gotten itself an American colony. The $880 million purchase of the remittances firm MoneyGram in a deal announced on Thursday looks like a counterintuitive bet in a de-globalizing world for the Alibaba founder\u2019s financial services arm. International payments are a tough business. But MoneyGram gives Ant a base with connections to many developing markets.Ant piggybacked off the growth of Alibaba, whose Alipay unit received commissions for each transaction it processed over the companies\u2019 marketplaces. In turn, its payments and financial services division helped the Chinese firm expand its e-commerce business. Alipay\u2019s immense popularity at home has allowed it to accumulate 450 million customers.While Ant has wished to expand internationally, complying with differing regulatory regimes and establishing relationships with all the entities in various nations\u2019 payments chains is a complex process. So it initially limited itself to following Chinese tourists around the world, giving them an option to pay at merchants with Alipay. The company is now steadily scaling up its ambitions as it edges toward an initial public offering.Buying MoneyGram helps on a few fronts. The transfer business is less regulated, and it gives Ant a toehold in the developed American market. MoneyGram specializes in sending money from immigrants back to their home countries. Ant has been moving into developing economies as well, having recently made big investments in India and Thailand. Linking MoneyGram with these operations will be a natural step.Remittances have grown in tandem with emigration. Between 2005 and 2015, the global volume of such payments through so-called formal channels grew to $582 billion from $283 billion, according to research by Aite. MoneyGram and the larger Western Union dominate this market. However, digital upstarts like Azimo and PayPal\u2019s Xoom are taking share, with cheaper and more convenient options. That may explain why Ant had to pay only about 12.5 times expected 2017 earnings for its purchase.Ant hopes its digital expertise will help it fend off these challengers. Dealing with regulators is another matter. The United States has steadily increased regulation of the transfer market over the last two decades. Western Union agreed just last week to pay a $586 million fine after admitting to aiding and abetting wire fraud. Ant\u2019s future public owners had better hope Mr. Ma\u2019s recent visit to Trump Tower gave the Chinese billionaire some assurance that the vise is finished tightening.Advertisement"}

It can generate more than 2,000 megawatts, or about one-fourth of the power consumed in New York City and Westchester County. The prospects for replacing that power are unclear, but potential options include hydropower from Quebec and power from wind farms that already operate or could open across New York, according to the person.State officials believe the Entergy agreement will help convince renewable energy providers that the state is serious about looking for new sources of energy, the person said. But without a viable replacement source, ratepayers in New York City could be burdened with higher energy prices for years.Entergy has agreed to make repairs and safety upgrades, including transferring spent fuel to what the state says is a safer storage system. The company will also allow safety inspections starting this year, bowing to longtime demands from the Cuomo administration, the office of the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, and Riverkeeper, the nonprofit environmental group, all of which participated in the deal.\u201cFor years, my office has been fighting to address the serious risks posed by Indian Point to the surrounding communities and the environment,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said on Friday. \u201c If we can shut down Indian Point under an agreement that enhances public safety and kick-starts investment into safer and more reliable renewable energy sources, that will be a major victory for the millions of New Yorkers who live in the region.\u201dIn exchange, the state and Riverkeeper will drop safety and environmental claims against Indian Point they had filed with federal regulatory agencies.In 2011, a report commissioned under then-Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg concluded that if Indian Point were shut within five years, there would not be enough reliable substitutes to meet the city\u2019s needs. Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Consolidated Edison, said that utilities and state regulators had worked since then to develop a contingency plan.\u201cSteps have been taken to replace that power in the event it does close,\u201d Mr. Clendenin said. \u201cStill more needs to be done, but there\u2019s more transmission and supply expected in the next few years.\u201dHe said he could not estimate what effect the proposed shutdown would have on the electric bills of Con Edison customers in the city and Westchester County, which already are among the highest in the nation. Con Ed has a contract to buy 500 megawatts of electricity from Indian Point, or nearly one-fourth of the plant\u2019s capacity.Jerry Nappi, a spokesman for Entergy in Westchester County, declined to comment on the proposed shutdown. He said that Indian Point has nearly 1,000 workers, about 550 of whom are union members.John Melia, a spokesman for the Utility Workers Union of America, said Entergy had not informed the union of the plan, which he called a \u201cheadstrong, headlong rush into nowhere.\u201d He asked, \u201cDid Governor Cuomo think about the people who are going to lose their jobs?\u201dNegotiations between the company and the Cuomo administration began in early December, according to the person with direct knowledge of the deal.The attorney general\u2019s office and Entergy have each signed off on the agreement, but the governor\u2019s office has indicated to the other parties that the administration will wait until Monday to sign it, the person said. The deal has shifted several times during negotiations, but the person said all that remained to complete it was an administration signature.Nonetheless, Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said that nothing was final. \u201cThere is no agreement \u2014 Governor Cuomo has been working on a possible agreement for 15 years and until it\u2019s done, it\u2019s not done,\u201d he said. \u201cClose only counts for horseshoes, not for nuclear plants.\u201dUnder the agreement with the state, the person with knowledge of it said, Entergy has committed to applying for a six-year renewal of the licenses, which were scheduled to expire in 2013 and 2015. The agreement may help clear the way for approval.But a six-year renewal would be a first, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. He said no nuclear plant license had ever been renewed for less than 20 years.The agreement would also require Entergy to establish an emergency operations center in Fishkill, in Dutchess County, and to create a $15 million fund to finance projects related to environmental protection and other community benefits. Entergy would be obligated to consult regularly with Riverkeeper and other local groups.The agreement also provides for flexibility if the state cannot find a replacement for Indian Point\u2019s energy: The deadlines in 2020 and 2021 can be delayed to 2024 and 2025 if the state and Entergy agree.The agreement is reminiscent of one arranged by Mr. Cuomo\u2019s father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, in 1989. Mario Cuomo negotiated a decommissioning of the Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island, which was never put into service. Its owner, the Long Island Lighting Company, sold the plant to the state for $1, but Long Island ratepayers bore the cost of building that plant in the form of higher utility bills for many years.Nuclear power has posed a dilemma for Mr. Cuomo. Since long before he was governor, as early as 1992, he has called for closing Indian Point. As the state\u2019s attorney general, he took legal action to try to do so.But while he has characterized nuclear reactors as dangerous downstate, he has said they are critical upstate.When Entergy announced in late 2015 that it planned to shut a nuclear plant on Lake Ontario in Oswego County, Mr. Cuomo objected. He argued that the plant was vital to the local economy and to his goal of having half of the state\u2019s power produced by renewable sources.To avert the shutdown of Entergy\u2019s James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant and a nearby plant that was also scheduled for closing, Mr. Cuomo offered huge subsidies to the operators to keep them open.Critics of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal to subsidize nuclear power plants upstate wondered why he would demand the closing of Indian Point, but insist on keeping the others open.\u201cWe happen to think people upstate deserve the same protections as New Yorkers who happen to live downstate do,\u201d said Alex Beauchamp, the northeast regional director for Food & Water Watch, a consumer protection watchdog. \u201cTo me, it makes no sense why the governor thinks nuclear power\u2019s unsafe downstate, but it is safe upstate.\u201dCiting various leaks and delayed repairs at the three upstate plants, Mr. Beauchamp said that they had problems similar to those at Indian Point, and pose similar risks to local residents.An earlier version of this article misstated the county where Fishkill, N.Y., is located. It is Dutchess County, not Westchester.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Pressure, Jeremy Corbyn Tries to Recalibrate His Image in U.K.", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn, the leftist leader of Britain\u2019s languishing Labour Party, went on a news media onslaught on Tuesday aimed at re-energizing his image and rebranding himself as more of a populist to try to allay fears among even his allies that the party is headed for a disastrous defeat in the next election.In a set of television and radio interviews and a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Corbyn shifted his position on immigration to Britain from the European Union, saying he was not wedded to freedom of movement for European Union citizens.Instead, he said, he wants to end the exploitation of low-skilled foreign workers from the bloc and to promote local hiring, which would \u201cprobably\u201d reduce the number of immigrants.Mr. Corbyn, who always seemed a reluctant supporter of the official Labour policy to remain in the European Union, declared that \u201cBritain can be better off after Brexit.\u201dAnd in a reach toward a leftist populism, he said Tuesday morning that he would like to see a cap on how much people can earn.Inequality in income is getting worse in Britain, he said, something that cannot continue \u201cif we want to live in a more egalitarian society.\u201d He added, \u201cI would like there to be some kind of high earnings cap, quite honestly.\u201dHe was \u201cnot wedded to a figure,\u201d he told the BBC, but he said, \u201cLet\u2019s look at it.\u201dHe said he feared that, otherwise, Britain after a departure from the European Union might become a \u201cgrossly unequal, bargain-basement economy on the shores of Europe.\u201dMr. Corbyn, who earns about 138,000 pounds, or about $168,000, a year, later told Sky News that he expected any maximum wage to be \u201csomewhat higher than that.\u201dLater in the day, Mr. Corbyn backtracked, suggesting instead that inequality could be reduced by increasing income tax for the highly paid and by giving companies that reduce pay differentials lower corporate tax.With Labour trailing the governing Conservatives in opinion polls, and the Liberal Democrats coming out strongly against leaving the bloc, Mr. Corbyn is trying to reach out to traditional Labour voters who are angry about job losses and low wages and who voted for a British exit from the bloc and for the U.K. Independence Party, which favors strict limits on immigration.\u201cLet\u2019s suppose we are not having a snap election,\u201d Mr. McCluskey said. \u201cIt buys into this question of what happens if we get to 2019 and opinion polls are still awful. The truth is, everybody would examine that situation, including Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. These two are not egomaniacs; they are not desperate to cling on to power for power\u2019s sake.\u201dMr. McCluskey later said Mr. Corbyn had his \u201cfull support,\u201d but the damage was done.Superficially, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s position has stabilized since last year, when an open feud with more centrist lawmakers culminated in the unsuccessful challenge to his leadership.Since that debacle, from which Mr. Corbyn emerged with an increased mandate from party members and supporters, his many Labour Party critics in Parliament have pulled back from outright confrontation, aware that they risked being blamed for causing poor poll ratings by provoking internal divisions.But the crisis within the party has not gone away, especially given fears that many Labour legislators could lose their seats in the next election. Internal critics are biding their time, with many devoting their political energies to working on important parliamentary committees.They hope that, with Labour\u2019s poll ratings poor, the tide will eventually turn against their leader, and that Mr. McCluskey might lose his re-election bid to lead Unite.There is little sign of a revival of Labour support among voters, however, despite Mr. Corbyn\u2019s success in attracting a cohort of enthusiastic, often younger, party members. There has been no apparent recovery in Scotland, once a Labour Party heartland, where the party slipped into third place in last year\u2019s elections to the Scottish Parliament.While trying to react to concerns in the party that Labour needs to respond to voter anxiety about immigration, Mr. Corbyn still wants Britain to remain in the European single market.Mr. Corbyn, backing \u201cfair rules and reasonably managed migration,\u201d also suggested that the only limit on immigration controls was the need to balance them against trading with the single market.But membership in the single market usually means accepting freedom of movement of labor and capital, and the rulings of the European Court of Justice, as European leaders constantly emphasize. That is widely assumed to make limits on immigration and access to the single market incompatible.Mr. Nuttall told the BBC on Tuesday that Mr. Corbyn \u201cseems all over the place\u201d and was \u201csaying that Labour isn\u2019t wedded to free movement \u2014 but then says we will bargain that to have access to the single market.\u201dMr. Corbyn\u2019s speech was intended to emphasize his shift on migration, but his comments on a wage cap dominated coverage on Tuesday.\u201cGiven that Mr. Corbyn could not put a rough number on where the cap should be \u2014 other than confirming it would not affect his own salary \u2014 suggests he has not properly thought this proposal through,\u201d Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a London-based free-market research institute, said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joyce Appleby, Historian of Capitalism and American Identity, Is Dead at 87", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byJoyce Appleby, a distinguished historian and author who argued that ideas about capitalism and liberty were fundamental in shaping the identity of early Americans, died on Dec. 23 at her home in Taos, N.M. She was 87.The cause was complications of pneumonia, her daughter, Ann Lansburgh Caylor, said.She was also a scholar of Thomas Jefferson and wrote a brief biography of him, published in 2003.Dr. Appleby was part of a generation of historians who examined the ideologies and beliefs that animated the American Revolution. These scholars took seriously the ideas of the founding generation, breaking with Progressive Era historians like Charles A. Beard, who had dismissed revolutionary ideas as rhetorical cover for the founders\u2019 economic interests. But the scholars were not united in their interpretation.Following a path laid by Caroline Robbins, historians like Bernard Bailyn and Gordon S. Wood emphasized civic republicanism, a set of beliefs that focused on the threat of power to liberty and the need to put the common good above personal self-interest. They traced the Americans\u2019 revolutionary beliefs to the so-called radical Whigs of 17th-century England, thinkers like Algernon Sidney and James Harrington, who feared a slide toward despotism.Dr. Appleby challenged this view.\u201cClassical republicanism involved several propositions: that change generally brought degeneration, or worse, and that history pointed to the instability of all political orders. Civic virtue, where leaders put the common good above their own interests, formed the only bulwark against decay.\u201dJohn Locke and Adam Smith had as much influence on founders like Jefferson as the radical Whigs \u2014 if not more, she said. In her view, the revolutionaries believed that the public good would arise out of the harmonious pursuit of private interests in a market economy.\u201cFor me, liberalism had entered American consciousness as a potent brew blended from 17th-century entrepreneurial attitudes and the Enlightenment\u2019s endorsement of liberty and reason,\u201d Dr. Appleby said in the 2012 lecture. \u201cBecause nature had endowed human beings with the capacity to think for themselves and act on their own behalf, representative government seemed the perfect fit for them.\u201cRather than classical republicanism\u2019s fixation on social traumas, liberalism was optimistic, moving forward with the rational, self-improving individual who was endowed with natural rights to be exercised in a widened ambit of freedom.\u201dThe debate between liberalism and republicanism, especially active in the 1970s, eventually subsided. A new generation of social historians analyzed the concerns of marginalized groups \u2014 workers, women, free and enslaved African-Americans, and Native Americans, among others. Later still, a new cohort of scholars, influenced by postmodernism and cultural studies, looked at how human consciousness is shaped by language.They agreed that claims of the \u201cabsolute character\u201d of scientific truth, and the supposed triumph of Enlightenment reason, needed to be challenged. But they argued that some thinkers had gone too far in arguing that there can be no historical truth at all, only opinion, ideology or myth.The notion of truth, they argued, makes possible science itself, as well as the self-criticism necessary for democratic society. They turned to 19th-century American thinkers like John Dewey and Charles Sanders Peirce to argue for \u201cpragmatic realism\u201d \u2014 for history that is aware of philosophy but that is also grounded in empirical data.Dr. Appleby was born Joyce Oldham on April 9, 1929, in Omaha, the youngest of three children of Junius G. Oldham and the former Edith G. Cash. Her father, a World War I veteran and a salesman for the United States Gypsum Corporation, came from a Democratic family; his father had been a friend of William Jennings Bryan. Her mother, a homemaker, was the daughter of a Republican land speculator.She eventually enrolled in a Ph.D. program at what is now Claremont Graduate University \u2014 because it was close by \u2014 and set about studying the impact of American nation-building on French and English politics early in the French Revolution. \u201cIt was a topic I could handle from Escondido, Calif., after two weeks of document-gathering in the East,\u201d she recalled.Her first marriage, to the art historian Mark Lansburgh Jr., ended in divorce. Her second husband, Andrew Bell Appleby, a scholar of British social history, died in 1980. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two sons, Mark Lansburgh and Frank Bell Appleby, and four grandchildren.\u201cBecause it affected access to both wealth and power, its success provoked the outrage of successive groups of moralists, aesthetes and traditionalists.

{"Headline": "Trump Injects High Risk Into Relations With China", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBEIJING \u2014 For China, President Trump\u2019s scrapping of the American-brokered Pacific trade agreement is a chance to extend Beijing\u2019s economic and political influence. And it is an opportunity to deepen ties with its neighbors in Asia.But with a cooling economy at home and a looming leadership shake-up, the last thing President Xi Jinping wants is a trade war, though officials are girding for that possibility. Rather, China\u2019s leaders crave stability and predictability.Early signs indicate they may not get their wish. The Chinese fear that if Mr. Trump was willing to toss aside years of delicate negotiations with allies and decades of American trade policy, he could also go his own way on issues he has staked out with Beijing, including Taiwan and the South China Sea.As if to bolster that point, on Monday \u2014 the same day that Mr. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement \u2014 his spokesman said the United States would prevent China from accessing islands it claims in the South China Sea, a threat that one nationalist Chinese newspaper had already warned would mean war.\u201cThis shows that Trump might act on his words,\u201d Deng Yuwen, a public affairs commentator in Beijing, said in an interview. \u201cWith previous presidents, their election promises weren\u2019t taken so seriously.\u201dHe added, \u201cThat means China must take his other warnings more seriously, especially about the South China Sea and Taiwan.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s goal in squelching the trade agreement was to protect American jobs and businesses. His trade officials have argued that the deal does not do enough to help the United States or to contain China, which was not invited to join the agreement.But in killing an agreement designed to limit China\u2019s vast economic reach in Asia and anchor America\u2019s presence in the world\u2019s fastest growing region, analysts said, Mr. Trump created a void that President Xi was already practicing to fill.Only last week, Mr. Xi was trying on the mantle of global leadership at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, suggesting that with the United States in retreat, China was prepared to step up as a champion of free trade and protector of the global environment.Mr. Xi has kept China\u2019s economy behind high walls, and China remains the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, but inconsistencies have never ruffled the president.\u201cThis is indeed a big win for China in the struggle for global leadership,\u201d said Zhang Baohui, director of the center for Asia Pacific studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. \u201cTrump is surrendering this opportunity to prove the continuing relevance of American primacy.\u201dThe death of the trade agreement is likely to accelerate Beijing\u2019s push for its alternative trade agreement, the China-centered Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.That agreement would exclude the United States and would reduce or eliminate tariffs on trade among China, Southeast Asian nations, Australia, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. It includes few of the features of T.P.P. that would have been most awkward for Beijing, such as protections for independent labor unions and the environment, and requirements that state-owned enterprises behave more like commercial enterprises.The agreement has stalled on rifts between Southeast Asian nations and the others, but Thailand\u2019s minister of commerce, Apiradi Tantraporn, said Monday that the talks \u201care expected to be expedited\u201d without the T.P.P.But the end of the T.P.P. will not be Mr. Trump\u2019s last word on trade with China.His trade officials say they expect greater access to the Chinese market in exchange for the easy access Chinese goods have to the United States. And they appear prepared to risk a trade war, an expanding tit-for-tat contest of tariffs and other trade restrictions, to get it.Mr. Trump\u2019s trade officials have threatened to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods, starting with heavily subsidized products such as steel and aluminum, imported into the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s a little weird that we have very low tariffs and China has very high tariffs,\u201d Wilbur Ross, the nominee for commerce secretary, said at his Senate confirmation hearing last week.While Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers say that China has more to lose than the United States in a trade war, Chinese officials told visiting American businessmen last week that Beijing was prepared. They had developed lists of punitive options they would take against the United States if Washington took the initiative, they said.\u201cThe signals are very clear: If this is going to be a trade war, China will reduce imports of American aircraft from Boeing and agricultural products,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, director of American studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cWe can turn to Europe, Australia and Canada for those products. And we know that 20 to 30 of the states in the United States with big agricultural lobbies and Boeing plants will be putting pressure on Congress.\u201dA long-serving American trade expert in China agreed, saying China was prepared to go to the mat.\u201cTrump\u2019s trade team would be wise to shelve \u2018The Art of the Deal\u2019 and focus on the \u2018Art of War,\u2019 if they really want to know what\u2019s ahead in U.S.-China trade relations,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a managing partner of the Beijing office of the law firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton who has worked in China for 19 years. \u201cChina views Trump as a paper tiger that will likely back down on the complicated, thorny issues that are not negotiable. The Chinese also know that Trump won\u2019t risk a trade war lest the business community will be up in arms.\u201dOthers, though, detect anxiety, and read China\u2019s outward confidence as bluster. Bilahari Kausikan, ambassador at large for Singapore, said China had \u201ca real insecurity about a trade war.\u201dBoth sides are likely to lose, he said, but China stands to lose more \u201csince the U.S. domestic political order is not at stake in the same way as the Chinese Communist Party rule may be at stake.\u201dThe next few months, as Mr. Xi focuses on choosing new members of the ruling Standing Committee for his second five-year term, will be a particularly tense political period, and economic instability is the last thing he needs. Similarly, he will try at all costs to appear strong to his domestic, nationalistic audience in the face of challenges from Mr. Trump on Taiwan and the South China Sea.Mr. Trump has suggested that the One China policy, under which the United States recognizes the government of Beijing and not Taiwan, is not sacrosanct, a major concern for Mr. Xi.\u201cShort term, it will almost certainly give the Chinese government a boost in its public support,\u201d Dr. Pei said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt helps Xi, because whenever there is such pressure from outside, Chinese officials tend to rally around the top leader.\u201dMr. Trump has also threatened China on control of territory it claims in the South China Sea. The comments by Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, on Monday echoed those made by his nominee for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, at his Senate confirmation hearing.While Mr. Trump has not explained how he will keep China off islands where it has built airstrips and installed weapons, the comments by his appointees suggest the possibility of an American blockade. While Mr. Obama tried unsuccessfully to leverage American allies in the region to compel China to back down, Mr. Trump seems willing to abandon them and face China on his own.That go-it-alone attitude has raised alarms at the Pentagon and among American Navy experts, who said such a blockade would be tantamount to war. The idea has also alarmed America\u2019s allies.Australia, Washington\u2019s staunchest ally in the Asia Pacific region, would not participate in such a venture, its defense officials said, adding that a blockade could not be successful and could serve to persuade disenchanted American friends in the Asia Pacific to pivot toward China.With Mr. Trump portending divisive action on many fronts, Mr. Xi was calm and prepared, his foreign minister, Wang Yi, suggested.\u201cSerene under the tumultuous clouds,\u201d Mr. Wang said, quoting a line from a poem by Mao Zedong, the founder of Communist China.No one knows how long that will be the case.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai, and Poypiti Amatatham from Bangkok.Advertisement"}

S\u00e9rgio Bermudes, a lawyer for Mr. Batista, said his client was out of the country, either in the United States or the Cayman Islands, to seek access to blocked bank accounts.The arrest warrant could signal a new phase in the downfall of Mr. Batista, 60, whose global prominence had long been associated with Brazil\u2019s booming economy. His personal wealth reached $34.5 billion as recently as 2012, but his fortunes, and those of Brazil, crashed amid falling global commodities prices.\u201cEike was a symbol of that moment of nationalist exaltation when the stars seemed to be aligning for Brazil,\u201d said Gerson Moraes, a professor of ethics at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in the Brazilian city of Campinas. \u201cBut it turns out he was involved in the same old rotten schemes involving large corporations and the Brazilian state.\u201dThe brash industrialist, who had publicly proclaimed that he would become the world\u2019s richest man, assembled a sprawling empire including mines, offshore oil fields, a port complex and even Rio\u2019s landmark Hotel Gl\u00f3ria. Mr. Batista cultivated close ties with government officials, and he received more than $4 billion in loans and investments from the national development bank.In 2008, Mr. Batista raised more than $3.6 billion in a public offering for his oil company, OGX, at a time when Brazil\u2019s economic prospects looked bright. But the company sought bankruptcy protection in 2013 after producing a small fraction of the oil it had promised.This is not the first time Mr. Batista has faced legal troubles. In 2014, he went on trial on charges of insider trading and stock market manipulation, but the case was suspended in February 2015 after the judge presiding over his trial was filmed driving Mr. Batista\u2019s seized Porsche.Mr. Cabral, who governed the state from 2007 to 2014, was arrested in November on suspicion that he and his wife pocketed millions of dollars in bribes from public works contracts.Federal prosecutors said in a statement that Mr. Batista had paid $16.5 million to Mr. Cabral in 2011 through offshore accounts in Panama and Uruguay. The tycoon sought to disguise the bribe as a deal involving the sale of a gold mine, the prosecutors said. \u201cIn a sophisticated way, Eike Batista repeatedly used the simulation of legal dealings for the payment and concealment of illicit amounts of money,\u201d they said.The Federal Police, Brazil\u2019s equivalent of the F.B.I., said in a statement that 80 officers had carried out nine arrest warrants, taken four people in for questioning and performed 22 searches in Thursday\u2019s operation. Among those arrested was Fl\u00e1vio Godinho, a former executive at one of Mr. Batista\u2019s companies who now holds a senior executive post at Flamengo, a soccer club in Rio.The police also said that they had discovered on Thursday that Mr. Batista, who holds dual citizenship in Brazil and Germany, may have traveled to New York on the evening of Jan. 24 on an American Airlines flight using his German passport.Mr. Bermudes said that a judge in Rio had issued a request for his client\u2019s arrest on Jan. 13, raising questions as to how Mr. Batista had been able to leave the country if the authorities were planning to apprehend him.\u201cThe police are in full contact with Interpol to locate him, to verify if he effectively arrived in New York,\u201d Tacio Muzzi, an officer with the Federal Police, told journalists. \u201cIt still can\u2019t be categorically affirmed that there was the intention to flee. This is being rigorously investigated.\u201dJos\u00e9 Vagos, a federal prosecutor, said investigators had yet to determine why Mr. Batista had bribed Mr. Cabral, who held sway for years over important decisions regarding infrastructure projects in Rio, where much of Brazil\u2019s oil industry is based.Another prosecutor, Eduardo El Hage, said Mr. Batista was suspected of crimes including bribery and money laundering.Dom Phillips reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Simon Romero from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

{"Headline": "How to Interpret the Trump Administration\u2019s Latest Signals on Mexico", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byTax PolicyThe White House floated an idea on Thursday afternoon that, in initial reports, sounded like a major tariff on Mexican imports \u2014 something that would have gone a long way toward unwinding one of the United States\u2019 deepest economic relationships.The reality of what Sean Spicer, the press secretary, suggested is a lot less dramatic. But it sends important signals about how people in the Trump administration are thinking about overhauling the tax code \u2014 and how they\u2019re thinking about claiming victory on some of the president\u2019s audacious campaign promises. It is a sign of just how fluid things are in this moment when so much of American public policy around taxes, trade and diplomacy is in flux.Mr. Spicer suggested a way the administration could accomplish President Trump\u2019s goal of building a border wall paid for by Mexico. A 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico would do the trick, Mr. Spicer said.That might sound as if Mr. Spicer was proposing that the United States slap a new tariff meant to punish Mexican exporters. Such a move would result in higher prices for American consumers, create profound challenges for industries with supply chains that span the border, and possibly prompt the collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement.But you get a different picture when you put Mr. Spicer\u2019s words into the context of the rapidly evolving debate in Washington around overhauling corporate taxation.House Republicans see the policy as a way to reshape the tax code to give businesses less incentive to move operations overseas while also generating revenue they can use to reduce tax rates.Opponents of the plan, which include major retailers, are skeptical. Among the risks: It could drive up consumer prices for all sorts of imported goods, from German cars to Mexican avocados, if the dollar does not rise as much as economists predict. And the policy may violate World Trade Organization rules, which could tangle it up in legal proceedings.But that Mr. Spicer was floating that plan as a way to fulfill Mr. Trump\u2019s Mexican wall promises is interesting on two levels.On Thursday, Mr. Spicer was explicitly suggesting that a border tax could be used to pay for a border wall. Referring to the tax plan, he said, \u201cThis is something that we\u2019ve been in close contact with both houses in moving forward.\u201dThe border adjustment strategy has plenty of enemies, and there\u2019s no certainty that it will become part of a tax overhaul bill. But the latest tea leaves suggest the administration is more open to it than it may have seemed.The second lesson from the incident is that the Trump administration looks inclined to be flexible in finding ways to satisfy campaign promises without doing major damage to the economy or international relations.Thursday was one of the roughest days for relations between the United States and Mexico in some time, with the cancellation of a planned visit by President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and tough talk from Mexico City, which adamantly refuses to pay for an expansion of a border wall.But Mr. Spicer\u2019s comments, which he later said were meant more to offer an example than a concrete policy proposal, suggest that the administration will look for creative ways to proclaim victory on Trumpian promises. In other words, he will proclaim that Mexico has paid for the wall as promised \u2014 even if the Mexican government never literally cuts a check to pay for new concrete.Advocates of the border adjustment tax have been fond of it because it would produce enough revenue to allow a deep reduction in tax rates. But money is fungible. So if the president can claim political victory by stating that the revenue from Mexican imports is going to pay for the wall, no one is going to stop him.It is a messy time for the making of economic policy. The Trump campaign was notoriously light on policy detail, and the Trump administration still has many key vacancies in economic policy jobs. Nominees for Treasury secretary, commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative have not yet been confirmed, and key jobs on the Council of Economic Advisers and most undersecretary and assistant secretary jobs remain unfilled.So the gaps are still being filled in on what the Trump administration economic policy will really mean in practice. The way to read the latest Mexico comments is as one more hint.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes He Did: Jonathan Chait Argues That Obama\u2019s Accomplishments Will Survive", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.If everything had gone according to plan, these would be valedictory days for President Obama. With the economy humming if not roaring and his approval ratings higher than they were through most of his time in office, Obama expected to take a victory lap, map out his memoir and hand the reins to a like-minded successor to build on his accomplishments.But everything did not go according to plan, and instead he finds himself bequeathing his record to Donald J. Trump, a man he disdains, who was elected in large part on a promise to take a sledgehammer to anything with Obama\u2019s name on it. Obama is left trying to explain the debacle, salvage what he can from the wreckage and make his case to history that his was still a transformative presidency.In his corner will be Jonathan Chait of New York magazine and one of the country\u2019s leading progressive voices, who has come to Obama\u2019s defense with \u201cAudacity,\u201d a timely, trenchant and relentlessly argued book presenting the 44th president in terms that he himself would approve. Not only did Obama change America for the better, Chait writes, he also cemented a new policy infrastructure that will resist Trump\u2019s efforts to tear it down.To be sure, this was a book written largely before the November election with the evident expectation that Hillary Clinton would be preparing to move into the Oval Office, and it cannot help reading that way. After Trump shocked the world with his improbable Electoral College victory, Chait tweaked the text to address the upheaval in American politics. But he did not change his fundamental conclusion or buy into the notion that Clinton\u2019s defeat represented a harsh verdict on Obama.\u201cShe lost despite, not because of, her association with the popular sitting president,\u201d Chait writes. Republicans nurtured the opposite conclusion to justify a demolition of Obama\u2019s new foundation. \u201cThe myth of repudiation had a clear purpose: to make it appear both fair and inevitable that the conquering Republican government would destroy Obama\u2019s legacy.\u201dBut, he adds, \u201cthe fatalistic conclusion that Trump can erase Obama\u2019s achievements is overstated \u2014 perhaps even completely false.\u201d Chait\u2019s point is that \u201cgood ideas advance in fits and stops\u201d and that Obama\u2019s presidency \u201crepresented one of those great bursts\u201d that will not simply be erased despite momentary setbacks.Whether that is the case remains to be seen. Certainly in facing the judgment of history, much of the record that Obama will point to is beyond any Republican effort to reverse. He helped pull the country back from the brink of the economic abyss, saved the auto industry, ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden and broke the ultimate racial barrier.Yet despite Chait\u2019s confidence in the durability of Obama\u2019s legacy, other elements of his agenda appear to be in jeopardy. Obama\u2019s health care program, efforts to ease immigration rules, crackdowns on emissions by coal-fired plants, regulations on Wall Street, labor rules intended to improve worker conditions and a free-trade pact with Asia all seem unlikely to survive, at least in the form he prefers. The fates of his nuclear agreement with Iran and his diplomatic opening to Cuba are at least in question, although Trump may ultimately find it harder than he thinks to unravel either.Other presidents, of course, have been followed by successors of the other party who in the end sustained their signal accomplishments. Dwight Eisenhower did not undo Harry Truman\u2019s record, nor did John Kennedy undo Eisenhower\u2019s. Richard Nixon, given the chance, left Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society largely in place. Even Obama preserved many of George W. Bush\u2019s achievements, including the vast bulk of his tax cuts, his Medicare expansion, his AIDS-fighting program in Africa and his homeland security architecture.Trump, on the other hand, is more mercurial, so it is harder to predict how far he will go to wipe out Obama\u2019s imprint on the country. He has sent conflicting signals since the election about his commitment to following through on certain campaign promises while Obama has quietly tried to nudge him away from a radical change.It could well be that Trump unintentionally helps his predecessor\u2019s case for history as a point of contrast \u2014 that whatever Obama\u2019s leadership flaws, his calm, no-drama performance will look better in hindsight to many Americans. At the same time, it raises the question that if Obama was so successful, why do so many Americans feel so dissatisfied and left behind? How could an America that twice chose Barack Obama decide to replace him with Donald Trump?Beyond noting Clinton\u2019s popular-vote margin, Chait, like others on the left, points to willful distortion by Republicans determined from the start to tear down Obama and cynical news media that were complicit in that strategy. But he also faults liberals who were too willing to flay a president they agreed with because he failed to achieve some impossible standard of progressive perfection.Indeed, Chait\u2019s book seems more like an argument with the left than with the right. \u201cThe yawning chasm between the scale of Obama\u2019s achievements and the mood of his supporters presents one of the mysteries of the era,\u201d he writes. \u201cIts resolution also helps us understand how to judge the Obama presidency. What would a successful presidency even look like? Would Democrats recognize one if they saw it?\u201dWhile Chait agrees that \u201cObama has not done the job perfectly,\u201d he echoes Michael Grunwald in \u201cThe New New Deal\u201d by making the case that his programs will have long-lasting if often overlooked impact. Obama\u2019s fiscal stimulus package, for instance, was \u201ca gigantic success,\u201d not only by helping stanch job losses but also by investing in the future in the form of renewable energy, transportation infrastructure and scientific research.Likewise, Obama\u2019s health care program covered 20 million more Americans while also producing an \u201ceconomic miracle,\u201d Chait says, in slowing the rise of medical costs even though premiums for some continued to rise sharply. Obama\u2019s green energy revolution, he adds, has already brought down climate change emissions and \u201cchanged the economic calculus irreversibly.\u201d While Obama\u2019s foreign policy may not have transformed the world, Chait concludes, he made incremental progress and avoided catastrophic mistakes.For disenchanted Obama supporters, this appraisal may seem like a surprise. The Obama who leaves office has traveled a long way from the hope-and-change moment eight years ago. In his early days, he was likened to George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Kennedy, even Ronald Reagan. When things turned dark, he was compared unfavorably with Johnson, Jimmy Carter, even George W. Bush.\u201cThe various theories of disconsolate liberals all suffer from a failure to compare Obama with any plausible baseline,\u201d Chait says. \u201cInstead they compare Obama with an imaginary president \u2014 either an imaginary Obama or a fantasy version of a past president.\u201dNow he will be compared with his successor, and that is a comparison Chait thinks favors Obama. \u201cTrump is the poisoned chalice of a failed ideology,\u201d he writes. \u201cObama, not Trump, is destined to supply the model for American governance in the decades to come.\u201dChait\u2019s argument probably will not persuade many on the right, who still see a president who expanded the size and reach of government at home while undercutting American authority abroad. But it may encourage those on the left and in the middle to come around again to a president they once believed in.For Obama, that may be enough for now. Deprived of the valediction he had sought in November, Obama may want to keep a copy of Chait\u2019s volume on the night stand in his new home in Washington\u2019s Kalorama neighborhood.Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The Times, is the author of \u201cObama: The Call of History,\u201d to be published this spring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trudeau Hits the Road, and Crowds and Questions Follow", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byHis decision to hang around with Canadian voters and schoolchildren instead of the high and mighty comes as Mr. Trudeau\u2019s image as a nothing-to-hide champion of the middle class is showing a few dents.Several polls show that Mr. Trudeau remains very popular, but even so, his January road show has all the earmarks of a campaign to reconnect with voters. At the first few stops, it has also shown Mr. Trudeau practicing politics without a safety net.The large crowds he draws have generally been friendly, but there have also been tears, anger and pointed questions, including some for which Mr. Trudeau acknowledges he does not have good answers.Above all, there has been keen interest.The setting booked for Mr. Trudeau\u2019s appearance in Peterborough, Ontario, last Friday was the Evinrude Centre, a cavernous banquet hall attached to a hockey rink complex. Even so, it was filled to its legal capacity well before Mr. Trudeau arrived, and organizers had to start turning people away. Several dozen latecomers stood outside in the biting cold to listen to the proceedings on loudspeakers.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s town-hall-style event in London, Ontario, later that day had to be relocated three times to successively larger sites, and people were still shut out. And his appearance in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Monday was eventually moved to a 3,000-seat arena.The unemployment rate in Peterborough, a city of 74,600 in a popular vacation area about an hour northeast of Toronto, is unusually low right now at 4.5 percent. But many of its traditional large industrial employers have either cut payrolls or moved work elsewhere since Canada signed free trade agreements with the United States and Mexico.A university, a college, government and health care employment and Peterborough\u2019s growing popularity with retirees have helped offset the city\u2019s lost manufacturing jobs. But a sense of economic unease was still evident in the questions Mr. Trudeau fielded from his audience.He got an earful, for instance, about steep rises in electricity bills, even though the province of Ontario sets the rates, not the national government. One woman, who said she was a single mother and spoke on the verge of tears, produced a recent monthly bill for 1,085 Canadian dollars. Cries of \u201cshame, shame, shame\u201d echoed through the hall.Standing in front of an oversize Canadian flag with the sleeves of his light-blue dress shirt rolled up and the top button undone behind his necktie, Mr. Trudeau acknowledged that many Canadians feel squeezed financially.\u201cWe are facing a big challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government should be helping you, not harming you.\u201dIn Halifax on Monday, he heard from voters about another looming economic worry: a Trump administration in Washington that dislikes free trade agreements and has hinted at new border taxes on imports from Canada. That could be devastating for Canada\u2019s export-dependent economy, especially its auto industry, which has been integrated with American factories since 1965.Mr. Trudeau said that he did not plan to change Canada\u2019s course to suit Mr. Trump, but he avoided criticizing the incoming president.\u201cWe both got elected on a commitment to help the middle class, and we\u2019re going to be able to find common ground on doing the kinds of things that will help ordinary families right across the continent,\u201d he said.Mr. Trudeau was challenged on a variety of issues, including Canada\u2019s official policy of English and French bilingualism, water problems in indigenous communities, the country\u2019s electoral system and immigration \u2014 the last from someone who wanted more refugees admitted more quickly.Conspicuously, no one in the crowd asked about the fund-raisers, and references to the vacation with the Aga Khan were limited to mild heckling from two middle-aged men at the back of the room. But those matters continue to dominate news coverage in Canada, and they are what the reporters covering Mr. Trudeau\u2019s tour are asking him about.Once Mr. Trudeau had posed for his last selfie and lifted up the last baby at the Peterborough stop, several attendees said they were pleased with the event, including some who had questions about certain policies.\u201cI really enjoyed listening to Mr. Trudeau, love the fact that he\u2019s very accessible to us. That\u2019s the big thing,\u201d said Laura Scaife, who had hoped to ask the prime minister to give Canada\u2019s provinces more money for health care. \u201cBut he does have a tendency to wander just a bit. I wish his answers had been a bit shorter, so that more people could ask questions.\u201dAfter the public event came a short news conference and a brief session with volunteers; then Mr. Trudeau waved goodbye. A crew took to the stage to fold up the giant flag, and the prime minister\u2019s caravan of seven black sport utility vehicles and vans set off for the next stop.Advertisement"}

Barra from G.M., Mark Fields of Ford and Sergio Marchionne from Fiat Chrysler.It is a provocative challenge for the Detroit companies, which have each added more than 25,000 jobs in the United States since the recession, when auto sales collapsed, and G.M. and Chrysler both went bankrupt and needed government bailouts to survive.But with the American market coming off a record sales year of 17.5 million vehicles and car companies reporting big profits, the Detroit executives sounded eager to participate in the Trump administration\u2019s pro-business agenda.A look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.After the meeting, Mr. Fields said Ford was excited to participate in \u201ca renaissance in American manufacturing,\u201d and Ms. Barra said the industry could benefit from cooperating with Washington.\u201cThere\u2019s a large opportunity in working together as an industry with the government,\u201d she said.Mr. Marchionne said in a statement, \u201cWe look forward to working with President Trump and members of Congress to strengthen American manufacturing.\u201dThe meeting was notable in that foreign automakers such as Toyota and Honda were not invited, although factories owned by European and Asian companies account for about 40 percent of the vehicles assembled in the United States.It also left open the question of how much more production capacity G.M., Ford and Fiat Chrysler can effectively add in the United States \u2014 particularly if consumer demand levels off or drops.While the Detroit companies have significantly increased employment since 2009, the resurgence came only after extensive restructuring had shuttered dozens of excess plants to cut costs.In his remarks just before the meeting, the president said automakers were \u201cnot being singled out\u201d in his efforts to increase jobs in the United States and prevent more American investment in other countries.Rather, he promised to change the prevailing business climate in the United States \u201cfrom truly inhospitable to extremely hospitable,\u201d and to streamline the regulatory approval process for new manufacturing operations.Automakers in general have been supportive of less stringent fuel-economy rules than were enacted under the Obama administration.

{"Headline": "For Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s Leader, Revival of Keystone XL Upsets a Balancing Act", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byThe move is likely to complicate a delicate balancing act Mr. Trudeau has been trying to keep up: He has long maintained that Canada needs to develop its energy industry, but he also stands for aggressively cutting the country\u2019s carbon emissions.Now, Mr. Trump has put Keystone XL back on the table, and with it the prospect of significantly increased oil production and carbon emissions, upending Canada\u2019s climate calculus.\u201cThe federal government now has to be able to demonstrate that its climate plan is still relevant with increased oil-sands production,\u201d said Simon Dyer, the regional director for Alberta at the Pembina Institute, an environmental group that accepts Mr. Trudeau\u2019s argument that the oil sands are vital to the economy. \u201cWhen you start to stack up the potential for increased production from increased pipeline capacity, it strains credibility that oil-sands emissions targets will be met.\u201dDennis McConaghy, a former executive at TransCanada, the company that proposed Keystone XL, said he welcomed both Mr. Trump\u2019s move and Mr. Trudeau\u2019s endorsement of the project. But he agreed with Mr. Dyer that building the pipeline might make it impossible for the government to meet its emissions targets.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s cross-country tour of town-hall-style meetings this month has shown how tricky the balancing act can be.\u201cYou can\u2019t make a choice between what\u2019s good for the environment and what\u2019s good for the economy,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told the crowd. \u201cWe can\u2019t shut down the oil sands tomorrow. We need to phase them out. We need to manage the transition off of our dependence on fossil fuels.\u201dThat suggestion that Mr. Trudeau wanted to \u201cphase out\u201d the oil sands quickly attracted angry attention from conservative politicians and talk-radio hosts in Alberta, and the context \u2014 that he was defending the oil industry \u2014 was largely lost.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s road show arrived on Tuesday in Calgary, a stronghold of the opposition Conservative Party where his reception was never likely to be warm. His remark in Ontario was soon thrown back at him. A man wearing an \u201cI Love Oil Sands\u201d T-shirt and a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap accused Mr. Trudeau of offering different messages about the energy industry in different parts of the country.\u201cYou are either a liar or you\u2019re confused,\u201d the man told him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m beginning to think it\u2019s both.\u201dThe usually imperturbableMr. Trudeau raised his voice as he replied: \u201cThe responsibility of any Canadian prime minister is to get our resources to market and, yes, that includes our oil-sands fossil fuels.\u201d Video of the exchange suggested that the crowd was divided about Mr. Trudeau\u2019s position.\u201cThere is a belief in the current government on the need to act on climate change,\u201d said Tim Gray, the executive director of Environmental Defense Canada. \u201cAnd they very much feel the way to do that was to get Alberta on side.\u201dReviving the pipeline project will not help, he said. \u201cThe old-school model is still dominating the discussion in the country, and people have latched on to this idea that pipelines need to be built,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cBut the world is passing us by.\u201dKeystone XL was originally planned to enter service around 2012. Some analysts say the market has changed since then, to the point that there may no longer be a compelling business case for building it.Oil production is quickly rebounding in the United States, threatening again to flood the domestic and international oil markets. Fuel prices at American pumps are relatively cheap without the pipeline.If Keystone XL is built \u2014 and many hurdles remain \u2014 the pipeline would deliver up to 830,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Canada and North Dakota to Steele City, Neb., where it would enter an existing piping network bound for the gulf refineries. With the American market already oversupplied, most of the additional oil from Canada would probably have to be re-exported in refined form to foreign markets, or would replace American crude that would then be exported.The project would create few permanent jobs, but it would generate thousands of short-term jobs in construction, which is why several powerful unions support the project.\u201cKeystone XL is just not a strategic artery anymore,\u201d said Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. \u201cIt\u2019s not crucial to the circulation of North American crude oil. It\u2019s become a focus of political partisanship, like the potted palm in the Jack Lemmon movie \u2018Mister Roberts.\u2019\u201dIn the end, a completed Keystone XL pipeline may prove to be little more than a favor to Canada, where several American oil companies have made huge investments in the oil sands fields.\u201cIn today\u2019s world, the Canadians need the pipeline to get their oil to the world market,\u201d said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy economist. \u201cBut it makes no difference to the United States.\u201dIan Austen reported from Ottawa, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Trump Go After Nafta With Tweezers or a Hammer?", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byTrade TalksIt was a deal that created a deeply intertwined economy stretching from the Arctic to Central America and a generation of mostly warm relations between the United States and its two neighbors.It has also contributed to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and added to deep-seated discontent in the communities that lost them. That, in turn, helped propel a sharp critic of the deal to the White House.So with Donald J. Trump in charge, what happens now to the North American Free Trade Agreement? It\u2019s one thing to assail it as the \u201cworst trade deal ever\u201d as the president did during the campaign. It\u2019s quite another to come up with an arrangement that is more advantageous to American workers and businesses.\u201cNafta is logically the first thing for us to deal with,\u201d said Wilbur Ross, the president\u2019s nominee to be commerce secretary, in his confirmation hearing. It will be, he said, a \u201cvery, very early topic in the administration.\u201dSo what might that actually mean? What can the president actually do, what benefits might be attained for the United States and what could go wrong?Trade experts say there really is room to make major change in the two-decade-old agreement. A renegotiation could well lead to a better deal for all three countries. But it will require the United States to make concessions that the Trump administration may be wary of offering.If not approached carefully, revamping an agreement that has created the economic underpinning of major industries would risk American jobs as well as higher prices for consumers. And the closer the Trump administration gets to blowing up the deal, the larger those risks loom.Before diving into what could go wrong \u2014 and right \u2014 as President Trump looks to rework Nafta, it\u2019s worth starting with the basics.What is Nafta?Mr. Bush\u2019s successor, Bill Clinton, was the one to push the North American Free Trade Agreement through a divided Congress. By 1994, the three countries were entwined in a trade deal that, in its 22 chapters covering 309 pages, lashed their economies together.It eliminated most tariffs on goods traded between the nations, and set in place processes to get rid of regulatory and other barriers. The idea was that over time a company in Ohio could do business with a firm in Ontario as easily as it did with one in Indiana.What have been its results?As the election showed, whether Nafta was a good thing for voters in the United States or a bad one continues to be argued. But there are some things most people who study these things can agree upon.The North American economy really does work as an integrated whole. United States exports to Mexico, for example, are now 3.5 times their 1993 level when adjusted for inflation. They have risen more than twice as fast as the overall economy. Trade between the United States and Canada has been pretty well balanced over time, but the United States has had about a $60 billion per year trade deficit with Mexico, importing more than it exports.One way to reconcile those two views: Nafta may have increased overall G.D.P. and average incomes in the United States \u2014 but at the same time contributed to the decline in well-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs that tended to be concentrated in certain cities and among certain groups of people, mostly blue-collar men.Can President Trump kill the deal?In theory, yes. But it would be a mess, particularly if he tried to do it right off the bat.That doesn\u2019t sound like what the Trump administration has cooked up. It\u2019s more likely to reopen the deal. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that we can renegotiate the deal that\u2019s both advantageous to us and advantageous to Mexico, that\u2019s a win-win for both countries,\u201d said Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, in his confirmation hearing.Will Canada and Mexico come to the table for a renegotiation?So what is the United States going to ask for?We don\u2019t know for sure, but some hints have emerged.If the required share of North American parts were increased \u2014 from its current 62.5 percent for many auto parts to 75 percent, for example \u2014 it would give an advantage to manufacturers in the United States and reduce competition with the low-wage countries of Asia.Another example of a possible United States priority: asking Canada and Mexico to be more liberal in allowing goods to be shipped into their countries with no taxes and little paperwork. (To be precise, asking them to raise the value of what would count as a \u201cde minimus\u201d shipment exempt from the usual customs process). That would be good news for American companies looking to sell into those countries.The United States has long complained that the tribunals that settle trade disputes among the three countries are stacked against U.S. interests, and it could seek changes.Those sure seem like perfectly normal things for trade deals to focus on.They are. But there was one more goal for the United States that Trump argued for during the campaign, and it would be a bigger source of friction if his negotiators chose to pursue it.Mr. Trump characterized the value-added tax that both Mexico and Canada have as unfair to U.S. companies. The tax is 16 percent in Mexico; when a Mexican firm exports goods to the United States, it receives a rebate for the tax it paid, and when a U.S. firm exports to Mexico, a comparable adjustment is added.The VAT is similar to a sales tax, and to the Mexican government, the Trump position will sound like the equivalent of Massachusetts demanding that it be able to sell its goods in Connecticut without a sales tax slapped on them.So if that issue ends up at the center of the negotiation, things could get rocky.But a deal should get done, right?Maybe. But keep in mind: This won\u2019t be a one-way street. Both Canada and Mexico expect concessions from the United States in return for concessions they make. And some of the things that the Mexican government most covets will rankle many Trump supporters.For example, Mexico wants better access to a program, widely enjoyed at the Canadian border, in which shippers that pass a security review are allowed to cross the border with a less intensive customs process (this is the international trade equivalent of the \u201cT.S.A. PreCheck\u201d security line at the airport).Mexico also seeks more favorable treatment for Mexican citizens with advanced skills seeking visas to work temporarily in the United States.Needless to say, making it easier for Mexican trucks and Mexican workers to get into the United States isn\u2019t exactly what Trump campaigned on. But that\u2019s the kind of concession that may be needed to get a trade deal.Is there a chance Nafta completely blows up?There is \u2014 though not necessarily in catastrophic fashion.Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, lays out a possibility in which the Trump administration does eventually withdraw from Nafta, but in a context in which it has worked out separate deals with Mexico and Canada that maintain most of the trade arrangements codified in Nafta.President Trump and his advisers have often spoken of a preference for bilateral deals instead of big multicountry trade deals. It is potentially a pathway for Trump to be able to proclaim that he ended a trade deal he assailed on the campaign trail, without wrecking the economy.Even that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be painless, however.\u201cIt would be like Humpty-Dumpty,\u201d Mr. Hufbauer said. \u201cThere will be firms and communities in the U.S. that will be adversely affected, that will close down if you disrupt these supply chains. That won\u2019t make for good newspaper coverage, and presumably the Trump team will want to avoid that.\u201dJust how urgent is renegotiating Nafta?Campaign promises aside, even some people who have been opposed to Nafta and other trade deals don\u2019t view this as a first-order priority. U.S. trade with Canada is reasonably well balanced, and the trade deficit with Mexico is smaller than that with some giant Asian economies.Robert E. Scott, the director of trade and manufacturing policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, sees more to be gained by rethinking the trade relationship between the United States and China, Japan, South Korea and even Germany. \u201cThose are accountable for 80 percent of trade-related job losses over the last 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, Nafta is not a top priority.\u201d\u201cThere are much bigger fish to fry,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate economist and author of numerous books on globalization and economic inequality. \u201cMore rights to bargain for workers, that\u2019s the part where Davos man is going to get stuck. The stark reality is that globalization has reduced the bargaining power of workers, and corporations have taken advantage of it.\u201dDavos is \u2014 at least rhetorically \u2014 consumed with worries about the shortcomings of globalization. About the deepening anxieties of the middle class in many developed economies. About the threat of trade protectionism and its attendant hit to economic growth. About the fear that robots are on the verge of sowing mass unemployment.It is a conversation fueled in part by fear: If the world is indeed in the throes of a populist insurrection, the pitchforks could do worse than to point here. The Davos elites have enjoyed outsize influence over economic policies in recent decades as a growing share of wealth has, perhaps not coincidentally, landed in the coffers of people with a need for bank accounts in the British Virgin Islands, while poor and middle-class households have seen their earnings stagnate and decline.Yet the solutions that have currency seem calculated to spare corporations and the wealthiest people from having to make any sacrifices at all, as if there is a way to be found to tilt the balance of inequality while those at the top hang on to everything they have.More entrepreneurialism, mindfulness training, education focused on the modern ways of technology: These are the sorts of items that tend to get discussed here as the response to the plight of those left behind by globalization. That perhaps private equity overseers should not be paid 1,000 times as much as teachers while availing themselves of tax breaks is thinking that gets little airing here.At a dinner on Monday evening as the forum got underway, Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization and development at Oxford University, celebrated the connectedness of the global economy and the technological advancements that have liberated humans from disease, poverty and the drudgery of manual labor.\u201cThere\u2019s never been a better time to be alive, and yet we feel so glum,\u201d Mr. Goldin said. \u201cSo many people feel anxious. So many people feel that this is one of the most dangerous times.\u201dHe denounced the frightened retreat from globalization manifest in Mr. Trump\u2019s threats of a trade war with China, and in Britain\u2019s abandonment of Europe, commonly known as Brexit.\u201cYou can\u2019t stop managing an entangled environment by disconnecting,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the fundamental mistake of Brexit, of Trump, and of so many others. We are not simply connected. We are entangled. Our lives, our destinies are intertwined. What happens in China, what happens in Indonesia, what happens in India, what happens across Europe, and what happens in North America, across Africa and Latin America will affect all of us in dramatic new ways. The idea that somehow we can forge our future in an insular way, even for the biggest countries like the U.S., is a fantasy.\u201dAnd yet, Mr. Goldin said, if the benefits of globalization are not spread more equitably, the world could be in for a replay of the Renaissance, an extraordinary period of scientific progress, commercial growth and artistic creativity in Europe that ultimately yielded popular resentment.The gold leaf landing on cathedrals was not bettering the lot of the peasantry. The spices coming in from Asia were too expensive for most. The Medici family that ruled Florence was sent packing by the mob. Intellectuals were persecuted and books burned.\u201cWe need to learn these historical lessons and realize that this is the most precious moment in human history,\u201d Mr. Goldin said. \u201cWe need to make the choices to ensure that globalization is sustainable, that connectivity is sustainable, that we deal with the intractable problems that are worrying people.\u201dBut Mr. Goldin\u2019s comments were merely the prelude to a conversation that was supposed to be about how to pull that off. The answers from the corporate executives who comprised a panel could be crudely boiled down to this: The people who have not benefited from globalization need to try harder to emulate those who have succeeded.Abidali Neemuchwala, the chief executive officer of Wipro, the global information technology and consulting company that hosted the event along with The Financial Times \u2014 and who last year earned some $1.8 million plus stock grants worth an additional $2 million or so \u2014 said working people would have to pursue training for the jobs of the future.\u201cPeople have to take more ownership of upgrading themselves on a continuous basis,\u201d he said.No one can reasonably argue against the merits of training (or entrepreneurialism for that matter). The jobs of the future have not yet been invented. New skills will be required to seize them. But nowhere in the discussion was there a mention of tax policy, or addressing the soaring costs of gaining higher education, or access to health care.At a panel on Wednesday morning, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, injected a rarely heard word into a conversation about the crisis for middle-class households: redistribution.\u201cThere are things that can be done,\u201d she said. \u201cIt probably means more redistribution than we have at the moment.\u201dFor years, economic inequality has ranked as one of the most discussed issues at Davos, both in the formal conference agenda and in the conversations that fill hallways and the private parties and dinners held throughout town. For years, little to nothing has changed.\u201cPeople talk about inequality, how it\u2019s a major problem, the greatest threat to globalization and the global economy,\u201d Mr. Stiglitz said. \u201cYou have to recognize that the way we have managed globalization has contributed significantly to inequality. But I have not yet heard a good conversation about what changes in globalization would address inequality.\u201dThat is not an accident, he surmised. Any sincere list would have to include items that involve transferring wealth and power from the sorts of people who come to Davos to ordinary workers via more progressive taxation, increased bargaining rights for labor unions, and greater protections for labor in general.Same as every other year, Davos is again plastered with the slogan of the World Economic Forum: \u201cCommitted to Improving the State of the World.\u201d But whatever improvements are supposed to be made, one can safely assume they will not conflict with those in attendance continuing to enjoy the state of the world as it is now, with canap\u00e9s and aged Bordeaux and private jets at the ready.Which means that the global populism insurrection is unlikely to lose momentum anytime soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Before He Takes Office, Trump Knocks Automakers on Their Heels", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Donald J. Trump has promised to change the way American automakers do business. Less than three weeks before his inauguration as president, he has already knocked the companies on their heels.In a stunning reversal, Ford Motor, the nation\u2019s second-largest automaker, said on Tuesday that it would scrap plans to build a small-car assembly plant in Mexico that Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized.Just a few hours earlier, Mr. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on cars made in Mexico by General Motors, the nation\u2019s largest automaker. His message forced the company to defend itself.Both developments indicate how Mr. Trump is having an enormous impact on how American car companies run their operations, even before he takes office. They also illustrate that one of Mr. Trump\u2019s particular points of criticism, manufacturing in Mexico, has become particularly sensitive.But the moves raise questions about how competitive the country\u2019s auto industry can be if its manufacturing options shrink in Mexico, and what the implications will be for consumers. For now, at least, some executives are praising Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plans.\u201cWe are encouraged by the pro-growth plans that President-elect Trump and the new Congress indicate they will pursue,\u201d Mark Fields, Ford\u2019s chief executive, said at an event on Tuesday.The decision by Ford to drop plans for a new plant in Mexico \u2014 what would have been a $1.6 billion investment \u2014 came at the same time the company announced it would add 700 jobs to build electric and hybrid vehicles at a plant in Flat Rock, Mich.The new Mexican factory was to build Ford Focus sedans currently manufactured at another Michigan plant near Detroit. Now the company will build those cars at an existing plant in Mexico.Ford officials said that the revised plans were tied to market conditions that have depressed small-car sales, and that they did not consult with the incoming Trump administration before making the decision.They did, though, tell Mr. Trump about the change just before the announcement. And on Tuesday, Mr. Fields made clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies were playing a role in the company\u2019s thinking. He added in an interview that the president-elect\u2019s emphasis on tax changes and cutting regulations should have an overall positive effect on automakers such as Ford.\u201cWe have a president-elect who has said very clearly that one of his first priorities is to grow the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should be music to our ears.\u201dFord has been a target of Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism since last spring, when he singled the company out during his campaign for planning to create jobs in Mexico instead of pushing employment in the United States. After the election, Ford dropped plans to move production of a Lincoln S.U.V. to Mexico from Kentucky. That move followed discussions between Mr. Trump and William C. Ford Jr., the company\u2019s chairman.\u201cIt was an embarrassment for them, and they said, \u2018Let\u2019s turn this thing around,\u2019\u201d Mr. Harbour said.\u201cGeneral Motors is sending Mexican made model Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across the border,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cMake in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\u201dA central tenet of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic platform has been to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which allows for the free flow of manufactured goods between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Instead, he favors tariffs of up to 35 percent on products made in Mexico and sold in America.Industry analysts have questioned whether automakers like G.M. and Ford can profitably build smaller vehicles in the United States instead of in Mexico, where wages rarely cross $10 an hour, compared with the $29 an hour earned by a majority of unionized American workers.For consumers, those higher wages could add up to higher sticker prices. And that could potentially reduce sales.But Mr. Trump is hardly backing off on his vow to scrap Nafta, and has found an unlikely ally in the powerful United Automobile Workers union, which represents hourly employees at G.M., Ford and Fiat Chrysler in the United States.While the U.A.W. leadership supported Mr. Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton, in the presidential election, the union has consistently attacked Nafta for encouraging car companies to invest in Mexico.The hatchback made by G.M. in Mexico is a version of its Cruze compact car produced primarily at a factory in Lordstown, Ohio.Sales of the Cruze, like many other passenger cars, have fallen in recent months because of low gas prices and shifting consumer demand toward more spacious sport utility vehicles. The Lordstown factory is among five American plants that G.M. will temporarily idle this month to reduce its growing inventories of slow-selling cars.G.M. officials declined to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter attack, other than to say in a statement that only a \u201csmall number\u201d of Cruze hatchbacks were built in Mexico for the American market.But G.M. has a large exposure to any potential changes looming on Nafta, having committed up to $5 billion in long-term investment in Mexico. Foreign car companies like Volkswagen and Toyota are also adding jobs and new products at their Mexican facilities.With Nafta under fire from the incoming administration, Ford, in particular, has tried to adapt.In a recent interview, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks, said the automaker was expecting changes in trade deals, and increasing its focus on expanding its manufacturing in the United States. \u201cThe bigger principle is we want to grow the U.S. economy,\u201d he said.On Tuesday, the company packaged a series of announcements on new electrified vehicles with a promise to invest $700 million in its Flat Rock assembly plants.The addition of 700 jobs at the plant will help it build a new fully electric S.U.V. to debut in 2020, as well as a new autonomous vehicle that has no steering wheel and operates entirely by computer.Mr. Fields, however, was more circumspect on why the company had dropped its plans for the new Mexican factory. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need it anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t need the capacity anymore given the demand for small cars.\u201dStill, the news about the Mexican plant and the new jobs in Michigan were conveyed directly to Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence before they were publicly announced.\u201cWe called the president-elect and the vice president-elect this morning and gave them the news,\u201d Mr. Fields said Tuesday. \u201cThey were very pleased, obviously, that we were making these investments in the U.S.\u201dBill Vlasic reported from Detroit and Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Troops Who Cleaned Up Radioactive Islands Can\u2019t Get Medical Care", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byRICHLAND, Wash. \u2014 When Tim Snider arrived on Enewetak Atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to clean up the fallout from dozens of nuclear tests on the ring of coral islands, Army officers immediately ordered him to put on a respirator and a bright yellow suit designed to guard against plutonium poisoning.A military film crew snapped photos and shot movies of Mr. Snider, a 20-year-old Air Force radiation technician, in the crisp new safety gear. Then he was ordered to give all the gear back. He spent the rest of his four-month stint on the islands wearing only cutoff shorts and a floppy sun hat.\u201cI never saw one of those suits again,\u201d Mr. Snider, now 58, said in an interview in his kitchen here as he thumbed a yellowing photo he still has from the 1979 shoot. \u201cIt was just propaganda.\u201dToday Mr. Snider has tumors on his ribs, spine and skull \u2014 which he thinks resulted from his work on the crew, in the largest nuclear cleanup ever undertaken by the United States military.Roughly 4,000 troops helped clean up the atoll between 1977 and 1980. Like Mr. Snider, most did not even wear shirts, let alone respirators. Hundreds say they are now plagued by health problems, including brittle bones, cancer and birth defects in their children. Many are already dead. Others are too sick to work.The military says there is no connection between these illnesses and the cleanup. Radiation exposure during the work fell well below recommended thresholds, it says, and safety precautions were top notch. So the government refuses to pay for the veterans\u2019 medical care.Congress long ago recognized that troops were harmed by radiation on Enewetak during the original atomic tests, which occurred in the 1950s, and should be cared for and compensated. Still, it has failed to do the same for the men who cleaned up the toxic debris 20 years later. The disconnect continues a longstanding pattern in which the government has shrugged off responsibility for its nuclear mistakes.But in the months since the report, nothing has been done to help them.Documents from the time and interviews with dozens of veterans tell a different story.Records show that protective equipment was missing or unusable. Troops requesting respirators couldn\u2019t get them. Cut-rate safety monitoring systems failed. Officials assured concerned members of Congress by listing safeguards that didn\u2019t exist.And though leaders of the cleanup told troops that the islands emitted no more radiation than a dental X-ray, documents show they privately worried about \u201cplutonium problems\u201d and areas that were \u201chighly radiologically contaminated.\u201dTying any disease to radiation exposure years earlier is nearly impossible; there has never been a formal study of the health of the Enewetak cleanup crews. The military collected nasal swabs and urine samples during the cleanup to measure how much plutonium troops were absorbing, but in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, it said it could not find the records.A tally of 431 of the veterans by a member of the group shows that of those who stayed on the southernmost island, where radiation was low, only 2 percent reported having cancer. Of those who worked on the most contaminated islands in the north, 20 percent reported cancer. An additional 34 percent from the contaminated islands reported other health problems that could be related to radiation, like failing bones, infertility and thyroid problems.Between 1948 and 1958, 43 atomic blasts rocked the tiny atoll \u2014 part of the Marshall Islands, which sit between Hawaii and the Philippines \u2014 obliterating the native groves of breadfruit trees and coconut palms, and leaving an apocalyptic wreckage of twisted test towers, radioactive bunkers and rusting military equipment.Four islands were entirely vaporized; only deep blue radioactive craters in the ocean remained. The residents had been evacuated. No one thought they would ever return.In the early 1970s, the Enewetak islanders threatened legal action if they didn\u2019t get their home back. In 1972, the United States government agreed to return the atoll and vowed to clean it up first, a project shared by the Atomic Energy Commission, now called the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense.So federal officials decided to collect radioactive debris from the other islands and dump it into the Runit crater, then cap it with a thick concrete dome.Safety planners intended to use protective suits, respirators and sprinklers to keep down dust. But without adequate funding, simple precautions were scrapped.Paul Laird was one of the first service members to arrive for the atoll\u2019s cleanup, in 1977. Then a 20-year-old bulldozer driver, he began scraping topsoil that records show contained plutonium. He was given no safety equipment.\u201cThat dust was like baby powder. We were covered in it,\u201d said Mr. Laird, now 60, during an interview in rural Maine, where he owns a small auto repair shop. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t even get a paper dust mask. I begged for one daily. My lieutenant said the masks were on back order so use a T-shirt.\u201dBy the time Mr. Laird left the islands, he was throwing up and had a blisterlike rash. He got out of the Army in 1978 and moved home to Maine. When he turned 52, he found a lump that turned out to be kidney cancer. A scan at the hospital showed he also had bladder cancer. A few years later he developed a different form of bladder cancer.His private health insurance covered the treatment, but co-payments left him deep in debt. He applied repeatedly for free veterans\u2019 health care for radiation but was denied. His medical records from the military all said he had not been exposed.\u201cWhen the job was done, they threw my bulldozer in the ocean because it was so hot,\u201d Mr. Laird said. \u201cIf it got that much radiation, how the hell did it miss me?\u201dAs the cleanup continued, federal officials tried to institute safety measures. A shipment of yellow radiation suits arrived on the islands in 1978, but in interviews veterans said that they were too hot to wear in the tropical sun and that the military told them that it was safe to go without them.Every evening, Air Force technicians scanned workers for plutonium particles before they left Runit. Men said dozens of workers each day had screened positive for dangerous levels of radiation.\u201cSometimes we\u2019d get readings that were all the way to the red,\u201d said one technician, David Roach, 57, who now lives in Rockland, Me.None of the high readings were recorded, said Mr. Roach, who has since had several strokes.The veterans\u2019 only avenue for help is to apply individually to the Department of Veterans Affairs for free medical care and disability payments. But the department bases decisions on old military records \u2014 including defective air sampling and radiation badge data \u2014 that show no one was harmed. It nearly always denies coverage.\u201cA lot of guys can\u2019t survive anymore, financially,\u201d said Jeff Dean, 60, who piloted boats loaded with contaminated soil.Mr. Dean developed cancer at 43, then again two years later. He had to give up his job as a carpenter as the bones in his spine deteriorated. Unpaid medical bills left him $100,000 in debt.\u201cNo one seems to want to admit anything,\u201d Mr. Dean said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer we can wait, we have guys dying all the time.\u201dAn article last Sunday about medical problems among soldiers who cleaned up the fallout from nuclear tests on Enewetak Atoll misstated, in some editions, the type of cancer that one service member, Paul Laird, learned he had after turning 52. It was kidney \u2014 not testicular \u2014 cancer. An accompanying picture caption also misstated Mr. Laird\u2019s age in some editions. As the article correctly noted, he is 60, not 59.Advertisement"}

They are making contingency plans to move thousands of jobs elsewhere. Other European Union members are eager to get those jobs. Their leaders also have suggested that Britain must be penalized economically to discourage further defections from the bloc.The country that came to symbolize Europe\u2019s economic travails a few years ago has receded from the headlines somewhat, obscured by Brexit, fears of terrorist attacks in European cities and coming elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. But Greece\u2019s economy remains anemic and in need of more debt relief.Negotiations for further restructuring of Greece\u2019s debts, involving Germany and the International Monetary Fund, also have encountered difficulties. \u201cIf the I.M.F. and Germany cannot find a way out, this is a serious problem,\u201d said Dimitrios Argyroulis, a political economics scholar at the University of Sheffield.While Mr. Trump\u2019s subordinates have sought to reassure European Union leaders that the United States remains a reliable ally, doubts have been planted. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the foreign minister of Germany at the time Trump made those remarks, said they had \u201ccaused astonishment.\u201dEmboldened by the momentum of Brexit and Mr. Trump, nationalist politicians espousing hostility toward the European Union and Muslim immigrants have made strong gains in campaigns for coming elections in three European countries, including the two largest.Even if Ms. Merkel survives to win a fourth term as chancellor, political analysts see her as a weakened figure, and at the worst possible time.An article last Sunday about challenges facing Europe in 2017 misidentified the party of Geert Wilders, a populist lawmaker in the Netherlands who wants to slash immigration and lead the country out of the European Union.

In an interview with French media published last week, Mr. Assad stated that Aleppo signaled a \u201ctipping point in the course of the war\u201d and that the government is \u201con the way to victory.\u201dBut if that is the case, what will Mr. Assad actually win?Finally, the battle is, in reality, far from over. Neither Mr. Assad\u2019s government nor the rebels he is fighting have achieved their goals. The opposition can no longer overthrow the regime, but an active insurgency by armed opposition elements is all but assured, backed by regional patrons, such as Saudi Arabia, which in no way wants to see its rival, Iran, sail toward complete victory. And by their very nature, insurgencies require much less state support than opposition forces trying to hold and govern territory. Mr. Assad would then see what the former United Nations Syria envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has called the \u201cSomalization\u201d of Syria. Mr. Assad would oversee a government that, like Somalia\u2019s, will reign, but not rule, over the entire country. Instead, a number of forces \u2014 the government, opposition militias, Kurdish militias, pockets of the Islamic State \u2014 will control sections of territory.And how would Mr. Assad rule the rump state? Pre-existing patronage networks have been shattered and replaced by semi-independent warlords, militias or local governing bodies. This is even the case in government-controlled areas, where pro-regime militias and gangs who remained loyal would expect rewards. Indeed, the Syrian leadership grossly underestimates how far the Syrian population as a whole has moved away from it. Syrians by and large have for years now been empowered by living, surviving and governing on their own. It is an utter delusion if the regime thinks it can return to anything close to the status quo ante.The Syrian government may have a representative to the United Nations, have embassies in some countries, stamp passports and print currency, but it is hardly a state. Mr. Assad\u2019s control, power and legitimacy have been severely circumscribed, whether he and his supporters know it or not. He will have to depend on continuing large-scale assistance from outside if he wants to restore even a portion of what Syria was. But it is a new Syria. He is the one who will have to reshape his political system to fit this new reality, rather than the other way around.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Obama\u2019s Jobs Record Stacks Up", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byEconomic LegacyOn a Friday morning in February 2009, the Labor Department issued its standard monthly readout on the state of the United States labor market. It was the first of 96 jobs reports to be issued during the Obama presidency, and it was a catastrophe.There was considerably less hand-wringing upon the release of the final jobs report of the Obama years on Friday, and for good reason. The nation added 156,000 jobs in December, and the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent, not the 7.9 percent reached eight years ago.To be precise, that report from February 2009 covered the period shortly before President Obama took office, and the state of the economy in the final days of his administration will be captured by numbers released early next month. But we\u2019re close enough to the end of the Obama era that it\u2019s hard to imagine any radical shifts in those numbers.Granted, presidents have limited ability to shape the economy. Congress controls the power to tax and spend, and the Federal Reserve sets monetary policy. A president has only subtle ways of influencing either. Luck plays a big part in economic results, too; Bill Clinton didn\u2019t invent the internet, but its advent helped drive a jobs boom during his presidency.Still, with moving vans starting to pull up to the White House gates, it\u2019s a fine time to look at how President Obama\u2019s jobs record stacks up against his predecessors. The short answer: The Obama years have been a gloomier period for American workers than the years of Ronald Reagan or Mr. Clinton. But Mr. Obama\u2019s record looks much better if you make adjustment for the fact that he took office in the middle of an economic free fall, or if you compare him with either President Bush.One of the simplest ways to measure employment is to look at the rate of job growth during a presidency. Here, the math is straightforward. With one month to go, the number of payroll jobs in the United States is up 8.4 percent since Obama took office. Of the last three two-term presidents, that falls considerably short of the levels reached by Presidents Reagan (17.7 percent) and Clinton (20.9 percent), but substantially better than the results achieved by George W. Bush (a gain of 1 percent).There are also some ways in which this isn\u2019t a fair comparison. That\u2019s because job growth rates are heavily shaped by two things that a president can\u2019t control: the state of the economy when they take office, and demographic forces that shape the availability of workers.Here, Presidents Reagan and Clinton had a big advantage. Both took office not long after a recession had ended, meaning that their job growth results were boosted by unemployed workers who were returning to the work force. And both presided during a time when baby boomers were in prime working years and women were entering the work force.By contrast, both President Bushes took office with the economy at full employment, when there was nowhere for job growth to go but down. And President Obama took office during a period of economic disaster, with less favorable demographics: Baby boomers are now retiring, and the proportion of women who seek to work is stable, not growing.One way to filter out those effects is by looking at the unemployment rate, which captures only the share of people who are looking for a job who can\u2019t find one.The average jobless rate during the Obama presidency is quite high by modern standards, at 7.4 percent. Even amid the miserable job growth record of the George W. Bush administration, the jobless rate averaged only 5.2 percent.The sheer depth of the recession that Mr. Obama inherited, combined with the slow, long slog out of it over which he presided, ensured that the jobless rate was, on average, elevated through his presidency.If you look not at the average, but compare the economy a president inherited with the one he passed along to his successor, President Obama\u2019s record looks a great deal better. If the December jobless number is unchanged in January, Donald J. Trump will inherit among the lowest jobless rates of any new president in modern times. Only Richard Nixon and George W. Bush inherited a lower rate.And the 3.1-percentage-point decline in joblessness over President Obama\u2019s eight years ties with Mr. Clinton for the steepest drop during a presidency in the post-World War II era.Looking only at the unemployment rate, especially at the tail end of the administration, may be too generous to the Obama record. That rate only counts people who are actively seeking work. And one of the big stories of the last several years has been a contraction in the share of Americans who even count themselves as part of the labor force.But how to measure that? One way is to look at the share of the adult population that is working, or counts itself as part of the labor force. But if you do that, you fail to account for people who are not in the labor force for completely sensible reasons \u2014 because they are voluntarily retiring, or going to graduate school, and so on.That\u2019s why economists often look at \u201cprime-age\u201d labor force participation, only the share of people between ages of 25 and 54 who are either working or seeking work.But here also, it is tricky to compare shifts in recent years with earlier decades, when women were entering the work force at high rates. That shift, which took place roughly from the 1960s through 2000, fueled a boom in the rate of labor force participation that hasn\u2019t continued in the last 16 years partly because most of the women who want to be part of the labor force already are.But what if we look just at the labor force participation rate among prime-aged men? How do the Obama years stack up?It\u2019s pretty bad. The proportion of men 25 to 54 who are part of the labor force has fallen by 1.4 percentage points during the last eight years.What is less widely understood, though, is that this shift isn\u2019t some new phenomenon of the Obama era. That same measure fell by 1.7 percentage points during the eight years of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. Even during the boom years of the Clinton administration, it fell by 0.9 percentage points.Going back even further, when America\u2019s postwar economy was going strong, the proportion of prime-age men in the labor force was falling. In the Nixon years, the number fell by 1.8 percentage points, more than twice the rate on a per-year basis as in the Obama administration.In other words, during the Obama administration, more men, even of prime working age, have dropped out of the labor force, and this is one of the most worrisome long-term trends in the economy. But it has been more of a continuation of a long-term pattern than something new.So what is the Obama jobs legacy? The administration succeeded in ending the steepest recession in modern times, and has presided over steady job growth for seven of its eight years \u2014 though less impressive than in some other recent administrations.The slow recovery meant an elevated unemployment rate, but President Obama will hand off to his successor an economy near full employment, something only a few modern presidents have accomplished.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Attacks BMW and Mercedes, but Auto Industry Is a Complex Target", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 In his latest criticism of what he sees as unfair trade, Donald J. Trump has taken aim at German cars. Why, the president-elect asked a German newspaper, do so many well-heeled drivers in New York drive a Mercedes-Benz, while Germans buy so few Chevrolets?That Mercedes-Benz in New York, for example, may have been made in Tuscaloosa, Ala., depending on the model. BMW has a plant in South Carolina that exports 70 percent of the vehicles made there, it says. And Germans might not buy many Chevrolets, which are no longer sold in Germany, but they buy plenty of Opels, which, like Chevy, is owned by General Motors.BMW and Mercedes-Benz \u2014 as well as the Japanese carmakers Honda, Nissan and Toyota \u2014 employ thousands of factory workers in Alabama, South Carolina, Texas and other states. G.M. gets more than a quarter of its auto-related sales outside North America, while Ford gets a third. Chrysler was bought by Fiat of Italy. Cars of all types increasingly have Chinese parts.Nevertheless, Mr. Trump has been making a series of ever-broader demands that the auto industry manufacture in the United States to sell in the United States.The president-elect\u2019s latest comments came on Sunday in excerpts from an interview with the German tabloid newspaper Bild. After praising German manufacturing prowess, Mr. Trump threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff \u2014 he called it a \u201ctax\u201d \u2014 on every car that BMW imported to the United States. BMW should build the factory in the United States, Mr. Trump said, where it would benefit from his plans to slash corporate taxes.Car exports are the lifeblood of the German economy, and the United States is one of the most important markets. New trade barriers would be a serious threat to German growth and could sour relations with one of the United States\u2019 most important allies.\u201cWe take his comments seriously,\u201d Matthias Wissmann, president of the German Association of the Auto Industry, said in a statement. \u201cRestrictions in the Nafta zone would put a real damper on the economy.\u201dThe main question lies in what Mr. Trump and his trade advisers decide to do once in office, auto industry officials and trade experts said. Measures to force manufacturers to shift assembly to United States factories and to use more American-made parts could drive up prices for American car buyers and make American vehicles less competitive in world markets.\u201cThe people who lose are the core Trump supporters, who end up buying more expensive products,\u201d said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler China who is now the managing director for the automotive industry at Gao Feng Advisory Company, a Chinese consulting firm.The German carmakers are hoping that, once Mr. Trump takes office, they will be able to convince him that tariffs on vehicle imports would hurt the American economy and get him to modify his views.\u201cWe should seek a dialogue with Trump,\u201d Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, a research organization in Munich, said in an email. But Mr. Fuest also expressed concern that differences over trade could escalate.\u201cThere is a danger that his policy fails and that he subsequently starts looking for scapegoats,\u201d Mr. Fuest said. \u201cOne such scapegoat could be the German economy.\u201dIn some respects, Mr. Trump has a point. The United States has been more open to imports than other large automotive markets, with the result that cars shipped in from abroad represent a considerably larger share of the American market than of markets elsewhere.European governments have effectively limited imports by putting pressure on vehicle manufacturers not to close high-cost factories or to lay off workers. The Chinese government requires foreign automakers to partner with local manufacturers and sometimes requires them to transfer technology to Chinese companies.Still, tailoring measures against the auto industry to create jobs in the United States could be difficult. For example, BMW\u2019s Mexico plant would produce 3 Series sedans, which are currently made in Germany and China, and South Africa, where production is being phased out. Most likely, the plant in Mexico would take jobs from the factories in Germany and China and create demand for components imported from the United States.BMW is \u201cvery much at home in the U.S.A.,\u201d Glenn Schmidt, a BMW spokesman, said in an email. Mercedes-Benz declined to comment.The BMW factory site in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico, is already swarming with construction workers rushing to make a 2019 deadline to begin production. There is little chance BMW will change its plans and move the assembly lines to the United States.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments hark back to the 1980s, when the Reagan administration criticized Japan for what it called unfair trade policies in the auto business. That compelled the Japanese government to set annual limits on the number of cars shipped to the United States.Although President George Bush allowed Japan to drop the limits soon after taking office in 1989, the fights of the 1980s taught the global industry a valuable lesson: Made in America can be a good thing. Japanese and European automakers built assembly plants in the United States, taking the edge off political battles while creating tens of thousands of jobs in the country. Building plants in the United States helped in other areas as well, such as improving the foreign automakers\u2019 logistics and moderating the impact from turbulence in currency markets.BMW\u2019s largest factory anywhere in the world is in Spartanburg, S.C. It employs nearly 9,000 people and exports 70 percent of the vehicles it makes, BMW says. Daimler makes Mercedes-Benz S.U.V.s and C-Class cars in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and it is building a factory in Charleston, S.C., to manufacture Sprinter vans, creating more than 1,000 jobs.Daimler, which also builds Freightliner trucks in the United States, has 22 factories or research and development centers in the United States that employ 22,000 people.Even Volkswagen has not given up on the United States despite an emissions scandal that has led to $20 billion in civil settlements and criminal penalties. The carmaker, which has long produced cars in Mexico, is expanding a factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., to manufacture a new full-size S.U.V.G.M. and Ford, meanwhile, saw big opportunities in places like China, where rapid economic development meant more people could afford cars.A tough stance on autos from Mr. Trump may not have the same impact as that of President Reagan. Since the 1980s, automakers have made fewer of their own parts, buying them instead from hundreds of parts suppliers based all over the globe. That means an American car assembled in the United States could still have large chunks that are manufactured abroad.Chinese manufacturers dominate the market for replacement parts in the United States, often undercutting prices for parts from the automakers by half or more. Tariffs on Chinese parts would end up being paid by Americans who took their cars in for repairs.\u201cU.S. consumers are paying a good price for their aftermarket parts,\u201d because of Chinese providers, said Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai-based consulting firm.Global automakers\u2019 assembly plants have been rapidly shifting orders from parts factories in the Midwest to plants in China in the last few years. But that trend could stop or reverse if Mr. Trump imposes sizable tariffs on those imports, Mr. Zhang said.An earlier version of this article gave an incomplete picture of where BMW\u2019s 3 Series sedans are made. They are currently made in South Africa, in addition to Germany and China, though production in South Africa is being phased out.Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

{"Headline": "The Afghan War and the Evolution of Obama", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "A strategy that went from a \u201cgood war\u201d to the shorthand \u201cAfghan good enough\u201d reflects the president\u2019s coming to terms with what was possible in Afghanistan.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015: How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. Obama\u2019s longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office?As it happened, the president solved the problem for them. In early August of that year, when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council, he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality.\u201cThe fever in this room has finally broken,\u201d the president told the group, according to a person in the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer in nation-building mode.\u201dWhat Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day, himself included, thought that the United States \u2014 after 14 years of war, billions of dollars spent and more than 2,000 American lives lost \u2014 would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself.At the same time, he added, \u201cthe counterterrorism challenges are real.\u201d As bleak as Afghanistan\u2019s prospects were, the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again.A few weeks later, the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely.It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama. The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan \u2014 the \u201cgood war\u201d to George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cbad war\u201d in Iraq \u2014 had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch. The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had, through bitter experience, become the commander in chief of a forever war.He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy,\u201d the president said in an interview in September.More than any other conflict, Afghanistan shaped Mr. Obama\u2019s thinking on the basic questions of war, peace and the use of military power. It is where he discovered his affinity for drones, sharpened his belief in the limits of American intervention, battled his generals and hardened his disdain for unreliable foreign leaders. It reaffirmed his suspicions about sending American troops into foreign conflicts and made him reluctant to use more force in Iraq, Syria, Libya and other war zones.It also chastened him about his own hopes.\u201cWhen it comes to helping these societies stabilize and create a more secure environment and a better life for their people, we have to understand,\u201d he said in the interview, \u201cthat this is a long slog.\u201dMr. Obama was a state senator from Illinois in October 2002 when he famously condemned Iraq as a \u201cdumb war.\u201d But in the same speech he also said, \u201cI don\u2019t oppose all wars.\u201d He was referring to Afghanistan, which he viewed as a just war to hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\u201cI would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again,\u201d he told the crowd that day in Chicago\u2019s Federal Plaza.By July 2008, as the Democratic nominee for president, Mr. Obama had embraced Afghanistan as a priority over Iraq \u2014 the \u201cgood war,\u201d in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him.Mr. Obama praised the Bush administration\u2019s troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society, but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan.\u201cThis is a war that we have to win,\u201d he declared. He promised to send at least two more combat brigades, or roughly 10,000 soldiers, to Afghanistan.Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed Mr. Obama in calling the situation in the country \u201cprecarious and urgent.\u201d More than 100 Americans would die in Afghanistan by the end of 2008, a larger number than in any other prior year.When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, he ordered a quick policy review on Afghanistan by a former intelligence analyst, Bruce Riedel. But even before it was completed, he accepted a Pentagon recommendation to send 17,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total to nearly 70,000 American troops on the ground.By the fall of 2009, with the Taliban showing increased strength, Mr. Obama\u2019s military commanders, backed by the elders on his war council, including Hillary Clinton, then his secretary of state, were pressing him to go much farther.They urged on him an ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that had helped turn around the war in Iraq \u2014 a troop-heavy, time-consuming, expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, bridges, schools and a well-functioning government.The strategy, known by its acronym COIN, would require as many as 40,000 additional American men and women in uniform in Afghanistan, his advisers told him.\u201cThere was still the afterglow of the surge in Iraq, and the counterinsurgency narrative that had made the military the savior of the Iraq war,\u201d said Vali R. Nasr, a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Obama was in a position to pick a debate with the military on Afghanistan, and to assert what would be his worldview.\u201d\u201cIn many ways, I think, he deferred,\u201d said Mr. Nasr, now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.Even some former military commanders agreed, saying that the troop deployments were framed in a way that made choosing a smaller number \u2014 20,000, for example \u2014 look like a path to certain defeat.\u201cPresident Obama was asking the military for broad options,\u201d said Karl W. Eikenberry, a retired general who served as the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and was later Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to Kabul. But, he said, the military gave Mr. Obama only \u201cvariations\u201d on \u201cthe more robust counterinsurgency model.\u201dGiven Mr. Obama\u2019s innate wariness of nation-building, it didn\u2019t take long for him to grow disenchanted with the Denmark option. A few months into the surge, in the spring of 2010, David H. Petraeus, the commander of the Pentagon\u2019s Central Command and an architect of the strategy, was briefing him on the state of the counterinsurgency campaign.Drawing on anthropology theory from the University of Chicago, General Petraeus explained to his commander in chief how neighborhoods in Kandahar related to one another. Mr. Obama listened for a while, then cut him off. \u201cWe can\u2019t worry about how neighborhoods relate to each other in Kandahar,\u201d he curtly told General Petraeus, according to people in the room.\u201cObama believes the military can do enormous things,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. \u201cIt can win wars and stabilize conflicts. But a military can\u2019t create a political culture or build a society.\u201dBy the end of his first term, Mr. Obama had evolved to the point that he fully embraced the concept \u201cAfghan good enough.\u201d The phrase, which had been kicked around the White House since 2010, referred to the shift away from nation-building to a policy that was content with taking out the terrorists, preventing the Taliban from overrunning the country and putting a premium on getting the troops out.By that new standard, things had improved in Afghanistan. By August 2010, 100,000 American troops were on the ground in Afghanistan and were pushing back the Taliban in some critical areas. Despite uneven progress in the military campaign, Ryan Crocker, a diplomat who had reopened the American Embassy in Kabul in 2002 and served there again as ambassador in 2011, recalled thinking, \u201cWow, this place looks great!\u201dAides to Mr. Obama had advised him not to go for security reasons, but he saw it as an important milestone.The agreement promised an \u201cenduring partnership\u201d between the United States and Afghanistan, with pledges of American help in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions. Yet the promises obscured a starker reality: Mr. Obama had accelerated the timetable for drawing down American troops, and he was looking beyond the war.Speaking to a national TV audience from Bagram Air Base, he suggested that America\u2019s experience in Afghanistan had come full circle. \u201cOne year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal I set \u2014 to defeat Al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild \u2014 is now within our reach.\u201dEarlier, Mr. Obama had met for an hour with Mr. Karzai. The two had long had a rocky relationship \u2014 on an earlier trip, Mr. Obama excoriated Mr. Karzai for the rampant corruption in the Afghan government \u2014 and this session did little to improve their rapport. Mr. Crocker recalled that the president was \u201cvery aloof, almost cold, which bothered me a bit because I\u2019d worked a solid damn year to get Karzai in a better place with us.\u201dThings never warmed up between them. When Mr. Karzai refused to sign a long-term security agreement with Washington, Mr. Obama gave up on him to focus on his successor, Ashraf Ghani. The experience left a lasting imprint on the president, his aides said. He concluded that without the right partner, it was impossible for the United States to succeed, no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country.It was an insight that Mr. Obama applied to his relations with other countries, from Pakistan to Israel, where his poor relationships with the leaders impeded progress. \u201cThe most underappreciated part of foreign policy,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said, \u201cis dealing with flawed partners.\u201dWorse, there was a new threat in the form of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which sprouted in the poisonous soil of Iraq after the United States left and was finding recruits in the Hindu Kush.Mr. Obama had rejected a chorus of calls in Washington to delay the drawdown, under which the residual force of American troops was to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2016.\u201cThe mantra I heard was that the president does not want to hand off to his successor the mess he inherited,\u201d said Daniel F. Feldman, who served as the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2014 and 2015.But as the Islamic State became a dire enough threat to return American troops to Iraq, Mr. Obama felt compelled to change course on Afghanistan. \u201cISIL thrived in a vacuum in Iraq and it pointed to a similar vacuum in Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said.Mr. Obama, he said, was prodded by more than fear. After a long stretch of political paralysis, Afghanistan formed a government with Mr. Ghani in the presidency. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Obama felt like he had a partner with whom he could do business. The American-trained Afghan Army was taking heavy casualties fighting the Taliban, and the president believed that the United States had an obligation to help them.But as Mr. Obama\u2019s war council met that August morning, the level of American support remained the subject of intense debate.Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who had succeeded Admiral Mullen as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended that the United States maintain a military presence in Kabul, and at Bagram and a scattering of bases in the east and south. The 10,000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular, ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control.The imperative, General Dempsey told Mr. Obama, was that Afghanistan fit into a broader counterterrorism policy from Central Asia to North Africa to extend \u201cwell beyond your presidency,\u201d according to several officials.Mr. Obama liked that idea. It was in line, he said, with the principles he had laid out in a 2014 speech at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., where he said America would train and equip foreign armies but leave the front-line fighting to them. He acknowledged that it would mean handing off Afghanistan to his successor as unfinished business.Mr. Obama now seems at an uneasy peace. In the interview in September, he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed. He had, after all, reduced the number of American troops to fewer than 10,000 from more than 100,000. They were training and assisting Afghan troops, even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry.The country had been broken to begin with, he said, and America was never going to fix it. \u201cAfghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world with the lowest literacy rates in the world before we got there. It continues to be,\u201d Mr. Obama said. The country \u201cwas riven with all kinds of ethnic and tribal divisions before we got there. It\u2019s still there.\u201dIn the end, Afghanistan became the template for a new kind of warfare \u2014 a chronic conflict, across an arc of unstable states, in which the United States is a participant, if not the principal actor.At a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw in July, Mr. Obama acknowledged that this prospect would disappoint an American public still suffering from combat fatigue. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of MacArthur and the emperor meeting, and a war being officially over,\u201d he said.\u201cAs commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world,\u201d he went on, \u201cI spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And I\u2019m not satisfied we\u2019ve got it perfect yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Abandons Trans-Pacific Partnership, Obama\u2019s Signature Trade Deal", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump upended America\u2019s traditional, bipartisan trade policy on Monday as he formally abandoned the ambitious, 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership brokered by his predecessor and declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that defined global economics for decades.With the stroke of a pen on his first full weekday in office, Mr. Trump signaled that he plans to follow through on promises to take a more aggressive stance against foreign competitors as part of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach. In doing so, he demonstrated that he would not follow old rules, effectively discarding longstanding Republican orthodoxy that expanding global trade was good for the world and America \u2014 and that the United States should help write the rules of international commerce.Although the Trans-Pacific Partnership had not been approved by Congress, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw not only doomed former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature trade achievement, but also carried broad geopolitical implications in a fast-growing region. The deal, which was to link a dozen nations from Canada and Chile to Australia and Japan in a complex web of trade rules, was sold as a way to permanently tie the United States to East Asia and create an economic bulwark against a rising China.Instead, Mr. Trump said American workers would be protected against competition from low-wage countries like Vietnam and Malaysia, also parties to the deal.But some in both parties worry that China will move to fill the economic vacuum as America looks inward, and will expand its sway over Asia and beyond.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or T.P.P., reversed a free-trade strategy adopted by presidents of both parties dating back to the Cold War, and aligned him more with the political left. When he told a meeting of union leaders at the White House on Monday that he had just terminated the pact, they broke into applause.On his first full workday in office, President Trump delivered on a campaign promise by abandoning the enormous trade deal that had became a flashpoint in American politics.\u201cWe\u2019re going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country, and it\u2019s going to be reversed,\u201d Mr. Trump told them, saying that from now on, the United States would sign trade deals only with individual allies. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to have a lot of companies come back to our country.\u201dBut free-trade advocates said that in canceling the Pacific pact, Mr. Trump lost an agreement that had already renegotiated Nafta under more modern rules governing intellectual property, internet access and agriculture, since both Mexico and Canada were signatories. He also undercut Mr. Obama\u2019s so-called pivot to Asia and, critics said, essentially ceded the field to China, which was not part of the agreement.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this action will be seen as a huge, huge win for China,\u201d Michael B. Froman, the trade representative who negotiated the pact for Mr. Obama, said in an interview. \u201cFor the Trump administration, after all this talk about being tough on China, for their first action to basically hand the keys to China and say we\u2019re withdrawing from our leadership position in this region is geostrategically damaging.\u201dSome Republicans agreed, but only a few would publicly challenge the president. Senator John McCain of Arizona called the decision \u201ca serious mistake\u201d that would hurt America. \u201cIt will send a troubling signal of American disengagement in the Asia-Pacific region at a time we can least afford it,\u201d he said in a statement.The Obama administration negotiated the trade pact for nearly eight years. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other congressional Republicans worked with Mr. Obama to pass legislation granting so-called fast-track authority to negotiate it over Democratic objections. But Mr. Obama never submitted the final agreement for approval amid vocal opposition.Obama officials argued that it benefited the United States by opening markets while giving up very little in return. In particular, it finally brought the United States and Japan, the world\u2019s largest and third-largest economies, together in a free-trade pact.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision was crushing for Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spent considerable political capital to get the agreement through Parliament, which ratified it Friday. Just hours before Mr. Trump dispensed with it, Mr. Abe told Parliament that Tokyo would lobby the new administration on the merits of the deal.Japan was the last to join the pact, which would give its manufacturers tariff-free access to export markets in the United States and other Asian countries, but would bring its automakers into competition with lower-wage countries like Mexico. Mr. Abe became a strong enthusiast after making politically painful concessions on agricultural imports that the United States had sought.Victor Shih, an expert on China\u2019s political economy at the University of California, San Diego, said withdrawing from the T.P.P. would alter America\u2019s image in the region. \u201cThe U.S. will be seen as an unreliable partner both economically and perhaps even in the security arena,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile some countries in Asia have no choice but to be close to the U.S., others may begin to look to China.\u201dChina has already sought to capitalize by making a push to complete an alternative pact, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which aims to unite 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India.Australia\u2019s trade minister, Steven Ciobo, said on Monday that other members of the trade pact were exploring whether to create a \u201cT.P.P. minus one,\u201d without the United States.\u201cThe T.P.P. offers very material benefits for all parties that signed up for the agreement,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt would be a great shame to lose those benefits. Notwithstanding President Trump\u2019s decision, there\u2019s still a lot of merits to capturing those gains.\u201dIf Mr. Trump scrambled coalitions overseas, he did so at home, too. Democrats and labor groups praised his move. James P. Hoffa, general president of the Teamsters union, said Mr. Trump had \u201ctaken the first step toward fixing 30 years of bad trade policies.\u201d Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch, said it would \u201cbury the moldering corpse\u201d of the Pacific deal, though she expressed concern about how Nafta would be renegotiated.Some people emerging from the union meeting with Mr. Trump, who won surprising victories in Midwestern labor strongholds, expressed enthusiasm for both his trade action and his promise to build new roads, bridges and other infrastructure.\u201cWe just had probably the most incredible meeting of our careers,\u201d Sean McGarvey, president of North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions, said. \u201cWe will work with him and his administration to help him implement his plans on infrastructure, trade and energy policy, so we really do put America back to work.\u201dReporting was contributed by Michael D. Shear in Washington, Edward Wong in Los Angeles, Daniel J. Wakin in New York, Peter S. Goodman in London and Motoko Rich in Tokyo.videoAdvertisement"}

Women are assumed to be empathetic and caring; men are supposed to be strong, tough and able to support a family.\u201cTraditional masculinity is standing in the way of working-class men\u2019s employment, and I think it\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist and public policy professor at Johns Hopkins and author of \u201cLabor\u2019s Love Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Working-Class Family in America.\u201d\u201cWe have a cultural lag where our views of masculinity have not caught up to the change in the job market,\u201d he said.But telling working-class men to take feminine jobs plays to their anxieties and comes off as condescending, said Joan Williams, a law professor at U.C. Hastings and author of \u201cReshaping the Work-Family Debate: Why Men and Class Matter.\u201d\u201cWhite working-class men\u2019s wages have plummeted, and what happens to men in that context is anxieties about whether they\u2019re \u2018real men,\u2019 \u201d she said.It\u2019s no surprise, then, that Donald J. Trump appealed to men who feel this way \u2014 not just his promises to bring back factory jobs, but also his machismo.Many unemployed men who did manual labor say they can\u2019t take the time and make the effort to train for a new career because they have bills to pay. And they say they chose their original careers because they wanted to build things, not take care of people.\u201cIt\u2019s not a skill mismatch, but an identity mismatch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they couldn\u2019t become a health worker, it\u2019s that people have backward views of what their identity is.\u201dJon Ray, 31, of Inez, Ky., was an electrician at a coal mine until it was shuttered a year ago. He applied unsuccessfully for maintenance and repair jobs, and got a job in manufacturing after enrolling in a program to learn how to operate computerized tools.Service-sector jobs weren\u2019t an option, he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to go back to school,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m used to working with my hands.\u201dIf more men do pink-collar jobs, they could erase the stigma and turn them into men\u2019s jobs, said Janette Dill, a sociologist at the University of Akron, at least for jobs that require less hands-on caregiving. \u201cMore men will go into care because they don\u2019t have a choice, but they\u2019re going to carve out spaces for themselves that feel less like women\u2019s work,\u201d she said.Technical health care jobs like ultrasound technician \u2014 requiring more training but not a college degree \u2014 paid 22 percent more than other blue-collar jobs, after controlling for things like education. They involve less interaction with patients and more with computers, so they are less stereotypically feminine.There is an education and race divide among the men who take these jobs, the study found. Black men were 3.3 times as likely as white men to take the lowest-rung health jobs, and other minority men were 1.8 times as likely. White men were more likely to take the higher-status technical jobs.Perhaps then men could take the same pride in their work that Mr. Dawson, the unemployed welder, showed when he talked about making pilings for the rebuilt World Trade Center. \u201cI had a good life as a welder,\u201d he said. \u201cIt always amused me.

And since bad stuff does happen, there\u2019s a strong likelihood that unemployment will be higher four years from now than it is today.Oh, and Trumpist budget deficits will probably widen the trade deficit, so that manufacturing employment in particular is likely to fall, not rise.So how will Mr. Trump handle the bad news of rising unemployment, plunging health coverage, and little if any crime reduction? That\u2019s obvious: He\u2019ll deny reality, the way he always does when it threatens his narcissism. But will his supporters go along with his fantasy?But it probably won\u2019t be that easy. For one thing, people tend to attribute improvements in their personal situation to their own efforts; surely many voters who gained jobs over the past eight years believe that they did it despite, not thanks to, Obama policies. Will they correspondingly blame themselves, not Donald Trump, for lost jobs and health insurance? Unlikely.On top of that, Mr. Trump made big promises during the campaign, so the risk of disillusionment is especially high.Will he respond to bad news by accepting responsibility and trying to do better? Will he renounce his fortune and enter a monastery? That seems equally likely.No, the insecure egomaniac-in-chief will almost surely deny awkward truths, and berate the media for reporting them. And \u2014 this is what worries me \u2014 it\u2019s very likely that he\u2019ll try to use his power to shoot the messengers.Seriously, how do you think the man who compared the C.I.A. to Nazis will react when the Bureau of Labor Statistics first reports a significant uptick in unemployment or decline in manufacturing jobs? What\u2019s he going to do when the Centers for Disease Control and the Census Bureau report spiking numbers of uninsured Americans?You may have thought that last weekend\u2019s temper tantrum was bad.

{"Headline": "Obama, Saying Goodbye, Warns of Threats to National Unity", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 President Obama, delivering a farewell address in the city that launched his political career, declared on Tuesday his continued confidence in the American experiment. But he warned, in the wake of a toxic presidential election, that economic inequity, racism and closed-mindedness threatened to shred the nation\u2019s democratic fabric.\u201cWe weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cwhen we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them.\u201dSpeaking to a rapturous crowd that recalled the excitement of his path-breaking campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama said he believed even the deepest ideological divides could be bridged. His words were nevertheless etched with frustration \u2014 a blunt coda to a remarkable day that laid bare many of the racial crosscurrents in the country.And here, in the cavernous convention hall where Mr. Obama celebrated his re-election in 2012, the nation\u2019s first black president \u2014 still popular, still optimistic \u2014 bade America goodbye 10 days before turning over his office to President-elect Donald J. Trump, who ran what his critics labeled a racist campaign.Mr. Obama pledged again to support his successor. But his speech was a thinly veiled rebuke of several of the positions Mr. Trump staked out during the campaign, from climate change and barring Muslims from entering the country to repealing his landmark health care law.\u201cIf every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cthen workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclave.\u201d\u201cIf we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don\u2019t look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children \u2014 because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America\u2019s work force,\u201d he added.In giving a farewell address, Mr. Obama invoked a privilege of presidents going back to George Washington. He staked his claim as the leader who steered the nation through the storms of the Great Recession to a growing economy and job market. He claimed credit for reducing the rate of uninsured Americans to record lows, while keeping a cap on health care costs.7 PhotosIn a pointed reference to Republicans determined to repeal the health care bill that was one of the signature accomplishments of his presidency, Mr. Obama said, \u201cIf anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we\u2019ve made to our health care system \u2014 that covers as many people at less cost \u2014 I will publicly support it.\u201dThere were also nostalgic moments, as well. He recalled the 2008 campaign that started him on his improbable journey to the White House. He thanked the army of volunteers and staff members who swept him into the Oval Office, ending with the iconic chant, \u201cYes, we can.\u201d And reflecting on all they had accomplished, he added, \u201cYes, we did.\u201d\u201cIt has been the honor of my life to serve you,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI won\u2019t stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days.\u201dHe drew some of the most thunderous applause of the night when he paid tribute to his wife, Michelle \u2014 \u201cmy best friend\u201d \u2014 and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u2014 \u201ca brother.\u201d As the crowd of 18,000 clapped and stamped their feet, Mr. Obama dabbed his eyes.Afterward, Mrs. Obama and her elder daughter, Malia, appeared onstage with the president, along with Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill. The Obamas\u2019 younger daughter, Sasha, stayed in Washington because she has an exam in school on Wednesday morning, the White House said.But Mr. Obama clearly wanted to use his last major turn on the national stage to send a message. Americans, he said, should not take their democracy for granted. Lamenting the perennially low voter turnout rates, Mr. Obama urged people to become involved. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired of arguing with strangers on the internet,\u201d he said, \u201ctry to talk with one in real life.\u201d\u201cAmerica is not a fragile thing,\u201d the president said. \u201cBut the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.\u201dThe White House had meticulously planned this event, from the location to the tone and cadence of the speech, which clearly reached for the oratorical heights of his best-remembered addresses.The president was still rewriting his remarks on Tuesday afternoon, one of his aides said, after being up very late Monday night scrawling edits on what was then already the fourth draft.Mr. Obama\u2019s chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, pored over previous farewell addresses for inspiration. George Washington used the occasion to disclose he would not run for a third term and warned Americans to steer clear of foreign entanglements in Europe, while Dwight D. Eisenhower warned of the influence of the \u201cmilitary-industrial complex.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s message recalled his final State of the Union address last year, as well as speeches he gave in Springfield, Ill.; at the commencement ceremonies at Howard University and Rutgers University; and during the Democratic National Convention.Dozens of alumni from the White House and Mr. Obama\u2019s political operation converged on Chicago to cheer their boss. With parties all over town, the atmosphere felt like a wistful version of 2012, or even more so, of 2008, when Mr. Obama\u2019s election drew a quarter-million people to a jubilant victory celebration in nearby Grant Park.There was, however, an undeniable tinge of sadness to Mr. Obama\u2019s leave-taking \u2014 the dread among many in this crowd that his legacy will be undone by Mr. Trump, and the disappointment that, for all his political gifts, he was unable to hand over his office to his chosen successor, Hillary Clinton.\u201cBeers and tears,\u201d said Ben LaBolt, who served as the national press secretary for Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election campaign.Many said they had waited hours in the cold to get tickets, like Ja-mese McGee, an elementary school teacher from the Chicago suburb Country Club Hills.Those hours had a purpose. She wanted to demonstrate to her students that seeing Mr. Obama was worth the wait. \u201cBetter than waiting to shop on Black Friday. Better than waiting in line for gym shoes,\u201d she said.But Ms. McGee was troubled by Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, and the damage it could do to Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to say about him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe maintained class, he maintained dignity. Honestly, I don\u2019t want him to leave, but I\u2019m sure it will be a load off his shoulders.\u201dAlvin Love, a Baptist minister, walked through the crowd holding the hand of his 6-year-old granddaughter, Bayleigh Love, who wore a red sequined party dress.He and Mr. Obama go back 30 years, when the president was a young community organizer on the South Side. \u201cIt\u2019s mixed emotions for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sad to see it come to an end, but proud and happy to see the work that he\u2019s done.\u201dMr. Love said he believed Mr. Obama\u2019s work could be sustained, even with the advent of a Trump presidency. \u201cAny time right is done, it will sooner or later stand up again.\u201dMichael D.

{"Headline": "September\u2019s Book Club Pick: \u2018Earning the Rockies,\u2019 by Robert D. Kaplan", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byNow Read ThisWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Well over half of American voters, having cast ballots for Hillary Clinton or minor-party candidates, awoke the next morning to a country that seems not only unfamiliar but upside-down. Populists embrace a celebrity billionaire, evangelicals welcome a foul-mouthed Lothario, conservatives accept an opportunist whose only ideological commitment is to himself. The Republican establishment proves helpless against the hijacking of the party, the mainstream media prove ineffectual against the tide of fake news and the political system proves vulnerable to the machinations of a sinister foreign government. Longstanding global alliances are questioned, longstanding political norms are trashed \u2014 and then the candidate with the three-million-vote plurality loses. In what alternative universe does this make any sense? As Karl Marx said, in a very different context: All that is solid melts into air.Or maybe not. Maybe the political air is turbulent but the country\u2019s tectonic fundamentals remain solid. Maybe American politics and geopolitics rest on a foundation as immovable as the rivers and plains of the country itself. For those who feel disoriented, and also (perhaps especially) for those who feel triumphant, Robert D. Kaplan\u2019s small but magisterial new book, \u201cEarning the Rockies,\u201d is a tonic, because it brings fundamentals back into view.With only 180 uncrowded pages of text, this is a book that can be read on a coast-to-coast flight, but fully digesting it will take much longer. Every page brings a fresh insight, a telling aper\u00e7u, a bracing reality check. If you do read the book at 30,000 feet, it will make you yearn to be down below. To understand the country, Kaplan posits, one must still \u201cearn the Rockies,\u201d reaching them on terra firma as our ancestors did. \u201cTo fly to California and set your clock back three hours is not to know the ground you have covered, because you haven\u2019t seen all the different mornings and evenings along the way.\u201dKaplan is one of America\u2019s most distinguished writers on foreign affairs, with 16 prior books to his name. (He and I are both contributing editors of The Atlantic, though we don\u2019t know each other.) Many will recall his 1994 Atlantic article (then book) \u201cThe Coming Anarchy,\u201d which looks eerily prescient today. In his teens as a hitchhiker and again in middle age as a journalist, Kaplan trekked across the continental United States. Today, perplexed by America\u2019s pivot against the successful global order that Americans built, he repeats the journey, \u201cfor the answers to our dilemmas overseas lie within the continent itself.\u201dHe returns with a musing travelogue, one that seeks, in words as carefully chosen as gemstones, to bring America\u2019s geographic and geopolitical fundamentals back into the picture. He begins in the East, where the landscape is vertical, cluttered with tall trees and taller cities. Walking streets that are thriving and dismal by turns, and overhearing conversations in rural diners and urban coffeehouses, he encounters not one country but two. Wheeling, in West Virginia coal country, is in a shocking state of collapse, but across the bridge in Marietta, Ohio, he finds prosperity fueled by natural-gas fracking. In Bloomington, the home of Indiana University, he finds \u201ca truly global civilization,\u201d demarcated by \u201cmiles and miles of expensive restaurants and well-appointed people.\u201dThe new \u201cuniversal civilization\u201d is slowly dissolving local distinctiveness, but only for some: Bloomington\u2019s elites understand their British counterparts better than they do their compatriots in Wheeling. In place after place, Kaplan encounters people who, though friendly and self-respecting, \u201chave in some important ways just given up.\u201d Even in blue states, many \u201cfeel their way of life is being endangered and fear being economically left behind in this new world of slim people on low-carb diets with stylish clothes.\u201dThen the \u201chorizontal landscape\u201d of the Great Plains unfurls before him, followed by the great American desert of the West, endless landscapes that forged an independent ethos yet, paradoxically, were built with the aid of enormous government investment. Here he finds the cradle of America\u2019s international ambitions: \u201cIf this unending vastness could be conquered, then, after some fashion, the world could be, too.\u201d At last, he arrives in San Diego, overlooking the port of the mighty United States Pacific Fleet and peering over the horizon toward Asia, where the fleet\u2019s patrols keep an uneasy peace.What do we learn along the way? For all the turbulent change swirling about us now, America was and remains the product of an exceptional geography. North America has more miles of navigable inland waterways than much of the rest of the world combined. Better still, its rivers run diagonally rather than (as in Russia) north and south, forming an ideal network for internal communication and trade. Moreover, America\u2019s continental span and rich resource base shield it from external threat and dependency. Thus the United States is uniquely blessed by geography to form and sustain a cohesive continental union. Union is not the same as unity, but it\u2019s a good start.America\u2019s geographical and hydrological blessings ramify not only inward but also outward. \u201cThe United States is not a normal country: Its geographic bounty gave it the possibility of becoming a world power, and with that power it has developed longstanding obligations, which, on account of its continued economic and social dynamism relative to other powers, it keeps,\u201d Kaplan writes. \u201cWe are,\u201d he says (his italics), \u201cfated to lead.\u201d For a host of reasons, ranging from geography to culture, no other country can play the same role.Kaplan embraces America\u2019s quasi-imperial role but is no imperialist. His book is most challenging, and most valuable, for the layers of paradox it mines. Geography and union make the United States a hegemon whose auspices create the conditions for globalization \u2014 but globalization diminishes America\u2019s geographical advantages and erodes American unity. Meanwhile, as globalization uproots local economies and norms, the communications revolution spawns new tribal and ideological identities, everything from jihadism to alt-right. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the clash of civilizations so much as the clash of artificially reconstructed civilizations that is taking place,\u201d Kaplan writes. Finally, globalization, a product of American influence and a bulwark against chaos, erodes American influence and births new disruptions. For all its unrivaled military and economic power, the United States \u201cnow has no possibility of bringing order to the world.\u201d The best we can hope for is to reduce disorder. Doing that requires projecting power, yes, but with a \u201clight and subtle footprint.\u201d It won\u2019t be easy.\u201cEarning the Rockies\u201d was written before the 2016 election. The name \u201cTrump\u201d appears only a few times. Yet there is more insight here into the Age of Trump than in bushels of political-horse-race journalism. George H.W. Bush imagined a new world order and, for a time, built one; Bill Clinton embraced soft power and democratic globalization and, for a time, made them work; George W. Bush rediscovered history, confrontation, hard power and blowback; Barack Obama sought to revive Clinton\u2019s formula but, in the end, left too many behind. And then came Trump, repudiating all of the above for irredentist nationalism, and smashing crockery as none have done since Andrew Jackson.Where are we now? In territory that is uncharted but not altogether unfamiliar. President Trump may try to ignore the paradoxes of geography and globalism, but he cannot escape them. In the long run, Kaplan reminds us, the shape of the river constrains the pilot\u2019s course. America will continue to lead, because it must.A review on Jan. 29 about \u201cEarning the Rockies: How Geography Shapes America\u2019s Role in the World,\u201d by Robert D. Kaplan, referred incorrectly to the voting results of last year\u2019s presidential election. Of the nearly 137 million Americans who actually cast ballots, 48.1 percent voted for Hillary Clinton, 46 percent for Donald J. Trump and nearly 6 percent for other candidates. It is not the case that \u201cjust over half of America\u201d voted for Clinton.Jonathan Rauch is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a contributing editor of The Atlantic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War May Have Already Begun", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 America\u2019s traditional allies are on the lookout for new friends.Some allies are shifting focus to other potential partners for new sources of trade and investment, relationships that could influence political, diplomatic and military ties. Many are looking to China, which has adroitly capitalized on a leadership vacuum in world affairs by offering itself \u2014 ironies notwithstanding \u2014 as a champion for global engagement.\u201cWe\u2019ve always said that America is our best friend,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup \u2014 comprising finance ministers from countries sharing the euro currency \u2014 said in an interview with The New York Times on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this month. \u201cIf that\u2019s no longer the case, if that\u2019s what we need to understand from Donald Trump, then of course Europe will look for new friends.\u201d\u201cChina is a very strong candidate for that,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Chinese involvement in Europe in terms of investment is already very high and expanding. If you push away your friends, you mustn\u2019t be surprised if the friends start looking for new friends.\u201dOn Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany spoke by telephone with Premier Li Keqiang of China. \u201cThe two spoke in favor of free trade and a stable world trade order,\u201d a German government spokesman later said in a written statement.The swift reassessment of trade relations \u2014 a realm in which Mr. Trump is directly threatening the order that has prevailed since the end of World War II \u2014 only amplifies the potential for a shake-up of the broader geopolitical framework.Through the fractious campaign, weary sophisticates dismissed the extreme talk from the Trump camp as political bluster. Even if he won, he would never follow through on his threats, particularly in trade where his business sensibilities would prevail.But that conventional wisdom looks to be crumbling. First, Mr. Trump delivered on a promise to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China\u2019s growing influence.\u201cI\u2019m incredibly concerned that the Trump people mean what they say,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cOne would hope that they are using this as a negotiating tactic. But even if you are, that\u2019s an extraordinarily dangerous game to play, because, right now, the communication to the world is not flowing clearly.\u201dThe communication on Thursday came through Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who during the administration of George W. Bush, promoted the job-creating magic of free trade as a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative.Pressed to explain how Mr. Trump would force Mexico to pay for the wall, Mr. Spicer said an import tax would do the trick. He soon clarified the tax was merely one option on a crowded buffet table.At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trump reported having had \u201ca very good call\u201d with the Mexican president. But he did not sound conciliatory. Mexico \u201chas outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201dWithin the business world, the prospect of substantial tariffs seems so damaging that many assume it will never happen.Three decades ago, Alan Russell, a former commercial airline pilot, set up the Tecma Group of Companies, which runs factory operations for multinationals in Mexico. Today, the company employs some 7,000 Mexican laborers, most of them in factories clustered around Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. They make components for the automotive, electronics, aerospace and medical device industries.Mr. Trump\u2019s words have provoked fear among the members of Mr. Russell\u2019s work force. \u201cThey hear the administration is going to shut down Nafta and deport everyone, and it scares them,\u201d he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement.But in the end, he said, business will carry on.\u201cIn 31 years, I\u2019ve been through rapid inflation, devaluations, three major recessions, the violence period and multiple presidential administrations, and every year trade has increased,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through worse. Trade is like life itself. It will figure a way.\u201dMost experts have similarly assumed the responsibilities of governance would temper Mr. Trump\u2019s trade posture. Given that nearly one-third of all American trade is conducted with China and Mexico, a rupture risks severe economic damage.\u201cThe idea of trade wars these days, what politicians have in mind is really a 19th-century or early 20th-century conception of trade,\u201d said Gianmarco I.P. Ottaviano, a trade economist at the London School of Economics. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know who you\u2019re going to hurt with these kind of things. You\u2019re probably going to destroy American jobs in the end.\u201dBeyond the economic effects, Mr. Trump\u2019s refashioning of trade has already altered global alignments.On Friday, as Mr. Trump hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May, he only increased the sense that he disdains Europe.\u201cBrexit\u2019s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,\u201d he told Ms. May at a news conference, before recounting his frustrations with the union\u2019s bureaucracy. \u201cGetting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough.\u201dWith both countries pursuing nationalist aspirations and multilateral institutions seemingly endangered, the world suddenly seems short of responsible supervision.China does not have free elections. China jails labor organizers, while lavishing credit on state-owned enterprises. All of this makes Mr. Xi an ironic choice as an icon for free trade. Yet Mr. Xi\u2019s speech was so successful that it won the embrace of business people and world leaders alike.At a lunch in Davos two days after Mr. Xi\u2019s address, a Berlin-based private equity fund manager, Andr\u00e9 Loesekrug-Pietri, stood in a dining room full of more than 100 people and predicted the dawning of a new era.\u201cWe heard a Chinese president becoming the leader of the free world,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

For a president who thinks so low of women, it just breaks my heart.\u201dLucy VandenHeede, 79, said that her daughter-in-law and two granddaughters had taken a bus to Washington from Kalamazoo, Mich., to attend the march and that she was cheering them on from afar.Women\u2019s rights have come a long way, she said, recalling the days when she worked in the newspaper business selling advertising and was paid far less than her male colleagues. \u201cThey earned commission, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was always called \u2018Mrs. John VandenHeede.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even have a name.\u201d\u201cShe was the best salesman in the bunch, too,\u201d said her husband, Mr. VandenHeede.Other women sharply questioned the notion of protesting a president whose administration had begun only the day before. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of offensive,\u201d said Linda Hine, 56, an accounting manager who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cPeople are just criticizing because they didn\u2019t get their way. All it did was force another reason for people to be divided.\u201dMs. Hine interpreted Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural speech on Friday as a generous, uplifting call to bring people together, contradicting the belief of others that it had painted an overly dark and gloomy picture of the country. \u201cIt was about unity,\u201d she said.Her friend Kim Redman, 48, said that as opponents of abortion, they would not have felt welcome at the march anyway, echoing a frequent complaint that only women who favor abortion rights were encouraged to attend. If women would just give Mr. Trump a chance, he might not be as bad as they expect, she said.\u201cHe\u2019s our president no matter what,\u201d she said.Why do women need a march at all, some people asked, when they have made so many gains in the past few decades? \u201cWomen have equal opportunities in the workplace now. We\u2019ve got minorities in jobs. The glass ceilings have opened up all across the nation,\u201d said Tammy Chesney, 53, a carpenter, adding that she had never experienced discrimination on the job.There are bigger concerns in Niles than expanding the rights of women, many people said. They worry about the state of local schools, the cost of health care and the town\u2019s economy, which has struggled with the loss of manufacturing jobs.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d had special resonance in Rust Belt towns like Niles, said Tracy Guetterman, 49, a retail manager, as she stopped to show her 6-year-old granddaughter Melanie an ice sculpture in the shape of \u201cU.S.A.\u201d\u201cPersonally, I\u2019d love to see our country go back to one parent working, like the good old days,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be able to quit my job.\u201dMs. Guetterman saw the marches as nothing more than complaining from liberals. \u201cQuit blaming everybody for your problems,\u201d she said. \u201cGet out there and do it yourself.\u201dYet many of the sentiments from the Women\u2019s March were echoed in the voices of people in Niles, about 600 miles from Washington.Diane Kellenburger, 69, a retired executive for a nonprofit organization who had purple streaks in her gray hair, showed off a gold medal from the 5K race, where she had the fastest finish in her age group.She had friends who went to a nearby march in Valparaiso, Ind., and she shared their disgust at Mr. Trump\u2019s attitude toward women.\u201cPersonally, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far with women\u2019s rights. I have a high level of concern that we\u2019re stepping backward.\u201dKim Shelton sat behind the counter of her memorabilia shop downtown, a business that she said is dependent on tourists, as local people have so little to spend these days. Michigan flipped to Mr. Trump, she insisted, because its residents believe he is a successful businessman who can turn things around.Ms. Shelton is not so sure whether he will pull that off, she said, but she is convinced that he does not respect women like her.\u201cI keep hoping, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to change,\u201d she said. \u201cI think women are going to take a few steps back with Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Climate Change, Even States in Forefront Are Falling Short", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneNew York, by contrast, left its nuclear plants running. It even offered upstate generators subsidies similar to those available to renewable energy generators, to help them survive the cutthroat competition against cheap power fueled by natural gas.The United States must decarbonize at an annual rate of 4.3 percent under that timetable. But over the last decade and a half, only North Dakota and the District of Columbia have achieved this pace. New York is decarbonizing at about 3 percent per year, California at barely above 2 percent.What\u2019s more, most of the gains in the United States have come relatively easily, not from the deployment of renewables but from the wholesale switch from coal to cheaper and cleaner natural gas. Much of that transition has played itself out, however. Further gains will be more expensive.\u201cWhat\u2019s critical to think about is, Where are the next savings going to come from?\u201d Mr. Muro told me. \u201cDivergent state dynamics on nuclear energy will become a crucial issue in the next 40 years.\u201d Taking nuclear energy off the table has already pushed the nation too far in the wrong way.The power from San Onofre and the Rancho Seco nuclear generation station near Sacramento, both now shuttered, added to that from the never-built Sundesert nuclear plant in the Mojave Desert and three planned-but-not-built units at Diablo Canyon on the state\u2019s central coast, would add a total of 77,000 gigawatt-hours of zero-carbon power to California\u2019s supply. Only 27 percent of the power produced in California would come from fossil sources, other things remaining equal, as opposed to 66 percent today. And carbon emissions from power generation would be only 40 percent of what they are today.Nuclear energy cannot compete with natural gas at current prices, of course. But its woes aren\u2019t just about economics. Incorporating the climate costs imposed by fossil fuels would sharply increase the cost of gas generation. But rather than level the playing field, policy makers mostly squeeze nuclear generation further.Consider Germany, which vowed both to replace its nuclear energy with renewable energy sources and to make great strides in combating climate change.At several moments last winter, a high-pressure system reduced wind and solar power to a small fraction of total demand. What if this happened in 2030? About a third of German power comes from renewables, on an average day. Even if the Germans had three times as much renewable generation capacity, there would be periods when it wouldn\u2019t come close to satisfying demand. With no nuclear energy to speak of, the gap would have to be filled with fossil fuels.Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look as if America\u2019s governors and state legislators will take the lesson to heart.Maybe New York\u2019s carbon emissions won\u2019t immediately kick back up. The state government argues that it will fill the gap with renewable energy, gains in efficiency and the like. It has also committed to cutting greenhouse-gas emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. And it is promising that half its power will come from renewable sources.Still, it\u2019s hard not to think that the battle against climate change has, once again, been relegated to the back seat.An earlier version of this column misstated when New York State offered nuclear plants subsidies similar to those available to renewable energy generators. It was in 2016, not \u201cearlier this year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Trump, Three Decades of Chasing Deals in Russia", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byIt was 2005, and Felix Sater, a Russian immigrant, was back in Moscow pursuing an ambitious plan to build a Trump tower on the site of an old pencil factory along the Moscow River that would offer hotel rooms, condominiums and commercial office space.Letters of intent had been signed and square footage was being analyzed. \u201cThere was an opportunity to explore building Trump towers internationally,\u201d said Mr. Sater, who worked for a New York-based development company that was a partner with Donald J. Trump on a variety of deals during that decade. \u201cAnd Russia was one of those countries.\u201dThe president-elect\u2019s favorable comments about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the conclusion of United States intelligence officials that Moscow acted to help Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign have focused attention on Mr. Trump\u2019s business interests in Russia. Asked about the issue at his news conference last week, Mr. Trump was emphatic on one point: \u201cI have no dealings with Russia.\u201d And he repeated, \u201cI have no deals that could happen in Russia because we\u2019ve stayed away.\u201dThe project on the old pencil factory site ultimately fizzled. And by the time Mr. Trump entered the presidential race, he had failed to get any real estate development off the ground in Russia. But it was not for lack of trying.Mr. Trump repeatedly sought business in Russia as far back as 1987, when he traveled there to explore building a hotel. He applied for his trademark in the country as early as 1996. And his children and associates have appeared in Moscow over and over in search of joint ventures, meeting with developers and government officials.During a trip in 2006, Mr. Sater and two of Mr. Trump\u2019s children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, stayed at the historic Hotel National Moscow opposite the Kremlin, connecting with potential partners over the course of several days.As recently as 2013, Mr. Trump himself was in Moscow. He had sold Russian real estate developers the right to host his Miss Universe pageant that year, and he used the visit as a chance to discuss development deals, writing on Twitter at the time: \u201cTRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next.\u201dSeeking deals in Russia became part of a broader strategy to expand the Trump brand worldwide. By the mid-2000s, Mr. Trump was transitioning to mostly licensing his name to hotel, condominium and commercial towers rather than building or investing in real estate himself. He discovered that his name was especially attractive in developing countries where the rising rich aspired to the type of ritzy glamour he personified.While he nailed down ventures in the Philippines, India and elsewhere, closing deals in Russia proved challenging. In 2008, Donald Trump Jr. praised the opportunities in Russia, but also called it a \u201cscary place\u201d to do business because of corruption and legal complications.Mr. Sater said that American hotel chains that had moved into Russia did so with straightforward agreements to manage hotels that other partners owned. Mr. Trump, by contrast, was pursuing developments that included residential or commercial offerings in which he would take a cut of sales, terms that Russians were reluctant to embrace.Even so, Mr. Trump said his efforts put him in contact with powerful people there. \u201cI called it my weekend in Moscow,\u201d Mr. Trump said of his 2013 trip to Moscow during a September 2015 interview on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show.\u201d He added: \u201cI was with the top-level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top of the government people. I can\u2019t go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary.\u201dWhen asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that he had \u201cstayed away\u201d from Russia, Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said it was a fair characterization given that none of the development opportunities ever materialized. Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in Russia, he said, was no different from his attraction to other emerging markets in which he investigated possible ventures. Mr. Garten did not respond to questions about whom Mr. Trump met with in Moscow in 2013 and what was discussed.Ted Liebman, an architect based in New York, got the call in 1996. Mr. Trump and Liggett-Ducat, an American tobacco company that owned property in Moscow, wanted to build a high-end residential development near an old Russian Olympic stadium. As they prepared to meet with officials in Moscow, they needed sketches of the Trump tower they envisioned.The architect scrambled to meet the request, handing over plans to Mr. Trump at his Manhattan office. \u201cI hope we can do this,\u201d Mr. Liebman recalled Mr. Trump telling him.Soon after, Mr. Trump was in Russia, promoting the proposal and singing the praises of the Russian market.\u201cI\u2019ve seen cities all over the world. Some I\u2019ve liked, some I haven\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference in Moscow in 1996, according to The Moscow Times. But he added that he didn\u2019t think he had ever been \u201cas impressed with the potential of a city as I have been with Moscow.\u201dMr. Trump had been eyeing the potential for nearly a decade, expressing interest to government officials ranging from the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev (they first met in Washington in 1987) to the military figure Alexander Lebed.The 1996 project never materialized, but by then Mr. Trump was already well known in Russia. Moscow was in the midst of a construction boom, which transformed the capital from a drab, post-Soviet expanse into a sparkly modern city.Yuri M. Luzhkov, Moscow\u2019s mayor at the time, said in an interview that he had met with Mr. Trump and showed him plans for a massive underground shopping mall just outside the Kremlin gates. Mr. Trump suggested connecting it to the Metro, \u201ca very important observation,\u201d Mr. Luzhkov said. Today, visitors to the Okhotny Ryad shopping center can go straight from the Metro to the Calvin Klein store without venturing into the cold.In the following years, Mr. Trump\u2019s pursuit of Russia was strengthened by a growing circle of partners and associates in Canada and the United States who had roots in the region. Among them were Tevfik Arif, a former Soviet-era commerce official originally from Kazakhstan who founded a development company called the Bayrock Group, and Mr. Sater, a partner in the firm, who had moved to New York from Russia as a child.Bayrock was in Trump Tower, two floors below the Trump Organization. While working to take Trump-branded towers to Arizona, Florida and New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood, Bayrock also began scouting for deals in Russia and other countries.\u201cWe looked at some very, very large properties in Russia,\u201d Mr. Sater said. \u201cThink of a large Vegas high-rise.\u201dWhen Mr. Sater traveled to Moscow with Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. to meet with developers in 2006, he said their attitude could be summarized as \u201cnice, big city, great. Let\u2019s do a deal here.\u201dMr. Trump continued to work with Mr. Sater even after his role in a huge stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals was revealed; Mr. Sater pleaded guilty and served as a government informant.In 2007, Mr. Trump discussed a deal for a Trump International Hotel and Tower in Moscow that Bayrock had lined up with Russian investors.\u201cIt would be a nonexclusive deal, so it would not have precluded me from doing other deals in Moscow, which was very important to me,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a deposition in an unsuccessful libel suit he brought against Tim O\u2019Brien, a journalist.He claimed the development had fallen apart after Mr. O\u2019Brien wrote a book saying that Mr. Trump was worth far less than he claimed. But Mr. Trump said he was close to striking another real estate deal in Moscow.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do one fairly soon,\u201d he said. Moscow, he insisted \u201cwill be one of the cities where we will be.\u201dThe Trump brand did appear in Russia, but not quite as the grand edifice the real estate mogul had envisioned.Trump Super Premium Vodka, with the shine of bottles glazed with 24-karat gold, was presented at the Millionaire\u2019s Fair in Moscow in 2007, and large orders for the spirits followed. The vodka was sold in Russia as late as 2009, but eventually fizzled out. In a news release, Mr. Trump heralded it as a \u201ctremendous achievement.\u201dHe tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to start a reality show in St. Petersburg in 2008 starring a Russian mixed martial arts fighter.But real estate developments remained a constant goal. From 2006 to 2008, his company applied for several trademarks in Russia, including Trump, Trump Tower, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Home, according to a record search by Sojuzpatent, a Russian intellectual property firm.But he told the Manhattan audience that \u201cI really prefer Moscow over all cities in the world\u201d and that he had visited Russia a half-dozen times in 18 months.In 2011, he was still at it. \u201cHeading to the airport to go to Moscow for business,\u201d he tweeted that year.Mr. Trump himself was back in Moscow in 2013, attending the Miss Universe pageant, which he owned with NBC.Earlier that year, at the Miss USA pageant in Las Vegas, he had announced that Aras and Emin Agalarov, father and son real estate developers in Russia, would host the worldwide competition.Erin Brady, that year\u2019s Miss USA winner, who watched the announcement from backstage of the auditorium at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino, said the news was a surprise. She was expecting one of the Latin American countries where beauty pageants are widely celebrated.\u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, Russia, I never thought of that,\u2019\u201d she said.Phil Ruffin, Mr. Trump\u2019s partner in the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas, said he was happy to lend him his new Global 5000 private plane for the trip. He and his wife met Mr. Trump in Moscow, also checking into the Ritz-Carlton. Mr. Ruffin said he and Mr. Trump had lunch at the hotel with the Agalarovs.The Agalarovs also reportedly hosted a dinner for Mr. Trump the night of the pageant, along with Herman Gref, a former Russian economy minister who serves as chief executive of the state-controlled Sberbank PJSC, according to Bloomberg News.Talk of development deals swirled around the visit, and Mr. Trump sent out his tweet, promising that Trump Tower Moscow was coming.But the tower never appeared on the skyline.Jo Becker, Michael Schwirtz and Maria Goncharova contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Can a Bombay Strongman Explain Trump?", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAs I watched Donald J. Trump campaigning, I thought, I\u2019ve seen this show before. It was in the 1990s in Bombay (now called Mumbai). And the man playing the Trump part was Bal Keshav Thackeray, the leader of the Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena party, who rode to power on a wave of outrageous stories, bluster, lies, bigotry and showmanship. He died in 2012 after ruling \u2014 and ruining \u2014 the city I grew up in. The road to understanding Mr. Trump might just lie through understanding Mr. Thackeray, and what became of Bombay.He was a master of the art of the outrage, of politics as performance. He would castigate his opponents as \u201cvampires,\u201d \u201ca sack of flour\u201d and various untranslatable epithets like calling South Indians \u201cyandu-gundus.\u201d Periodically, he would express admiration for Hitler, immediately attracting thousands of news pages of free publicity. He regularly called for books and films that he felt were antithetical to Hindu values to be banned. Egged on by his invective, his legions would go out and beat up artists and journalists.Though Mr. Thackeray neither inherited nor ran businesses as Mr. Trump did, the two men\u2019s support base was remarkably similar in its political contours. The people Mr. Thackeray represented were the native Maharashtrians, the \u201csons of the soil.\u201d The list of his enemies varied with the seasons, from Communists to South Indian migrants to Gujaratis to Muslims and, eventually, North Indians.Working-class Maharashtrians felt excluded from booming Bombay, capital of Maharashtra State, as it made the transition from manufacturing to a postindustrial financial and services economy. They resented both the moneyed cosmopolitan elites as well as the North Indian migrants who competed with them for low-skill jobs.Mr. Thackeray promised to restore their jobs, by threatening mob violence against industrialists who hired non-natives. He promised to make Maharashtra great again by reversing the clock: His idol was the 17th-century warrior-king Shivaji, who held the Mughal emperors at bay. He demanded the requirement of a visa to enter Bombay.Mr. Thackeray played fast and loose with the facts, claiming that the Indian Constitution allowed the imposition of a ban on non-natives in Bombay. His party newspaper, Saamna, was the Breitbart News of its time, chock-full of fake news about Muslims, outsiders, celebrities.Bombay accommodated every faith and was relatively untouched by the mass violence that accompanied the Partition of India in 1947. But after a Hindu nationalist mob destroyed a medieval mosque in the North Indian town Ayodhya in December 1992, Bombay erupted in sectarian riots, which continued through January 1993. More than 1,100 people, most of them Muslims, were killed. Mr. Thackeray organized the violence, leading his troops \u201clike a veteran general,\u201d according to a judicial inquiry.On assuming office, Mr. Thackeray\u2019s party got into bed with the very elites it had scorned. Mr. Thackeray and big business loved each other. Trade unions controlled by his men were much more malleable than the left-controlled ones. On a return to Bombay in 2008, I met the Shiv Sena street fighters I had known in the 1990s, and the Muslims gangsters they had battled. They were all in real estate now. They had been hired by developers to extort slum dwellers into consenting to their houses being razed, in exchange for shabby tower blocks under a government program. The alligators in the Bombay swamp had never feasted better.Mr. Thackeray had no use for theories or data; he was all about action, or the illusion of action. \u201cI like people who can get the things done!\u201d a sign in his office proclaimed. His solutions to the city\u2019s vast problems were precise and petty: rename Bombay as Mumbai; increase water flow in the city\u2019s hydrants to enable the flushing out of rats.Mr. Thackeray was the most powerful man in the city because, like Mr. Trump, he knew how to tell a good story. Mr. Trump\u2019s victory was the triumph of stories over numbers. Hillary Clinton had the research, the voter data. Mr. Trump went with his gut, told stories, ripping yarns. The audience laughed, cried \u2014 and voted.I teach journalism at New York University, and none of the esteemed journalists I know predicted a Trump victory. In the 1980s, nobody in the Bombay elite could predict Mr. Thackeray\u2019s electoral victories. Mr. Trump entertained and outraged. We sought comfort in data. FiveThirtyEight and The Upshot reassured us hourly with numbers predicting a Clinton victory. But people are too sophisticated, too nuanced, too complex, to be captured in numbers. We respond with our head to numbers; we respond with our heart to stories. God speaks to us in stories. The scriptures of every faith are collections of stories, not assemblages of data.Every fall during the Hindu festival of Dussehra, Mr. Thackeray would get on the stage at Shivaji Park in Bombay and deliver a performance lasting several hours, part stand-up comedy, part paranoid conspiracy theory, part scurrilous mockery of his political opponents. Hundreds of thousands of his followers cheered, laughed, engaged in frenzied call-and-response. He never used a written text. A high, or low, point was his mockery of Sonia Gandhi, the Congress Party leader. Mr. Thackeray would pull a sari over his head and mimic the Italian-born daughter-in-law of the Nehru-Gandhi family in a high falsetto, mocking her fumbling Hindi.He used mob violence to rule Bombay. The Muslims who were attacked in the riots were from all social classes. Their killers walked free; they had powertoni.Suketu Mehta\u2019s \u201cMaximum City: Bombay Lost and Found\u201d was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

{"Headline": "Deficits Matter Again", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byWhat wasn\u2019t quite so predictable, however, was that Republicans would stop pretending to care about deficits at almost precisely the moment that deficits were starting to matter again.Those apocalyptic warnings are still foolish: America, which borrows in its own currency and therefore can\u2019t run out of cash, isn\u2019t at all like Greece. But running big deficits is no longer harmless, let alone desirable.But these predictions were always conditional, applying only to an economy far from full employment. That was the kind of economy President Obama inherited; but the Trump-Putin administration will, instead, come into power at a time when full employment has been more or less restored.What changes once we\u2019re close to full employment? Basically, government borrowing once again competes with the private sector for a limited amount of money. This means that deficit spending no longer provides much if any economic boost, because it drives up interest rates and \u201ccrowds out\u201d private investment.No, they\u2019re going to blow up the deficit mainly by cutting taxes on the wealthy. And that won\u2019t do anything significant to boost the economy or create jobs. In fact, by crowding out investment it will somewhat reduce long-term economic growth. Meanwhile, it will make the rich richer, even as cuts in social spending make the poor poorer and undermine security for the middle class. But that, of course, is the intention.But back to deficits: the crucial point is not that Republicans were hypocritical. It is, instead, that their hypocrisy made us poorer. They screamed about the evils of debt at a time when bigger deficits would have done a lot of good, and are about to blow up deficits at a time when they will do harm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eight Was Enough", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byIT wasn\u2019t supposed to end this way for Democrats.Eight years ago, Barack Obama won the presidency promising to transform America. A supremely self-confident politician, Mr. Obama was the object of extravagant hopes that he nurtured and encouraged.What happened?For some of the president\u2019s admirers, the answer is that America has become benighted and bigoted. For others, the culprit is the Republican Party, which obstructed Mr. Obama at every turn. And for still others, like Mr. Obama, the problem is that his administration didn\u2019t do enough to advertise its greatness.Even if you believe there are elements of truth in these explanations, they still amount to excuses. The same country that twice elected Mr. Obama did not suddenly become a nation of deplorables. In his first two years, with Democrats firmly in control of the House and Senate, Mr. Obama won the passage of his sweeping legislative agenda, including the Affordable Care Act, the stimulus package, financial regulations, the extension of jobless benefits and more. As for selling his policies, President Obama was constantly making his case.The decimation of the Democratic Party came because Mr. Obama turned out to be great at poetry and bad at prose.Start with the economy. It\u2019s true that he inherited a wicked recession, that unemployment is much lower than when he entered office and that the stock market has reached an all-time high. On the flip side, the economic recovery has been unusually weak, with annual growth never exceeding 3 percent. (Until Mr. Obama, every president since Herbert Hoover had at least one year of 3 percent growth.) The labor force participation rate is at the lowest it has been since the 1970s. Since 2008, real wages have remained the same or fallen for the bottom four-fifths.To make matters worse, the Obama presidency has been characterized by injurious incompetence, in particular with regard to his signature achievement, Obamacare. The unveiling of the website was a disaster, and the promises the president made \u2014 that Americans could keep their doctors and plans if they chose to \u2014 were false. Mr. Obama guaranteed lower insurance costs to families and lower health costs to the taxpayer; instead, costs rose. Several of the state-run exchanges appear to be headed for collapse.Overseas, the Obama years have been defined by spreading disorder and chaos, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, with nations collapsing and borders dissolving. More terrorist safe havens have been established than ever before. Russia and China have become more aggressive and significantly increased their geopolitical influence. America is now held in brazen contempt by our enemies and mistrusted by many of our allies.It would be silly to lay all the blame for this at the feet of Mr. Obama. Republicans have been rhetorically reckless at times, and President-elect Donald Trump has coarsened public discourse and set Americans against one another in ways that were once unimaginable. But Mr. Obama came first, and he played a role in where we are.In his farewell address last week, President Obama said that for the sake of our democracy we need to heed the advice of the fictional character Atticus Finch, who said, \u201cYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view.\u201dYet Mr. Obama never seemed to consider things from a different point of view from his own. He has shown withering disdain for his opponents, constantly impugning their motives even as he testified to the purity of his own. It was his arrogance that proved to be Mr. Obama\u2019s undoing. (Even leaders of his own party felt Mr. Obama\u2019s derision, as if dealing with them was somehow beneath him.) Mr. Obama dismissed those who disagreed with him like a professor forced to deal with simple-minded, wayward students. He warned us against retreating into our bubbles, but he was never able to escape his own.During the Obama presidency, many people felt unheard and alienated. They are the kind of Americans Mr. Obama had in mind in 2008 when he talked about \u201cbitter\u201d people clinging to their \u201cguns or religion.\u201dBarack Obama is among the most talented campaigners we have ever seen. But as president, he failed in a manner and on a scale that damaged his party, undermined faith in the institutions of government and left the nation more riven than he found it. For most Americans, the economy has been listless. All this helped create the conditions that allowed a cynical demagogue to rise up and succeed him, one who will undo the achievements he most prizes.In many ways Barack Obama and Donald Trump could not be more different. Mr. Obama is equable and graceful; Mr. Trump is erratic and graceless. Yet one cannot make sense of the incoming presidency without understanding the failures of the outgoing one.Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, served in the last three Republican administrations and is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quicken Loans, the New Mortgage Machine", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported by8 PhotosDETROIT \u2014 A low buzz fills the air as an army of mortgage bankers, perched below floating canopies in a kaleidoscope of vivid pinks, blues, purples and greens, works the phones, promising borrowers easy financing and low rates for home loans.By the elevators, nobody blinks when an employee wearing a pink tutu bustles past. On any given day, a company mascot, Simon, a bespectacled mouse, goes on the hunt for \u201cgouda,\u201d or good ideas, from the work force.A visit to the headquarters of Quicken Loans in downtown Detroit may seem like a trip to a place where \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d meets Seussville. But the whimsical, irreverent atmosphere sits atop a fast-growing business in a field \u2014 the selling of the American dream \u2014 that has changed drastically since an earlier generation of mortgage lenders propelled the economy to near collapse in 2008 by issuing risky and even fraudulent loans.In the years since the crisis, many of the nation\u2019s largest banks pulled back their mortgage-lending activities. Quicken Loans pushed in. Today, it is the second-largest retail mortgage lender, originating $96 billion in mortgages last year \u2014 an eightfold increase from 2008.Privately held Quicken, like some of America\u2019s largest banks before it, has also landed in regulators\u2019 cross hairs. In a federal false-claims lawsuit filed in 2015, the Department of Justice charged that, among other things, the company misrepresented borrowers\u2019 income or credit scores, or inflated appraisals, in order to qualify for Federal Housing Administration insurance. As a result, when those loans soured, the government says that taxpayers \u2014 not Quicken loans \u2014 suffered millions of dollars in losses.Quicken Loans today is the F.H.A. insurance program\u2019s largest participant.Executives at Quicken Loans deny the charges, maintaining, among other things, that the government \u201ccherry-picked\u201d a small number of examples to build its case. In an aggressive move, the company pre-emptively sued the Department of Justice, demanding a blanket ruling that all of the loans it had originated met requirements and \u201cpose no undue risks to the F.H.A. insurance fund.\u201dMr. Gilbert, who founded the company in 1985, sold it to the business software company Intuit in 1999, before buying it back with other investors in 2002.He is working to rectify the city\u2019s downtrodden image with streetcars, upscale cafes and boutiques, and fiber-optic data, making him a hometown hero. Late last year, Quicken Loans won a motion to move the Department of Justice case to a federal courthouse roughly three blocks from its Detroit headquarters.Sitting on the edge of a chair in his office, the Motor City\u2019s skyline a steel gray in the late-afternoon November sun, Mr. Gilbert said that his company has been unfairly targeted. \u201cYou want to know what this case is about?\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody probably put up a whiteboard and said, \u2018Here are the 10 largest F.H.A. lenders, now go and collect settlements from them, regardless of whether they did anything wrong.\u2019\u201dIn court documents, Quicken argues it has the lowest default rates in the F.H.A. program. It projects the government will reap $5.7 billion in net profits from the insurance premiums for loans made from 2007 to 2013, after paying out any claims.A spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is home to the F.H.A. program at the center of the case against Quicken, declined to speak about the lawsuit.Late last year, Donald J. Trump named a former Quicken Loans lobbyist, Shawn Krause, to his H.U.D. transition team. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to an email asking about potential conflicts of interest. In an emailed statement, Quicken Loans said the fact that Ms. Krause had come from the largest F.H.A. lender in the country \u201cbodes well for the positive impact she has, and will, make on H.U.D.\u201dIn the years since the financial crisis, Quicken has emerged as a leader in the nation\u2019s shadow-banking system, a network of nonbank financial institutions that has gained significant ground against its more heavily regulated bank counterparts in providing home loans to Americans. Increased regulation and decreased profits sent the nation\u2019s banks packing.Nonbanks, like Quicken, have filled that gap. Today, Quicken is the nation\u2019s second-largest retail residential mortgage lender, behind Wells Fargo, but ahead of banking giants like J. P. Morgan, Bank of America and Citigroup, according to Mortgage Daily.Mr. James is again playing for the Cavaliers. A call to his agent seeking comment was not returned.The year before, Mr. Gilbert got into an altercation at a bar mitzvah, punching a former colleague, David Hall, in the head before he was escorted out by security, according to interviews conducted by the Birmingham Police Department in Michigan. In police documents, Mr. Gilbert\u2019s lawyer said Mr. Hall filed the complaint in order to pressure Mr. Gilbert into paying $2 million to buy out Mr. Hall\u2019s investments in Mr. Gilbert\u2019s companies. The Birmingham city attorney ultimately denied a warrant in the case on the grounds that the charges were not \u201csupported by probable cause.\u201dMr. Hall did not return an email seeking comment. In an email statement, a Quicken Loans spokesman said Mr. Gilbert \u201cdefended himself in a minor confrontation that was instigated by a former employee who was the aggressor.\u201dOn a more trifling scale, after sending text messages about this article to a reporter at The New York Times but not receiving a response \u2014 Mr. Gilbert was texting her landline number by accident \u2014 he followed up with an email accusing the reporter of disconnecting her mobile phone to avoid him. The phone \u201clikely is one of your temporary numbers that you deploy for the surreptitious work that you do,\u201d he wrote.When alerted to the misunderstanding, Mr. Gilbert apologized \u201cfor any of it that was caused on my end.\u201dWhen Mr. Gilbert was asked in an email if he \u201coften strikes a \u2018combative stance\u2019 or \u2018frequently attacks his critics,\u2019\u201d a Quicken Loans spokesman responded in an email, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that when someone with as long and successful career as Mr. Gilbert is forced to defend his integrity and honor from old and/or insignificant already rehashed incidents and accusations from a media source as credible as The NY Times, you would imply that doing such is \u2018frequently attacking\u2019 his critics.\u201dThese days, Mr. Gilbert appears to be itching for a fight with the Justice Department. In court filings, Quicken argued that the three-year government investigation was based on 55 \u201ccherry-picked\u201d loans out of nearly 250,000.Quicken also argued that a longstanding F.H.A. process to resolve loans that did not meet its requirements, through either the repurchase of the loan or by indemnifying F.H.A. from any losses, was retroactively discontinued for Quicken.Since 2011, Mr. Gilbert has spent more than $2.2 billion on downtown Detroit, buying up 95 decrepit properties and rehabilitating them in an effort to lure new tenants. Nike opened a store there last year. The New York burger chain Shake Shack is coming in 2017, as is the sports retailer Under Armour. Mr. Gilbert also notes that he has leased space downtown to several local minority-owned start-up businesses.That sort of presence makes downtown Detroit today seem a bit like a company town, a sort of Quickenville. That\u2019s because Quicken Loans is just one of more than 100 closely knit companies that is owned or controlled by Mr. Gilbert with a footprint in the area. Through his commercial real estate properties, Mr. Gilbert can decide which tenants fit into his vision for downtown Detroit, and which don\u2019t.Lines of bicycles in downtown Detroit are available free for all employees of Mr. Gilbert\u2019s companies. And visitors can bet at the tables at Jack Detroit Casino-Hotel Greektown, a gambling venture controlled by Mr. Gilbert.The Quicken Loans family also includes one of the largest title companies in the United States, an appraisal firm, a call center and In-House Realty, which says on its website that it is the \u201cpreferred real estate partner\u201d of Quicken Loans.With Quicken Loans, Mr. Gilbert has built a game-changing company in the once-staid mortgage-lending industry.Former executives describe Quicken Loans as a technology company that sells mortgages. But the heart that keeps Quicken\u2019s blood moving is the 3,500 mortgage bankers who work its phones. Many new employees come in with little to no background in financial services. One employee joined after delivering pizzas to the Quicken Loans office and becoming interested in working there.Entry-level employees typically make hundreds of calls a day, trying to get potential customers on the phone. Not unlike the assembly lines that put together cars in Detroit, the call is immediately handed off to a licensed mortgage banker, who completes the loan application, then quickly passes it to processing so that he or she can focus on the next loan application.Mr. Gilbert said clients are able to close more quickly on loans when specialists focus on each stage of the loan process. He and other Quicken executives note that the company has repeatedly made Fortune magazine\u2019s list of Best Places to Work For and has earned top marks in J. D. Power client satisfaction surveys.Quicken defines its culture and philosophy through a number of so-called \u201cisms,\u201d created and curated over the years by Mr. Gilbert: \u201cYes before no.\u201d \u201cA penny saved is a penny.\u201d \u201cWe eat our own dog food.\u201dAt the same time, several former employees and executives in interviews described a demanding work environment, with staff members expected to work long hours and weekends to hit targets. In recent years, Quicken and its affiliated companies have faced at least four lawsuits filed by former mortgage bankers seeking overtime.Quicken won one of the overtime cases, but court documents indicate others were directed into settlement negotiations. An email to the various plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers was not returned.And in early 2016, a National Labor Relations Board judge ruled that Quicken and five of its related companies issued an employee handbook with rules that violated workers\u2019 right to engage in various activities, including union-related ones. Quicken has appealed the ruling, calling the policies \u201ccommon, rational and sensible.\u201dWhen asked about criticisms of the work environment, Mr. Gilbert and other executives defended the company, noting that mortgage bankers work an average of 44 hours per week and are compensated well. It is possible for team members, Mr. Gilbert said, to earn over $85,000 in their second year, more than double the median household income for Wayne County, Mich.Quicken Loans\u2019 growing role in parts of the mortgage market may make it a lightning rod for critics.Proponents say that nonbanks like Quicken or PennyMac in California \u2014 which was started by former executives of Countrywide, the mortgage machine in Southern California that was a hotbed of toxic mortgages in the 2008 crisis \u2014 are filling an important void. They argue that they serve people with low to moderate incomes or lower credit scores whom the big banks shun. The big banks, they say, focus instead on so-called jumbo mortgages, or mortgages of more than $424,100, the maximum amount that can be backed by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\u201cThe large banks want to go after the higher-end business,\u201d said Guy D. Cecala, the chief executive and publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.Thanks to low interest rates, home sales are booming and the mortgage market was expected to top $2 trillion in originations in 2016. That\u2019s a far cry from the frothy height of $3.8 trillion that was hit in 2003.Moreover, many other parts of the mortgage machine that were in place leading up to the financial crisis have been dismantled.Still, critics say today\u2019s shadow banks, by focusing on the riskier end of the mortgage market, may be revving up the same parts of the engine that resulted in defaults and foreclosures in the past. Nonbanks, which are typically less capitalized and may have more difficulty reimbursing the government for bad loans, now dominate F.H.A.-insured mortgage loans, according to data from the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s International Center on Housing Risk.In September 2012, banks originated 65 percent of the purchase-mortgage loans insured by the F.H.A., according to the data. Today, that number has more than flipped: Nonbanks originate 73 percent of the loans, with banks\u2019 share dropping to 18 percent.The figures are more spectacular for refinanced mortgages, where nonbanks now make up 93 percent of loans.\u201cThe market has moved to the nonbanks because the nonbanks\u2019 appetite for risk is much higher,\u201d said Edward J. Pinto, a director of the Center on Housing Risk. He has argued that the F.H.A. is not only failing to help low-income communities with its programs, but is actually weakening them with imprudent loans.Mr. Gilbert disputed any \u201cfalse narrative\u201d that claims Quicken faces less regulatory scrutiny, is lightly capitalized or makes risky loans. He said that the average credit score of a Quicken borrower is one of the highest in the nation; that the parent company\u2019s assets \u201care larger than that of 93 percent of all F.D.I.C.-insured depositories\u201d; and that the company is regulated by 50 states, multiple municipalities and numerous federal agencies. Quicken Loans is privately held, and it is unclear what its assets are worth.In an email response to follow-up questions, Mr. Gilbert added, \u201cQuicken Loans underwriting and production is one of the highest, if not the highest, quality production in the entire country.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the growth of Quicken Loans as a retail mortgage lender misidentified Dan Gilbert\u2019s position at the company. He is the founder and chairman, not the chief executive. A capsule summary of the article repeated the error. The article also described the history of Quicken Loans incorrectly. Mr. Gilbert founded the company today known as Quicken in 1985, sold it to Intuit in 1999 and then bought it back with other investors in 2002; he and other investors did not first buy Quicken in 2002 from Intuit, nor had Intuit owned it for about a decade. \u0081Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Davos Elites See an \u2018Abyss\u2019: The Populist Surge Upending the Status Quo", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 For the investors and market-movers at the annual World Economic Forum here, a threat lurks.At cocktail parties where the Champagne flows, financiers have expressed bewilderment over the rise of populist groups that are feeding a backlash against globalization. In the halls of the Davos Congress Center, where many of the meetings this week are taking place, investors have tried to make sense of the political upheaval.The world order has been upended. As the United States retreats from the promise of free trade, China is taking up the mantle. The stark shift leaves investors trying to assess the new risk and opportunities in the global economy.\u201cThis is the first time there is absolutely no consensus,\u201d said William F. Browder, a co-founder of Hermitage Capital Management who has been coming to Davos for 21 years. \u201cEveryone is looking into the abyss.\u201dThe religion of the global elite \u2014 free trade and open markets \u2014 is under attack, and there has been a lot of hand-wringing over what Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund has declared a \u201cmiddle-class crisis.\u201dBut while all attendees in Davos have a view on the state of the world, there is little agreement on how to deal with it.The biggest concern? Finding a way to make the people who are driving populist movements feel like they are part of the global economic pie that Davos participants have created and largely own.In a Twitter post from the Swiss resort, Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a political-research firm, offered his advice: \u201cElites won\u2019t be able to manage populism until they stop seeing it as a threat and start seeing it as a symptom.\u201dIf that is the case, Davos has, so far, made little progress.\u201cI want to be loud and clear: Populism scares me,\u201d Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, said during a panel on how to fix the middle-class crisis. \u201cThe No. 1 issue economically as a market participant is how populism manifests itself over the next year or two.\u201d But Mr. Dalio offered little by way of a solution, beyond opining on the positive aspects of loosening regulation and lowering taxes.On the subject of rising populism, Mr. Dalio, who runs the $150 billion investment firm Bridgewater Associates, added: \u201cIt\u2019s an anti-Davos way of operating.\u201dJack Ma, the founder of Alibaba in China, offered his view of the problem in the United States. Americans, he said, \u201cdo not distribute the money properly.\u201dIf there was one thing that Davos attendees agreed on last year, it was that Donald J. Trump would not win the United States presidential election.And so this year, with Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday coinciding with the end of the World Economic Forum, every conversation has drifted to one question: What will the Trump presidency look like, and what will it mean for business?To many American financiers who once opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, the prospect of fewer regulations and a blank slate with a new leader has assuaged some of the fear about uncertainties. At the forum, some attendees have been thrust into a role of interpreting the president-elect to a befuddled global elite.\u201cHe\u2019s not necessarily communicating in a way that the people in this community would love,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund regular at Davos and onetime critic of Mr. Trump who is now set to join the administration as a public liaison and adviser. \u201cBut he is communicating very, very effectively to a very large group of the population in Europe and the U.S. that are feeling a common struggle right now.\u201dMr. Scaramucci promised that Mr. Trump had \u201cthe utmost respect for Angela Merkel,\u201d the German chancellor who was the subject of an attack by the president-elect this week; that he was in fact a champion of free trade; and that he wanted to have a \u201cphenomenal relationship with the Chinese,\u201d despite his fiery anti-China language.Soon after his appearance on a panel, Mr. Scaramucci was on a plane heading to Washington to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. But his words still resonated, mainly because they were being broadcast on a giant screen behind a coffee bar where World Economic Forum participants congregated between meetings.One Davos regular, the billionaire investor Paul Singer, did not attend this year. Mr. Singer, a vociferous critic of Mr. Trump for most of the election campaign, was instead making his way to Washington for the inauguration, having recently donated $1 million to the event.One major investor has not changed his views about Mr. Trump, however.George Soros, the investor and philanthropist who has called Mr. Trump \u201ca con man,\u201d hosted a dinner on Thursday evening in Davos, during which he said that Mr. Trump \u201cwould be a dictator if he could get away with it.\u201d This was unlikely to happen, he added, because of strong democratic institutions in the United States.For those who have been puzzled over market euphoria since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Soros put it this way: \u201cMarkets see Trump dismantling regulations and reducing taxes \u2014 and that has been their dream.\u201dBut Mr. Soros, who became known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, added that he was convinced that Mr. Trump would fail. \u201cI don\u2019t think the markets are going to do very well,\u201d he said.When President Xi Jinping addressed the Davos forum, becoming the first Chinese head of state to do so, his message was clear: China is ready for the world stage. He championed free trade and open markets, setting the tone for the week.On the sidelines, the country\u2019s business leaders echoed that sentiment.Among the delegation that arrived in Davos with Mr. Xi were some of China\u2019s biggest business leaders including Mr. Ma, Wang Jianlin of Dalian Wanda, and top executives from Baidu, Huawei Technologies and China Telecom. Through the week, they have been meeting with investors and talking deals with erstwhile partners.With Mr. Xi\u2019s help, China has fashioned itself here as a new leader of the free-market world.\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if it was President Xi or Ronald Reagan,\u201d joked Thomas W. Farley, president of the New York Stock Exchange. At a lunch with Mr. Ma of Alibaba, Mr. Xi was quoting Abraham Lincoln, Mr. Ma told a small group of participants on Wednesday.It was a message somewhat at odds with the roots of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party. And back in Washington, Wilbur Ross, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, did not mince words, calling China \u201cthe most protectionist\u201d major economy, setting the stage for a possible trade war.But in Davos, there was a sense that change in the economic order was afoot.Alicia B\u00e1rcena Ibarra, who heads the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, told a small group that China could soon overtake the United States when it comes to importance in Latin America.She described how on the same day last year that Mr. Trump told the world he would not sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Xi arrived for a summit meeting in Chile.\u201cSo can you imagine the impact when he came talking about free trade as he did this morning?\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Xi\u2019s address on Tuesday in Davos. \u201cChina now is the second-most important trade partner of Latin America after the U.S.\u201d\u201cMaybe this is going to change,\u201d she added. \u201cVery soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Narendra Modi\u2019s Crackdown on Civil Society in India", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBANGALORE, India \u2014 Among their common traits, illiberal strongmen share a virulent mistrust of civil society. From Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia to Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Turkey, illiberal governments regularly use imprisonment, threats and nationalist language to repress nongovernmental organizations. Here in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government is going after their money.The Lawyers Collective, an advocacy group in New Delhi run by the prominent lawyers Indira Jaising and Anand Grover, has for three decades provided legal assistance to women, nonunion workers, activists and other marginalized groups, often without charge. In December, the Modi government barred it from receiving foreign grants. The political reasons were obvious: The Collective had represented critics of Mr. Modi\u2019s sectarian record and environmental vision.Under Indian law, nongovernmental groups that seek foreign donations have to register under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act, which prohibits the use of overseas funds for \u201cactivities detrimental to the national interest.\u201d Although accountability in the nongovernmental sector is necessary to control malpractice, the foreign funding law is better known as a tool of political retribution than transparent auditing.It\u2019s not just the Collective that has been punished. The Home Affairs Ministry recently revoked the licenses of around 10,000 other nongovernmental organizations. Even groups whose funding licenses were renewed are worried about the future. \u201cIt is activism on thinning ice from now on,\u201d an education activist told me.The funding law is rooted in Cold War fears about foreign interference in domestic politics. In 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi raised the specter of the \u201cforeign hand,\u201d suspended civil liberties, arrested political opponents, and censored the press for an almost two-year dictatorial stretch known as the Emergency.The new law prohibited political parties, the news media and organizations \u201cof a political nature\u201d from receiving foreign contributions. Social, religious and educational organizations with foreign donors were required to obtain a permit.India has moved away from the paranoid 1970s to a liberalized economy and is embracing the United States and global financial institutions. But the foreign funding law remains a handy weapon whose vague vocabulary (\u201cpublic interest\u201d and \u201cnational interest\u201d) gives the state immense discretionary powers against critics.Mr. Modi\u2019s government has been even more openly hostile to civil society groups. It repeatedly denounces human rights and environmental activism as \u201canti-national\u201d \u2014 a phrase that carries connotations of treason. The patriotic rage is a mask for a more pedestrian motive: punishing pesky critics. In 2016, what is normally a routine license renewal process was used to punish groups that have been critical of Mr. Modi or his policies.The Lawyers Collective has been prominent among such groups. In 2015, Priya Pillai, a campaigner from Greenpeace India, was traveling to London to testify in the British Parliament about coal mining in central Indian forests by Essar Energy, a corporation registered in Britain. Federal officers pulled Ms. Pillai off her flight, arguing that her deposition would have hurt India\u2019s \u201cnational interest.\u201d Ms. Pillai went to court; the Lawyers Collective represented her.Some of these groups are seeking redress in Indian courts, which have largely been fair. But legal battles exact a cost: With bank accounts frozen for months during investigations, bills for rent, electricity and lawyers mount. People\u2019s Watch, a human rights group, was unable to pay salaries for 23 months. Many Greenpeace India employees took pay cuts in 2014. As court duels drag on, campaigns lag, research comes to a standstill and years of community mobilization dissipate.Yet neither Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party nor the Congress Party has had any qualms about accepting campaign funding from foreign businesses. In May 2014, a New Delhi court held both the B.J.P. and the Congress Party guilty of receiving donations from a London-listed company in violation of the foreign funding law.Civil society groups do try hard to raise funds within the country, but Indian philanthropists remain tightfisted when it comes to issues like land or labor rights, health care access, quality of education, or resource exploitation by corporations.\u201cOur rich guys will feed poor kids but won\u2019t question governments,\u201d a fund-raising manager in New Delhi explained.By yanking foreign funding licenses, the Indian government is doing just what it accuses civil society organizations of: working against public interest.Rohini Mohan is the author of \u201cThe Seasons of Trouble: Life Amid the Ruins of Sri Lanka\u2019s Civil War.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s News Conference: Full Transcript and Video", "Date": "2017-01-11", "News": "Supported byAfter the president-elect makes some remarks, he will introduce Ms. Sheri Dillon, a prominent attorney in Washington, D.C., with the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who will \u2014 who structured the agreements pursuant to the president\u2019s business arrangements and she will give brief remarks.Before we start, I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night. It\u2019s frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elect\u2019s campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office.According to BuzzFeed\u2019s own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report. The executive editor of The New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, \u201cTotally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet.\u201dCarter Page is an individual who the president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign. Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time. We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague.In fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague. A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at \u2014 at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game. One report now suggested apparently it\u2019s another Michael Cohen. For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful.With that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today, but I\u2019m even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again.(APPLAUSE)Now, the president-elect\u2019s leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive. But as the chairman of the transition effort, I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring. To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet.Nineteen of the 21 cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a \u2014 it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward. Perhaps that\u2019s why there\u2019s been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration.You know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be. But with freedom comes responsibility. And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it.(APPLAUSE)But today, we\u2019ll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again. And we\u2019ll hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today.So, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the president-elect of the United States of America, Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis. I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it\u2019s good to be with you.But I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years \u2014 a couple in particular \u2014 and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station.So, I just want to compliment many of the people in the room. I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that. But I will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional \u2014 so incredibly professional, that I\u2019ve just gone up a notch as to what I think of you. OK?All right. We\u2019ve had some great news over the last couple of weeks. I\u2019ve been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country. A lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies \u2014 big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest.You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they\u2019re going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant.I appreciate that from Ford. I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler. I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be. I think a lot of people will be following. I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back.We\u2019ve got to get our drug industry back. Our drug industry has been disastrous. They\u2019re leaving left and right. They supply our drugs, but they don\u2019t make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they\u2019re getting away with murder.Pharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there\u2019s very little bidding on drugs. We\u2019re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don\u2019t bid properly and we\u2019re going to start bidding and we\u2019re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.And we\u2019re going to do that with a lot of other industries. I\u2019m very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the F-35, you\u2019ve been reading about it. And it\u2019s way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget. I don\u2019t like that. And the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic. I\u2019ve really gotten to know them well. And we\u2019re going to do some big things on the F-35 program, and perhaps the F-18 program. And we\u2019re going to get those costs way down and we\u2019re going to get the plane to be even better. And we\u2019re going to have some competition and it\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing.So, we\u2019ve been very, very much involved, and other things. We had Jack Ma, we had so many incredible people coming here. There are no \u2014 they\u2019re going to do tremendous things \u2014 tremendous things in this country. And they\u2019re very excited.And I will say, if the election didn\u2019t turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here. They would not be in my office. They would not be in anybody else\u2019s office. They\u2019d be building and doing things in other countries. So, there\u2019s a great spirit going on right now. A spirit that many people have told me they\u2019ve never seen before, ever.We\u2019re going to create jobs. I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. And I mean that, I really \u2014 I\u2019m going to work very hard on that. We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we\u2019re going to do a real job. And I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve done.And we haven\u2019t even gotten there yet. I look very much forward to the inauguration. It\u2019s going to be a beautiful event. We have great talent, tremendous talent. And we have the \u2014 all of the bands \u2014 or most of the bands are from the different \u2014 from the different segments of the military. And I\u2019ve heard some of these bands over the years, they\u2019re incredible.We\u2019re going to have a very, very elegant day. The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special; very beautiful. And I think we\u2019re going to have massive crowds because we have a movement.And we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they\u2019re gonna have a lot of security. They\u2019re going to have a lot of good news for their veterans.And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we\u2019ll do a news release in a little while. Tell you about David, he\u2019s fantastic \u2014 he\u2019s fantastic. He will do a truly great job.One of the commitments I made is that we\u2019re gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans. Our veterans have been treated horribly. They\u2019re waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they can\u2019t see a doctor. By the time they get to the doctor, they\u2019re terminal. Not gonna happen, it\u2019s not gonna happen.So, David is going to do a fantastic job. We\u2019re going to be talking to a few people also to help David. And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more than we have. And we\u2019re gonna set up a \u2014 a group.These are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line. And they\u2019re going to get together with their great doctors \u2014 Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved.Ike Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business. And we\u2019re gonna straighten out the V.A. for our veterans. I\u2019ve been promising that for a long time and it\u2019s something I feel very, very strongly.So, you\u2019ll get the information on David. And I think you\u2019ll be very impressed with the job he does. We looked long and hard. We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good. But we had a lot of talent. And we think this election will be something that will, with time \u2014 with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good \u2018cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly.OK, questions? Yes, John (ph)?A couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we\u2019re looking for further clarification on.And if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States?And \u2014 but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. And I will say, again, I think it\u2019s a disgrace that information would be let out.I saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting. It\u2019s all fake news. It\u2019s phony stuff. It didn\u2019t happen. And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. It was a group of opponents that got together \u2014 sick people \u2014 and they put that crap together.So, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. It should have never been \u2014 number one, shouldn\u2019t have even entered paper. But it should have never have been released. But I read what was released and I think it\u2019s a disgrace. I think it\u2019s an absolute disgrace.As far as hacking, I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. And I \u2014 I can say that you know when \u2014 when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China.We had \u2014 we had much hacking going on. And one of the things we\u2019re gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we\u2019ve assembled. You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world \u2014 they were never in the same room together as a group. And we\u2019re gonna put those minds together and we\u2019re going to form a defense.And I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense.And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through.We have to do that for our country. It\u2019s very important.(CROSSTALK)Now, somebody would say, \u201cOh, of course he\u2019s gonna say that.\u201dI respected the fact that he said that.And I \u2014 I\u2019ll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would\u2019ve released it; they would\u2019ve been glad to release it.I think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would\u2019ve released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her. I mean what he said about her was horrible.If somebody said about me, what Podesta said about Hillary, I was the boss, I would\u2019ve fired him immediately or that person. Because what he said about her was horrible.But remember this: We talk about the hacking and hacking\u2019s bad and it shouldn\u2019t be done. But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking.That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn\u2019t report it? That\u2019s a horrible thing. That\u2019s a horrible thing.Can you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate \u2014 it would\u2019ve been the biggest story in the history of stories. And they would\u2019ve said immediately, \u201cYou have to get out of the race.\u201d Nobody even talked about it. It\u2019s a very terrible thing.Yeah?(CROSSTALK)On that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election.Do you accept that part of the finding? And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place?If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That\u2019s called an asset, not a liability.Now, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m gonna get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t. And if I don\u2019t, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Give me a break.OK?(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)When I leave our country, I\u2019m a very high-profile person, would you say?I am extremely careful. I\u2019m surrounded by bodyguards. I\u2019m surrounded by people.And I always tell them \u2014 anywhere, but I always tell them if I\u2019m leaving this country, \u201cBe very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you\u2019re gonna probably have cameras.\u201d I\u2019m not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.And number one, \u201cI hope you\u2019re gonna be good anyway. But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places. Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can\u2019t see them and you won\u2019t know. You better be careful, or you\u2019ll be watching yourself on nightly television.\u201dI tell this to people all the time.I was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well \u2014 Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well.And I told many people, \u201cBe careful, because you don\u2019t wanna see yourself on television. Cameras all over the place.\u201dAnd again, not just Russia, all over.Does anyone really believe that story?I\u2019m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)Based on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified? Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise? And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it?As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. I have assets that are \u2014 and now people have found out how big the company is, I have very little debt \u2014 I have very low debt. But I have no loans with Russia at all.And I thought that was important to put out. I certified that. So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don\u2019t want to because I think that would be a conflict. So I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals.Now, I have to say one other thing. Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Damack, a friend of mine, great guy. And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai \u2014 a number of deals and I turned it down.I didn\u2019t have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I\u2019m president, which is \u2014 I didn\u2019t know about that until about three months ago, but it\u2019s a nice thing to have. But I don\u2019t want to take advantage of something. I have something that others don\u2019t have, Vice President Pence also has it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll need it, I have a feeling he\u2019s not going to need it.But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president. It was many, many years old, this is for presidents. Because they don\u2019t want presidents getting \u2014 I understand they don\u2019t want presidents getting tangled up in minutia; they want a president to run the country. So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time.I don\u2019t like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one to be able to do that. You can\u2019t do that in any other capacity. But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company \u2014 the country. I\u2019d do a very good job, but I don\u2019t want to do that.Now, all of these papers that you see here \u2014 yes, go ahead.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)And what I\u2019m going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company. They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They\u2019re not going to discuss it with me. Again, I don\u2019t have to do this. They\u2019re not going to discuss it with me. And with that, I\u2019m going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she\u2019s going to go \u2014 these papers are just some of the many documents that I\u2019ve signed turning over complete and total control to my sons.(CROSSTALK)He\u2019s asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he\u2019s taking. As you know, the business empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president. But at that time, no one was so concerned.President-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people\u2019s business and not his own. To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company.He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.Even so, President-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests. He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit. He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law.Critical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him. He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H.W. Bush\u2019s Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center.Mr. Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan. He\u2019s here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump organization.I\u2019m gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking. First, President-elect Trump\u2019s investments and business assets commonly known as the \u2014 as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th. Here is just some of the paperwork that\u2019s taking care of those actions.Second, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump.Further, at the president-elect\u2019s direction, the trust agreement provides \u2014 that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team. The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns.President-elect Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency. President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities.Further, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization. As she and Jared move their family to D.C., Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools.The president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments. As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets. Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics.Second, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with. Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods. Things like Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust.Through instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect trust \u2014 President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric.DILLON: The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump\u2019s presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process.The president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. Because any new deal could \u2014 and I emphasize could \u2014 be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues.The ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts. Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval.To further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization, President-elect Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights. Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole. There will be no separate business by business accounting.Another step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization; the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency.He has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to President-elect Trump\u2019s role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency.In sum, all of these actions \u2014 complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights \u2014 will sever President-elect Trump\u2019s presidency from the Trump Organization.Some have asked questions. Why not divest? Why not just sell everything? Form of blind trust. And I\u2019d like to turn to addressing some of those questions now.Selling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest. In fact, it would exacerbate them. The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization\u2019s assets. If President-elect Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency.Further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect. And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn\u2019t even feasible.Some people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children. This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated. And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now.Some people have suggested that the Trump \u2014 that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company. Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter. It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization.Some people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses. President Trump can\u2019t unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized.DILLON: Further, it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization. The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets. And this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective. It creates a complete separation from President-elect Trump \u2014 it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new deal.I\u2019m going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. That\u2019s a word I think we\u2019ve all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before.And we\u2019re gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.Emoluments comes from the Constitution. The Constitution says \u201cofficials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office.\u201dThe so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder.No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument.But since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm\u2019s-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn\u2019t even aware of.These people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It\u2019s not an emolument.The Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here. But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires.So, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit.In sum, I and president-elect\u2019s (sic) other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we\u2019ve outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family.We believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elect\u2019s desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure.The American people were well \u2014 well aware of President-elect Trump\u2019s business empire and financial interests when they voted. Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.President-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)What is your response to your critics that say not only you, but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest?And do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your \u2014 your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration...(CROSSTALK)I watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general. And he was brilliant. And what people don\u2019t know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama. And he was brilliant yesterday.So, I really think that they are \u2014 I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together. And we\u2019ve been hearing that from so many people. People are so happy.You know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil. When there was a find, he would get it. When they needed something, he would be there.A friend of mine who\u2019s very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm \u2014 big supporter \u2014 he said there\u2019s nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson.And that\u2019s what we want. That\u2019s what I want to bring to government.I want to bring the greatest people into government, because we\u2019re way behind. We don\u2019t make good deals any more. I say it all the time in speeches. We don\u2019t make good deals anymore; we make bad deals. Our trade deals are a disaster.TRUMP: We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis \u2014 hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody. We don\u2019t make good deals anymore.So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they\u2019re smart. And that\u2019s what I\u2019d put, I\u2019m very proud of the Cabinet, I think they\u2019re doing very well.It\u2019s very interesting how it\u2019s going, but it\u2019s \u2014 I think they\u2019re doing very, very well.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)They can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you. In some cases, they guide you incorrectly. In most cases, you realize what\u2019s happened, it\u2019s imploding as we sit.Some states have over a hundred percent increase and \u201917 and I said this two years ago, \u201917 is going to be the bad year. It\u2019s going to be catastrophic. Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the people.We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare. We don\u2019t wanna own it, we don\u2019t wanna own it politically. They own it right now.So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in \u201917 and believe me, we\u2019d get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time. We\u2019re going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary\u2019s approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan.It\u2019ll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour.So we\u2019re gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff. And we\u2019re gonna get a health bill passed, we\u2019re gonna get health care taken care of in this country. You have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can\u2019t even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high.Obamacare is the Democrats problem. We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them. We\u2019re doing them a tremendous service by doing it. We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service.So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we\u2019ll be filing a plan. And it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times. And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare.We\u2019re going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)And then my follow-up question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts?And they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us, a lot. But those were \u2014 that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it\u2019s always tough when they\u2019re building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement.TRUMP: So I wanna thank United Technologies. But we\u2019ve been meeting with a lot of companies. But what really is happening, is the word is now out, that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason, it\u2019s not going to happen that way anymore.You want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you\u2019re going to build that plant in Mexico and you\u2019re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you\u2019re making, and you\u2019re going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border \u2014 not a weak border like it is \u2014 we don\u2019t even have a border. It\u2019s an open sieve.But you\u2019re going to sell through a very strong border \u2014 not going to happen. You\u2019re going to pay a very large border tax. So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina. You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan.You can do anywhere \u2014 you\u2019ve got a lot of states at play; a lot of competition. So it\u2019s not like, oh, gee, I\u2019m taking the competition away. You\u2019ve got a lot of places you can move. And I don\u2019t care, as along as it\u2019s within the United States, the borders of the United States.There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. And you\u2019d have millions more workers right now in the United States that are \u2014 96 million really wanting a job and they can\u2019t get. You know that story. The real number \u2014 that\u2019s the real number.So, that\u2019s the way it is. OK. Go ahead.And on the Supreme Court, what\u2019s your timeline? You said a while ago you were down to four. Have you conducted those interviews yet? What\u2019s your timeline for nominating?And on the border fence, it now appears clear U.S. taxpayers will have to pay for it up front. What is your plan to...(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)On the fence \u2014 it\u2019s not a fence. It\u2019s a wall. You just misreported it. We\u2019re going to build a wall. I could wait about a year-and-a-half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office, but I don\u2019t want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin.I don\u2019t feel like waiting a year or a year-and-a-half. We\u2019re going to start building. Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment \u2014 probably less likely that it\u2019s a payment. But it will happen.So, remember this, OK? I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy. I would then say, who is going to pay for the wall? And people would all scream out \u2014 25,000, 30,000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had. You know that. You don\u2019t like to report that, but that\u2019s OK.OK, now he agrees. Finally, he agrees.But I say who is going to pay for the wall? And they will scream out, \u201cMexico.\u201dNow, reports went out last week \u2014 oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement. What\u2019s the difference? I want to get the wall started. I don\u2019t want to wait a year-and-a-half until I make my deal with Mexico. And we probably will have a deal sooner than that.And by the way, Mexico has been so nice, so nice. I respect the government of Mexico. I respect the people of Mexico. I love the people of Mexico. I have many people from Mexico working for me. They\u2019re phenomenal people.The government of Mexico is terrific. I don\u2019t blame them for what\u2019s happened. I don\u2019t blame them for taking advantage of the United States. I wish our politicians were so smart. Mexico has taken advantage of the United States. I don\u2019t blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of Mexico. What I say is we shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore.So, in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed. OK?Supreme Court judge. So, as you know, I have a list of 20. I\u2019ve gone through them. We\u2019ve met with numerous candidates. They\u2019re outstanding in every case. They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society. Jim DeMint was also very much involved, and his group, which is fantastic, and he\u2019s a fantastic guy.TRUMP: So between Leo and Jim DeMint and some senators and some congresspeople, we have a great group of people. I\u2019ll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the United States Supreme Court, a replacement for the great, great Justice Scalia. That will be probably within two weeks of the 20th. So within about two weeks, probably the second week. I consider the first day because we\u2019ll also be doing some \u2014 some pretty good signings and I think what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll wait until Monday.That will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday, because on Friday, people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration, and then Saturday, as you know, we\u2019re having a big church service and lots of good things are happening. So our first day \u2014 and you\u2019ll all be invited to the signings, but we\u2019ll be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday, and then also the next week. And you\u2019re all invited.But on the Supreme Court, I\u2019ll be making that decision, and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in. I think it\u2019s one of the reasons I got elected. I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court, so I think it was a very, very big decision as to why I was elected.As far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they\u2019re going to suffer the consequences. They already are. And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up \u2014 and by the way, we just found out I was coming down. Michael Cohen \u2014 I was being \u2014 Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer. He\u2019s a good lawyer in my firm. It was just reported that it wasn\u2019t this Michael Cohen they we\u2019re talking about. So all night long it\u2019s Michael Cohen.I said, \u201cI want to see your passport.\u201d He brings his passport to my office. I say, hey, wait a minute. He didn\u2019t leave the country. He wasn\u2019t out of the country. They had Michael Cohen of the Trump Organization was in Prague. It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen. It\u2019s a disgrace what took place. It\u2019s a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen.(APPLAUSE)Go ahead. Go ahead. You\u2019ve been waiting.As far as we understand it, the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news, as you describe it. If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up, that any of it is true, will you consider your position...You know, I\u2019ve been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they\u2019re talking about people that go and say all sorts of things. But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news more so than anybody. I could name them, but I won\u2019t bother, but you have a few sitting right in front of us. They\u2019re very, very dishonest people, but I think it\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have to live with.TRUMP: I guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back. When it happens to somebody that doesn\u2019t have this \u2014 doesn\u2019t have that kind of a megaphone, they can\u2019t speak back. It\u2019s a very sad thing. I\u2019ve seen people destroyed. I\u2019ve seen people absolutely destroyed. And I think it\u2019s very unfair. So, all I can ask for is honest reporters.Yes?(CROSSTALK)I want them to cover this situation. I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly \u2014 because we\u2019re hacked by everybody \u2014 you know, the United States, our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst, it\u2019s number 17, in terms of protection.If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries \u2014 they put this in the category of an industry \u2014 the United States is last in terms of protecting, let\u2019s say, hacking defense. Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National Committee.That\u2019s why we weren\u2019t hacked. By the way, we were told that they were trying to hack us, but they weren\u2019t able to hack. And I think I get some credit because I told Reince, and Reince did a phenomenal job, but I said I want strong hacking defense.The Democratic National Committee didn\u2019t do that. Maybe that\u2019s why the country runs so badly that way. But I will tell you \u2014 wait \u2014 wait \u2014 wait, let me finish. Within 90 days, we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomena \u2014 fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybody.That includes Russia and China and everybody \u2014 everybody. OK.(CROSSTALK)I\u2019ll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody\u2019s leaking it out. So, there\u2019s \u2014 maybe it\u2019s my office. Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people. Maybe it\u2019s them. And what I did is I said I won\u2019t tell anybody. I\u2019m going to have a meeting and I won\u2019t tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence.And what happened is I had my meeting. Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn\u2019t know \u2014 I didn\u2019t tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.So, I don\u2019t want that \u2014 I don\u2019t want that. It\u2019s very unfair to the country. It\u2019s very unfair to our country; what\u2019s happened. That report should have never \u2014 first of all, it shouldn\u2019t have been printed because it\u2019s not worth the paper it\u2019s written on. And I thank the New York Times for saying that.I thank a lot of different people for saying that. But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK.(CROSSTALK)We have to work something out, but it\u2019s not just Russia. Take a look at what\u2019s happened. You don\u2019t report it the same way; 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China. And that\u2019s because we have no defense. That\u2019s because we\u2019re run by people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.TRUMP: Russia will have far greater respect for our country when I\u2019m leading it and I believe and I hope \u2014 maybe it won\u2019t happen, it\u2019s possible. But I won\u2019t be giving (ph) a little reset button like Hillary. Here, press this piece of plastic. A guy looked at her like what is she doing? There\u2019s no reset button. We\u2019re either going to get along or we\u2019re not. I hope we get along, but if we don\u2019t, that\u2019s possible too.But Russia and other countries \u2014 and other countries, including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress, total. Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations.I want to thank everybody. So this is all \u2014 just so you understand, these papers \u2014 because I\u2019m not sure that was explained properly. But these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I hope at the end of eight years, I\u2019ll come back and say, oh, you did a good job. Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I\u2019ll say, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201dGood-bye, everybody. Good-bye.ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With New Congress Poised to Convene, Obama\u2019s Policies Are in Peril", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The most powerful and ambitious Republican-led Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life \u2014 refashioning the country\u2019s social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration.Even before President-elect Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities \u2014 most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s repeal. Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation. Also up early: filling a long-vacant Supreme Court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees.\u201cIt\u2019s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. \u201cAnd we intend to do it.\u201dBut as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals, Democrats are preparing roadblocks. The party\u2019s brutal election-year wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference, Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts. (On Saturday, he offered New Year\u2019s wishes \u201cto all,\u201d including \u201cthose who have fought me and lost so badly they just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d)Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock.For Republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved \u2014 the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink.The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the mid-1990s. Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber.\u201cThey\u2019ve been given a golden opportunity here,\u201d said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. \u201cBut I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand.\u201cIf you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,\u201d Mr. Lott continued. \u201cYou have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you.\u201dThe tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation; the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus.The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for re-election in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time.But on many issues, Senate Democrats \u2014 including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York \u2014 are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201cAfter campaigning on a promise to help the middle class, President-elect Trump\u2019s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he\u2019s sworn in,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. \u201cDemocrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating middle-class families and the economy.\u201dRepublicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many business-related, that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone.\u201cI hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,\u201d the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. \u201cI think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy.\u201dIn late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in mountaintop-removal mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration.But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules\u2019 completion.Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year \u2014 already a quarter over \u2014 that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster. But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama\u2019s, and they may delay the repeal measure\u2019s effective date for years.The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome.Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. \u201cThe senator doesn\u2019t want to rush,\u201d said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer.One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland.Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him \u2014 want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions.While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party\u2019s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well.\u201cThis is no time for hubris,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cYou have to perform.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marshall Plans, Not Martial Plans", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 The carnage of the Syrian government\u2019s assault on Aleppo, enabled by Russia and Iran, was unbearable to watch. Just as unbearable was the realization that the United States could not save the Syrian people from this horror.That\u2019s hard to admit, and harder for those in the middle of this humanitarian nightmare to hear. But the lessons of how Syria arrived at this moment of catastrophe, and how America arrived at this moment of helplessness, are clear. And if the United States does not learn from them, we will repeat them.The first lessons come from our short-term mistakes, which have prolonged the conflict and misery and increased the human toll of the war. Civil wars tend to end by one of three means: One side eventually crushes the other; both sides fight so long that they reach the point of exhaustion; or an outside power steps in with overwhelming influence to force a settlement between the sides.We most likely watched the first scenario play out when the army of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, together with Iranian militias and Russian forces, stormed Aleppo. Our primary mistake was miscalculating the lengths that Mr. Assad\u2019s allies would go to prop up his rule, while believing our halfhearted measures would be enough to tip the balance.The United States was never prepared to do enough to topple Mr. Assad. That was clear when concern over getting dragged into the conflict led both Republicans and Democrats to overwhelmingly oppose President Obama\u2019s request for congressional approval of a limited bombing campaign to respond to chemical weapons attacks on rebel-held areas by the Syrian government.Instead, the United States pursued a policy that prolonged the conflict. We dropped a lot of bombs inside Syria, but only on Islamic State targets, never in government-controlled areas. We trained fighters in a mess of well-meaning but uncoordinated covert and overt programs run by different parts of our national security apparatus.We sent weapons to the rebels, but always stopped short of giving them firepower that would have made the difference \u2014 in part, because we were justifiably afraid that powerful weapons would fall into the wrong hands. Our halfway support for the rebels doomed them: They had enough to continue the fight, but not enough to win or force Mr. Assad to the negotiating table.And when Syrians started to flee their country, we compounded our errors by shutting our doors. Unconscionably, the Republican-controlled Congress refused to allow large numbers of Syrian refugees into America because of bigoted fears of domestic extremism. We played right into the jihadist narrative that says America doesn\u2019t care about the suffering of Muslims, and turned our backs when the world needed us most.The doctors\u2019 precept \u201cfirst, do no harm\u201d applies to foreign policy as well as medicine. Bashar al-Assad is an evil man. The mayhem and misery he has caused is horrific and indefensible. But American policy since 2013 has made the situation inside Syria worse, not better.Even after Iraq, American foreign policy and military elites still cling to the notion that military intervention can bring political stability, somehow, to the Middle East. This is a fallacy.Restraint in the face of evil is hard stuff, but hubris in the face of evil is worse. The United States never should have taken sides in the Syrian civil war. If we had shown restraint from the outset, more people would be alive today.The real question is how to stop societies from descending into civil war in the first place. This is the most important foreign policy question facing the next Congress. The response must start with a recognition that a foreign policy built on brute military strength alone holds few answers for societies caught in a downward spiral.Take Jordan and Lebanon, fragile islands of stability in the Middle East today. Increased American assistance could be the difference between those two nations surviving as functioning states and sliding into a Syria-like chaos. The financial support Jordan and Lebanon need to remain economically viable is a drop in the bucket compared to the cost if either one descended into civil strife.A new Marshall Plan for at-risk countries and regions will not guarantee global security. It took Europe more than 1,500 years after the fall of the Roman Empire to establish peaceful coexistence. In the Middle East, it\u2019s been just 100 years since the Ottoman Empire fell, and the region has not yet found its way to a new order.But what the United States is doing \u2014 using its military to try to bring about political change \u2014 isn\u2019t working. Restraint can feel counterintuitive, even cruel, but the alternative is doomed to failure at a far more cruel cost. The most humane, and effective, policy is to spend money up front to prevent catastrophe.Chris Murphy is a Democratic senator from Connecticut.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The America We Lost When Trump Won", "Date": "2017-01-21", "News": "Supported byOpinionNO, I\u2019m not over it.On Election Day I felt as though I had awakened in America and gone to sleep in Ecuador, or maybe Belgium. Or Thailand, or Zambia, or any other perfectly nice country that endures the usual ups and downs of history as the years pass, headed toward no particular destiny.It\u2019s different here, or at least it was. America was always supposed to be something, as much a vision as a physical reality, from the moment that John Winthrop, evoking Jerusalem, urged the Massachusetts Bay Colony to \u201cbe as a city upon a hill.\u201d To be an American writer meant being able to share that sense of purpose, those expectations, and to flatter yourself that you were helping to shape it. Nobody expects anything out of Belgium.More than any other country, I think, America has been a constant character in the work of its writers. Not only those writers who celebrate it ecstatically, like Walt Whitman, who made his life\u2019s work one long ode to our young nation, or Nathaniel Hawthorne, or Toni Morrison, or E. L. Doctorow, who have picked more critically through its past. It applies as well to those who have scourged it, and exposed the worst of its contradictions and betrayals; a Richard Wright or a Ralph Ellison, or John Reed. It remained a vivid entity even in the work of those who have left it for one reason or another, Henry James or Edith Wharton, F. Scott Fitzgerald or Ernest Hemingway, or John Dos Passos.Their love for it, and their disappointments, all have the same roots, which are those expectations and those dreams. Even at our lowest, we believe with Langston Hughes\u2019s wish to \u201clet America be America again/The land that never yet has been, and yet must be\u201d; with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s overworked but ever more necessary claim that the moral arc of the universe may be long but that here, at least, it bends toward justice. Even its sternest critics agreed: America was going places!I know that it may sound na\u00efve, even childish, to think that any nation has a special destiny. It\u2019s the kind of thing that dictators and demagogues like to tell their people. I doubt if many of the other writers I know would admit they believe in such a big, vague concept as \u201cAmerican exceptionalism.\u201d But we do, most of us. It\u2019s inescapable, considering what we are: the first republic of the modern age, a nation of immigrants, haven to so many peoples from around the world. We have, like no other country, for better and for ill, dominated the modern world through both our hard power and our soft, our weapons but also our ideas.I can tell you all of the worst things we have done. The annihilation of the peoples who lived here before we did, and how much of America was built on the backs of enslaved Africans. The things we have done to other nations weaker than ours, the death squads and the C.I.A. schemes, and all the squalid little wars we\u2019ve waged to grab land or save face. The exploitation and the bigotry, and the withering greed, and how we let the vastness of this continent fool us into believing that no matter how big a mistake we make, we can always start over \u2014 that we can endlessly root up and tear down, and move unmindfully through the world.I have written about many of these things, but that was in a greater cause, too. The absolute conviction, in the end, that I, too, was caught up in the great work; that I was helping us to get to some higher place and fulfill our promise.Geoffrey Ward, the brilliant American historian and the writer of many of Ken Burns\u2019s documentaries, told me with a sense of wonder, a few days after the election: \u201cI just turned 76 and had na\u00efvely assumed that issues I thought resolved when I was a young man \u2014 voting rights, abortion, the ongoing enrichment immigration provides our country \u2014 would remain resolved.\u201dNothing is settled anymore in America, and it appears that so many of the gains we have fought so hard to win over the years are about to be rolled back by our new president and the party that has so cravenly backed him, even when it knows better. Obamacare, which millions of us \u2014 myself included \u2014 depend upon, is already under assault, and Medicare may not be far behind. Who knows what established rights the cadres of far-right justices who will now fill the federal benches for a generation may strike down?Yet when I say that I have lost the America I knew, I\u2019m not talking about policy, or even fundamental rights, disorienting as their loss would be. I mean a greater, almost spiritual faith that I had in my fellow citizens and their better instincts, something that served as my north star in all I wrote and all I did.When I watched the debates and the conventions this year, my thoughts kept going back to my parents, neither of whom lived to see this election. They would have been staggered by the sheer, pounding vulgarity of it all. They were both political moderates, who voted Republican as well as Democratic, and who like most of us never paid all that much attention to politics outside the few weeks before an election. But the phenomenon of Donald J. Trump \u2014 a man who says he has never asked God for forgiveness, who refers to the Eucharist with characteristic humility (\u201cI drink my little wine, which is about the only wine I drink, and have my little cracker\"), who mocks our military heroes, who lumbers about a stage proclaiming, \u201cI alone can fix it!,\u201d who dismissed a working man after the election with a tweet that read in part, \u201cSpend more time working \u2014 less talking\u201d \u2014 would have been incomprehensible to them. They would have thought themselves transported to some other time and country, maybe another dimension. As do I.I have listened to all the blame foisted on the Clinton campaign for doing this or that wrong, or the media for not exposing Mr. Trump, or for giving him too much airtime. I don\u2019t buy it. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign wasn\u2019t that bad, and Mr. Trump was exposed enough for any thinking adult to see exactly what he is.From assorted commentators I have heard that it is unfair or condescending to say that all Trump voters were racists, or sexists, or that they hated foreigners. All right. But if they were not, they were willing to accept an awful lot of racism and sexism and xenophobia in the deal they made with their champion, and demanded precious few particulars in return. Lately Mr. Trump has endorsed the comparison of his personal populist movement with Andrew Jackson\u2019s, and it is true that there was much that was racist and ignorant at the heart of Jacksonian democracy. For their love, the followers of Old Hickory demanded the destruction of Native American civilization in the South, and the furthering of slavery westward. This cruel bargain won Jackson voters land, and thus the vote. What have those who embraced \u201cMr. I Alone Can Fix It\u201d obtained, save for the vague, grandiose promise, renewed in his inaugural, that they will soon \u201cstart winning again, winning like never before\u201d? Or \u2014 worse \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to end \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and make this, at least rhetorically, the same white man\u2019s America it was in Jackson\u2019s time?I know that Mr. Trump was elected, in part, because too many people were still hurting in this economy, from the terrible disruptions of their lives and their communities over the last 25 years. I have been poor and desperate myself, and I know what that feels like. In their giddy rush to globalization and the paper economy, too many liberal \u2014 and conservative \u2014 leaders have made the same mistake that they made in Vietnam, when they tried to palm that misbegotten conflict off on the poor and the working class. They have forgotten \u2014 again \u2014 that this great nation will endure and will prosper only if we all prosper together.Yet that is no excuse for what we did last November.Throughout our history, Americans have encountered economic shocks much worse than anything we know today, and with many fewer resources at their disposal. American working people have agency, they are plenty educated, and in past crises they rejected the extremism that other nations turned to. Even in the Great Depression they did not succumb to the ideologies of Fascism and Communism sweeping the world. When the system seemed broken in the past, when the elites and the major parties seemed irretrievably corrupt and deaf to their appeals, their response was to build true democratic movements from the ground up, and to push them on to victory even if that took decades.The populists after the Civil War, faced with the collapse into peonage of American farmers \u2014 then about half the population \u2014 built nationwide lecture and correspondence networks, and eventually won the reforms they needed, even though it took them more than 60 years. The first wave of feminists fought for more than 70 years to win their biggest demand; Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were dead by the time women got the vote. African-Americans battled ceaselessly, in every way they could, against their enslavement and Jim Crow, training their own lawyers to take their cases to the Supreme Court. The struggles for labor rights, gay rights, Hispanic rights, civil liberties, religious toleration, women\u2019s control over their own bodies \u2014 all these battles and more took decades to win. They are the glory of our civilization.Today\u2019s passive, unhappy Americans sat on their couches and chose a strutting TV clown to save us.What they have done is a desecration, a foolish and vindictive act of vandalism, by which they betrayed all the best and most valiant labors of our ancestors. We don\u2019t want to accept this, because we cannot accept that the people, at least in the long run of things, can be wrong in our American democracy. But they can be wrong, just like any people, anywhere. And until we do accept this abject failure of both our system and ourselves, there is no hope for our redemption.A couple of days after the election I watched on CNN as red-faced Russian apparatchiks in Moscow toasted one another on their great success. \u201cHurrah!\u201d I thought. \u201cNo more American exceptionalism! We have joined up with the drunken idiot of history!\u201d Once Russians, too, and especially Russian writers, were certain that there was a special destiny for the Russian soul. But a century of disastrous choices and their consequences seems to have disillusioned them. They have so much to teach us.Kevin Baker is a novelist and essayist and the author, most recently, of \u201cAmerica the Ingenious.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But there they were, amid spacious parks, plazas and tree-lined avenues: a train station, a theater, a palace, some government buildings.Yet that grandeur from the 1930s \u2014 when Goi\u00e2nia was founded as an example of forward-looking cosmopolitanism in Brazil\u2019s hinterland \u2014 has faded. Landmark buildings have been torn down to make way for nondescript towers, and graffiti envelops many structures.Some Brazilians write off Goi\u00e2nia, far from S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, as their version of Midwestern flyover country. But farming and ranching generates much of the country\u2019s wealth and influences Brazilian culture these days, even if the region sometimes neglects its own complex and sophisticated history.As envisaged by the pioneering architect Att\u00edlio Corr\u00eaa Lima, Goi\u00e2nia seems to have had a more inviting feel than Bras\u00edlia\u2019s austere modernism. Here\u2019s the same gazebo in the early 1940s, back when Goi\u00e2nia was planned for just 50,000 residents.Some landmarks persist, albeit in graffiti-splattered disrepair, like the Grande Hotel.Either way, Goi\u00e2nia, only about 80 years old, is still clutching for some history. The main plaza downtown is named officially for Mr. Corr\u00eaa Lima, the architect. But most people call it the Pra\u00e7a do Bandeirante, after the S\u00e3o Paulo explorers who went into the back country on slave-hunting missions.Brazil was searching for myths in 1942 when the authorities unveiled the statue of Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva, an 18th-century bandeirante. To this day he is better known as Anhang\u00fcera, \u201cOld Devil\u201d in the Tupi indigenous language, a name evoking the brutal methods conquerors used to take possession of the lands on which Goi\u00e2nia was built.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Call to Create Jobs, or Else, Tests Trump\u2019s Sway", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump summoned the titans of American business to the White House on Monday for what was billed as a \u201clistening session,\u201d but it was the new president who delivered the loudest message: Bring back domestic manufacturing jobs, or face punishing tariffs and other penalties.The contrast between Mr. Trump\u2019s talk and the actual behavior of corporate America, however, underscored the tectonic forces he was fighting in trying to put his blue-collar base back to work in a sector that has been shedding jobs for decades.Many of the chief executives Mr. Trump met with have slashed domestic employment in recent years. What is more, their companies have frequently shut factories in the United States even as they have opened new ones overseas.Mr. Trump said he would use tax policy, among other means, to deter companies from shifting work abroad. \u201cA company that wants to fire all of its people in the United States and build some factory someplace else, then thinks that product is going to just flow across the border into the United States,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201dWall Street is pushing industrial companies to increase earnings at a double-digit rate when the American economy is growing by only 2 percent, and the quickest way to deliver higher profits is by reducing labor costs, whether through automation or by moving jobs to cheaper locales like Mexico or China.Just as significant is the desire by multinational corporations to go where the growth is, and many emerging-market economies, as well as China, are growing at more than twice the rate of the United States.A look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.At the end of 2015, Dow employed 49,500 people, about half of them in the United States, nearly 5,000 fewer than it did at the end of 2012. During the same period, the number of domestic Dow manufacturing locations fell to 55, from 58, but increased by five in Latin America and Asia.Dow is hardly the only company to reduce its head count in recent years. International Paper, whose chief executive also attended the White House meeting, had its work force in the United States fall to roughly 34,000 in 2015, about 2,000 fewer than at the end of 2010.Mr. George noted that Ford Motor, which Mr. Trump has tangled with and whose chief executive was at the White House on Monday, employed a fraction of the workers it did two decades ago because its production lines were now highly automated.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get C.E.O.s to come in on the first day of his presidency and warn them they are on watch,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cI believe a lot of the C.E.O.s in that room want do the right thing and create jobs in America, but the realities of Wall Street pressure and a globalized economy leads them to offshore a lot of these jobs.\u201dMr. Trump made clear on Monday that his plan to reshape the economy and revive the manufacturing sector went beyond exhortations, however. Taxes are up next, he suggested, and when it comes to tax policy, one of his top priorities is to punish American companies that move jobs abroad.To curb such behavior, Mr. Trump said, he plans to impose a \u201csubstantial\u201d border tax on such firms. In the past, he has said the tariff could be as high as 35 percent.The logistics of such a tax continue to befuddle both Republicans and Democrats. Many wonder what penalties companies such as General Motors, which already has a plant in Mexico, might face, or what would happen to a technology giant such as Apple that has contracts with manufacturers in China but does not manufacture there itself.\u201cEverything he\u2019s said about this has been so vague and ill defined, it\u2019s hard to think about it sensibly,\u201d Mr. Strain said. \u201cIt could be that the business community really starts pushing back against this stuff and it becomes a broader fight.\u201dDuring the meeting on Monday, Mr. Trump also made the case that building in the United States would soon become a more cost-effective proposition because of his plans to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 or 20 percent and to reduce regulations.He pointed to onerous environmental regulations as one area where changes could be on the way, and he insisted that, despite the more lax regulatory environment, protections would improve under his administration.\u201cThere will be advantages to companies that do indeed make their products here,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Of course, financial considerations like taxes and regulations alone do not guide corporate decision making.Terry Gou, the chairman and founder of the Foxconn Technology Group, the largest contract electronics manufacturer in the world, is weighing a major investment to build a factory in the United States.Mr. Gou, speaking at a company event in Taiwan on Sunday, suggested that the factory, a $7 billion plant making flat-panel screens, could create 30,000 to 50,000 jobs and that Pennsylvania was the front-runner as a likely location.Technology analysts were puzzled by the job projections Mr. Gou described because flat-panel displays, like computer chips, are produced in highly automated factories. But if Foxconn does proceed with a factory in the United States, it will be as much a matter of the politics of trade as the industrial economics of high-tech manufacturing, analysts said.Foxconn is based in Taiwan, but its largest operations are in China. Apple is its biggest customer, representing about half of Foxconn\u2019s sales, and opening an American plant might be a way to alleviate White House pressure on Asian exporters like China and Taiwan.Steve Lohr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Erdogan Says Troops Will Be in Cyprus \u2018Forever,\u2019 Complicating Hopes of Reuniting", "Date": "2017-01-13", "News": "Supported byGENEVA \u2014 Turkey\u2019s president declared on Friday that Turkish troops would remain in Cyprus \u201cforever,\u201d complicating hopes of reuniting the island nation, which has been effectively partitioned since 1974.\u201cGreece is fleeing again from a solution to the Cyprus problem,\u201d the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told reporters in Istanbul on Friday. \u201cTurkey will be in Cyprus forever.\u201dThat said, Mr. Erdogan often takes a firmer line with domestic audiences than with foreign ones, and diplomats said they remained cautiously optimistic.In 1974, a coup sponsored by the military junta that controlled Greece at the time ousted the government of Cyprus, and Turkey invaded, arguing that the Turkish Cypriots needed its protection. The nation has been largely stable and peaceful for decades, but this is one of the world\u2019s thorniest and longest conflicts.Since the late 1970s, leaders of both the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots have agreed in principle on a \u201cbizonal, bicommunal federation\u201d as the basis for reunification, but have different understandings of that term.Among the key issues in dispute are the return of displaced Cypriots and the handling of their property, repatriation of Turkish settlers, demilitarization of the island, and the future role of Greece, Turkey and Britain.Mr. Erdogan on Friday said firmly that Turkey would not withdraw from the island as long as Greek troops were also stationed there. \u201cFull withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus is not possible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this is being discussed, then both sides must withdraw.\u201dThe Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, maintained the Turkish position while also leaving room for negotiation.\u201cTaking into consideration the current situation in our region, the continuation of the security and guarantees system, which has been the solid basis of the 43-year-long security and stability on the Island, is a necessity,\u201d Mr. Cavusoglu said in the statement, referring to the system of guarantors, which Turkey used as its rationale for the 1974 invasion. \u201cWe expect this issue to be discussed in line with the realities on the island.\u201dCypriot leaders held out hope for an agreement.The Greek Cypriot leader, Nicos Anastasiades, noted that both sides had submitted maps detailing the redrawing of internal boundaries, a promising first; that Turkey had agreed to discuss the issue of the security guarantees, itself a sign of progress; and that both sides had made progress in discussing areas like governance, the economy and Cyprus\u2019s involvement in the European Union, which it joined in 2004, notwithstanding the divisions.Mr. Anastasiades and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mustafa Akinci, both said that they had agreed that the security of one community should not be perceived as a threat by the other community.\u201cThe point is, where can you strike a balance: How can you find the ways and means so that both communities of this beautiful island can feel safe and secure?\u201d Mr. Akinci said, adding that the Turkish Cypriot community \u201cfeels that they need the continuation of some sort of a guarantee coming from Turkey.\u201d\u201cThis is how they feel,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the polls, more or less, say the same thing. How can we deal with this issue so that it\u2019s acceptable by the other party?\u201dHe added: \u201cWe are here to discuss all these issues. There are no taboos.\u201dThe last time a peace deal was close at hand, in 2004, it was accepted by the Turkish Cypriots in a referendum but rejected by the Greek Cypriots. All sides are trying to avoid a repeat of that experience.Mr. Akinci said that reunification would lead to major economic benefits, including the possibility of channeling natural gas deposits through Cyprus to Turkey and Europe, and distributing water that is currently piped to northern Cyprus from Turkey across the whole island.Turkish Cypriots are estimated to make up about one-fifth of the island\u2019s population, and the Greek side had proposed a rotating presidency, but how it would be carried out remains in dispute.Asked about Mr. Erdogan\u2019s remarks, Espen Barth Eide, the United Nations secretary general\u2019s special adviser for Cyprus, said he did not think the talks were in trouble.Negotiations on technical matters have been scheduled for Wednesday, and Mr. Eide said, \u201cWe\u2019re close to completion\u201d on five areas of agreement \u2014 not including the issue of security and guarantees. \u201cNot easy, but the will is there,\u201d he said, while reminding both sides that \u201cwe must not lose any time.\u201dMr. Eide added, \u201cIt will be hard.\u201dNick Cumming-Bruce reported from Geneva, and Andreas Riris from Nicosia, Cyprus.

{"Headline": "Run-Up Since Election Slows as Investors Consider Risks", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byWith just days to go before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president, once ebullient markets have eased a bit as investors have begun to ponder more seriously the risks of a Trump administration.After a run-up in the weeks after Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory, stock markets in the United States have been little changed in the last month \u2014 with investors on several occasions stepping back, as opposed to elevating the Dow Jones industrial average past a 20,000 milestone.The concerns include a dollar that has gained too much in value, worries about trade wars with China and Mexico and, most broadly, a fear that Mr. Trump will not be able to deliver on his promises to cut taxes, increase government spending and reduce regulation.The market declines in recent weeks have been very modest, and investors, for now, seem to be prepared to give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt on his plans for the economy.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments over the weekend about the dollar being too strong, about the possibility that more countries will follow Britain out of the European Union and his intention to tax German carmakers for not building factories in the United States all heightened these concerns.\u201cPeople are concerned about an appreciating dollar, how much higher rates will go and antagonizing China,\u201d Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of the asset management giant BlackRock, said in an interview last week. \u201cThere has been too much conversation about the glories of the U.S. stock market.\u201dOn Tuesday, the dollar\u2019s main index, which is measured against the world\u2019s top currencies, dropped by more than 1 percent. Even beaten-down currencies like the Turkish lira and the Mexican peso \u2014 among the world\u2019s weakest performers in the last month \u2014 gained ground against the dollar.Economists have warned that an overly strong dollar can hurt the United States economy in several ways. America\u2019s trade deficit would widen as exports stagnate and cheaper goods from Mexico and China flood the market. A long period of a strong dollar also increases the chances of an emerging market crisis, when crucial investment funds flee currencies that are plummeting against the dollar.The price of gold, a traditionally safe investment, was up by nearly 1.5 percent on the day. The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose, driving its yield \u2014 an important benchmark for interest rates \u2014 down to 2.33 percent from the previous close, 2.4 percent, a sign that investors are searching for safety instead of returns by loading up on government bonds.And stocks in the United States continued to search for direction in the absence of tangible developments on Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for the economy.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed at 2,267.89 on Tuesday, down 0.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down by the same percentage, at 19,826.77. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.63 percent to 5,538.73.Mr. Fink\u2019s view, which is shared by many investors with a global outlook, is that while the president-elect has made bold promises about the need to energize what has been a tepid recovery for the nation\u2019s economy, such transformations do not occur quickly.\u201cThese things take months and years to do,\u201d Mr. Fink said.While stock market specialists are in broad agreement that the Trump rally has more room to run, some are beginning to question whether the marked increase in stocks has gone as far as it can without tangible policy results in the form of lower taxes and government spending initiatives.\u201cI wonder if the euphoria has exceeded the fundamentals,\u201d said David Lafferty, chief market strategist for Natixis Global Asset Management. \u201cThe stock market is pricing in a Reagan-type scenario.\u201dLike many, he worries that such a bout of fiscal expansionism so late in the economic cycle will lead to a sharp increase in prices and a sudden move by the Federal Reserve to play catch-up by raising interest rates faster than the market expects.Economists and investment strategists are also warning of possible global shocks that could unnerve the markets in the next year.While some of these upsets may be driven by the growth of populist political movements, across Europe in particular, this higher volatility would kick in as central banks cease intervening so aggressively in markets.Jens Nordvig, a currency specialist at Exante Data, highlighted three such concerns in a recent letter to clients. He cautioned that it had been 15 years since the last full-fledged emerging market crisis and pointed to Turkey\u2019s plunging currency and capital outflows in China as two areas of concern.He also listed a potential breakup of the European Union and any move by Mr. Trump to impose tariffs or other penalties on imports as events that could destabilize markets.\u201cIt is a complex world, with messy answers to questions that seemed simple fairly recently,\u201d Mr. Nordvig wrote in his note. \u201cAnd in this world, significant macro shocks will be more prevalent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Mexican Leaders, a Turbulent Start to the New Year", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byThis week a jump in gasoline prices unleashed widespread protests that spiraled into looting. The country received an ominous warning that President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric could have concrete effects when Ford Motor canceled a $1.6 billion investment. The peso fell to its lowest level ever.The new turmoil promises to make this year even more difficult for President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, whose approval ratings have already plunged below 25 percent.He returned from a golf vacation on Wednesday and appealed for unity as images ricocheted across social media of people carting away televisions from Walmarts and stealing snack foods from stalled delivery trucks.Protests continued on Thursday, as demonstrators blocked highways and gas stations. Scattered looting continued, and marches are planned for this weekend to demand a reversal of the price increases. The president\u2019s explanation that the gasoline increase of almost 20 percent was necessary to maintain economic stability did nothing to calm the outrage. \u201cEven in good times, it is a problematic decision\u201d to raise gasoline prices, Vidal Romero, a political analyst at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, said. \u201cAnd this is a very bad moment.\u201dOn Tuesday, Ford announced that it was canceling its planned investment to build a small-car plant in the state of San Luis Potos\u00ed. Although falling sales of small cars may have had more to do with Ford\u2019s decision than Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism on Twitter, the president-elect promised that the Ford episode was just \u201cthe beginning.\u201dAt the brief ceremony to announce Mr. Videgaray\u2019s return, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto seemed to address the upheaval caused by the gas prices as an afterthought. \u201cI repeat, it hasn\u2019t been easy to take this measure,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said. \u201cBut it is with a sense of responsibility to safeguard the stability of our economy.\u201dTalk of economic sobriety sits poorly with Mexicans, disgusted by a series of political scandals. \u201cThis is a government with a terrible record of corruption,\u201d Mr. Romero said. \u201cState, federal \u2014 everything smells of corruption.\u201dThe gas-price increase was approved last year by Congress as part of an austerity budget designed to insulate Mexico from the market uncertainties of Mr. Trump\u2019s rise. The government plans to let prices \u2014 which have long been controlled and subsidized \u2014 float by the end of the year. This should lead to competition, and eventually lower prices. \u201cThe incredible thing is that the government didn\u2019t expect the reaction,\u201d said Ignacio Marv\u00e1n, a political analyst at CIDE, a Mexico City university.Truck and taxi drivers have blocked highways since Sunday.

I would love to help usher in a new era in Gambia and help the children have brighter futures. The biggest factor that could influence my decision would be safety concerns. Truly look forward to being able to go home for the 1st time in 27 years.\u201d\u201cI believe this government will avail me the rights that Jammeh denied every Gambian for 22 years. Freedom of speech, freedom from fear of being fired unlawfully from your job and fear of a relative getting arrested.\u201d\u201cTerm limits will not only ensure we don\u2019t have another Yahya Jammeh with a 22-year rule, but the practice will also deter unnecessary military takeovers, an undemocratic act that has always bedeviled the African continent.\u201d\u201cI think one of the fundamental flaws of the previous regime was its disregard for constitutionalism and the tenets of democracy, which ultimately enthroned a dictatorship that we had to endure for 22 years.

Gambia needs capital to avoid a financial crash. People are free but without a strong economy.\u201d\u201cThis feels like being born again, and the feeling of patriotism is coming back again. There were literally no opportunities to make it in the country unless you had ties with the government. Now that is out of the way, we would like to see reforms, especially education, health and infrastructure, job creation and, of course, firstly a newly drafted constitution.\u201d\u2014 Omar Njie, 28, a graduate student in Ankara, Turkey.\u201cI hope he implements teaching students the Gambian Constitution, as it will always pay in the future. Gambians are promised free speech, assembly, to protest, etc., but they do not know this, as it was suppressed under the previous government. Example is the U.S.: Some people do not know their state governors, district congressmen/women, vice president of the U.S. or the other branches exist, but they know they have the right to free speech, press, assembly, etc.\u201d\u201cMy first point is for the new administration to change the Islamic Republic to just the Republic of the Gambia as the country is built on diversity of religion culture and tribe as well.\u201d\u201cSocially, the last regime destroyed the very \u2018sacred\u2019 fabric of the Gambian social contract and that is empathy and trust. Gambians cared for and trusted each other in a way that led us to claim that our \u2018teranga\u2019 (hospitality) was unparalleled around the world. Due to the fear and mistrust that Jammeh\u2019s brutal regime caused, this unique trait was almost completely lost.\u201d\u201cThe United States, indeed the entire rest of world, must support the transition in Gambia. Countries not just in Africa, but around the globe, need to see the positive benefits of a change from authoritarian to democratic rule that institutes a legitimate government and respects human rights. It must be clear to all that such a government delivers not just abstract principles, but real concrete benefits. Foreign support and assistance can help that happen.\u201d\u2014 Ousman Njie, 47, the head of Catholic Relief Services\u2019 Gambia office in Banjul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The BMW X4 M40i Is Fast, if Not Practical", "Date": "2017-01-19", "News": "Supported byDrivenTHE BMW 3 Series is such a classic that it\u2019s easy to lose sight of how many different vehicles the Bavarian company produces. It has some 15 distinct models, like the 5 Series, X5 S.U.V. and i3 electric car. And nearly every model has multiple variations. The 3 Series alone has 13 configurations when powertrains and body styles are tallied \u2014 and 14 if you count the M3 performance sedan.To riff off BMW\u2019s tagline, this automaker is the Ultimate Variant Machine.One of its most curious models, though, is the X4. Basically, it\u2019s an X3 sport utility with the useful boxy back end sliced off and a smidgen of back-seat headroom excised. It also comes in an M40i version, which adds 115 more horsepower to the 240 that comes with the 28i version.That extra power makes right feet happier, but this isn\u2019t quite the M-version that true enthusiasts lust after. The X4 M40i is an \u201cM Performance\u201d vehicle, not a full potency M car like the M2, M3, M4 or the X6 M (which looks like the X4\u2019s bigger meaner brother).Still, it is hard to resist the 355 horsepower and 343 pound-feet of torque produced by the M40i\u2019s 3-liter in-line twin-turbo 6-cylinder engine. It hauls this 4,200-pound raised hatchback from rest to 60 miles an hour in 4.7 seconds, charging toward what BMW says is a 150 m.p.h. top speed. (I value my driver\u2019s license too much to verify BMW\u2019s claim.)The M40i\u2019s hardware includes a smooth and sure 8-speed automatic with steering wheel paddle shifters. Drive modes start at mild Eco Pro and climb to edgy Sport Plus. It not only changes the steering, transmission, throttle and stability control characteristics, but also alters the M40i\u2019s adaptive dampers and retunes the musical note burbling from the dual exhaust.All X4s grip the road with all-wheel drive tuned with a rear power bias.The suspension is calibrated toward sport with those adaptive dampers keeping things more comfortable than one might expect. The electrically assisted steering is accurate and nicely weighted but kind of numb. Also, this machine\u2019s center of gravity is on the higher side, affecting cornering feel if not ability. That\u2019s just physics. Enthusiasts needing cargo space might check out BMW\u2019s 330i xDrive Sport Wagon or the excellent Porsche Macan S.The Environmental Protection Agency rates the M40i\u2019s fuel economy at 19 miles per gallon in city driving and 26 on the highway, using specified premium gasoline. Romping on it, I saw 18 miles per gallon in mixed driving.Those familiar with BMW will instantly recognize the cabin. Materials look and feel great, but at $67,495 as tested, where is the cut and sewn dashboard and LED accent lighting? Moderately bolstered seats with thigh extensions should coddle most drivers and passengers. It wouldn\u2019t be a BMW without the iDrive user interface. Some people love it; others loathe it.The rear door openings are a little on the tight side. At 5-foot-9, I have just enough headroom. The seat cushion is low, reducing thigh support. A third adult dealing with the drive shaft tunnel in the middle back seat might think twice about climbing in. Stuff can be stashed, phones can be charged and bottoms can be warmed. If your friends and family are tall, there\u2019s always the X3, though it can\u2019t be had with as much power.The sloped rear of the X4 won\u2019t accommodate big boxes in the trunk the way the squared-off X3 can, but for everyday use it doesn\u2019t really affect the space. It easily holds luggage for four.The M40i starts at $59,095, and many buyers will want options like the $2,750 technology package for its navigation and head-up display and the $950 cold weather package to get heat for all the seats and the steering wheel. A basic backup camera costs $400. You could settle for the 28i version at $46,545 and start piling options on from there, but the right pedal of the M40i offers 115 reasons not to (as well as the lovely Long Beach blue metallic paint exclusive to M Performance cars).The X4 M40i fills a curious niche, a variant for those craving a raised high-performance all-wheel-drive hatchback. If BMW sells a bunch of these, more power to it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putting More Women on a Path to Political Power", "Date": "2017-01-16", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 About five decades since the surge in modern feminism, it is unlikely that most women \u2014 in the United States, at least \u2014 would have anticipated the current political climate in which gender equality remains almost as elusive as ever and long-ago-won rights are under siege.What is more, a man criticized by many for his treatment of women will be sworn in as president of the United States on Friday. And in 2016, a woman still could not be elected to the job.After the gamut of emotions engendered by Hillary Clinton\u2019s surprising loss to Donald J. Trump, women are once more confronting the big questions that have long enveloped the feminist quest. Put bluntly, is it sexism or the system that has so far prevented a woman from becoming president of the United States? And what lessons might be drawn from Europe, or places further afield, that could help an American woman get to the top one day?If the fight for women\u2019s rights has taught activists one thing, it is that simple questions have complex answers.Melanne Verveer, executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and former ambassador at large for global women\u2019s issues under President Obama, said that \u201cto just look at this election through the gender lens is not to understand it fully.\u201dThough many women saw Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, as the most qualified candidate, other women felt no tug to help one of their own shatter a glass ceiling and instead \u201creached a conclusion that they might be better off with a change,\u201d Ms. Verveer said.\u201cI think people would like to think there has to be one good explanation,\u201d said Shauna Lani Shames, an assistant professor of political science at Rutgers University-Camden in New Jersey. \u201cBut there is not. It\u2019s many.\u201d What she called the \u201cdeeply ingrained sexism\u201d of a country fond of cowboy myths and tales of the Wild West is one. There are others.For starters, look at how the United States chooses candidates.\u201cSelection is mostly about people self-recruiting,\u201d Dr. Shames said. \u201cYou have to self-identify as a candidate, and often win a primary before the party will take note of you.\u201d Just the expense and time away from family involved turn many women off, leaving a smaller pipeline.Even the basic act of asking for money \u2014 essential to any political bid in the United States \u2014 hurts women more, she argued: \u201cWomen hate it more than men do. Men tend to be in social circles where they can raise more money.\u201dMrs. Clinton was criticized last summer when her annual sojourn in the wealthy enclaves of the Hamptons became studded with fund-raisers. (Mr. Trump made his own round of fund-raisers there, to perhaps less attention.)In Europe, women can work their way up the ladder of their party, which tends to have a distinct ideological identity and is often subsidized by government funds from which all legal parties can benefit.In addition, Dr. Shames said, research has shown that the proportional representation that is a cornerstone of many European political systems is far more likely to get women elected to national legislatures.Europeans have also been much readier to adopt quotas to bolster women\u2019s part in politics. Americans steeped in individualism have been reluctant to legislate in this way. \u201cThe concept of quotas in the U.S., as you know, is antithetical to the American position and possibly the myth that holds that everyone pulls themselves up by their bootstraps,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers.Of course, Europeans have not always proved able to use quotas to the full advantage for women. In France, for example, where law dictates that 40 percent of candidates be female, parties, particularly conservative ones, have often preferred to pay fines rather than find the mandated number of women.Joanna Maycock is secretary general of the European Women\u2019s Lobby, which brings together about 2,500 women\u2019s groups from each of the 28 European Union nations, and from neighbors like Norway and aspiring members like Turkey and Serbia. She said she detected a change in attitudes since Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat that starkly highlighted the quirks of the American system, in particular the Electoral College. (The college affirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension to the presidency despite his loss of the popular vote.)Ms. Maycock cited a three-day workshop at the end of November that brought together about 25 American and European activists examining how to get more women into politics. \u201cWhen we planned it, we thought we would be celebrating Hillary\u2019s success,\u201d she said. Instead, the meeting reflected \u201cthe shock of Trump.\u201d\u201cA lot of the American participants were so horrified and shocked, there was a big difference,\u201d she said, a readiness to explore other methods and reinforce the need to train women in public speaking, fund-raising and building networks. Ms. Walsh\u2019s center at Rutgers runs nonpartisan campaign training in New Jersey and assists in such training in 17 other states. She reported a \u201cdramatic increase\u201d in women\u2019s signing up.\u201cWomen are seeking a way to have a voice,\u201d Ms. Walsh said. \u201cThis election has made citizens \u2014 men and women \u2014 see things through the gender blend.\u201d She added that women \u201ccan have an enormous impact on their lives, families, identities\u201d and that \u201cthey can\u2019t sit on the sidelines; they have to figure out a way to get engaged.\u201dIn modern Europe, the trail to the top was blazed by the somewhat unlikely figure of Margaret Thatcher, who was the first woman elected as prime minister in Britain in 1979.(Theresa May is now the second, with the tough task of negotiating the country\u2019s exit from the European Union.)Mrs. Thatcher had no outright feminist agenda and stood accused of fomenting social hardship with her conservative policies and iron will, for instance, to break Britain\u2019s trade unions.Close to 40 years later, similar policies of austerity are associated with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, often called the world\u2019s most powerful woman after 11 years in office. Her unwillingness to loosen Europe\u2019s purse strings while Germany, Europe\u2019s No. 1 economy, benefits substantially from the euro currency, makes her anything but a heroine in many feminist eyes.\u201cThe obsession with austerity across Europe has been really bad,\u201d Ms. Maycock said. It hits women doubly, she argued, cutting public service jobs often held by women and leaving them bereft of the infrastructure \u2014 care for children and seniors, for instance \u2014 that enables them to work.Over the past decade, Ms. Maycock contended, austerity has been a big brake on women\u2019s empowerment. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually stopped progressing, more or less,\u201d she said, citing a gender inequality index compiled by her group that showed 51.5 percent progress toward full equality 10 years ago, compared with 52.5 percent now.In general, she said, European countries with quotas tend to show an effect once the female membership of legislatures passes one-third, she said. Over all in Europe, women account for about one-quarter of legislators, she said.The range is large: In Poland, for instance, a female prime minister, Beata Szydlo, is among 27 percent of female lawmakers in the lower house of Parliament after the 2015 elections introduced a quota system. But the upper house, which has no such mechanism, is only 13 percent women.Norway, one of the first European countries to adopt quotas, has had two female prime ministers and a female defense minister, mandates 40 percent female board membership in business.Ms. Maycock pointed to recently elected female mayors in Paris, Barcelona, Madrid and Rome as more examples of women\u2019s getting power where it matters.But in the United States, Dr. Shames said, women are far more likely to be city council members than mayors and state legislators than governors.On both sides of the Atlantic, women still have important territory to take: While France has had a female defense minister, and Germany currently has one \u2014 Ursula von der Leyen, a married mother of seven \u2014 neither Britain nor the United States has entrusted defense to a woman.American finance, too, has remained firmly in the hands of men, on Wall Street as at the Treasury.And 2016 shocked many not just with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat \u2014 but with the triumph of Mr. Trump, despite accusations of misogyny, and with the murder of Jo Cox, a Labour Party legislator, who was stabbed by a man reportedly shouting \u201cBritain First\u201d days before the country voted to leave the European Union, which Ms. Cox opposed.In democracies from Australia through the United States and Europe, the thin pipeline of women ready to step up to the top in politics (and business) is an added cause for concern.In the United States, there are just five female governors right now, and 21 women in the Senate, Ms. Walsh said. \u201cThe bench is very small, and the potential pool of candidates is really very small,\u201d she said, noting that most modern presidents (if not Mr. Trump) have been governors or senators first.That makes it doubly significant that more women are expressing an interest in entering politics after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat, she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of women who have served as defense minister in France. The country has had one female defense minister, not none.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Alignment With Trump Threatens European Order", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterLONDON \u2014 As American allies across Europe and Asia brace for President Trump, Britain stands out for the degree to which it is proceeding as if little has changed.The country, consumed with managing \u201cBrexit\u201d and its associated domestic political dramas, appears to have taken relatively few steps to prepare for the geopolitical earthquakes that Mr. Trump could bring to the international and European orders on which Britain relies, and that his proposals would undermine.It is possible that Prime Minister Theresa May, by throwing in her lot with Mr. Trump, could ride out any changes to the international order. But if that approach does not succeed, it could have severe consequences both for her nation and for the world that Britain plays a role in keeping together.Mrs. May has sought to win over Mr. Trump, whom she will visit this week, just as her European counterparts are exploring more fundamental questions about American reliability.\u201cThe British debate on Trump is over very trivial stuff, like who Trump spoke to before May, and the German debate is over the future of the liberal order in the West,\u201d said Mark Leonard, the director of the London-based European Council on Foreign Relations.Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, said last month that Mr. Trump\u2019s election \u201copens a period of uncertainty.\u201dBritish leaders, Mr. Leonard said, have not accepted the view, growing in other European governments, \u201cthat our prosperity and security are based on an international architecture that\u2019s now being threatened.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an assumption that\u2019s all going to remain,\u201d he continued.Since Britain\u2019s decline from a global power in the years just after World War II, the country\u2019s foreign policy has rested on two pillars.First is the American-British partnership, which allows Britain to project its power and safeguard its interests globally. Second is European unity, which is essential for Britain\u2019s economic prosperity and, by removing the centuries-old diversions of European conflict, frees up Britain to act on the world stage.But both of those pillars could now be crumbling under the strain of European populism, Russian resurgence and particularly Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to step away from Europe.Britain\u2019s challenge is not just that each of those elements is coming under strain. Mr. Trump\u2019s avowed opposition to the European Union has put them in direct conflict.For instance, Mr. Trump offered to reward Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union with a speedy trade deal. But this risks encouraging more exits from the bloc and possibly its disintegration. The resulting turmoil on the Continent, which includes several top British trading partners, could risk harming Britain\u2019s economy far more than an American trade deal would help.Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed alignment with Russia poses a similar quandary. Germany and other leading European powers oppose such a realignment, which they fear would open the way for Russia to dominate Eastern Europe, breaking the Continent\u2019s unity on security matters.Mrs. May remains hawkish on Russia. But it is unclear whether she would oppose Mr. Trump on the matter, particularly as she more fully ties her fate to the alliance.\u201cIf America eases up on Russia, Britain will be under heavy pressure to pick the United States, not to side with Merkel,\u201d said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a London-based think tank, referring to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Mrs. May is increasingly focused on maintaining the alliance with the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy and military power.Whereas leaders such as Ms. Merkel have responded sharply to criticism from Mr. Trump, Mrs. May has been more forgiving. For example, she overlooked Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to meet with Nigel Farage, a former leader of the fringe U.K. Independence Party, before speaking with her.Even if Mrs. May succeeds in upholding the alliance, it is unclear that her government is preparing for the range of more seismic changes that Mr. Trump\u2019s election and other events could bring.Jeremy Shapiro, an American and the research director for the European Council on Foreign Relations, said he had struggled to convince British officials that the old order is \u201ceroding all around them.\u201dMr. Shapiro paraphrased the \u201cdominant\u201d British view of Mr. Trump as, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want him, but pressures of the presidency, checks and balances, our expert tutelage will socialize him, and it\u2019ll be O.K.\u201dBritish hopes, he added, often rest on Senator John McCain\u2019s persuading of Mr. Trump to drop his controversial plans and revert to traditional positions such as upholding European unity.Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King\u2019s College London, said there was a simple reason that British leaders never seemed to discuss their backup plan should they fail to moderate Mr. Trump.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a Plan B,\u201d he said. Preparing for life without American support, British leaders worry, could send the message that the United States can safely withdraw, risking exactly the outcome Britain wishes to avoid.\u201cThis has always been the problem,\u201d Mr. Freedman said, because it leaves Britain unprepared for a situation that could be deeply destabilizing \u2014 much as it failed to prepare for Brexit.\u201cWe\u2019re going through a very solipsistic moment,\u201d Mr. Leonard said. This has led the British to behave \u201cas if the only independent variable is Britain leaving the E.U. and the manner in which it\u2019s done.\u201dThis is shaping British foreign policy in other ways.\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a question of whether we\u2019re better off using our political capital to advance the international security order or to try to get a good trade deal,\u201d Mr. Leonard said.Britain\u2019s party politics also distract.Mrs. May is only barely holding together the governing Conservative Party, leaving her overwhelmingly focused on managing divisions that are mostly about Brexit and migration. Both she and her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, have spent their careers focused on domestic issues.The opposition Labour Party is riven by its own divisions. Its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tends to be skeptical toward Britain\u2019s global role.As a result, there are no major voices in British politics who have an interest, either ideological or political, in addressing the country\u2019s foreign policy challenges.Britons\u2019 view of their country as a pillar of a European and world order, rooted in their experience of standing up to fascism and militarism in World War II, is also shifting.\u201cUntil quite recently, we saw ourselves as part-guarantors of the European order, but we don\u2019t sort of see ourselves in that way anymore,\u201d said Mr. Freedman, the King\u2019s College professor.This has accelerated with the enmity toward immigration, which has focused politics inward and portrayed the outside world as something to guard against rather than to protect and uphold.That has ramifications beyond Britain. Even after Brexit, the country remains important for upholding the postwar order in Europe, where it is the largest economy after Germany and the biggest military spender after Russia. If its horizons continue to narrow, that will contribute to the Continent\u2019s continuing fracturing on economics and opposition to Russian power.Mr. Niblett, the Chatham House chief, said he was worried Britain would become the \u201cweak link\u201d on European sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea.\u201cThe U.K., which traditionally sees itself as upholding the spine of Europe toward Russia, is pulling itself out of that role,\u201d Mr. Niblett said.Other European states are already preparing for the possibility that the Continent can no longer rely on Britain, Mr. Leonard said, on issues from Russia to the Iran nuclear deal to global free trade.\u201cThey don\u2019t know if Britain\u2019s going to be there or not,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this column misstated the office held by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. He is the president of France, not the prime minister.Advertisement"}

You were inspired by a protester in Georgetown who was worried about the sweatshops that created the sweatshirts at Georgetown. Your sense was that the protesters \u201cdidn\u2019t get it.\u201d What might U.S. voters not have gotten about trade and globalization?I actually think they probably got a great deal right. I started working on this book in 1999, and there were a certain set of concerns there regarding sweatshops and labor abuses and so forth. [In mid-December], Georgetown students again occupied the university president\u2019s office over the same issue.So there\u2019s the human cost abroad, and then there is a human cost in the United States. If you talk to the students who are protesting at the president\u2019s office, they are concerned about workers in Vietnam, and if you talk to some of the workers in Pennsylvania, they are more concerned about economic conditions here. But if you join these two forces together, a population that contains both Bernie Sanders supporters and Donald Trump supporters, politically we\u2019re talking bigger numbers now. It\u2019s a more important political phenomenon.Do these two camps recognize each other as kindred spirits?There\u2019s a lot of space in between those two groups that hampers dialogue, but what\u2019s critical is that if you look at the sentiments that were expressed about trade in this past election season, there was an awful lot of convergence across the spectrum. This isn\u2019t a Trump thing. If you look at the U.S. economy, we are actually one of the least trade-dependent countries in the world. I think we\u2019re ranked seventh from the bottom.Because of the size of our domestic market?Because of the size of the market, the diversity of the productive assets that we have. You have a country that has relatively low trade exposure, but if you look at the polling and opinion data, we are among the most negative about trade. You look at Europe for example, they have lost the same kinds of jobs as we have, they\u2019re less protected. Yet, politically, they aren\u2019t as opposed.If I\u2019ve got people in Germany who have lost their low-end manufacturing jobs, then why are they more in favor than we are? I think it has to do with safety nets and institutions that eliminate some of the costs associated with churn. What you have in the United States is a quite rational response to the failure of policy to deal with these dislocations. If I have easily portable health insurance, if I have retraining, if I have mechanisms that facilitate search and relocation, if I have these things in place to ease these transitions, then I\u2019m not going to be so opposed.I\u2019m not sure they don\u2019t get it. They might get it just fine. Now that doesn\u2019t address the thing that many economists would say, which is that they are conflating the effects of automation and trade.You were inspired to write your book by the Seattle protests against the Doha Round, which was to produce a global trade agreement that depended on the World Trade Organization\u2019s authority, and you know the Doha Round has been moribund ever since. Do you think that multilateral trade agreements are now a thing of the past?I think it\u2019s going to be very difficult to move on these agreements, certainly in the United States, for a while. But the other thing that gets confounded is trade and trade agreements. You can be opposed to trade agreements and be in favor of trade.I\u2019m O.K. without a forward march on more trade agreements, especially given the openness of the U.S. economy. I don\u2019t think it will be a huge drag on trade itself.So let\u2019s say these movements on the right and the left, they halt trade agreements, not necessarily trade itself, but mechanization moves forward. Four years from now, the guy in Scranton, Pa., says, I still don\u2019t have a job. Where does the antitrade deal movement lead?It\u2019s not just that they don\u2019t have a job. There are mortality effects, health effects, there are opiate addiction effects. I\u2019m not optimistic about the ability of certain parts of the country to generate employment that matches up well with the human resources in those areas. Now that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m pessimistic over all, because if you look at certain regions that have been able to turn around, if you look at Pittsburgh, if you look at Charlotte, N.C., if you look at Birmingham, Ala., these aren\u2019t rural areas, but they are becoming postindustrial, and providing opportunities.So what is the difference between the Pennsylvania cities of Pittsburgh, Scranton and Wilkes-Barre? Pittsburgh is now a thriving, high-tech medical center, and Scranton and Wilkes-Barre have turned to President-elect Trump.There\u2019s this whole literature in economics over what they are calling network effects, which is just that we\u2019re all more valuable if we\u2019re together in one place. In Pittsburgh, there was an ignition switch that was largely related to health care and universities. In Charlotte, it was financial services. And in Birmingham, it was related to autos.You have to start with something.So what does that tell policy makers in areas that don\u2019t seem to have this network effect? Is it possible to implant something that begins to grow a network?That\u2019s a great question. The fact that you\u2019re talking about a 300-year-long trend in urbanization isn\u2019t going to give you an optimistic story. Even if you look at the urbanization from agriculture, we weren\u2019t able to come up with stuff to keep people in the cornfields.But you wrote about how cotton has remained king in the United States, in large part because of government policy. Does that mean you favor that?Here\u2019s where I think there\u2019s a lot of confusion. Cotton has succeeded because of its political influence, but it\u2019s cotton that has succeeded. It\u2019s not employment. There are no people in the cotton business. It\u2019s a lot easier to protect an industry than to protect employment in the industry.Should we do with manufacturing what we did with cotton, which actually accelerated mechanization? Most of us wouldn\u2019t say that is welfare enhancing.In your book, you say the importance of trade is overstated by opponents and proponents. Explain that.I was just having a conversation with one of the students who was occupying the president\u2019s office [in mid-December], and he is a left-leaning kid who has been caught up in a lot of social justice stuff. And he actually thinks global capitalism is evil. There\u2019s this idea of a faceless market force that is essentially profit seeking, and profit seeking is cost minimizing, and if you\u2019re minimizing cost, then there\u2019s this race-to-the-bottom logic where things like wages as well as environmental protections and labor protections all spiral downward. On the positive side, you get the argument of most economists, which says competitive markets mean better mousetraps will create more employment, and eventually more productivity and more consumption.In both cases, you have a machine, this market mechanism that is leading to outcomes, both negative and positive. What I tried to say in the book is, you know, if we actually look under the hood of this machine, I\u2019m not sure if it works the way you say it works.I spent a fair amount of time in China, and in Beijing there was a food street, a dumpling street. It looked like a perfectly competitive market. Whoever had the best dumplings at the best price should win. But fortunes did not rise and fall on how good your dumplings were. Through a variety of mechanisms, some guys were able to get a good spot. And that\u2019s my analogy. You\u2019re not really talking about a mechanism that necessarily generates the best mousetrap. There are ways to influence the rules and institutions.And today, that is what you\u2019re hearing in the so-called politics of resentment.Last year was the first time in modern history that global trade flows actually declined.If you start with the question, what kind of productive assets and people do we have to make things for the global economy, you\u2019re going to use what you\u2019ve got. In the United States, we have a lot of land and we have fancy machines. That\u2019s what comparative advantage is.But it results from two kinds of differences: differences in productive assets and differences in preferences. We sell China all of our chicken feet. They want them. We don\u2019t. If those differences go away, you lose the fundamental logic that drives trade. That\u2019s the way I see this in a longer-term frame.The homogenization of taste is going to be the doom of trade?That\u2019s certainly going to contribute. If you have convergence in both those things, you\u2019re going to have reductions in trade. That\u2019s not a bad thing.Donald Trump campaigned on getting good deals, keeping jobs in the United States, rebuilding our manufacturing. Does the political power structure in the United States have any way to actually reverse the course of economic history?A: No. But I think it\u2019s reversing itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For 5 Contest Finalists, a $20 Million Dash to the Moon", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byThe surface of the moon may soon be dotted with corporate logos, and its craters labeled with slogans. Families might be able to send their loved ones\u2019 ashes \u2014 or even their pets\u2019 remains \u2014 for lunar burial.Entrepreneurs hope that commercial ventures expand in lucrative ways in later years. In a farther, fanciful future, for example, the moon could be mined for platinum, a valuable metal, or helium-3, to be used as fuel for fusion energy reactors that do not yet exist.Private access to the moon grew a little closer to reality on Tuesday, when the X Prize Foundation, with prizes financed by Google, chose five teams of private entrepreneurs who say they can get to the moon by the end of this year.If any of them succeeds \u2014 the deadline has been pushed back several times \u2014 it could usher in an era of extraterrestrial commerce and renew interest in our long-ignored moon.\u201cIt\u2019s incentivized this whole business of the niche space economy,\u201d said Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, a senior director at the X Prize Foundation, which runs the contest.The X Prize Foundation was founded by Peter H. Diamandis, an entrepreneur who wanted to use competitions to encourage technological innovation in the way that aviation prizes in the early 20th century helped transform airplanes from a dangerous avocation of barnstormers to a commonplace mode of transportation.The first X Prize award of $10 million in 2004 went to the first private spaceship that could take people 62 miles up, into outer space. That led to the founding of Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic, which aims to take tourists to the edge of space for a few minutes of weightlessness.The foundation began a similar competition in 2007 to point attention to the moon. To win the top $20 million prize, a spacecraft must land on the moon, move 500 meters and send back video and photographs. The second team to accomplish the task wins $5 million. The contest also offers $5 million in bonus prizes, for feats like surviving the cold lunar night and traveling more than 5,000 meters on the surface.The next 11 months are a dash to finish team designs, assemble spacecraft and prepare for launching. And the teams differ on their approaches.Rahul Narayan, the leader of Team Indus, said the engineers had to develop their own computer, software, power system and other components when the initial approach of buying off-the-shelf satellite parts did not work out, increasing costs. Mr. Narayan now estimates the price tag at $70 million to $75 million.The Hakuto team, with a $10 million budget, is not building a lander at all, but hitching a ride for its rover with Team Indus. If Team Indus is the first to land on the moon, its rover and Hakuto\u2019s will race to travel the 500 meters to capture the $20 million prize. Both rovers have a top speed of about 4 inches a second.\u201cWe think that we can beat them on the moon,\u201d said Takeshi Hakamada, the leader of Hakuto (pronounced HOCK-tow).For SpaceIL and Synergy Moon, the main goal is not starting a business, but inspiring the next generation. \u201cKind of like Jacques Cousteau did with ocean exploration,\u201d said Kevin Myrick, a founder of Synergy Moon.Eran Privman, the chief executive of SpaceIL, said attracting the interest of venture capitalists would have been difficult for the company, because the return on investment would have been a couple of decades in the future. So instead of trying to be a profitable business, his team seeks to inspire children in Israel. \u201cJust like Apollo in the United States in the \u201960s,\u201d he said.Moon Express, based in Cape Canaveral, Fla., has followed a more conventional business path, soliciting investors. It is building a scaled-down lander to fit into a small, $5 million rocket called Electron, developed by a start-up company, Rocket Lab.It will carry a reflecting mirror experiment that bounces back laser beams from Earth, the same type of experiment that Apollo astronauts left behind on the moon. The lead scientist for the experiment, Douglas Currie, a retired physicist from the University of Maryland, was a key member of the Apollo laser experiments.SpaceIL and Moon Express are eschewing rovers. To fulfill the 500-meter requirement, both instead intend to have their landers lift off and land again.And the companies all still face challenges. Moon Express\u2019s ride, the Electron, has yet to launch even once. \u201cIt\u2019s not a blind bet,\u201d Mr. Richards said, but he conceded that it was also not a sure thing. Synergy Moon also plans to launch on an unproven rocket.Yet even some of teams that have dropped out have not given up.Astrobotic, which now plans to launch its spacecraft in 2019, has announced partnerships with DHL, the delivery company, and signed up customers for its trips including Elysium Space, which plans to offer the possibility of sending human remains to the moon. \u201cThe X Prize is not really the core driving thing anymore,\u201d said John Thornton, Astrobotic\u2019s chief executive.Robert Boehme, the leader of Part-Time scientists, said his team \u2014 which is backed by Audi, the carmaker \u2014 had a contract to launch in mid-2018. \u201cIt\u2019s too risky to try to accelerate it,\u201d he said.Its rover will have the four-ring Audi logo on the front and be called the Audi lunar quattro, echoing the name of one of Audi\u2019s cars.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the price of platinum. It is currently more expensive than gold; it is not the case that platinum is \u201cfar more valuable than gold.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Make China Great Again", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "Supported byAmerica\u2019s rivals and enemies have enjoyed a very good 10 days.So any strategic benefits are tiny while the costs are substantial: Trump has just helped ISIS recruiters. He has angered Iraq, France and others battling ISIS. He\u2019s started a new argument in the Middle East, which long distracted the United States. Most alarmingly, he has undercut our claim to stand for larger principles \u2014 freedom, rule of law, even basic competence.This undermining of both American values and interests has been an early theme of the administration. And the ultimate beneficiary is not likely to be ISIS. Although it poses serious threats, it is not a serious rival to the United States. The ultimate beneficiary is instead likely to be America\u2019s biggest global rival: China.China remains far less powerful than the United States. But it has come a long way. Its economic progress and its ambitions, combined with the size of its population, mean that China has become the world\u2019s only other potential superpower.Here, too, the Trump administration has set back American interests.They welcomed it because they want a strong American presence to offset Chinese power in Asia. These countries have close commercial ties with China, but they are afraid of becoming merely moons that orbit Beijing. They tend to prefer the American model to the Chinese model.That\u2019s why they were willing to adopt American-style rules on intellectual property, pollution and labor unions, even though those rules created some political tensions in those countries.Now that Trump has rejected our would-be Asian allies, China is trying to put together a different trade pact with some of the same countries. If China succeeds, it will gain more sway in Asia, as will a more bare-knuckle economic system in which copyrights, worker rights, product safety and the environment aren\u2019t taken very seriously.Meanwhile, Beijing will be able to point to Trump\u2019s extralegal stances as proof that the United States is just another self-interested, transactional nation. After all, the United States also threatened a trade war when it was unhappy with one of its neighbors and also mistreats its ethnic minorities.The early pattern of Trump foreign policy is to take actions that have the veneer of strength but are actually weak. It\u2019s a kind of anti-Teddy Rooseveltism. Instead of speaking softly and carrying a big stick, the White House is screaming loudly to hide insecurity about the strength of its stick.The question they should be asking themselves is: How do our enemies and rivals feel about the Trump administration so far?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Donald Trump Denies Climate Change, These Kids Die of It", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byTSIHOMBE, Madagascar \u2014 She is just a frightened mom, worrying if her son will survive, and certainly not fretting about American politics \u2014 for she has never heard of either President Obama or Donald Trump.What about America itself? Ranomasy, who lives in an isolated village on this island of Madagascar off southern Africa, shakes her head. It doesn\u2019t ring any bells.Yet we Americans may be inadvertently killing her infant son. Climate change, disproportionately caused by carbon emissions from America, seems to be behind a severe drought that has led crops to wilt across seven countries in southern Africa. The result is acute malnutrition for 1.3 million children in the region, the United Nations says.Trump has repeatedly mocked climate change, once even calling it a hoax fabricated by China. But climate change here is as tangible as its victims. Trump should come and feel these children\u2019s ribs and watch them struggle for life. It\u2019s true that the links between our carbon emissions and any particular drought are convoluted, but over all, climate change is as palpable as a wizened, glassy-eyed child dying of starvation. Like Ranomasy\u2019s 18-month-old son, Tsapasoa.Southern Africa\u2019s drought and food crisis have gone largely unnoticed around the world. The situation has been particularly severe in Madagascar, a lovely island nation known for deserted sandy beaches and playful long-tailed primates called lemurs.But the southern part of the island doesn\u2019t look anything like the animated movie \u201cMadagascar\u201d: Families are slowly starving because rains and crops have failed for the last few years. They are reduced to eating cactus and even rocks or ashes. The United Nations estimates that nearly one million people in Madagascar alone need emergency food assistance.I met Ranomasy at an emergency feeding station run by Catholic nuns who were trying to save her baby. Ranomasy had carried Tsapasoa 12 hours on a trek through the desert to get to the nuns, walking barefoot because most villagers have already sold everything from shoes to spoons to survive.\u201cI feel so powerless as a mother, because I know how much I love my child,\u201d she said. \u201cBut whatever I do just doesn\u2019t work.\u201dThe researchers calculated that human contributions to global warming reduced water runoff in southern Africa by 48 percent and concluded that these human contributions \u201chave contributed to substantial food crises.\u201dAs an American, I\u2019m proud to see U.S. assistance saving lives here. If it weren\u2019t for U.S.A.I.D., the American aid agency, and nonprofit groups like Catholic Relief Services that work in these villages, far more cadavers would be piling up. But my pride is mixed with guilt: The United States single-handedly accounts for more than one-quarter of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions over the last 150 years, more than twice as much as any other country.The basic injustice is that we rich countries produced the carbon that is devastating impoverished people from Madagascar to Bangladesh. In America, climate change costs families beach homes; in poor countries, parents lose their children.In one Madagascar hamlet I visited, villagers used to get water from a well a three-hour walk away, but then it went dry. Now they hike the three hours and then buy water from a man who trucks it in. But they have almost no money. Not one of the children in the village has ever had a bath.Families in this region traditionally raised cattle, but many have sold their herds to buy food to survive. Selling pressure has sent the price of a cow tumbling from $300 to less than $100.Families are also pulling their children out of school, to send them foraging for edible plants. In one village I visited, fewer than 15 percent of the children are attending primary school this year.One of the children who dropped out is Fombasoa, who should be in the third grade but now spends her days scouring the desert for a wild red cactus fruit. Fombasoa\u2019s family is also ready to marry her off, even though she is just 10, because then her husband would be responsible for feeding her.\u201cIf I can find her a husband, I would marry her,\u201d said her father, Sonjona, who, like many villagers, has just one name. \u201cBut these days there is no man who wants her\u201d \u2014 because no one can afford the bride price of about $32.Sonjona realizes that it is wrong to marry off a 10-year-old, but he also knows it is wrong to see his daughter starve. \u201cI feel despair,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel a man any more. I used to have muscles; now I have only bones. I feel guilty, because my job was to care for my children, and now they have only red cactus fruit.\u201dOther families showed me how they pick rocks of chalk from the ground, break them into dust and cook the dust into soup. \u201cIt fills our stomachs at least,\u201d explained Limbiaza, a 20-year-old woman in one remote village. As it becomes more difficult to find the chalk rocks, some families make soup from ashes from old cooking fires.Scientists used to think that the horror of starvation was principally the dying children. Now they understand there is a far broader toll: When children in utero and in the first few years of life are malnourished, their brains don\u2019t develop properly. As a result, they may suffer permanently impaired brain function.\u201cIf children are stunted and do not receive the nutrition and attention in these first 1,000 days, it is very difficult to catch back up,\u201d noted Joshua Poole, the Madagascar director of Catholic Relief Services. \u201cNutritional neglect during this critical period prevents children from reaching their full mental potential.\u201dFor the next half century or so, we will see students learning less in school and economies held back, because in 2017 we allowed more than a million kids to be malnourished just here in southern Africa, collateral damage from our carbon-intensive way of life.The struggling people of Madagascar are caught between their own corrupt, ineffective government, which denies the scale of the crisis, and overseas governments that don\u2019t want to curb carbon emissions.Whatever we do to limit the growth of carbon, climate problems will worsen for decades to come. Those of us in the rich world who have emitted most of the carbon bear a special responsibility to help people like these Madagascar villagers who are simultaneously least responsible for climate change and most vulnerable to it.We need these emergency relief efforts \u2014 and constant vigilance to intervene early to avert famines \u2014 but we can also do far more to help local people help themselves.Catholic Relief Services provides emergency food aid, but it also promotes drought-resistant seed varieties and is showing farmers near the coast how to fish. It is also working with American scientists on new technologies to supply water in Madagascar, using condensation or small-scale desalination.American technology helped create the problem, and it would be nice to see American technology used more aggressively to mitigate the burden on the victims.For me, the most wrenching sight of this trip was of two starving boys near the southern tip of Madagascar. Their parents are climate refugees who fled their village to try to find a way to survive, leaving the boys in the care of an aunt, even though she doesn\u2019t have enough food for her own two daughters.I met the boys, Fokondraza, 5, and Voriavy, 3, in the evening, and they said that so far that day they hadn\u2019t eaten or drunk anything (the closest well, producing somewhat salty water, is several hours away by foot, and fetching a pail of water becomes more burdensome when everyone is malnourished and anemic). Their aunt, Fideline, began to prepare the day\u2019s meal.She broke off cactus pads, scraped off the thorns and boiled them briefly, and the boys ate them \u2014 even though they provide little nutrition. \u201cMy heart is breaking because I have nothing to give them,\u201d Fideline said. \u201cI have no choice.\u201dAt night, the boys sometimes cry from hunger, she said. But that is a good sign. When a person is near starvation, the body shuts down emotion, becoming zombielike as every calorie goes to keeping the heart and lungs working. It is the children who don\u2019t cry, those quiet and expressionless, who are at greatest risk \u2014 and the two boys are becoming more like that.I don\u2019t pretend that the links between climate change and this food crisis are simple, or that the solutions are straightforward. I flew halfway around the world and then drove for two days to get to these villages, pumping out carbon the whole way.Yet we do know what will help in the long run: sticking with the Paris agreement to limit global warming, as well as with President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. We must also put a price on carbon and invest much more heavily in research on renewable energy.The most basic starting point is for the American president-elect to acknowledge what even illiterate Madagascar villagers understand: Climate change is real.As the sun set, I told Fideline that there was a powerful man named Trump half a world away, in a country she had never heard of, who just might be able to have some impact, over many years, on the climate here. I asked her what she would tell him.\u201cI would ask him to do what he can, so that once more I can grow cassava, corn, black-eyed peas and sorghum,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re desperate.\u201dMr. President-elect, are you listening?Ross Douthat is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warsaw Grapples With Gloomy, Gray Smog", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Supported byWarsaw JournalWARSAW \u2014 Michal Czekala\u2019s job chopping down trees keeps the 21-year-old out in the fresh air pretty much all day long. But after hearing news recently that the air was far from fresh, that in fact record-high smog was enveloping the entire nation, he decided to take a week off work.Warsaw city officials reacted by making all public transportation free last Monday, in an attempt to keep cars off the roads, and warned residents to stay indoors unless necessary. Pollution levels eventually dropped off toward the end of the week.The issue, though, is not just cars and coal. Warsaw\u2019s spike in air pollution was driven largely by a severe cold snap that forced thousands of private households, especially the most destitute ones, to crank up poor quality heaters that burn things like coal and garbage to beat back the winter chill.\u201cEighty percent of all households in Warsaw are connected to a district heating network,\u201d said Michal Olszewski, deputy mayor of Warsaw. \u201cThe problem is the remaining 20 percent that often use these low-tech heating systems.\u201dAccording to Poland\u2019s Central Statistical Office, this could be the case in over 150,000 households in a city with 1.7 million residents.The situation got out of hand in the first week of January after a Siberian blast poured into the region and temperatures dropped below zero Fahrenheit. People overworked their heaters, and an absence of wind caused the smog to squat gloomily over the capital.On average, readings of fine particulates in the air exceeded Polish environmental norms by fourfold, at some points reaching 1,000 percent of the norms.High smog levels, Warsaw authorities warned, could be especially dangerous for children, older residents, pregnant women and people with existing health issues.Szymon Wisniak, 33, a financial expert, left his car at home on Monday so he wouldn\u2019t \u201ccontribute to this mess of a situation.\u201dAs he was waiting for a train in the city center on Monday night, he said that more than half of his Facebook feed was about the smog.\u201cMany of my friends and I woke up to this smoky smell in our houses,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first, I thought something was on fire, but then I looked out the window and there was this scary grayness.\u201dOther regions in Poland are even worse. In the southern city of Rybnik, alarming air pollution levels led officials to offer free public transportation and shut down schools and kindergartens.Magdalena Urban, a 25-year-old marketing specialist in Warsaw, said on Monday evening that she had been suffering from a headache since last Sunday.\u201cIt hurts around the temples and I\u2019m constantly feeling nauseated,\u201d Ms. Urban said as she went grocery shopping in Zabki, a town just outside the capital. \u201cI\u2019m going out shopping because I don\u2019t know what else to do. This has all been so sudden.\u201dBeata Szydlo, the prime minister, said on Monday that her government was going to work on ways of reducing a problem that \u201cis so very burdensome for the Polish citizens,\u201d though she did not provide any specifics.Mr. Olszewski said that the mayor\u2019s office was already doing a lot to tackle the problem, but it needs \u201ctools that only the central government can provide.\u201d\u201cPoland\u2019s economy needs to be decarbonized, but the government does the complete opposite,\u201d Mr. Olszewski said. \u201cPlus, they take away our environmental competences. Only recently they lifted restrictions on tree felling in Warsaw and we can\u2019t even say no to that.\u201dMs. Jedrasik said that first of all, regulations needed to be put in place regarding the quality of fuel and furnaces people use in their houses, as well as the building insulation.\u201cAnd then,\u201d she said, \u201cwe need effective ways of executing those rules and ensuring that people comply with them.\u201dKonstanty Radziwill, the Polish health minister, caused controversy at the beginning of the year \u2014 before the pollution levels radically increased \u2014 when he called the smog \u201ca theoretical problem\u201d and said that \u201cthere are no reasons for panic,\u201d and besides \u201cour lifestyle is much more damaging.\u201d\u201cSomeone who breathes in air smoking a cigarette, with fumes and everything that comes with it, is in a position in which complaining about poor air quality is not credible at all,\u201d Mr. Radziwill told a private radio station, Tok FM.\u201cThink of your children smoking a couple of cigarettes a day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that bad.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But experts say that in recent years, some towns and cities, reeling from shifts in the economy and declining populations, have focused anew on potential economic benefits from refugee resettlement, even as immigration has become a subject of partisan political battles.\u201cOver the last couple of decades, especially in the last 10 years, places have started to develop strategies to attract and retain immigrants and resettle refugees in order to boost their economic activity,\u201d said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who has studied refugee resettlement in American cities.Refugees are a small subset of immigrants, and many cities that have made a point of welcoming them say that they do so primarily for humanitarian, not economic, reasons. But as cities in the Rust Belt, like Pittsburgh and Dayton, Ohio, and in other parts of the country, like Maine and upstate New York, set up offices to connect immigrants and refugees with services and job opportunities, advocates say economic benefits have arisen as a result.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a few neighborhoods kind of turn around because of immigrants and refugees moving in,\u201d said Melissa Bertolo, the coordinator for one such support group, Welcome Dayton. She added that cities in the Rust Belt are \u201call looking at how immigrant integration plays a part in the revitalization of a city.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019re right on the beginning of the cusp of serious, serious labor problems,\u201d said Mr. Woolf, who added that the state\u2019s unemployment rate, at 3.6 percent, was a sign of more trouble to come. \u201cWe\u2019re low because there\u2019s nobody available to work.\u201dNowhere is that more pronounced, Mr. Woolf said, than Rutland County, here in the center of the state, which has lost residents since 2000. The city of Rutland has 15,824 residents, according to an estimate by the United States Census Bureau, which said the city had lost 4 percent of its population since 2010. The highest population for Rutland recorded by the Census Bureau was 19,293, in 1970.It is a striking community, lately hobbled by isolation: There are mountains on the horizon, but the city is an hour from major highways. Its status as a railroad hub and a marble powerhouse is long gone, and recent decades have seen the loss of major factory employers.\u201cIt hit a peak, it leveled off, and now we\u2019re trying to find ourselves,\u201d said Will Notte, 45, the president of the board of selectmen and a fifth-generation Rutlander who supports the refugee proposal.But city leaders are worried that population loss could make it harder for the remaining major employers, like General Electric plants that make parts for aircraft engines and the Rutland Regional Medical Center, to stay. They are putting $100,000 toward a $200,000 effort from local economic development groups to market the area and draw more residents.Syrian refugees, business leaders say, could become an integral part of that effort, both by adding to the population \u2014 if only slightly \u2014 and bringing cultural diversity that they hope will attract younger residents.\u201cI saw that as an opportunity to grow our population, bring in individuals, families, new Americans from Syria who have a strong work ethic, who were fleeing for their lives and looking to rebuild those shattered lives,\u201d Mr. Louras said.Many members of Rutland First say that they are not biased or xenophobic, as their critics have said, but that they have economic concerns about whether the city can absorb the new arrivals.\u201cWe\u2019re kind of stuck out here, with our level of economic depression, with our level of crime and drug issues,\u201d said Timothy Cook, a doctor and an Army Reserve colonel who gave Rutland First its name. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are gonna have to foot the bill for this.\u201dAnd that is what business leaders in Rutland hope will happen here.Resettlement, said Lyle Jepson, the executive director of the Rutland Economic Development Corporation, is \u201csupporting people when they need help.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cFrankly, we need help. We need people to join our community.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Will more major airlines begin restricting access to their overhead bin space? And while we\u2019re talking about space, which carry-on size will actually make it past the gate agent and onto the plane?Let\u2019s begin with United\u2019s new fares.If you buy one of United\u2019s \u201cbasic economy\u201d fares, you can bring along a personal item like a laptop bag or backpack that is 9 inches by 10 inches by 17 inches or less, but not carry-on luggage (hence why you\u2019re not given access to the overhead bins). But there are ways around those rules. In fact, there are three ways to bring on carry-on luggage and use the overhead bins even if you purchase a \u201cbasic economy\u201d fare:Any of the above will also prevent you from having to board last as well.Whether other major United States carriers join United and introduce new rules for their overhead bin space remains to be seen, but it will not be surprising if they eventually do, given that the airlines tend to copy one another if a new practice is successful. Indeed, the latest segmentation of economy fares into no-frills seats and premium seats began with Delta Air Lines and has since been adopted by American Airlines and United. If travelers take to United\u2019s basic economy fares, expect the practice to become more widespread.There is no universal carry-on bag size. Each airline has its own rules. And baggage allowances may vary across routes and cabin classes.Shopping for a new bag? There are two things to keep in mind. First, an airline can change its carry-on policy so if you\u2019re buying a bigger bag you might not want to spend a mint. (For example, beginning April 4, the maximum dimensions of the personal item travelers on Spirit Airlines are allowed to bring on board will be 18 x 14 x 8 inches \u2014 a change from the current maximum size of 16 x 14 x 12 inches.)Nine out of the 11 bags were larger than the manufacturer claimed. So invest in a tape measure. And when you measure a bag, be sure to include the wheels and handle in your measurements. Be ruthless. After all, the airlines will be.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Emotion Over Pet Care Helps Explain Human Health Spending", "Date": "2017-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe New Health CareIn almost every year since the 1960s, health care spending has grown at least as fast as the overall economy, and often much faster. Health economists have long debated why.Strange as it may sound, how we care for our pets offers some answers.The supply of both physicians and of veterinarians has grown at a more rapid rate than overall employment. Since 1996, the number of physicians has grown by about 40 percent. The number of veterinarians is up 100 percent.\u201cThese commonalities made us think that something else may be behind the rapid growth in human health care spending,\u201d said Amy Finkelstein, an M.I.T. economist and one of the authors of a recent study on pet care.Which camp is right?The three economists pointed out that, in contrast with the market for human health care, there is much less government involvement in pet care.So the economists\u2019 focus turned to the commonalities. Human and pet health care are both provided by experts \u2014 doctors and veterinarians \u2014 who\u2019ve undergone lengthy and expensive training and occupational licensing. That expertise commands high salaries. It also gives them the authority to recommend treatments and tests, the need for which most consumers cannot independently judge.You trust your vet as you would trust your doctor to do what is best, especially when an emotional decision is being made. Both human and pet health care are accompanied by strong emotions, making it hard to rationally weigh the value of options. Moreover, the need for care, whether it is for a pet or a human, is difficult to predict and often urgent, again threatening our ability and willingness to shop for the best deals.\u201cIt makes you think that the emotional nature of the treatment decision may be important in explaining high and sometimes heroic end-of-life health care spending,\u201d Ms. Finkelstein said, \u201cwhether on your dog or on your mother.\u201dBut the point of health insurance \u2014 whether for humans or their pets \u2014 is to protect against the risk of catastrophically high costs, not to make money.Though you might reasonably avoid pet care insurance, you really can\u2019t do that with human health insurance. Human and pet health care may have some commonalities, but this isn\u2019t one of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Increases in Interest Rates on Savings Accounts Remain Slow to Materialize", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserSavers hoping for higher interest rates on deposit accounts are probably going to have to wait awhile longer for yields on their savings to move upward.While the Federal Reserve decided in December to increase short-term interest rates, that hasn\u2019t yet translated into significant increases in deposit rates paid out by banks on safe, federally insured deposits \u2014 the kind of accounts consumers might want to use for an emergency fund or for parking cash they expect to use in the next month or two.\u201cBe patient,\u201d advised Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a couple more rate hikes before we see broad-based increases.\u201dPartly, that\u2019s because banks increase the rates they charge on loans first, to increase their income from the \u201cspread\u201d between rates on loans and deposits, said Ken Tumin, founder of the website DepositAccounts.com.Rates paid on cash deposits remain anemic, as they have been for years. Still, Mr. Tumin said there were some early, encouraging signs that things might improve for plain-vanilla savers. DepositAccounts\u2019 monthly analysis of rates at more than 8,000 banks and credit unions showed that average rates on all five categories of the consumer deposit accounts that it tracks increased in January, the first time in the last year that all had risen in the same month, he said.The increase was small \u2014 about 1 percent or less on average, on most types of accounts \u2014 and the initial rates were so paltry that the impact for most savers is negligible. The average savings account rate, for example, increased less than 1 percent, to 0.18 percent in January from 0.179 percent in December. (To put that in perspective, if you put $1,000 in a savings account for a year, you would make $1.80 at the higher rate instead of $1.79 \u2014 an extra penny.)The average one-year rate on certificates of deposit among the top nationwide banks increased by more than 2 percent, to 0.88 percent from 0.86 percent.To earn more than 1 percent on your cash, the analysis found, you would probably have to tie your money up in a longer-term C.D.; five-year C.D.s now have average interest rates of more than 1.4 percent, and average rates at the most competitive national banks are approaching 2 percent.\u201cAt best, we\u2019re seeing small signs of upward movement,\u201d Mr. Tumin said.The best thing consumers can do now is keep a watchful eye on rates, Mr. Tumin said. If the pace of the economy picks up, banks will probably see demand for more loans \u2014 and will raise rates as they compete to attract new deposits to fund the additional lending activity.The Federal Reserve has indicated that it will increase interest rates incrementally three more times this year, but some are skeptical of that. Mr. McBride says he is forecasting two increases this year.Mr. McBride said it was wise to compare rates from different institutions. \u201cBe sure to shop around.\u201dHere are some questions and answers about savings rates.What type of banks pays the highest rates on savings?Internet banks may pay higher rates, because they don\u2019t have to pay to operate physical branches, Mr. Tumin said. For that reason, he said, they may also raise rates more quickly than brick-and-mortar institutions. Some banks may require significant minimum deposits to get their best available rate. Synchrony Bank, for instance, offers more than 2 percent on its 60-month C.D., but you must deposit at least $25,000.How can I make the best of the current interest-rate situation?One approach to try is known as C.D. \u201claddering.\u201d Instead of tying up all of your savings in a single, long-term C.D., you divide the money into several certificates with staggered terms. \u201cLaddering still makes sense,\u201d said Patricia Seaman, a spokeswoman for the National Endowment for Financial Education.For instance, if you had $30,000, instead of putting all the money into a three-year C.D., you would buy three separate C.D.s of $10,000 each, with terms of one year, two years and three years. When the one-year C.D. matures, you can withdraw the money or roll it over into a new three-year C.D. That way, you have access to some of your money every 12 months, and can take advantage of higher rates, should they materialize.If you want to maintain more flexibility should rates increase, you could opt for a ladder with shorter C.D. terms, Ms. Seaman said.Will I pay a penalty if I withdraw money early from a C.D.?Most banks charge penalties \u2014 usually, several months of interest \u2014 if you withdraw your money before the term of the C.D. ends. Mr. Tumin suggested that you seek a C.D. with a \u201cmild\u201d penalty, like no more than six months of interest on a five-year C.D.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Era of Trump, China\u2019s President Champions Economic Globalization", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 In a world troubled by grave uncertainties over the basics governing trade, security and the mission to limit climate change, President Xi Jinping of China on Tuesday portrayed his nation as a responsible global citizen dedicated to furthering international integration.That a leader of the People\u2019s Republic of China can stake a claim to the mantle of leadership in the realm of free trade speaks to the unforeseen, even surreal alteration of the global order in recent months.\u201cPursuing protectionism is just like locking oneself in a dark room,\u201d the Chinese president declared. \u201cWhile wind and rain may be kept outside, so are light and air. No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war.\u201dIn myriad ways, Mr. Xi is a strikingly ill-fitting steward of openness and connectivity.Under his direction, China\u2019s Communist Party has clamped down severely on civil society, tightening restrictions on the internet and jailing scores of lawyers focused on using the country\u2019s own laws to defend the rights of aggrieved people. He has projected China\u2019s navy into contested waters in the South China and East China Seas.Throughout his speech, Mr. Xi carefully used the phrase \u201ceconomic globalization,\u201d while avoiding unqualified \u201cglobalization,\u201d reflecting China\u2019s spurning of an open internet, universal human rights and free elections.But the populist ferment refashioning the global order has made previously unthinkable roles possible. In the United States, the supposed citadel of free market enterprise, a wealthy real estate magnate has captured the White House on the strength of his appeal as a supposed champion of blue-collar workers. Here in Davos, where technology executives fret about the plight of sub-Saharan Africa while drinking champagne paid for by investment banks, the chairman of the Communist Party of China \u2014 an institution that rules in the name of peasant-led revolution \u2014 draped himself in the banner of globalization.None of these details were featured in Mr. Xi\u2019s highly choreographed appearance at the gathering that has become a rite of passage into the ranks of the global elite.For Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, the participation of China\u2019s president amounted to a public relations coup because it was the first time a Chinese head of state had attended. Mr. Schwab obliged with his trademark soft treatment. He asked no questions, solicited none from the audience, and delivered an introductory address so laudatory that it provoked winces among some in the audience.\u201cIn a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility, the international community is looking to China to continue its responsive and responsible leadership in providing all of us with confidence and stability,\u201d Mr. Schwab said.That Mr. Xi chose this year to make his debut underscores China\u2019s attempt to improve its international standing just as much of the world appears in turmoil.The United States is about to inaugurate as president someone who has questioned the relevance of powerful institutions that have anchored the world order for decades, from NATO to the World Trade Organization. Britain is pursuing a fraught divorce from the European Union, dealing a blow to those who have advanced regional integration as a solution to economic and security problems.The growing electoral strength of populist, anti-European Union parties in France, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany has intensified fears that the union may not endure.These developments have yielded a gnawing sense that a complex world is suddenly short of adult supervision. Mr. Xi devoted his speech to trying to fill that vacuum, casting China as a trustworthy power in which serious-minded people are taking considered action to address consequential challenges \u2014 from climate change to a weak global economy.\u201cThis appears to be a time of uncertainty in the United States, in the U.K.,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent venture capitalist in Beijing who invests in emerging Chinese companies. \u201cThe world needs strong leaders to give the world confidence.\u201dIn keeping with the traditions of speeches delivered by senior Chinese officials, Mr. Xi\u2019s address was long on platitudes, tortured metaphors and literary references, while nearly bereft of policy pronouncements.Yet, in totality, it delivered a striking message: In an era in which the United States and Britain are consumed with recriminations over the strains of globalization, China will continue to tether its fortunes to world trade.\u201cChina has no intention to boost its trade competitiveness by devaluing the RMB,\u201d Mr. Xi said.In another implicit rebuke of Mr. Trump, the Chinese president argued forcefully for follow-through on the 2015 Paris climate accord. Mr. Trump has threatened to renounce the deal while naming to his cabinet several people who question the basic scientific consensus on climate change.\u201cThe Paris agreement was hard won,\u201c Mr. Xi said. \u201cAll signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it, as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations.\u201dMr. Xi was accompanied by an enormous delegation of Chinese officials and business executives who reveled in a moment on the world stage, posing for photos as they awaited the president\u2019s arrival.In conversations on the sidelines, many expressed concerns about the threats of tariffs from the incoming Trump administration, fearing the consequences of a potential trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. But most assumed tough rhetoric would eventually give way to the realities of shared commercial interests.China relies on access to the United States, the largest consumer market on earth, as the landing place for its exports. The United States depends upon China for a vast range of finished goods.Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant, said he assumed cooler heads would find a way to avoid trade hostilities.\u201cI don\u2019t think it will happen,\u201d he said of the hostilities. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a disaster if it does.\u201dBut on Tuesday, as he waited for the Chinese president to deliver his address, Mr. Fu, who recently retired from another major Chinese energy company but retains a party post, expressed confidence that Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump would forge common ground.\u201cEventually, they will cooperate to get more benefits,\u201d Mr. Fu said. \u201cAt the beginning, Trump will say something very harsh. He will try to do something punishing. But this is a double-edged sword. Once he\u2019s in the White House, he will see things differently.\u201dMichael Forsythe contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Economic Vows May Be Harder to Hit After a Slow 2016", "Date": "2017-01-27", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump\u2019s target for economic growth just got a little more distant.But however solid, the recovery under President Barack Obama never reached exuberance. It is the second longest recovery in American history but the first in the postwar era in which growth for a full year did not hit 3 percent.Mr. Trump made that data point a focus of his campaign, citing factories that closed during the recession but never reopened and workers who gave up looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force. And economists, even if they disagree with his policy prescriptions, acknowledge that many areas have been left behind.While Friday\u2019s report will provide more support for Mr. Trump\u2019s argument, the lackluster pace of economic growth may also complicate the new administration\u2019s plans. Indeed, some of the headwinds in 2016 \u2014 like a widening trade deficit and cautious spending by businesses \u2014 could persist into 2017 and beyond.In 2016, personal consumption \u2014 which accounts for a majority of economic activity \u2014 slowed from 2014 and 2015. In addition, the sharp plunge in oil prices over the same period prompted steep cuts in energy production and exploration, contributing to a drop in business investment.All of this underscores why analysts say that Mr. Trump\u2019s growth rate target of 4 percent is audacious at best and fanciful at worst, especially given broader factors like an aging population and the growth rate of 2 percent or so that has prevailed since the recovery began in 2009.\u201cIt would defy gravity,\u201d Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago, said. Four percent growth would require big gains in the size of the work force and productivity, but neither is in the offing, Ms. Swonk said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s simple math.\u201dAt the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it is ready to raise interest rates a few times this year, and a faster expansion would only accelerate the Fed\u2019s plan to tighten monetary policy to head off inflation.Whatever the growth trajectory is in 2017, Fed officials will have a tricky time navigating the political and economic currents under Mr. Trump. Not only did he criticize the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, during the campaign, but his assessment of the current economy is more downbeat than the Fed\u2019s.One week into the Trump administration, there are many other economic wild cards for policy makers and private forecasters to contemplate, including the impact of congressional efforts to reshape the corporate tax code, trade tensions with Mexico and China, and the proposed repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.Tax cuts could open the way for new spending and investment. But more expensive imports from Mexico could be painful for many consumers, for example, while a trade war with China would hurt American companies like Apple, General Electric and Caterpillar.What is more, although the Commerce Department report focused on the last three full months of Mr. Obama\u2019s second term, anemic economic activity could add to the revenue shortfall the federal government will most likely face from the personal and corporate tax cuts Mr. Trump has discussed.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see how we would get to 4 percent growth given the current structure of the economy, especially demographics and productivity growth,\u201d said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. \u201cThat would be true no matter who is the president.\u201dThe retirement of the baby boomers will limit the size of the labor force, he said, while productivity gains from technology are not expected to accelerate from the current level, as they did with the adoption of the internet or mobile phones in the 1990s.Weak growth does strengthen arguments for a federal program to fortify the nation\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 an approach Mr. Trump has advocated that could provide an economic stimulus.Since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November, many economists have been raising their projected growth rates for the latter half of 2017 and for 2018.That is not necessarily because they feel Mr. Trump\u2019s policies will prove beneficial in the long run. Instead, it is because the tax cuts and infrastructure investments he has called for could bolster the economy in the short term.Mr. Faucher lifted his growth forecast to 2.4 percent in 2017 and 2.7 percent in 2018. Previously, he expected output to expand by 2.25 percent in each year.\u201cTax cuts and infrastructure spending represent a much more expansionary fiscal policy than we\u2019ve had in some time,\u201d he said.But Mr. Faucher cautioned that increasing the federal deficit, which stood at $587 billion in 2016, by hundreds of billions more in the coming years could increase interest rates, which were already moving higher.Rates, including mortgage rates for home buyers, are already up more than half a percentage point since the election, on expectations of more borrowing and faster growth.But in economics, as in life, everything cuts both ways. The rise in interest rates has also strengthened the dollar relative to other currencies.While that has been good news for American tourists, a stronger currency is bad news for American exporters, with imports becoming cheaper while the price of American-made products abroad rises.The prospect of a stronger dollar also makes it more difficult to achieve another of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic goals: a revival of the American manufacturing sector. Manufacturers are more dependent on foreign sales than many other businesses, but a rising dollar makes their products less competitive overseas.The dollar is rising on expectations of faster growth in the United States and because of the jump in domestic interest rates, which make American financial assets like bonds more appealing to global investors than lower-yielding debt in Europe and Asia.\u201cMr. Trump can\u2019t control the dollar, and that will be a big factor this year,\u201d Mr. Faucher said. \u201cTrade is likely to be a drag on growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saving Private Enterprise in Afghanistan", "Date": "2017-01-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe couture in Vogue\u2019s pages was also featured in a United States-sponsored exhibition I visited here in Dubai focusing on Afghan exports, including carpets, fruits and nuts, and marble and precious stones. It was a small sample of the riches that the country of my birth could sell to the world.Carpet exports from Afghanistan have reached around $200 million annually. The relatively meager sum, in terms of national exports, makes up about one-third of all legal Afghan exports of $600 million; since imports total $8 billion, the result is a huge trade deficit. The humble Dubai exhibition was a reminder that Afghanistan needs to look within to build an economic future after foreign aid runs out. It needs to judiciously harness its natural resources, modernize its economy beyond traditional goods, and alleviate the bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption that has hobbled its private sector.However, countries such as Iraq and several African nations have managed to extract resources despite insecurity. Afghan soldiers trained by the Americans can be used to ensure that large-scale investment is protected. The United States has committed 8,400 troops, and the incoming Trump administration should maintain that commitment until Afghanistan can protect itself.In Brussels this year, international donors led by the United States and the European Union committed to fund Afghanistan through 2020, hoping to buy four more years of stability and stem the record migration of despondent Afghans to Europe.By making security for mining and other projects a priority, both the Afghans and the United States will reduce their burden after 2020, helping the country move toward a point where it can fund its own national budget and security forces.While improving security, the Afghan government needs to harness its natural resources and invest in other sectors that will make use of Afghanistan\u2019s site at the crossroads of Asia. In addition to the traditional trade in agricultural products, wool and skins, trade in new sectors like data and information technology services also has potential.I was working with Etisalat, a telecommunications investor, in 2007, when it expressed interest in building an information technology park with other telecom and technology companies. After initial expressions of support from the Afghan government, there were no commitments to provide security or access to electricity. The project, which could have provided jobs to thousands of young Afghans, never took off. Almost a decade later, the country is still plagued by a lack of security, bureaucratic failure and weak infrastructure.Companies with falling revenues are squeezed to pay more taxes to meet targets set by international donors and the International Monetary Fund, a situation that is prompting major businesses to consider pulling out of Afghanistan. Instead of absolute revenue collection, international aid programs need to be contingent on reforms that increase G.D.P. and get the economic engines going.An air cargo terminal at the main airport in Kabul would allow for modern facilities and security checks to make it easier to consolidate exports. Cold storage units could house food products before takeoff. The new railroad lines from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan can be connected to a dry port that takes advantage of the road networks already built.Such investments, along with legal extraction of natural resources, emphasis on training and investment in I.T. and other modern industries, and loosening the chokehold of bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption on the existing private enterprise will make it possible for Afghanistan to one day provide for its own people.Masuda Sultan is the author of the memoir \u201cMy War at Home.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By 1994, the three countries were entwined in a trade deal that, in its 22 chapters covering 309 pages, lashed their economies together.It eliminated most tariffs on goods traded between the nations, and set in place processes to get rid of regulatory and other barriers. The idea was that over time a company in Ohio could do business with a firm in Ontario as easily as it did with one in Indiana.As the election showed, whether Nafta was a good thing for voters in the United States or a bad one continues to be argued. But there are some things most people who study these things can agree upon.The North American economy really does work as an integrated whole. United States exports to Mexico, for example, are now 3.5 times their 1993 level when adjusted for inflation. They have risen more than twice as fast as the overall economy. Trade between the United States and Canada has been pretty well balanced over time, but the United States has had about a $60 billion per year trade deficit with Mexico, importing more than it exports.In theory, yes. But it would be a mess, particularly if he tried to do it right off the bat.The administration also wants to change \u201crules of origin\u201d governing what counts as an automobile or other finished good produced within the free trade area. For example, a steering wheel might be assembled in Mexico but include parts made in China; the rules of origin state how many of those parts can come from China while still counting as a Mexican steering wheel and thus enjoy the benefits of the free trade zone.If the required share of North American parts were increased \u2014 from its current 62.5 percent for many auto parts to 75 percent, for example \u2014 it would give an advantage to manufacturers in the United States and reduce competition with the low-wage countries of Asia.Maybe. But keep in mind: This won\u2019t be a one-way street. Both Canada and Mexico expect concessions from the United States in return for concessions they make. And some of the things that the Mexican government most covets will rankle many Trump supporters.For example, Mexico wants better access to a program, widely enjoyed at the Canadian border, in which shippers that pass a security review are allowed to cross the border with a less intensive customs process (this is the international trade equivalent of the \u201cT.S.A. PreCheck\u201d security line at the airport).Mexico also seeks more favorable treatment for Mexican citizens with advanced skills seeking visas to work temporarily in the United States.Needless to say, making it easier for Mexican trucks and Mexican workers to get into the United States isn\u2019t exactly what Trump campaigned on. But that\u2019s the kind of concession that may be needed to get a trade deal.There is \u2014 though not necessarily in catastrophic fashion.Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, laid out a possibility in which the Trump administration does eventually withdraw from Nafta, but in a context in which it has worked out separate deals with Mexico and Canada that maintain most of the trade arrangements codified in Nafta.President Trump and his advisers have often spoken of a preference for bilateral deals instead of big multicountry trade deals. It is potentially a pathway for Trump to be able to proclaim that he ended a trade deal he assailed on the campaign trail, without wrecking the economy.Even that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be painless, however.\u201cIt would be like Humpty-Dumpty,\u201d Mr. Hufbauer said. \u201cThere will be firms and communities in the U.S. that will be adversely affected, that will close down if you disrupt these supply chains. That won\u2019t make for good newspaper coverage, and presumably the Trump team will want to avoid that.\u201dCampaign promises aside, even some people who have been opposed to Nafta and other trade deals don\u2019t view this as a first-order priority. U.S. trade with Canada is reasonably well balanced, and the trade deficit with Mexico is smaller than that with some giant Asian economies.Robert E. Scott, the director of trade and manufacturing policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, sees more to be gained by rethinking the trade relationship between the United States and China, Japan, South Korea and even Germany. \u201cThose are accountable for 80 percent of trade-related job losses over the last 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, Nafta is not a top priority.\u201d\u201cThere are much bigger fish to fry,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

The unionists are allied in London with the Conservative Party, which is pursuing Brexit, while Sinn Fein wants Northern Ireland to stay in the European Union and eventually reunite with Ireland.The stated reason for his resignation was to protest what he called the mishandling of a regional renewable energy program. The program was set up by the first minister, Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionists, and ran hundreds of millions of pounds over budget.Critics have accused Ms. Foster and her team of corruption and mismanagement of the program, and Sinn Fein has demanded that she step aside while the program is investigated; she has refused.The current Assembly was elected in early May, about seven weeks before the Brexit referendum; its term was due to run until 2021. The secretary of state for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, announced the dissolution of the Assembly and the timing of the election Monday evening.After Mr. McGuinness resigned last week, the Democratic Unionists tried to persuade Sinn Fein not to force an early election by restoring a government subsidy for study of the Irish language that Sinn Fein favored. Prime Minister Theresa May also held talks with Ms. Foster and Mr. McGuinness on Monday in hopes of resolving the crisis. But the Sinn Fein leader remained adamant.There is little sign that Northern Ireland has been a significant concern in London as the British government works out its strategy for Brexit. But the political crisis in Belfast may prevent Mrs. May from formally beginning the Brexit process in March, as she intends. The Supreme Court is considering whether she needs the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly to formally set the process in motion by invoking a European Union treaty provision known as Article 50.Support is growing in Northern Ireland for political parties that have no sectarian links, but even so, Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists are expected to emerge once again as the two leading parties after the election. They will then have three weeks to form a new government \u2014 a process likely to be acrimonious, especially if the Democratic Unionists lose seats, as is widely expected.Ms. Foster, the Democratic Unionist leader, accused Sinn Fein of putting its partisan interests ahead of the public good.\u201cThey have forced an election that risks Northern Ireland\u2019s future and its stability, and suits nobody apart from themselves,\u201d she said.In his announcement, Mr. Brokenshire appealed for calm: \u201cWhile it is inevitable that debate during an election period will be intense, I would strongly encourage the political parties to conduct this election with a view to the future of Northern Ireland and re-establishing a partnership government at the earliest opportunity after that poll.\u201dThe Irish foreign minister, Charlie Flanagan, also called for party leaders in the North to \u201ccome together respectfully, in accordance with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement, to deliver solutions for all of the people of Northern Ireland.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The president-elect wants to privatize health services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs. He wants to privatize public infrastructure \u2014 drawing private sector companies to fix, build and manage bridges and roads, water supplies and airports. He is selling privatization as a surefire winner that will deliver better services for less public money.\u201cThere\u2019s a magical thinking among business executives that something about the profit motive makes everything run better,\u201d noted Raymond Fisman, a professor of economics at Boston University. \u201cWhat is government going to be like when it is run by billionaire C.E.O.s that see the private sector as a solution to all the world\u2019s problems?\u201dA serious body of economics, not to mention reams of evidence from decades of privatizations around the world, suggests this belief is false.Of course, the government can also do a horrible job of running things. And private corporations do many things well. They tend to be much faster to innovate. In competitive markets, the profit motive makes for a powerful incentive to deliver all kinds of goods and services, from widgets to telephone calls, efficiently and effectively. A study found that opening nursing homes in Sweden to private providers actually improved patients\u2019 mortality rates.But it is critical to understand how profit seeking can go awry, giving companies a motivation to skimp on quality to bolster margins.

{"Headline": "Why Democracy Prevailed in Gambia", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 In the end, democracy prevailed.When Gambia\u2019s president refused to give up power, neighboring countries rallied troops and invaded this month, threatening to oust him by force.It was nothing short of a democratic coup. So was it an exception, or proof that African leaders are increasingly willing to demand \u2014 and enforce \u2014 democracy in the region?Democracy\u2019s record throughout the African continent has been checkered in recent years. While many West African nations, including Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast, have recently celebrated their first peaceful elections or transitions of power in decades, some have experienced violence and fraud at election time. In other countries, leaders appear poised to hold on to power until death, with little threat of intervention from neighboring countries.African leaders took such a strong line in Gambia\u2019s case for one chief reason: Mr. Jammeh was an easy target to align against. With a long record of human rights abuses and bizarre, repressive behavior, he had increasingly distanced himself from regional and Western governments. He had jailed journalists and opponents, some of whom were tortured or died in prison, and had been widely disliked for years. Numerous governments had denounced Mr. Jammeh\u2019s administration long before he declared that he would defend his presidency with his security forces.\u201cHe rubbed too many people the wrong way,\u201d said Mohammed Ibn Chambas, the top representative to West Africa from the United Nations. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have too many friends.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long for regional organizations to side with the winner of the election, Adama Barrow. The United Nations, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States denounced Mr. Jammeh\u2019s actions and called on the government of Gambia \u201cto abide by its constitutional responsibilities and international obligations,\u201d according to a joint statement from the groups. \u201cIt is fundamental that the verdict of the ballots should be respected.\u201dThe African Union announced that it would no longer recognize Mr. Jammeh as president as of Inauguration Day. And most important, the Economic Community of West African States \u2014 a group that despite its name has been increasingly active in peace and security matters \u2014 kept open a channel for a diplomatic solution, but simultaneously announced that it was preparing a regional military force to intervene if Mr. Jammeh did not step down.No one came to the defense of Gambia, a country with a shaky economy so small it barely registers on the global economic stage.\u201cGambia wasn\u2019t strategic or interesting to anyone,\u201d said Alex Vines, head of the Africa program for Chatham House, a research group. \u201cSo they were all united.\u201dWhile the show of force had clearly been planned in advance, the initial military foray across Gambian borders came about unintentionally, according to diplomats versed in activities in the region.The region also had recent history to consider. The outcome of a 2011 standoff in Ivory Coast weighed heavily in the minds of negotiators of the Gambian situation, according to Mr. Chambas of the United Nations.For such a tiny nation, Gambia and its presidential crisis attracted huge attention. For Americans, it offered some similarities. Like the election of Donald J. Trump, Gambia\u2019s vote showed a populist candidate with a real estate background and no political experience riding a wave of frustration over economic inequality.Both candidates pulled off a surprise victory. And in both elections, voters sought to punish elites who many thought did not deliver during their administrations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Rural America Voted for Trump", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorKnoxville, Iowa \u2014 One recent morning, I sat near two young men at a coffee shop here whom I\u2019ve known since they were little boys. Now about 18, they pushed away from the table, and one said: \u201cLet\u2019s go to work. Let the liberals sleep in.\u201d The other nodded.They\u2019re hard workers. As a kid, one washed dishes, took orders and swept the floor at a restaurant. Every summer, the other picked sweet corn by hand at dawn for a farm stand and for grocery stores, and then went to work all day on his parents\u2019 farm. Now one is a welder, and the other is in his first year at a state university on an academic scholarship. They are conservative, believe in hard work, family, the military and cops, and they know that abortion and socialism are evil, that Jesus Christ is our savior, and that Donald J. Trump will be good for America.They are part of a growing movement in rural America that immerses many young people in a culture \u2014 not just conservative news outlets but also home and church environments \u2014 that emphasizes contemporary conservative values. It views liberals as loathsome, misinformed and weak, even dangerous.Political analysts have talked about how ignorance, racism, sexism, nationalism, Islamophobia, economic disenfranchisement and the decline of the middle class contributed to the popularity of Mr. Trump in rural America. But this misses the deeper cultural factors that shape the thinking of the conservatives who live here.For me, it took a 2015 pre-caucus stop in Pella by J. C. Watts, a Baptist minister raised in the small town of Eufaula, Okla., who was a Republican congressman from 1995 to 2003, to begin to understand my neighbors \u2014 and most likely other rural Americans as well.\u201cThe difference between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans believe people are fundamentally bad, while Democrats see people as fundamentally good,\u201d said Mr. Watts, who was in the area to campaign for Senator Rand Paul. \u201cWe are born bad,\u201d he said and added that children did not need to be taught to behave badly \u2014 they are born knowing how to do that.\u201cWe teach them how to be good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe become good by being reborn \u2014 born again.\u201dHe continued: \u201cDemocrats believe that we are born good, that we create God, not that he created us. If we are our own God, as the Democrats say, then we need to look at something else to blame when things go wrong \u2014 not us.\u201dMr. Watts talked about the 2015 movie theater shooting in Lafayette, La., in which two people were killed. Mr. Watts said that Republicans knew that the gunman was a bad man, doing a bad thing. Democrats, he added, \u201cwould look for other causes \u2014 that the man was basically good, but that it was the guns, society or some other place where the blame lies and then they will want to control the guns, or something else \u2014 not the man.\u201d Republicans, he said, don\u2019t need to look anywhere else for the blame.Hearing Mr. Watts was an epiphany for me. For the first time I had a glimpse of where many of my conservative friends and neighbors were coming from. I thought, no wonder Republicans and Democrats can\u2019t agree on things like gun control, regulations or the value of social programs. We live in different philosophical worlds, with different foundational principles.Overlay this philosophical perspective on the American rural-urban divides of history, economy and geography, and the conservative individual responsibility narrative becomes even more powerful. In my experience, the urban-rural divide isn\u2019t really so much a red state versus blue state issue, it\u2019s red county versus blue county. Rural Iowans have more in common with the rural residents of Washington State and New Mexico \u2014 places I\u2019ve also lived \u2014 than with the residents of Des Moines, Seattle and Albuquerque.Look at a national map of which counties went for Democrats and which for Republicans: Overwhelmingly the blue counties are along waterways, where early river transportation encouraged the formation of cities, and surround state capitals. This is also where most investment in infrastructure and services is made. Rural Americans recognize that this is how it must be, as the cities are where most of the people are, yet it\u2019s a sore spot.In state capitols across America, lawmakers spend billions of dollars to take a few seconds off a city dweller\u2019s commute to his office, while rural counties\u2019 farm-to-market roads fall into disrepair. Some of the paved roads in my region are no longer maintained and are reverting to gravel. For a couple of generations now, services that were once scattered across rural areas have increasingly been consolidated in urban areas, and rural towns die. It\u2019s all done in the name of efficiency.In cities, firefighters and E.M.T.s are professionals whose departments are funded by local, state and federal tax dollars. Rural America relies on volunteers. If I have a serious heart attack at home, I\u2019ll be cold to the touch by the time the volunteer ambulance crew from a town 22 miles away gets here.Urban police officers have the latest in computer equipment and vehicles, while small-town cops go begging.In this view, blue counties are where most of our tax dollars are spent, and that\u2019s where all of our laws are written and passed. To rural Americans, sometimes it seems our taxes mostly go to making city residents live better. We recognize that the truth is more complex, particularly when it comes to social programs, but it\u2019s the perception that matters \u2014 certainly to the way most people vote.To make matters worse, jobs are continuing to move to metropolitan areas. Small-town chamber of commerce directors and mayors still have big dreams, and use their perkiest grins and tax abatements to try to lure new businesses, only to see their hopes dashed, time and again. Many towns with a rich history and strong community pride are already dead; their citizens just don\u2019t know it yet.Many moderate rural Republicans became supporters of Mr. Trump when he released his list of potential Supreme Court nominees who would allow the possibility of overturning Roe v. Wade. They also think the liberal worldview creates unnecessary rules and regulations that cripple the economy and take away good jobs that may belong to them or their neighbor. Public school systems and colleges are liberal tools of indoctrination that go after what we love and value most \u2014 our children.Some of what liberals worry about they see as pure nonsense. When you are the son or daughter of a carpenter or mechanic and a housewife or secretary who lives paycheck to paycheck, who can\u2019t afford to send kids to college, as many rural residents are, white privilege is meaningless and abstract.It\u2019s not just older people. The two young men at breakfast exemplify a younger generation with this view. When Ted Cruz campaigned in a neighboring town in 2015, I watched as a couple of dozen grade-school pupils sat at his feet, as if they were at a children\u2019s service at church. His campaign speech was nearly a sermon, and the children listened wide-eyed when he told them the world is a scary place, and it\u2019s godly men like him who are going to save them from the evils of President Obama, Hillary Clinton and their fellow Democrats.While many blame poor decisions by Mrs. Clinton for her loss, in an environment like this, the Democratic candidate probably didn\u2019t matter. And the Democratic Party may not for generations to come. The Republican brand is strong in rural America \u2014 perhaps even strong enough to withstand a disastrous Trump presidency.Rural conservatives feel that their world is under siege, and that Democrats are an enemy to be feared and loathed. Given the philosophical premises Mr. Watts presented as the difference between Democrats and Republicans, reconciliation seems a long way off.Robert Leonard is the news director for the radio stations KNIA/KRLS.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pastas With a New Selling Point: They\u2019re All Italian", "Date": "2017-01-03", "News": "Supported byPREDAZZO, Italy \u2014 A half-mile above sea level in the Dolomites, the fourth-generation pasta maker Riccardo Felicetti is leading a quiet revolution in the Italian pasta industry.But the real change Mr. Felicetti and other small pasta makers are creating is something more fundamental: using durum wheat grown exclusively in Italy.The move is paying off in flavor and sales, capitalizing on growing interest in expressions of terroir and feeding Italian pride at a time in which the country could use it.One might assume, on opening a box of pasta marked \u201c100 percent durum wheat, made in Italy,\u201d that all the grain used had been grown in Italy. But almost without exception, Italian pasta companies use a mix of about 70 percent Italian and 30 percent imported durum wheat.This is nothing new. In the early 1900s, Mr. Felicetti said, the nation imported about four-fifths of its durum wheat from Russia. After the Russian Revolution, Italy began importing grain from North America, and later, from Australia and other countries.The reasons have to do with both appetite and geography. Every year, an Italian eats on average about 60 pounds of pasta (compared with about 20 pounds for an American). Although Italian farmers grow an enormous amount of durum wheat \u2014 four million tons annually \u2014 they cannot meet the domestic pasta industry\u2019s demand, which requires five million tons or more.While the bigger pasta companies cannot subsist on Italian wheat alone, for smaller manufacturers, it is an increasingly appealing option.Mr. Felicetti began his foray into domestic wheat 16 years ago, inspired by another Italian specialty: grappa. In the early 1970s, Italian distillers, which had long made virtually indistinguishable grappas from mounds of undifferentiated grape pomace \u2014 the freshly crushed skins, seeds and pulp \u2014 began using the carefully selected pomace of single grape varieties.In 2004, after extensive experimentation to determine which wheat varieties performed best in particular regions, Pastificio Felicetti began manufacturing a line of pasta called Monograno, or \u201cone grain.\u201d Tasting notes on the packaging resemble the jottings of a sommelier: \u201cstone cooked bread, butter and bamboo shoots\u201d or \u201cpeanut butter and red date.\u201dPastificio Felicetti makes about 400 tons of Monograno pastas annually, about 15 percent of its total production. In 2014, its Monograno Spaghettoni, made from a variety of wheat called Matt, grown in Apulia in southern Italy, won the Specialty Food Association\u2019s Sofi Award in the pasta, rice or grain category. Another Monograno pasta won the same prize in 2016.In 2013, Pastificio Felicetti began using only Italian wheat for all of its pastas, although Mr. Felicetti emphasized that the decision had more to do with streamlining production than it did with concerns about the quality of his ingredients.\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily consider Italian durum wheat to be the best,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for us, getting wheat from Italy simplifies control of the supply chain.\u201dRustichella d\u2019Abruzzo, a small producer in central Italy, has also started an all-Italian-wheat pasta line, called PrimoGrano, or \u201cfirst grain.\u201d The pastas are made from three varieties of durum wheat \u2014 San Carlo, Varano and Mongibello \u2014 grown by farmers in Abruzzo.The company\u2019s owner, Gianluigi Peduzzi, planned to make PrimoGrano only once, to celebrate the company\u2019s 80th anniversary in 2004, but the response was so enthusiastic, he said, he made it a regular offering.Rustichella d\u2019Abruzzo makes about 100 tons of PrimoGrano each year, a figure Mr. Peduzzi said was growing 10 to 15 percent annually. Part of the appeal is the local wheat\u2019s texture and flavor. \u201cPrimoGrano is softer, and tasty, like bread,\u201d he said.The rationale was simple. \u201cIt\u2019s for sustainability reasons, energy use,\u201d said Luca Di Leo, a Barilla spokesman. \u201cYou avoid using energy to transport the wheat all over the world, which adds both to the cost of the product and to the environment.\u201dMr. Di Leo said the use of all-Italian wheat had more benefits. \u201cI think that it does give an edge to say, in Italy especially, that it\u2019s something that is made in Italy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is partly for patriotic reasons, and especially at a time in which the economy is facing hardships, and people are losing their jobs, to be able to say we make pasta that only uses Italian durum wheat, and that we are helping our farmers.\u201dThese efforts seem to be benefiting from Italy\u2019s vibrant local-food movement, which in recent years has been using the catchphrase \u201ckm 0,\u201d short for zero kilometers.Forthcoming legislation could give these pastas another edge in the marketplace. In the first half of this year, the European Commission expects to start requiring food packaging to state the country of origin of the primary ingredient, if it is different from the country where the product is made.Pastas made entirely of Italian wheat can be found at some specialty stores. Felicetti Monograno pasta is available from eataly.com, and at Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco. In New York, Rustichella d\u2019Abruzzo PrimoGrano is sold at some Dean & DeLuca shops, and Mancini pasta at Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, calls him a modern incarnation of Andrew Jackson. Newt Gingrich compares him to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Liberals prefer authoritarian analogues, like Vladimir V. Putin or figureheads of the Axis powers.Each comparison assumes that Mr. Trump is a political figure with a politician\u2019s instincts and calculations.But that is wrong. Mr. Trump is not just a president who is unusually obsessed with media. He is an aspiring media mogul who happens to be president. When Mr. Bannon told The New York Times that the media should \u201ckeep its mouth shut,\u201d he was being disingenuous. Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t want the media to keep its mouth shut. He wants to silence his critics, co-opt their distribution and broadcast the story of his stardom. After winning with the instincts of a media impresario, he will lead using the strategy of a media empire.Before the primaries even got rolling, Mr. Trump stormed to a lead through means that would be familiar to any upstart media or entertainment group. He identified an underserved audience demographic \u2014 the white working class \u2014 for whom he produced a range of genres from horror and comedy to uplift. Then he found a formula \u2014 nativist outrage and invective \u2014 for getting his message distributed on broadcast channels that he didn\u2019t own or control, which happens to be the challenge of every 21st century media company in an age of decentralization.Now in the White House, President Trump is poised to enact his agenda through extraordinary means \u2014 by broadcasting an alternative reality in which he seeks a monopoly on his own narrative and facts. It is 20th-century strongman meets 21st Century Fox.In conversations with dozens of entertainment and media executives and academics from hit-making industries over the past few years, I have learned that there are three overarching rules of popular entertainment. Each applies to Mr. Trump.Savior-to-sociopath might measure the full spectrum of Americans\u2019 feelings about Mr. Trump. His self-regard is legendary. His buildings are Pharaonic, emblazoned with golden surnames. Producers on the \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d edited his entrances and utterances for maximum authority, painting him as a Caesar of the boardroom. Mr. Trump carried this mythic posture through the primaries, where he said what other candidates never would, and into the Republican National Convention, where he told his supporters that he could do what they could not. \u201cNobody knows the system better than me,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is why I alone can fix it.\u201d In other words, I\u2019m not a politician. I\u2019m a superhero.The second rule of popular entertainment is that, as critical as it is to write stories that move people, distribution is more important than content. On Twitter, Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to distribute his message directly to voters is both novel and nostalgic at once. In the radio era, Franklin D. Roosevelt reached tens of millions of people with his fireside chats. When television eclipsed radio, presidential addresses remained blockbuster events. In 1970 alone, Richard Nixon delivered nine prime-time addresses to the nation, which reached half of all television-owning households.But the presidency\u2019s star power has shrunk as the entertainment options around him have grown. Ronald Reagan\u2019s average address reached less than 40 percent of households, and Bill Clinton\u2019s reached 30 percent. At the same time, the average presidential sound bite on the news shrank from 40 seconds in 1968 to less than seven seconds in the 1990s. Cable created the golden age of television, but it ended a golden age for the bully pulpit.That is, before Mr. Trump. Twitter in his hands is an old-fashioned mainline to voters, with a key twist. Mr. Trump\u2019s chief audience \u2014 the one he watches constantly and whose insults hurt the most \u2014 isn\u2019t the public. It\u2019s the newspapers and TV shows; the mass media is the audience. In a 2013 meeting of New York Republicans, when people told him he couldn\u2019t run for president by relying on TV alone, Mr. Trump disagreed, according to Politico. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the power of the mass audience,\u201d he said.THE third rule of popular entertainment is the most distressing for the news media and for the country at large. The dark history of 20th-century entertainment is that media blockbusters seek to become monopolies. For nearly half of the 1900s, the movie studios owned movie theaters, before the Supreme Court ruled it illegal. Throughout the century, music labels bribed radio stations to play their handpicked songs over and over, until states cracked down on this practice, known as \u201cpayola.\u201dThis is the point where Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon\u2019s ambitions meet. The White House wants to establish a political media monopoly, which seeks dominion over its own set of facts, by demonizing critical news sources (even those within the government) and promoting sycophantic alternatives.The president has now labeled CNN \u201cfake news\u201d on live television and on Twitter. His adviser Kellyanne Conway deemed a series of obvious lies about the size of his inaugural crowd \u201calternative facts.\u201d Mr. Trump issued gag orders to prevent government agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency, from making public statements that presumably contradict his personal beliefs. In the last month, the administration has hailed the Fox News Channel, cited stories from Breitbart, the largest platform for the alt-right, and tweeted stories from LifeZette, a site that traffics in false pro-Trump rumors. We are seeing the origins of a White House Media Group, a constellation of pro-Trump sources that get access and kudos at the expense of traditional news companies.In a world of Trump-branded media, what role do we, the viewers, play? The next few years will be full of false certainties \u2014 and false uncertainties. Objective lies will get government support; objective truths will be darkened by cynicism. It could also be an age of brilliant investigative journalism and renewed civic engagement. Before Mr. Trump, social media had shrunk the universe of news to a handful of preferred stories picked by peers. But democracy was not designed for catharsis, and news was never meant to be therapy. Digging out the truth, for both reporters and readers, is painstaking and sometimes painful work. But the next four years are going to hurt, anyway. We might as well spend the time learning to love digging.It\u2019s hard enough to predict the next four hours of the Trump administration, much less the next four years. But the publicity-driven instincts that got Mr. Trump to the White House may serve him terribly in the Oval Office. He is unpopular and torn between paradoxical instincts to condemn traditional news companies while seeking out their approval. The volume of early leaks suggests that many aides are already weary of a president who elevates representations of popularity over politics and policy.But Mr. Trump has had dreadful weeks before \u2014 and here we are. Several months ago, many people thought that he would badly lose the presidential race and build a television network, Trump TV. Instead, he has won both: a presidency that seeks to broadcast a separate media reality, in which an unpopular president is actually a hero of the people. If he succeeds, the Trump Show will be worse than reality television. It will not be reality at all.Derek Thompson is a senior editor at The Atlantic and the author of \u201cHit Makers: The Science of Popularity in an Age of Distraction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As you note, its $232 million high-end estimate is about $70 million more than the figure offered by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for his more robust Excelsior Scholarship proposal.Few New Yorkers are more enthusiastic than I am about tuition-free CUNY and SUNY. Tens of thousands of Brooklynites have crippling student debt weighing down their ability to invest in their futures, and the status quo is simply unsustainable if we hope to keep the middle class in our borough.That said, our students and universities would lose long term if the state establishes a program that it cannot fund to scale, one that it will potentially expect New York City and other municipalities to pick up the slack for in the 11th hour.Senator Bernie Sanders is spot on in our need to be progressively bold, and the Legislature certainly ought to take robust tuition assistance action this session. We must also be fiscally wise, as we face the threat of federal funding cuts from the incoming Trump administration. ERIC L. ADAMSBorough PresidentBrooklynTo the Editor:As a professor who has fought for free tuition at the City University of New York for more than 25 years, I am excited that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has proposed free tuition for lower and middle-income students at our state\u2019s public universities.When the City University began in 1847, it was as the Free Academy, and it was inspired by the democratic ideal of equal access to higher education. The city\u2019s poor and recent immigrants were seen as having as much right to develop their minds as their wealthier counterparts.Since the mid-1970s, this ideal has taken a back seat to budgetary concerns. Granted, these concerns are important, but the democratic ideal goes to the heart of the kind of society we want to be.WILLIAM CRAINNew YorkThe writer is a professor of psychology at City College, CUNY.To the Editor:Free tuition at state schools has more benefits than just to ease the cost burden on students and their middle-income families. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone.Low-cost higher education will inevitably increase the talent of state university student bodies, as more students desire to avoid loans by staying in state. Additionally, as a consequence, New York State universities will become more of an engine of economic growth for the state.Many think that California\u2019s position as the premier economy within the country is primarily due to its stellar state university system.

{"Headline": "Suspending Disbelief in a Savage \u2018Endgame\u2019", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookNEW HAVEN \u2014 Suspension of our disbelief is a natural element of attending theater. Those unhappy folks speaking English under an ornate proscenium are not really Russian aristocrats, after all. The dynamos pouring forth raps about American history are not really fomenting revolution.Brian Dennehy stars in \u201cEndgame,\u201d playing the irascible Hamm, who presides over a bizarre human menagerie from his movable throne in a grimy bunker. With an unruly gray beard, Mr. Dennehy looks rather like a Santa Claus gone to seed, and Hamm does indeed take an almost jolly pleasure in harassing his servant, Clov, portrayed by Reg E. Cathey.Demanding to be moved an inch this way or that, or just demanding that Clov attend to his needs \u2014 Hamm is blind and immobile \u2014 he lords it over Clov, and is scarcely more respectful to his parents, Nagg (Joe Grifasi) and Nell (Lynn Cohen), who live enclosed in canvas garbage bins. From the small windows in their basement, Clov occasionally searches for signs of life but sees only a gray wasteland.Directed by Gordon Edelstein, the production is perhaps the best \u201cEndgame\u201d I\u2019ve seen: sharp in its savage humor, attentive to the language, and increasingly unsettling as these gruesome figures, at first repellent and almost cartoonish, gnaw at our souls. As they squabble or reminisce, we see in them grotesque emblems of humanity in various states of decay, but still clinging to life, and to one another, because that is what humans do. Even as life becomes absurd and unendurable, it is endured.Mr. Cathey\u2019s dead-eyed Clov shuffles around the stage, dutifully obeying Hamm\u2019s commands, but he also contains a smoldering sense of resentment that threatens at any moment to flare into open rebellion. Despite his humiliatingly submissive stance, Mr. Cathey imbues Clov with a haunting dignity.Mr. Dennehy is terrific as the cantankerous Hamm. Although his eyes are obscured behind dark glasses, Hamm\u2019s squirming, sudden changes of mood, from irritated to elegiac to abusive, arrive like small shock waves. And while he lords it over his petty kingdom with a preening arrogance, Hamm is, of course, as pathetically dependent on Clov as Clov is on him \u2014 ultimately more so \u2014 and thus he, too, invokes as much pity as horror. (It is vaguely hinted that their relationship goes beyond master and servant, and that Hamm is in fact Clov\u2019s father or adoptive father.)The veteran actors Ms. Cohen and Mr. Grifasi are likewise superb. Ms. Cohen\u2019s Nell has an ingratiating smile that\u2019s heartbreaking; she seems perfectly content to subsist on the crumbs of attention tossed her way. She and Mr. Grifasi make clear how the embers of their love still glow, albeit ever more dimly. In their separate chambers, they offer a grim image of the ultimate isolation that will descend on us all.The enterprising Ms. Kapil, meanwhile, might take a few tips from Beckett\u2019s notable economy (although \u201cEndgame\u201d is among his longer stage works). Her \u201cImogen Says Nothing\u201d meanders across some mighty strange terrain, and ultimately fails to derive much meaning from the admittedly inventive strands of its story.Through some confusion she finds herself in conversation with two of Shakespeare\u2019s actors, the dismissive John Heminges (Christopher Ryan Grant) and the more sympathetic Henry Condell (Hubert Point-Du Jour). They offer little help, but somehow Imogen finds herself falling in with the company.Women were not, of course, allowed to appear on stages in Elizabethan England, but Ms. Kapil latches on to a footnote in the history of \u201cMuch Ado About Nothing\u201d to spin a fanciful tale suggesting that, on at least one occasion, this rule was broken. The back story: A character named Imogen, Leonato\u2019s wife, is referred to only in a few stage directions in early versions of the text, but was later eliminated from it in others and is often cut from contemporary versions.\u201cImogen Says Nothing\u201d puts forth the whimsical theory that, at the first performance, John, who was portraying Leonato, was so inebriated that Imogen was corralled into shepherding him around the stage so that he could say his lines without collapsing into a puddle, thus making her, in theory, the first woman to appear in a Shakespeare play.Nor does Ms. Kapil\u2019s fertile imagination stop at revising Shakespearean history. Noting that bearbaiting was, like the theater of the time, a popular form of entertainment, she folds into her tale a troupe of bears who carp about their degrading lives from inside their cages.And, lo, in the play\u2019s truly head-scratching twist, it turns out that Imogen herself was once a bear, who escaped from captivity and \u2014 presto! \u2014 somehow became human. When trying to urge her former fellow sufferers to escape as she did, she is once again captured by the impresario of the bearbaiting company (a commandingly malicious Ben Horner).While I\u2019d grant Ms. Kapil full marks for invention, \u201cImogen Says Nothing\u201d comes a little too close to saying nothing fully coherent itself. Buried in its layers is some sort of statement about the injustice of being erased from history. According to the play, Quaere, in Latin, means something missing or absent, and despite Shakespeare\u2019s resistance, Imogen eventually has herself written into the First Folio, which Henry has dedicated himself to preparing. Lurking in the bearbaiting plot, too, is a lesson about the cruelty of man\u2019s dominion over nature.But while the production, directed by Laurie Woolery, is acted with brio, humor and commitment by its ample cast, the play becomes bogged down in reams of unnecessary dialogue and wayward plotting. In this case, to enter into the world of the play, your ability to suspend disbelief would have to be stretched to the length of a suspension bridge. For this viewer, it was a bridge too far.EndgameTickets Through Sunday. Long Wharf Theater, New Haven; 203-787-4282, longwharf.org.

{"Headline": "Taliban, Collecting Bills for Afghan Utilities, Tap New Revenue Sources", "Date": "2017-01-28", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The Afghan government faces a peculiar problem in at least two major provinces: It provides precious electricity, some of it imported at costly rates from neighboring countries, but Taliban militants collect most of the bills.If the government cuts off power, it will further anger a population that is already disenchanted. If it does not, the revenue from the power will continue to provide more income to an already emboldened Taliban.But as they have taken over increasingly large areas in the past two years, they have found new ways of diversifying and collecting revenue, according to interviews with officials, Taliban commanders and local residents.The diversification of the revenue collection system, in the face of a central government largely dependent on Western donations and hobbled by corruption, has raised fears that the balance of the war could tilt even further in the year ahead, and that the insurgency is becoming more entrenched and acting as a shadow government in parts of the countryside.\u201cWhat it suggests, essentially, is that the group is becoming more efficient in systematically taxing the areas they either control or have a lot of influence on,\u201d said Timor Sharan, senior analyst for Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group, a research institute. \u201cEfficiency of taxation is quite significant in terms of sustaining the group for a long time.\u201dIn addition to collecting electricity bills from thousands of homes in provinces such as Kunduz and Helmand, the insurgents levy taxes on potato harvests, flour mills, teachers\u2019 salaries, marriage ceremonies, and fuel and vegetable trucks crossing their checkpoints.But the United Nations report also spoke of the group\u2019s diversification efforts.\u201cAnalysis of Taliban revenue sources suggests that they remain highly diverse, with various income streams that enable the Taliban to quickly substitute for declining asset streams,\u201d the report said.Mr. Sharan said the increased revenue collection was largely due to a restructuring of the insurgency spearheaded by its former leader, Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, who was seen more as a businessman heavily involved in the drug trade than a conventional Taliban ideologue. Part of the reason for the change was an expected decline in external funding amid growing competition for resources from other militant groups like the Islamic State.\u201cMansour, in his restructuring, gave more autonomy to the local Taliban groups and tasked them with finding more locally driven revenues and securing their funding at the local level,\u201d Mr. Sharan said.The Taliban have also been hit by a dwindling number of major NATO military contracts and development projects from which they could take a cut.Western and Afghan officials say the greater fund-raising autonomy for local commanders is also a consequence of chaos within the Taliban leadership and infighting over resources after an American drone strike killed Mullah Mansour in May.A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the group relied on a variety of resources, including Islamic taxes and offerings from farmers and local residents, donations from traders abroad and from Islamic countries, and booty captured from Afghan forces. He acknowledged that in their areas of control in places like Kunduz and Helmand, the Taliban collected the electricity bills.\u201cOur territory has expanded in some areas, and since our presence has increased there, our resources have also increased,\u201d Mr. Mujahid said.At first glance, each strand of Taliban revenue might seem insignificant. But for an insurgency numbering about 30,000 men, who operate in small groups, it is a substantial sum.The head of the power department in Kunduz Province, Hamidullah, said the Taliban were collecting electricity payments from close to 14,000 homes in the province, possibly as much as $200,000 for every two-month cycle.Haji Ayoub, an elder from Boz Qandahari village, north of Kunduz city, said that two months ago, the Taliban had stopped government electricity workers and taken the bills they delivered by bicycle. Then, they started calling people to come to the local mosque and pay.Mr. Ayoub said he owed the government about $200, for electricity used at his home and a flour mill he ran before it went bankrupt.\u201cThe Taliban representative took the money,\u201d Mr. Ayoub said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t sign or stamp the bill. He just tore half of it and gave me back the other half and wrote something in his notebook.\u201dHe added, \u201cI said, \u2018At least put your signature on the bill so I can bring it to the government to show that I have paid,\u2019 but he didn\u2019t.\u201dIn Helmand Province, members of the provincial council said most of the territory was controlled by the Taliban, who collected bills in places they held where there was electricity.\u201cWe cannot switch off the electricity in Taliban areas, because then they create big problems for electrical poles along the way to cities like Kandahar and Lashkargah,\u201d said Nasrullah Qani, the power department\u2019s director in Helmand.Residents in Helmand said the collection of electricity charges differed by district. In Kajaki district, the Taliban collect a fee once a year, from $60 to $150 depending on usage. In other areas, it is monthly.\u201cFor each electric bulb you use, they charge you $2 a month,\u201d said Haji Ziaudin, a shopkeeper in Musa Qala district.The Taliban have a multitude of ways to make money and to finance their local groups.Just south of Kabul, the Taliban set up checkpoints, taxing vehicles transporting vegetables, according to residents. New York Times journalists saw copies of receipts the Taliban provided to drivers for vehicles they taxed.In the western province of Ghor, farmers described paying taxes in cash and kind. Abdul Qayoum, 47, a potato farmer in Pasaband district, said he paid taxes to the Taliban twice a season, and two months ago had handed over about 220 pounds of potatoes.\u201cThe reason we give tax to the Taliban is because we have to take our vegetables to the Dahane Jamal bazaar, which is the main market for us, and it is controlled by the Taliban,\u201d Mr. Qayoum said.Sakhidad, 48, another resident of Pasaband, described how the Taliban had moved from an arbitrary system of collection, to a more ordered one enforced with strictness and fear.When the Taliban first took over the district three years ago, Mr. Sakhidad said in an interview last year, all those who had worked for the government had to pay a fine. Then, they imposed a regular 10 percent tax on harvests.Reached over the phone again recently, Mr. Sakhidad said that he continued to pay taxes to the Taliban and that he had given the new commander in the village $60 in taxes two months ago \u2014 a large sum for a farmer.But he said he was relieved that the former Taliban commander in his village, Mullah Gul Agha, had been replaced. In one of his final acts, he said, Mullah Gul Agha pulled out his pistol and shot and killed a man who had protested paying his taxes, saying he had already paid one of the commander\u2019s associates, Mr. Sakhidad said.\u201cThey force people to pay the taxes \u2014 it is not voluntary.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jolted by Deaths, Obama Found His Voice on Race", "Date": "2017-01-14", "News": "Tensions across the country prompted the president to abandon his early reticence on race again and again.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Only weeks after 70 million Americans chose a black man for president, shattering a racial barrier that had stood for the entirety of the nation\u2019s 232-year history, no one in the White House, especially the man in the Oval Office, wanted to talk about race.President Obama had made a pragmatic calculation in January 2009, as the financial crisis drove communities across the United States toward economic collapse. Whatever he did for African-Americans, whose neighborhoods were suffering more than others, he would not describe as efforts to specifically help Black America.Mr. Obama made the decision knowing how powerfully his election had raised the hopes of African-Americans \u2014 and knowing that no matter what he did, it would not be seen as enough.\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018They are going to hate us one day,\u2019\u201d said Melody Barnes, who is black and served as Mr. Obama\u2019s first domestic policy adviser, recalling her sadness when she stood in an auditorium in those early months as a crowd cheered for the success of the new president. \u201cI knew that we couldn\u2019t do everything that people wanted to meet those expectations.\u201dThe fear inside the West Wing was that promoting a \u201cblack agenda\u201d and aiming programs directly at African-Americans at a time of widespread economic anxiety would provoke a white backlash \u2014 the kind that, years later, White House officials would view as helping to elect Donald J. Trump.\u201cAt a minimum, that would have been tone deaf,\u201d said Eric H. Holder Jr., who served as the nation\u2019s first African-American attorney general during much of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, \u201cand at worst, would have created a reaction in the larger community that would have prevented the things you wanted to do.\u201dMr. Obama, who had grown up straddling two worlds as the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas, wanted to be the president of all America. Framing his efforts in racial terms could exacerbate something that was already simmering, he thought.But over the next seven and a half years, racial tensions across the country forced Mr. Obama to abandon his early reticence on race again and again. Ultimately he led a national conversation on race ignited by spasms of violence \u2014 police shootings and protests in Florida, South Carolina, Missouri and elsewhere. Inside the White House, aides recall them as among his most painful moments as president.After he leaves office, Mr. Obama will continue that conversation in work for My Brother\u2019s Keeper and other programs to help black youths. There is plenty to do. As much as his once-unthinkable presidency has inspired and empowered African-Americans, black unemployment is still about double that for whites. Nearly a quarter of blacks are living in poverty, almost the same as in 1976.\u201cHe made it seem like everything was all good, and it\u2019s not,\u201d said Thelonious Stokes, 21, a black artist whose experiences of being racially profiled in Chicago left him jaded about the state of race relations. \u201cWe almost needed Trump to show the true state of America.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s earliest public reflection about race as president backfired. Asked about a black Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., a friend of Mr. Obama\u2019s who was arrested in July 2009 trying to enter his own house by a white officer, Mr. Obama immediately took sides.\u201cThe profound mistake of Reverend Wright\u2019s sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society. It\u2019s that he spoke as if our society was static; as if no progress had been made,\u201d Mr. Obama said that March day in Philadelphia, urging people to move beyond old racial wounds. \u201cLet us be our brother\u2019s keeper, Scripture tells us. Let us be our sister\u2019s keeper. Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well.\u201dBut the beer summit was deeply disturbing to many of the president\u2019s African-American advisers, who thought he should not have backed down. The officer had acted stupidly, they thought, and the nation\u2019s first black president ought to be able to say so.The meeting \u201cwas demeaning and diminished his leadership and his voice at that moment,\u201d one of them recalled, asking for anonymity to bluntly discuss the topic. \u201cPeople thought we were being punked. I got so many emails, so many phone calls from people I respected: \u2018He was right. Why are you backpedaling?\u2019\u201dInside the West Wing, the impact was clear. Mr. Obama would have to be more cautious when it came to racial issues, particularly ahead of the 2012 re-election campaign. The issue of race was too divisive at a time when Mr. Obama needed to emphasize inclusion.\u201cWhat it did teach us is that you just have to be careful about the words that you choose,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you shy away from issues that arise that deal with race, just as he didn\u2019t shy away from Reverend Wright. But you have to be sensitive to a long history of people reacting strongly to the topic.\u201dOutside the White House, people noticed, too: \u201cHe plainly arrested him because he was black,\u201d said Edward G. Robinson Sr., who is black and works at a box factory in Cleveland. Mr. Obama \u201cbacktracked because he wanted to be everybody\u2019s president.\u201dLike others, Mr. Robinson said the president was met with racially motivated disrespect in Washington, and pointed to the moment when a white Republican lawmaker yelled, \u201cYou lie!\u201d at the president during a congressional address.The president\u2019s voice was shaking with emotion.\u201cIf I had a son he would look like Trayvon Martin,\u201d Mr. Obama told Ms. Jarrett and David Plouffe, his senior adviser and former campaign manager, as the three talked in the Oval Office about what the president should say publicly about the death of the 17-year-old African-American at the hands of a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. \u201cI am going to say that.\u201dIt was March 2012, nearly three years after the beer summit. The specter of that meeting still hovered and Mr. Obama was, in a sense, taking sides again.But in personalizing the shooting, his aides recalled, Mr. Obama\u2019s hope was that people might view African-African boys differently if they saw Trayvon through the president\u2019s own eyes.Mr. Obama headed out to the Rose Garden, announced his nomination of a new World Bank president, then took the question from a reporter that everyone knew was coming: \u201cCan you comment on the Trayvon Martin case, sir?\u201dMoments after Mr. Obama returned to the Oval Office, Gene Sperling, one of his top economic advisers, stopped by with tears in his eyes.\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what that will mean to my son,\u201d Mr. Sperling, who is white and is married to an African-American woman, told the president, according to a colleague who was there at the time.This time, the president\u2019s comments were embraced by many outside the White House, too. Media reports focused on the emotion Mr. Obama had displayed \u2014 rare for a politician whose usual demeanor was cool and professorial.\u201cFor him to say things like that in front of the entire country and the world, I think sends a strong message to people,\u201d Ryan Shultz, 33, an art teacher in Chicago who is white, said in a recent interview.\u201cCrime is still bad and police are still shooting black people left and right,\u201d Mr. Shultz said. \u201cI live in Chicago \u2014 a murder capital of the United States \u2014 and it\u2019s crazy and it hasn\u2019t gotten that much better, I don\u2019t think.\u201d\u201cYou want to try to calm the situation,\u201d Mr. Holder said, recalling the discussions he had with the president and Ms. Jarrett about what to say. \u201cYou want to reassure the community that an investigation will be done and done fully. But you want to make sure that the people in law enforcement know it is done fairly.\u201d\u201cThere was that trust gap,\u201d he added. \u201cThat was something that had to be dealt with.\u201dAs the violence worsened, Mr. Holder, Mr. Obama and Ms. Jarrett concluded that the president needed to denounce the violence \u2014 and at the same time criticize the police for their conduct during the protests.For the rest of his presidency, Mr. Obama would strive for the balance he struck in his remarks that day: empathy and understanding for African-Americans and support for the police and the rule of law. But however he weighed in, the events in Ferguson made clear that he could no longer hang back and instead had to lead a national debate about race, violence and unity.\u201cOnce it was so in America\u2019s face, police brutality, it blew the circuit,\u201d said Bill Burton, an African-American who served as deputy White House press secretary during the first term. \u201cIt made it possible to have that conversation that our country had actively not been having.\u201dInevitably, Mr. Obama\u2019s striving for balance often left him vilified by both sides.\u201cThe president has never been a police officer. He\u2019s never walked in a police officer\u2019s shoes,\u201d Mr. Pasco said last July. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a breakdown in communication more than there is a breakdown in insincerity or intent.\u201dJa\u2019Mal Green, a 21-year-old Black Lives Matter activist based in Chicago, said he thought Mr. Obama \u201cignored\u201d the calls of organizers for federal policy and funding aimed at stopping police brutality. Mr. Green said he also grew tired of hearing Mr. Obama couple his grief for families in racially charged shooting episodes with statements supporting white police officers.\u201cHe is trying to walk a neutral line and he wants to please both sides,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cHe wants to please black people and then he wants to please police supporters and police officers and police unions. But sometimes you have to pick a side in situations. You need to pick your time when you fight for home or you\u2019ll just have everybody hating you.\u2019\u201dMr. Stokes, the 21-year-old artist from Chicago, felt similarly disappointed.\u201cChicago is the exact same,\u201d Mr. Stokes said. \u201cHe simply opened up, maybe, a lane for young men like me to just maybe be accepted a little bit more to people that don\u2019t accept educated black people. But that\u2019s it, literally. White America is still running everything, and that means that nothing is changing.\u201d\u201cYou took something very precious away from me,\u201d Nadine Collier, the daughter of 70-year-old Ethel Lance, told Mr. Roof, as her voice rose in anguish. \u201cI will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again. But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.\u201dIt was an extraordinary scene, broadcast live on television, which moved many who saw it to tears. Mr. Obama was traveling and did not see it in real time, but when Eric Schultz, the deputy press secretary, read Ms. Collier\u2019s words out loud to Mr. Obama on Marine One, the presidential helicopter, the president was awed by what he heard.\u201cHe said, \u2018That\u2019s what we need to recognize here, the ability of people to forgive on the worst day of their lives.\u2019 It really struck him,\u201d Ms Jarrett recalled. \u201cWe sat there and talked about it on the helicopter. About that quality, the amazing grace.\u201dLater, in the Oval Office, Mr. Obama struggled with his chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, to come up with the right words for a eulogy for the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the pastor of the Charleston church and a friend of the president\u2019s.\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to say,\u201d Mr. Keenan told Mr. Obama, according to Ms. Jarrett. \u201cYou\u2019ve said everything that one could possibly say on the subject.\u201dEventually, the president decided that instead of talking about guns he would talk about what black churches stood for and the meaning of grace.At the beginning of his term, the podcast could have caused a fury and Mr. Obama might have pulled back again. But events in the country \u2014 especially the deaths of young black men \u2014 had given him more opportunities to engage the topic. Mr. Pinckney\u2019s funeral was one of them.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to just whistle in the wind,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for a chance to talk to people when they are ready to hear him. He doesn\u2019t ignore moments.\u201dOne of those moments came this past May.Mr. Obama had a little more than eight months left in office, and he had already said plenty about race. But as he headed to deliver the 2016 commencement address at Howard University, the historically black college in Washington, Mr. Obama said he had something he wanted to add.It was a message to young African-Americans, the ones who wanted to protest the injustices they saw around them. The president had invited some of them to the White House to talk with him about their cause, and in a few cases, they refused the invitation. People close to him said that made him burn.For the president, a onetime community organizer in Chicago, it was a crucial distinction. Mr. Obama had tilted against the powerful and connected \u2014 he called his time as an organizer \u201cthe best education I ever had, better than anything I got at Harvard Law School.\u201d His approach had always been more strategic than confrontational and foreshadowed his cautious, meticulous attitude in the White House.In the speech, Mr. Obama recalled working as a young Illinois state senator to fight racial profiling, not by calling the police racist, but by sitting down and negotiating a new law. \u201cSo we engaged and we listened, and we kept working until we built consensus,\u201d he said.By the time he became president, people close to Mr. Obama said, he was frustrated by the idea that young activists would view themselves as tainted if they came into the White House to talk to him. In the speech, he urged the young protesters not to give in to the idea that the system is rigged.\u201cThat will lead to more cynicism, and less participation, and a downward spiral of more injustice and more anger and more despair,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s never been the source of our progress. That\u2019s how we cheat ourselves of progress.\u201d\u201cListen,\u201d he told the students. \u201cEngage. If the other side has a point, learn from them. If they\u2019re wrong, rebut them. Teach them.\u201dMr. Obama has told people that he avoided framing his early White House efforts in overtly racial terms because he wanted to avoid a white backlash \u2014 but acknowledges that he got one anyway.Still, the president repeatedly tells crowds like the students at Howard that race relations are better since he graduated from college. \u201cTo deny how far we\u2019ve come would do a disservice to the cause of justice, to the legions of foot soldiers,\u201d he told them last May.In Atlanta, Latonda Henderson, a 40-year-old marketing consultant, watched Mr. Obama\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump with admiration as the president she loved sat down with the man who had led the movement questioning the legitimacy of his birth certificate.\u201cYou sit down with people who opposed you,\u201d said Ms. Henderson, who is black. \u201cYou sit down and try to find a common ground with people who were attacking your family, spitting on your family. That\u2019s President Obama\u2019s legacy.\u201dMichael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Yamiche Alcindor from New York.Advertisement"}

(Penelope reminds Alex that they have a TV, a refrigerator and a laptop. \u201cThose are things poor people have!\u201d he says.) But it\u2019s based on an acknowledgment you don\u2019t really hear in prime time anymore: that there is a class divide, nebulous but real, and that your family is closer to the bad side of it.The new \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d arriving on Friday, is lively and full of voice, a rare reboot that\u2019s better than the original. It\u2019s a throwback in the best sense, to an era of mainstream, socially engaged kitchen-sink sitcoms. And just as the political debate has pitted diversity against class in a zero-sum contest, it\u2019s a reminder that the two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.With few exceptions (like ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Middle\u201d), sitcoms moved into offices, cafes and living rooms populated by comfortably white-collar characters. (A recent \u201cblack-ish\u201d slyly acknowledged this remove; its affluent parents were mortified when their youngest son took an aptitude test that pegged him as a future \u201cskilled laborer.\u201d)Work \u2014 nonprofessional, non-doctor/lawyer/cop work \u2014 became the stuff of basic-cable reality TV (\u201cDeadliest Catch\u201d). Just as actual labor became increasingly invisible to consumers, shunted off overseas or hidden through e-commerce, working-class people entered TV through the poor door, or not at all.With \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d \u2014 like \u201cFuller House\u201d and \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d another product of Netflix\u2019s drive to exhume our every nostalgic memory \u2014 peak TV is restoring something of what peak TV took away: the kind of family that buys discounted meat at the grocery store and whose old car stalls when you turn on the air-conditioning.But it spoke to the times. Compared with Mr. Lear\u2019s outspoken Maude, Ann Romano (Bonnie Franklin) expressed her feminism practically \u2014 bouncing from job to job, getting the rent paid and raising two independent girls. (This was in 1975, just five years after it was deemed too outrageous to have Mary Richards be divorced in \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show.\u201d)The update, which Mr. Lear produces with Gloria Calder\u00f3n Kellett and Mike Royce, moves the setting from Indianapolis to Echo Park, Los Angeles, and reimagines the family as Cuban-American. (Mr. Lear\u2019s cross-cultural remake of his own work recalls how he adapted the British \u201cSteptoe and Son\u201d as \u201cSanford and Son,\u201d with an African-American cast.)The most productive rethinking involves Penelope, a veteran of Afghanistan who works as a medical assistant. The war ended her marriage \u2014 she separated from her husband, also a soldier, who developed a drinking problem from stress \u2014 and left her with anxiety and a bum shoulder. The show understands, in a way comedies about more privileged families don\u2019t have to, that circumstances shape choices and exact costs.Despite the studio-audience laughs, the series works best in character-driven dramedy mode. The season has a serial arc, and Ms. Machado (previously of \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d) handles the emotional material with a light touch. One of the strongest episodes is built around a long, frustrating phone call with the Department of Veterans Affairs as Penelope tries to wrangle a chiropractor referral.The zinger-based humor is clunkier. Stephen Tobolowsky carries some familiar workplace subplots as Penelope\u2019s sad-sack boss, and the show leans heavily on Ricky Ricardo-esque jokes about Lydia\u2019s accent.Still, if the comedy can be dated, the retro approach \u2014 multicamera, theatrical, issues-based \u2014 feels current, as the headlines recall the tumult of the \u201970s and the president-elect seems to be tweeting from Archie Bunker\u2019s armchair. (One of the season\u2019s themes, immigration, lands harder, if differently, from the way it might have before the election.)If TV can help divided Americans see one another better, it\u2019s by telling more specific stories of every kind. It\u2019s true that we don\u2019t see enough working-class people on TV, or military veterans or Hispanic families. And guess what? Sometimes, this \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d reminds us, you find all those people under the same roof.Advertisement"}

He\u2019s a study in neediness. Adulation is what he craves; admonishment he cannot abide. Trafficking in untruths and conspiracies, he calls the press that he secretly venerates dishonest for pointing this out. That\u2019s called transference.

And if people in Hollywood don\u2019t start recognizing why and how \u2014 you will get him re-elected.\u201d She has a point. Trump lost the popular vote in November by 2.8 million. But outside California and New York, he won by 3 million. That\u2019s America\u2019s story in a nutshell.Getting America out of its mess begins with the acknowledgment that New York and California do not have a stranglehold on truth, any more than Kansas and Missouri do. Out there in God-fearing gun country there are plenty of smart, upstanding Americans who, as Mark Lilla of Columbia University put it, paraphrasing Bernie Sanders, are \u201csick and tired of hearing about liberals\u2019 damn bathrooms.\u201dWith time, more Americans will side with Streep. They will see that a mean, shallow actor has duped them. But to finish with Trump, liberals will also have to reckon with how they lost sight of their country.Advertisement"}

The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, would give Alibaba a controlling stake of about 74 percent.The takeover of Intime is part of a strategy that makes Alibaba a rarity among major global e-commerce companies \u2014 it has spent billions buying up pieces of the very retail sector it disrupted.Alibaba has also bucked the trend among its peers with logistics. Unlike Amazon and JD.com, its Chinese rival, Alibaba has shied away from owning its own inventory or trying to build out logistics.That Alibaba begins the year with a major acquisition shows that the company has no intention of slowing its merger binge.
