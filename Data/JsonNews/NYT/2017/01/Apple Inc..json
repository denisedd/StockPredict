{"Headline": "When Snap Goes Public, Some Shareholders\u2019 Voting Rights May Disappear", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe current rising star of tech start-ups, the parent company of the messaging app Snapchat, is apparently planning to issue shares with no voting rights when it goes public this year.It\u2019s another sign of how the balance of power has tilted to tech founders. But Snap may have gone too far.Still, a total disenfranchisement of public shareholders has been a long time coming among technology companies.When Apple and Microsoft went public decades ago they had the traditional corporate structure of one share, one vote. Google started the trend of making public shareholders lesser citizens in 2004, when it issued to public shareholders shares having one vote while the founders and insiders held shares with 10 votes.That has become the norm among new tech companies, as Facebook, Zynga and Groupon (among others) followed, as well as nontech companies such as Shake Shack. The typical structure was to give 10 votes per share to the Class A stock held by the founders and one vote to the public, though some companies went even further: Zynga\u2019s class A had 70 votes per share. (Twitter, however, was a noticeable exception and instead adopted a more traditional one-share, one-vote structure.)But Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, as well as other tech founders, soon discovered a problem. Even with all of those high-vote shares, they might lose control if they sold their stock to fund their charities or other ventures. As a result, Google, Zillow and even Under Armour have created no-vote shares to issue to employees and for future offerings.This is having your cake and eating it, too.Snap could go public with a Google-like structure and then issue out no-vote shares later. But why deal with all those pesky shareholders who may challenge such a conversion?Instead, Snap is apparently going to make sure that the public has no vote and hence never the opportunity to have a say in the company\u2019s governance. While public shareholders will be totally disenfranchised, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy are reportedly going to have 70 percent of the total vote despite owning only 40 percent of Snap.The discrepancy is not bad compared with other companies. At Facebook, for example, Mark Zuckerberg currently casts 53.8 percent of Facebook\u2019s votes while owning 15 percent of the company.Snap\u2019s rationale for wanting its co-founders to have this power has not been explained. But from news media reports and otherwise, we can figure out the gist. Snap is likely to argue that Mr. Spiegel, 26, is a visionary who knows how to sell to teenagers and 20-somethings. He is the one who can lead the company to join the superpower ranks of Facebook and Google, justifying Snap\u2019s valuation of over $20 billion.Indeed, that appears to be why Snapchat changed its name to Snap, so it could mimic the big boys like Google and be an umbrella company for other innovative and presumably lucrative products. Mr. Spiegel, the argument goes, needs total control over the company to ensure that this ambitious vision is executed.There are warning signs that the hype over Snap\u2019s initial public offering is going to be extreme. Already the company is indicating that it will focus not on revenues or profits, but on alternative metrics like user engagement.Yet is there any doubt that Snap\u2019s initial public offering will be a stunning success? After all, how can you miss out on the Next Big Thing, like, say, Myspace, Zynga, Groupon or perhaps Theranos? Oh, Snap.Sarcasm aside, few big social media players come to market, so investors will be sure to gobble up Snap shares.And risks and governance problems will be ignored in the rush not to miss out. The euphoria over Snap is noticeable even among banks, which are providing the company with a loan of $1.4 billion \u2014 more than Snap\u2019s entire expected 2017 revenue. So much for sober and prudent banking.When you think about it, this emphasis on vision in technology is tiresome. It drives money to companies but often seems hype to build up the egos of founders who often get lucky. I mean, were messages that disappear \u201cvisionary\u201d five years ago?Couldn\u2019t it be easier to say that instead of a visionary, Mr. Spiegel will be a multibillionaire with total control of a company and a track record of only a few years?Without picking on Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy, this type of corporate power concentration in one or two people has too much chance of going wrong \u2014 especially someone who might be around for 70 years and is running a company with so much uncertainty in its future. Their vision may change or just go bad, but shareholders who own part of the company are stuck as are the employees and consumers of the company who then are kept in this scenario.Even Google was criticized for overspending on investment, something shareholder pressure pushed back on and caused the company to change. Shareholders can provide some measure of check on these issues, but Snap would be saying: We won\u2019t care.Defenders of such a class-share structure point to the ability to look at the long term while arguing that the market will price any governance defects. Shareholders will pay less for Snap\u2019s shares because of these risks.This assumes a rational market, but it is hard not to see that people may be discounting the risks in the rush to buy the next hot tech stock. And while there may be real benefits to this structure in preserving a singular mission, given the early trajectory of Snap, it seems too risky.Perhaps the supporters are right. But the real test of this structure will come if the institutional investment firms who have the greatest influence in the stock market, like Vanguard and BlackRock, idly stand by.But I doubt that the institutions will do much more than complain, instead leaving Snap with corporate governance that mimics its disappearing messages, leaving nothing there.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "Clearing Out the App Stores: Government Censorship Made Easier", "Date": "2017-01-18", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThere\u2019s a new form of digital censorship sweeping the globe, and it could be the start of something devastating.These moves may sound incremental, and perhaps not immediately alarming. China has been restricting the web forever, and Russia is no bastion of free speech. So what\u2019s so dangerous about blocking apps?Here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s a more effective form of censorship.But that\u2019s not the end of this story. The banning of apps highlights a deeper flaw in our modern communications architecture: It\u2019s the centralization of information, stupid.\u201cI think the app store censorship issue is one layer of ice on the surface of the iceberg above the waterline,\u201d said Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School and a leader in the free software movement of activists who have long been warning about the dangers of centrally managed, commercial software.For more than a decade, we users of digital devices have actively championed an online infrastructure that now looks uniquely vulnerable to the sanctions of despots and others who seek to control information. We flocked to smartphones, app stores, social networks and cloud storage. Publishers like The New York Times are investing in apps and content posted to social networks instead of the comparatively open World Wide Web. Some start-ups now rely exclusively on apps; Snapchat, for instance, exists only as a mobile app.Compared with older forms of distributing software, apps downloaded from app stores are more convenient for users and often more secure from malware, and they can be more lucrative for creators. But like so much else online now, they risk feeding into mechanisms of central control. In most countries, the Apple and Google app stores are the only places to find apps for devices running their respective operating systems. (There are more choices for Android app stores in China, where Google does not offer its store.)The internet\u2019s earliest boosters considered it a magical tool to liberate people from restrictions on speech. The easy banning of apps suggests that if we let it, the internet could instead become something quite the opposite \u2014 one of the most efficient choke points of communication the world has ever seen.As the threat of nuclear attack diminished and the internet grew, its decentralized design became as much a political selling point as a technical one.What the creators and early proselytizers of the internet did not foresee was the rapid commercialization of the network. The internet that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Gilmore envisioned was built and maintained by collectives of users; the one that users flocked to was tamed by companies whose very success turned them into some of the largest corporations on the planet.The internet is now no longer \u201ceverywhere and nowhere.\u201d Just about all of its economic value is instead connected to two very specific somewheres: the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, the homes of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook, the four monstrously large companies that own the internet\u2019s central information platforms. As these companies began to build ever-larger empires online, they have evolved into convenient choke points \u2014 the very points of control that the internet was designed to eliminate.Apple offered this statement in response to my queries on how it decides to take down apps: \u201cFor some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China, and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.\u201d Google declined to comment.But Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights activist organization, said the internet giants were not without leverage in this fight.\u201cThe flip side of that is, is China going to block the entire Apple App Store over a single app?\u201d she asked. Interestingly, the internet giants\u2019 hold on every aspect of online life works toward their advantage in battling governments.\u201cThe bigger a company is, the bigger the risk that blocking them will lead to riots in the streets because you have come between people and their pictures of cats,\u201d Ms. Galperin said. \u201cThose are the companies that governments are going to be more wary of blocking, and they should be the ones that stand up to government pressure. They have a special responsibility.\u201dUsers and app developers who are now at risk of being censored also bear some responsibility. When I asked Mr. Moglen at Columbia about app bans, he was incensed that I didn\u2019t recognize The New York Times\u2019s own complicity in this story.The Times, he argued, could have stuck with the old way of publishing news. The company could have declined to create a downloadable app and instead invested all of its engineering resources into making its news available on the web, anonymously. The Times could have refused to profile users for advertising purposes, or to have its articles hosted on Facebook, or to monitor what people read in order to recommend more articles to keep people engaged. In short, The Times could have refused to play the modern digital-publishing game. But like every other publisher, it went along.\u201cWhat did you expect would happen?\u201d Mr. Moglen asked. \u201cChina didn\u2019t have to build a Great Firewall to do this. You all offered them an opportunity to piggyback onto your disrespect for the privacy and integrity and autonomy of your readers and users.\u201dI don\u2019t agree with Mr. Moglen that The Times disrespects its readers by offering a news app. (I think it\u2019s a very nice app.) But he is right that a lot of people online walked blindly into the no-win position we are in now, where our only recourse against censorship might be the good will of a few giant corporations that control most of the internet.There has to be some other way. Let\u2019s maybe work on finding it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Removes New York Times Apps From Its Store in China", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byApple, complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities, removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China late last month.Apple removed both the English-language and Chinese-language apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications, including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, were still available in the app store.\u201cFor some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,\u201d Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said of the Times apps. \u201cAs a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.\u201dMr. Sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the Times apps were said to have violated, who had contacted Apple and when, and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented.China\u2019s main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not respond to faxed questions.The Times bureau in Beijing said it had not been contacted by the Chinese government about the matter. A Times spokeswoman in New York, Eileen Murphy, said the company had asked Apple to reconsider its decision.\u201cThe request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world,\u201d Ms. Murphy said in a statement.The regulations say apps cannot \u201cengage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others.\u201d The cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish \u201cprohibited\u201d information.The ruling Communist Party tightly controls media inside China and employs one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated systems of internet censorship. Chinese law prohibits the publication of \u201charmful information\u201d online, and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable.Farzana Aslam, associate director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, noted that in matters involving customer privacy, Apple requires governments to submit subpoenas, search warrants or other legal documents.\u201cMaybe in the end they have to do it, but I think there\u2019s something to be said about standing up for what you believe in and purporting to put principle before profit in a country like China, to show that actually there is this tension there,\u201d Ms. Aslam said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as, \u2018Because we operate in your jurisdiction, we\u2019ll do anything you ask of us.\u2019\u201dShe added that it was \u201cvery worrying\u201d that Apple had not disclosed what laws the authorities said were violated, making it difficult for The Times and other publishers to file an appeal or challenge the government\u2019s requests.On Dec. 23, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with members of Apple\u2019s media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner, Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting.Later that day, a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed, Ms. Murphy said.The Times news apps remain available in Apple\u2019s app stores for other countries, as well as the Hong Kong and Taiwan stores, but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland China to download them. The Times crossword puzzle and virtual reality apps remain available throughout China.When the Chinese government began blocking the Times websites in 2012, it also prevented users with Times apps from downloading new content.But readers in China can still gain access to The Times using software that circumvents the government\u2019s firewall. And in July 2015, The Times released a new version of its Chinese-language app that adopted a different method for retrieving articles, one that the government appeared unable to stop.Apple\u2019s decision to remove the app from its China store should not affect those who have already installed it. But users in China will not be able to download new releases unless they use another region\u2019s app store.Mark Natkin, the Beijing-based managing director of Marbridge Consulting, who advises American technology firms in China, said he did not think any such company entering the Chinese market could \u201cever fully comprehend how challenging it\u2019s going to be.\u201dMr. Natkin said that Apple had a certain amount of leverage against the Chinese government in terms of the total amount of jobs created but that \u201cthe technology gap has started to close.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, and its headline, referred incorrectly to the Apple store in China from which the Times apps were removed.

{"Headline": "Blackstone\u2019s Latest Move Has the Look of a Hit", "Date": "2017-01-05", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsBlackstone is going long on music. For its first venture into buying and holding companies for extended periods of time, the private equity firm is taking over Sesac, a group that manages song rights for the likes of Bob Dylan and Mariah Carey. The growth of streaming provides a steady outlook. With some financial improvisation, it\u2019s easy to come up with a healthy return.The deal for Sesac, a for-profit Nashville-based operation that competes with the larger nonprofits Ascap and BMI, is the first from Blackstone\u2019s new $5 billion fund that plans to hang on to acquisitions for at least a decade, far longer than a typical leveraged buyout. It also is the firm\u2019s first jump into the music business, which is enjoying a bit of a renaissance.Spotify, Apple and others have breathed fresh life into subscription models after years of struggling to figure out the digital market. Annual revenue from streaming music is expected to rise tenfold, to $14 billion by 2030, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.By owning a middleman like Sesac, Blackstone may capitalize on the new groove. In 2013, Rizvi Traverse, a private equity firm previously invested in Twitter and Snapchat, bought 75 percent of the licensing and royalty collection organization at a $600 million valuation, Billboard reported at the time. That would have been 15 times Sesac\u2019s $40 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda.By 2015, Ebitda had grown to roughly $60 million, according to the credit-rating firm Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Apply the same imputed multiple as in the Rizvi transaction and Sesac could have been valued at $900 million, though Blackstone isn\u2019t saying.So assuming Blackstone bought the whole company, a $450 million equity check would be a reasonable estimate alongside approximately $450 million in gross debt on Sesac\u2019s books. Moody\u2019s said last year that it expected \u201ccontinued revenue and Ebitda growth in the mid- to high single-digit range.\u201d At, say, 7 percent, the Ebitda figure would double to about $120 million in a decade.At the same 15-times-valuation multiple and with no change in total debt, Blackstone would triple its equity by 2027 for a 12 percent annualized return even without paying itself any dividends along the way as Rizvi has done. That would be an investment tune that hits the right notes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Crisis Signals Problems at Korea Inc.", "Date": "2017-01-23", "News": "Supported byBut for many of the company\u2019s critics, the most interesting part of the presentation was what Samsung did not say: How could such a technologically advanced titan \u2014 a symbol of South Korea\u2019s considerable industrial might \u2014 allow the problems to happen to begin with?The answer to that question gets to deep shortfalls that former employees, suppliers and others who watch the company say may have contributed to the incident. Samsung, like South Korea as a whole, fosters a top-down, hidebound culture that stifles innovation and buries festering problems, they say.\u201cThe Korean economy as a whole has reached a kind of limit,\u201d said Park Sang-in, a Seoul National University economics professor who thinks that the cozy relationship between the government and business is stifling innovation in South Korea.Though Samsung did not address its corporate culture directly in its discussion of the Note 7, it apologized and detailed new steps it would take to stop future problems, including naming a board of battery advisers.\u201cTo produce an innovative Galaxy Note 7, we set the goals on battery specifications,\u201d D. J. Koh, Samsung\u2019s mobile chief, said on Monday. \u201cWe now feel a painful responsibility for failing to test and confirm that there were problems in the design and manufacturing of batteries before we put the product out to the market.\u201dDespite the troubled handset, the company said on Tuesday that profit more than doubled in the last three months of 2016, to about $7.93 billion. The increase was driven by chip sales, and gave Samsung the financial firepower to announce a nearly $8 billion share buyback program.Over the past decade Samsung and South Korea have been widely viewed as a model of forward-thinking, technological prowess. In Asia it was viewed as the exception to the sluggish economic growth of nearby Taiwan and Japan, whose once world-beating electronic makers have been in decline.But as with the rest of the country, a shake-up has been slow to come. In recent years the company has run initiatives to push back against what is widely described as a rigid, top-down management system. Samsung engineers and midlevel managers are seldom allowed to second-guess management goals set by top bosses, former employees say.Pressures rose after Mr. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, its chairman, suffered a stroke in 2014 and fell into a coma. One engineer in the United States who works with Samsung suppliers on projects, including the Note 7, said Samsung\u2019s no-questions-asked corporate culture had grown more inflexible in recent years.\u201cIn the Samsung culture, managers constantly feel pressured to prove themselves with short-term achievements,\u201d said Kim Jin-baek, who worked at Samsung until 2010 before becoming a professor at the business school of Chung-Ang University in Seoul. \u201cExecutives fret that they may not be able to meet the goals and lose their jobs, even when they know the goals are excessive.\u201dWith the Note 7, Samsung pushed its business model, as well as its technology, to the limit, according to Samsung officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity while the Note 7 investigation was being completed. Driven by the desire to prove it was more than a fast follower of Apple, Samsung rushed the Note 7 to market ahead of Apple\u2019s iPhone 7. To fend off Chinese competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi, it packed the phone with new features, like waterproof technology and iris-scanning for added security.But battery scientists, including those who spoke at the announcement, said aggressive decisions in designing the batteries made problems more likely. Pushing to make the battery thinner and more powerful, Samsung opted for an exceptionally thin separator in its battery. As the critical component that separates the positive and negative electrodes in a battery, separators can cause fires if they break down or contain flaws.UL, a safety science company contracted by Samsung to investigate the battery, said the thin separator offered poor protection against defects. It also said that the high energy density of the battery could increase the severity of failures when they occurred.Samsung\u2019s insistence on speed and internal pressures to outdo rivals in part signal a breakdown in the ability to truly innovate and push out new ideas, critics say. In place of big new ideas, Samsung focused on maxing out the capability of components like the battery. That philosophy, which worked to keep Samsung on the heels of the likes of Apple, simply is not as effective as Samsung tries to push ahead, they argue.A similar strain can be felt in other parts of South Korea\u2019s economy. Even the symbols held up as signs of the country\u2019s forward thinking, like speedy internet and eye-popping creative mobile apps, come in part from the support of the government. While that has helped create new companies, workers in the tech industry argue that approach also ensures start-ups do not challenge the country\u2019s biggest companies.\u201cThe government is trying to pick the next Steve Jobs,\u201d said Mr. Park, the Seoul National University professor. \u201cYou cannot pick the next Steve Jobs. You need to allow somebody to achieve that.\u201dTim Chae, a venture capital investor in South Korea and partner at 500 Startups, a venture fund, cites another government program called TIPS. The government program is designed to support new companies with funding. Yet with the money come rules, he said, such as funding that can be used to pay only certain types of employees \u2014 engineers are included, but sales personnel are not.While he acknowledged that the government should keep checks on taxpayer money, Mr. Chae said it should lean toward more freedom: \u201cJust give them the money and trust them to use it right.\u201dMr. Chae highlighted other problems. Many of South Korea\u2019s most talented workers are sucked up into companies like Samsung, where they imbibe its corporate culture, making it harder for them to work elsewhere or develop the right mentality to start their own company, he said.That top-down culture that pervades both Samsung and South Korea hints at a deeper question embedded in the accusations about the company\u2019s involvement in the unfolding graft scandal: Would Samsung itself not be better off if South Korean regulators treated it more harshly?In October, at Samsung\u2019s request, the Korea Testing Laboratory investigated a Note 7 that had caught fire. Within a few hours, it issued a report indicating the fire was due to an \u201cexternal shock.\u201dIts chief, Lee Won-bok, now regrets that decision, calling it \u201ctoo hasty.\u201d\u201cThey did the test for Samsung and produced the findings that Samsung wanted,\u201d Woo Won-shik, an opposition lawmaker, said during a parliamentary hearing. \u201cThis Republic of Samsung phenomenon actually hurts its international credibility.\u201dChoe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul and Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong.videoAdvertisement"}

It puts Apple and Google in a difficult position. The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens.When LinkedIn\u2019s website was blocked, the apps stopped functioning properly.

But many people still find these systems too unreliable, or annoying, to use for more than the most simple tasks, like \u201cCall Mom.\u201dThat isn\u2019t stopping auto and tech companies from trying to give drivers the ability to do even more things by talking to their cars \u2014 while keeping their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. The efforts have some added urgency now, as states pass stricter laws aimed at curbing distracted driving. Under a California law that went into effect Jan. 1, holding or operating a phone while driving is now prohibited.This week at the International CES, the giant electronics conference in Las Vegas, Ford Motor announced that owners of its cars would soon be able to use Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice-activated assistant in their vehicles. Drivers will be able to ask for a weather report, stream music from Amazon Music or add appointments to their calendars. They will also be able to use Alexa from home to start or unlock their cars remotely.But the automaker also envisions drivers using Alexa to help with other tasks \u2014 like shopping on Amazon. Stuck in traffic? You can take care of Valentine\u2019s Day by saying, \u201cAlexa, order flowers on Amazon.\u201dOther companies are moving in the same direction. Apple\u2019s Siri can be used to control iPhone functions in cars, and Apple\u2019s CarPlay software allows drivers to dictate text messages while driving, as well as program destinations into Apple Maps and have the route plotted on the car\u2019s display. Google\u2019s Android Auto can do the same.In the last year, carmakers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and General Motors have also introduced improved voice-recognition systems that can understand normal spoken words for many tasks. Older systems required drivers to learn specific commands.With newer models, owners can program in a destination just by saying the address, as if speaking to another person. In older cars, the state, city and street had to be given separately, one at a time \u2014 and if you were lucky, each was correctly understood.While more advanced systems like Alexa will make it easier for drivers to use voice commands, there are still hurdles. The biggest is just changing habits, and persuading people to try talking to their cars.On the day before Thanksgiving, Frank Krieber bought a 2016 Dodge Challenger, granite gray, with a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 engine, and the latest version of the Uconnect infotainment system. A few days later, when he set off on a road trip to Florida from his home in Michigan, he synced his phone to the car, but didn\u2019t bother to use the voice-recognition capabilities to enter destinations or handle other tasks.\u201cI probably should use it, but it\u2019s just easier to put in an address manually, so I haven\u2019t really played around with it,\u201d said Mr. Krieber, a sales executive for a computer company. \u201cMy experience so far has been, when you tell it to do something, it doesn\u2019t do what you want.\u201dOlder cars used voice-recognition systems that were built into the car and had limited computing power and memory. Now that more and more cars have wireless connections, the voice-recognition processing can be done via the internet in distant computers and servers, what the tech industry calls the cloud.That is an advantage that Ford sees in using Alexa, said Don Butler, Ford\u2019s executive director for connected vehicle and services. \u201cIf you have the voice recognition done outside the car, people will see a much greater ability to interpret normal, everyday speech,\u201d he said.With Alexa, a user will need to download an Alexa app to a phone and carry the phone in the car, creating the connection with the cloud.Ford and Amazon have also developed a way to get Alexa to work seamlessly with a Ford car\u2019s own built-in entertainment and navigation systems. Alexa will first be available in a few months in battery-powered and hybrid models like the Focus Electric and Fusion Energi, and later in other Ford models.\u201cYou can ask Alexa where the nearest Starbucks is, and have her program the address into the Ford navigation system for you,\u201d Mr. Butler said.For Amazon, the collaboration with Ford is another illustration of a broader push by technology giants to push their versions of voice assistants, which are made to perform simple tasks like turning on lights at home, playing music and fetching sports scores from the internet.Apple was an early entrant into the market with its Siri assistant for iPhones. Google has its Assistant and a new connected speaker featuring the voice technology called Google Home. And Samsung, which has announced plans to buy the audio and automobile technology company Harman International Industries, last year agreed to acquire a voice assistant start-up, Viv Labs.Many analysts believe Amazon has vaulted to a leadership position in the race with the surprise success of the Echo family of smart speakers. While Amazon does not reveal sales figures for its devices, the company recently said that the Echo speaker and a smaller device called Echo Dot were the best-selling products on Amazon last year.Amazon has been more aggressive than other tech giants in getting other companies like Ford to integrate Alexa into their products. Dozens of other companies were expected to announce plans at CES to allow people to control their devices using Alexa.The satellite television provider Dish Network said people who use its Hopper digital video recorders would be able to use Alexa voice commands to change channels and play movies. Lenovo, the computer maker, announced its own Alexa-based speaker, Lenovo Smart Assistant. The maker of Seiki, Westinghouse Electronics and Element Electronics televisions said it would build Alexa into the remote controls for some 4K sets from those brands.In California, Mr. Smith-Fagan would welcome better voice recognition. \u201cWith the new law we have, I\u2019m kind of worried, because everyone\u2019s going to have to find a way to use the phone without touching it with your hands,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Data Could Be the Next Tech Hot Button for Regulators", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "Supported byWealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on.Now data \u2014 gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations \u2014 is increasingly a focus of technology competition. And academics and some policy makers, especially in Europe, are considering whether big internet companies like Google and Facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation.In recent years, Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion, privacy or antitrust investigations. But in the coming years, who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in American tech giants.As government regulators dig into this new era of data competition, they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make. Using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit, for example. And higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services.The competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990s about software and Microsoft. The worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers, and gather more data, a powerful \u201cnetwork effect\u201d effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform, like Google in search or Facebook in consumer social networks.Evidence of the rising importance of data can be seen from the frontiers of artificial intelligence to mainstream business software. And certain data sets can be remarkably valuable for companies working on those technologies.Microsoft is betting LinkedIn, combined with data on how hundreds of millions of workers use its Office 365 online software, and consumer data from search behavior on Bing, will \u201cpower a set of insights that we think is unprecedented,\u201d said James Phillips, vice president for business applications at Microsoft.IBM estimates that 70 percent of the world\u2019s data is not out on the public web, but in private databases, often to protect privacy or trade secrets. IBM\u2019s strategy is to take the data it has acquired, add customer data and use that to train its Watson artificial intelligence software to pursue such tasks as helping medical researchers discover novel disease therapies, or flagging suspect financial transactions for independent auditors.\u201cOur focus is mainly on nonpublic data sets and extending that advantage for clients in business and science,\u201d said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s Watson and cloud businesses.At Google, the company\u2019s drive into cloud-delivered business software is fueled by data, building on years of work done on its search and other consumer services, and its recent advances in image identification, speech recognition and language translation.For example, a new Google business offering \u2014 still in the test, or alpha, stage \u2014 is a software service to improve job finding and recruiting. Its data includes more than 17 million online job postings and the public profiles and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of more than 200 million people.Its machine-learning algorithms distilled that to about four million unique job titles, ranked the most common ones and identified specific skills. The job sites CareerBuilder and Dice are using the Google technology to show job seekers more relevant openings. And FedEx, the giant package shipper, is adding the service to its recruiting site.That is just one case, said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google\u2019s cloud business, of what is becoming increasingly possible \u2014 using the tools of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, to sift through huge quantities of data to provide machine-curated data services.\u201cYou can turn this technology to whatever field you want, from manufacturing to medicine,\u201d Ms. Greene said.Fei-Fei Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is taking a sabbatical to become chief scientist for artificial intelligence at Google\u2019s cloud unit. She sees working at Google as one path to pursue her career ambition to \u201cdemocratize A.I.,\u201d now that the software and data ingredients are ripe.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have the current era of A.I. without the big data revolution,\u201d Dr. Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s the digital gold.\u201dIn the A.I. race, better software algorithms can put you ahead for a year or so, but probably no more, said Andrew Ng, a former Google scientist and adjunct professor at Stanford. He is now chief scientist at Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant, and a leading figure in artificial intelligence research.Rivals, he added, cannot unlock or simulate your data. \u201cData is the defensible barrier, not algorithms,\u201d Mr. Ng said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alphabet\u2019s Profits Stay Predictably Good in a Volatile Industry", "Date": "2017-01-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It is almost boring how predictably good Alphabet\u2019s earnings are these days \u2014 a trait not always shared by the company\u2019s tech conglomerate peers.But fourth-quarter results announced on Thursday from Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, proved once again that the company is the model of moneymaking consistency.The heart of Alphabet\u2019s consistent earnings remains the company\u2019s search engine. While a consumer can delay an iPhone purchase or shop somewhere other than Amazon, Google\u2019s search engine is an indispensable tool for anyone using the internet. The shift to mobile devices, once considered a threat to Google\u2019s search business, has only strengthened it.Google\u2019s market share on desktop search is around 78 percent, but it is above 90 percent on mobile devices, according to research from NetMarketShare.com. What is more, on smaller mobile displays, Google\u2019s ads occupy a large portion of the screen \u2014 making it more likely a user will click on them.Clicks on Google ads increased 36 percent in the quarter, but what advertisers paid for each click decreased 15 percent.Google is also sitting on many of the internet\u2019s most valuable properties \u2014 the places where people go to stay in touch on email, find driving directions or seek out entertainment.While clicks on Google\u2019s ads across the internet are rising, they are growing faster on its own websites like YouTube. Alphabet does not break out results for YouTube, but the site continues to amass a huge audience. Google said more than a billion people watched YouTube every month, viewing hundreds of millions of hours of its videos every day.Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said company assets like search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play, constituted \u201cprime time in the mobile era.\u201dEven Alphabet\u2019s unexpected hiccups are a little dull. The company\u2019s earnings per share were $7.56, or 11 cents below analysts\u2019 estimates. It said the reason for the shortfall was that it paid more in taxes. The company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 percent, compared with 5 percent in the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet said it paid more in United States taxes but did not explain why.Alphabet shares were down 2 percent in after-hours trading. The stock reached a record high on Wednesday.While the dominance of the Google search engine seems unassailable today, Alphabet is investing heavily in new technologies that may threaten its stronghold. Devices like the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated smart speaker, portend a future where artificially intelligent digital assistants fetch information without needing to access a search engine directly.Google did not provide figures for how those products sold, but the \u201cother revenue\u201d category, which included hardware sales along with revenue from Google Play, rose 62 percent to $3.4 billion.Part of the company\u2019s financial stability came from Google\u2019s creation of Alphabet in 2015. The reorganization into a holding company split the company\u2019s core search business from a growing list of fledgling operations, like the newly minted Waymo \u2014 what used to be Google\u2019s self-driving car project until it was spun off as an independent Alphabet company in 2016.Under the watch of Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, the company has scaled back costs and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 the ambition of its speculative investments into new technologies. During the quarter, Alphabet said quarterly revenue from \u201cother bets\u201d rose 75 percent to $262 million, while operating losses narrowed to $1.09 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Seem Invincible. That Worries Lawmakers.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech \u2014 from IBM to Hewlett-Packard to Cisco to Yahoo \u2014 were eventually outmaneuvered by start-ups that came out of nowhere.The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place.Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable.In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world\u2019s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will.The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump\u2019s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds.This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year.Let\u2019s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends \u2014 mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs.Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech \u2014 on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance.The Five aren\u2019t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple\u2019s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet\u2019s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren\u2019t entirely safe from competition from start-ups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot.Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from start-ups; today\u2019s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five.But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you\u2019re supposed to in America \u2014 by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren\u2019t considered that bad. They weren\u2019t causing environmental disasters. They weren\u2019t selling cigarettes. They weren\u2019t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five\u2019s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn\u2019t I called them the Fabulous Five?Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with.During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos\u2019s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry\u2019s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public.For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised \u2014 entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others.\u201cDuring the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U.S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,\u201d said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them.During Mr. Genachowski\u2019s term at the F.C.C., and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201d which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies.But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. \u201cThe next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things \u2014 battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,\u201d he said.That\u2019s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger \u2014 their benefits to society as well as their potential costs \u2014 when deciding how to police them.But there\u2019s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today\u2019s start-ups. The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining, voice-activated assistants, self-driving cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five.That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more; and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Adds to Qualcomm\u2019s Troubles, Filing Lawsuit Over Rebates", "Date": "2017-01-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry.Some days that is a real drag.On Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm\u2019s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things.In its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as \u201cthe world\u2019s dominant supplier\u201d of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained \u201celevated royalties\u201d for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too.When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said.Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F.T.C. suit. \u201cApple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too.Few expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable.\u201cThey are seasoned, and equipped to fight,\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cBut when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it\u2019s tough.\u201dQualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were well-regarded electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company.Qualcomm\u2019s engineers work at a 41-building campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores.Companies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like high-speed wireless video for millions of people at once.Its major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones.Qualcomm\u2019s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company\u2019s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of third-generation, or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls.At the time, many thought Qualcomm\u2019s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23.6 billion and a profit of $5.7 billion.Qualcomm\u2019s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless.\u201cYou\u2019d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,\u201d said Clint McClellan, a 17-year employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. \u201cWe enabled those markets.\u201dSouth Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm\u2019s revenue. Apple\u2019s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center.Qualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone \u2014 at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty.By helping to create today\u2019s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks.\u201cWe believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,\u201d said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, \u201cwere prodded and misled by commercial interests.\u201dIn an email, Hea-Ryoung Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it \u201cwas one of many multinational corporations\u201d that responded to questions from South Korean regulators.Additionally, the F.T.C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10.Neither the F.T.C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we\u2019ve contributed to their success,\u201d said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm\u2019s president.Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers.\u201cWe\u2019re not sitting still\u201d while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. \u201cYou have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives.\u201dIn other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm\u2019s expensive intellectual property.Advertisement"}

Not anymore.Those stores have been outmaneuvered by online retailers like Amazon and discount retailers like T. J. Maxx. And now the pace of change is accelerating, transforming the retail industry faster than expected.The results? A rude awakening for some of the country\u2019s biggest retailers. And for malls, a reshaping that, in many ways, mirrors a growing economic divide.These changes are \u201chappening at a tremendous speed,\u201d said Bernard Sosnick, a retail analyst at Madison Global Partners.\u201cIt\u2019s putting pressure on all stores, best and worst, but the worst just don\u2019t have a place in retailing anymore as sales decrease,\u201d Mr. Sosnick said. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to sacrifice them, shutter them, to help the others survive and stabilize sales.\u201dThe exits highlight the growing dichotomy between America\u2019s highest-end shopping centers, the type with Tesla dealerships and Apple stores, and those on the lower end of the spectrum, which are struggling to fill space and attract national brands. The stores being closed by Sears are not profitable. And Macy\u2019s chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren, said many of the stores it was closing were \u201cno longer robust shopping destinations.\u201dGreen Street Advisors, which tracks the mall industry, said in a report last year that more department store closures \u201cshould ultimately result in a larger number of malls becoming irrelevant retail destinations.\u201dEven among more successful malls, it is clear that department stores are far less important than they once were as they attract fewer customers.While mall owners once relied on four or five department stores to serve as so-called anchor tenants, offering them cheap rent in exchange for reliable foot traffic, they may now simply need one or two department stores and otherwise seek anchors in off-price chains like T. J. Maxx, restaurants and movie theaters, Green Street Advisors said.\u201cTen or 15 years ago, if a department store left a mall, it was really a problem for the developer,\u201d Les Wexner, the longtime chief executive of L Brands, which owns Victoria\u2019s Secret, told analysts and investors in November. \u201cNow, many of the developers are trying to buy back the space from the department stores because they\u2019re an economic detriment and they can recycle that space.\u201dThe business of department stores has been attacked from all sides in recent years. Online, consumers can purchase directly from brands or on Amazon, which has invested heavily in fashion.Offline, the chains have had to contend with discount retailers like TJX, the owner of T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and Home Goods, which compete hard on price and brand names, as well as fast-fashion sellers like H&M and outlet centers. Department stores also face competition from beauty chains like Sephora and Ulta.\u201cEveryone is carving away at different parts of the business,\u201d said Liz Dunn, the chief executive of Talmage Advisors, a retail consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that these retailers that have this rent advantage can\u2019t seem to make it worth it.\u201dNowhere is this shift more evident than in apparel. Two years ago, annual sales at TJX eclipsed those of Macy\u2019s for the first time, as the company drew consumers to its relatively smaller stores with a treasure-hunt-like experience and brand-name discounts. TJX posted $29 billion in sales for the year that ended Jan. 31, 2015, while Macy\u2019s revenue was $28 billion, a gap that has widened since then.Some of the money Macy\u2019s will save with its closures and job cuts will be diverted to its own version of T. J. Maxx, called Macy\u2019s Backstage, an effort akin to off-price chains like Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off 5th. Macy\u2019s, which operated 22 of the Backstage stores at the end of October, said it will open 50 more in the next two years. Many will be within current Macy\u2019s locations.Still, the stores remain exposed to changing conditions. The real estate industry ranks malls with letter grades like report cards, assigning \u201cA++\u201d to the highest-end locations that make nearly $1,000 in sales per square feet and a \u201cC\u201d to those that generate one-third or less of that and are at risk of closing. Sears, Macy\u2019s and J. C. Penney, the biggest mall anchors, are also the most exposed to C malls, according to Green Street Advisors.\u201cThe recognition now is that you can\u2019t have this long dragging tail and you\u2019ve got to cut it off right now so you can concentrate on the best stores,\u201d Mr. Sosnick said. \u201cThese are the retailers that went into the earliest shopping malls, and so have stores in malls that have been degraded tremendously over time, and that\u2019s what you see being closed today.\u201dBy the time Macy\u2019s finishes closing its stores, it will have shuttered nearly 200 locations since 2010. Today, it has 730 stores. At the end of October, J. C. Penney had 1,014 stores, 90 fewer than five years ago, while Sears, which also owns Kmart, had 676 full-line stores with its name, a 192-location drop in the same period.\u201cBrick-and-mortar is not necessarily dead, but you need fewer stores to achieve the same amount of sales volume,\u201d Ms. Dunn said. \u201cA lot of retailers need to shrink their store base, and that is tied to everything that\u2019s happened with digital and changing shopping patterns.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Takes a Right Turn", "Date": "2017-01-12", "News": "Supported byMost tech executives and employees remain supportive of Democrats, especially on social and cultural issues. The Republican tilt of the PACs at Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook suggests, however, that as these companies\u2019 domains grow larger, their bottom-line interests are becoming increasingly aligned with the policies of the Republican Party.In 2016, the Microsoft PAC gave $478,818 to Republican House candidates and $272,000 to Democratic House candidates. It gave $164,000 to Republican Senate candidates, and $75,000 to Democratic Senate candidates.This was not small change. In 2016 Microsoft employees gave a total of $6.47 million.The firm first became a noticeable player in the world of campaign finance in 2012 when employees and the company PAC together made contributions of $910,000. That year, Facebook employees backed Democrats over Republicans 64-35, while the company\u2019s PAC tilted Republican, 53-46.By 2016, when total Facebook contributions reached $3.8 million, the Democratic advantage in employee donations shrank to 51-47, while the PAC continued to favor Republicans, 56-44.While the employees of the three other most valuable tech companies, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and Apple, remained Democratic in their giving in 2016, at the corporate level of Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 that is, at the level of their PACs \u2014 they have not.Tech giants can no longer be described as insurgents challenging corporate America.American consumer technology companies are getting larger, more entrenched in their own sectors, more powerful in new sectors and better insulated against surprising competition from upstarts.Among Ferenstein\u2019s findings: a minority, 29 percent, of tech company founders described labor unions as \u201cgood,\u201d compared to 73 percent of Democrats. Asked \u201cis meritocracy naturally unequal?\u201d tech founders overwhelmingly agreed.Ferenstein went on:One hundred percent of the smaller sample of founders to whom I presented this question said they believe that a truly meritocratic economy would be \u201cmostly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unequal. This is a key distinction: Opportunity is about maximizing people\u2019s potential, which founders tend to believe is highly unequal. Founders may value citizen contributions to society, but they don\u2019t think all citizens have the potential to contribute equally. When asked what percent of national income the top 10% would hold in such a scenario, a majority (67%) of founders believed that the richest individuals would control 50% or more of total income, while only 31% of the public believes such an outcome would occur in a meritocratic society.One of the most interesting questions posed by Ferenstein speaks to middle and working class anxieties over global competition:In international trade policy, some people believe the U.S. government should create laws that favor American business with policies that protect it from global competition, such as fees on imported goods or making it costly to hire cheaper labor in other countries (\u201coutsourcing\u201d). Others believe it would be better if there were less regulations and businesses were free to trade and compete without each country favoring their own industries. Which of these statements come closest to your belief?There was a large difference between tech company officials, 73 percent of whom chose free trade and less regulation, while only 20 percent of Democrats supported those choices.Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University who writes about demographic, social and economic trends, sees these differences as the source of deep conflict within the Democratic Party.The disruptive force is largely Silicon Valley, a natural oligarchy that now funds a party teetering toward populism and even socialism. The fundamental contradictions, as Karl Marx would have noted, lie in the collision of interests between a group that has come to epitomize self-consciously progressive mega-wealth and a mass base which is increasingly concerned about downward mobility.The tech elite, Kotkin writes, \u201cfar from deserting the Democratic Party, more likely will aim take to take it over.\u201d Until very recently, theconflict between populists and tech oligarchs has been muted, in large part due to common views on social issues like gay marriage and, to some extent, environmental protection. But as the social issues fade, having been \u201cwon\u201d by progressives, the focus necessarily moves to economics, where the gap between these two factions is greatest.Kotkin sees future partisan machination in cynical terms:One can expect the oligarchs to seek out a modus vivendi with the populists. They could exchange a regime of higher taxes and regulation for ever-expanding crony capitalist opportunities and political protection. As the hegemons of today, Facebook and Google, not to mention Apple and Amazon, have an intense interest in protecting themselves, for example, from antitrust legislation. History is pretty clear: Heroic entrepreneurs of one decade often turn into the insider capitalists of the next.In 2016, Donald Trump has produced an upheaval within the Republican Party that shifted attention away from the less explosive turmoil in Democratic ranks.Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed bid to finesse the inherent conflict between her dependence on corporate contributions and her need for a strong turnout by union workers, minorities and idealistic millennials embodies the Democratic Party\u2019s long term struggle.The public, at least for the moment, is not willing to support the continued compromise of principle that has been a hallmark of both parties. Trump has provided a temporary solution for the Republican Party; the Democrats need to find a legitimate and more lasting one.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chief Executive of Audio Firm Sonos Steps Down", "Date": "2017-01-10", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Over the years, Sonos has weathered competition from better known rivals like Apple and Bose to find a devoted audience among audio enthusiasts. But lately its wireless speaker has lost ground to an unexpected competitor, Amazon\u2019s Echo.Now it faces another challenge: a change in the corner office. After 14 years leading the company he helped found, John MacFarlane has resigned as chief executive of Sonos and has been replaced by one of his deputies, Patrick Spence.Mr. MacFarlane, 50, has also left the company\u2019s board of directors, though he will remain an employee to help mentor colleagues and work on other projects. He said he left the board so Mr. Spence would not feel like he was always looking over his shoulder.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be that founder who\u2019s always second-guessing,\u201d Mr. MacFarlane said.Sonos is a rarity among technology companies, started in 2002 at a time when independent hardware companies in consumer electronics, an industry dominated by much bigger players, were hard to find. Mr. MacFarlane did not take venture capital money for several years and kept the company private, shunning the usual routine of selling shares to the public or being acquired by a bigger company.Sonos \u2014 based hundreds of miles away from the glare of Silicon Valley in the seaside town of Santa Barbara, Calif. \u2014 does not have the visibility of an Apple, Facebook or Uber. But it has amassed a loyal following with its family of wireless speakers, which allow people to play music streamed from internet services like Spotify or stored on a local computer.One of the secrets to Sonos\u2019s business is that once listeners become hooked on the sound from one of the company\u2019s speakers, they tend to buy more of them so they can simultaneously play music in multiple rooms in their homes.Mr. MacFarlane said he had planned to resign as chief executive earlier, citing his wife\u2019s bout with breast cancer and his aging parents as factors. But last year he delayed his plans when Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker unexpectedly began to eat into sales of Sonos speakers.While Echo has received mixed reviews for its sound quality, its Alexa voice assistant \u2014 which allows people to quickly play music with verbal commands \u2014 has captivated the tech industry and the public. More recently, Google introduced its own Echo competitor, Google Home, with a voice assistant.\u201cI fell into that trap where I\u2019ve been watching voice recognition for years,\u201d Mr. MacFarlane said. \u201cI tried Echo in the beginning and wrote it off. I had too many distractions at that time. I wasn\u2019t playing at the level I should have been playing at in all frankness.\u201dMr. MacFarlane said the company is in a better place than it was last year. The growth of streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, both of which work with its speakers, has helped stoke demand for Sonos products. The company said the number of households with Sonos speakers grew 20 percent this past holiday quarter from the same period the previous year.Mr. Spence, 42, said Sonos understands that its competition is no longer strictly the audio companies that it faced before. \u201cWith what Amazon and Google are doing, the world has changed completely,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re part of that new world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their turnover ratios \u2014 the percentage of holdings they replace each year \u2014 are lower than average. The typical actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar sloughs nearly 65 percent of its portfolio annually. Not one of these three hits that rate.Like Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor who leads Berkshire, Mr. Mullholland started out as a hard-core value hound; he sought stocks that were selling for far less than his estimate of their worth. But, he said, he concluded early on that the best companies also had the potential to grow in the long term and that an investor often had to pay more for them.\u201cYou make money by buying the exceptional \u2014 an exceptional business, exceptional management or an exceptional price,\u201d he said. These days, Mr. Mulholland calls himself a \u201cprice-conscious\u201d purchaser of both value and growth stocks.Consider Goldman Sachs Group, which was recently the fund\u2019s top holding. Its shares, like those of many companies, had lagged in some years since the financial crisis. But Mr. Mulholland said he saw an exceptional business \u2014 \u201cthe premier financial brand in the world.\u201d When he bought in, the stock was trading at what he deemed a discount. It returned nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter.Mr. Mulholland likes to stick with winners and will let them swell into a sizable stake. Goldman recently accounted for 9 percent of his fund\u2019s assets, and several years ago Apple was nearly 18 percent. It\u2019s now also about 9 percent.He runs the fund out of a small office in suburban Philadelphia, and he and his wife are its biggest shareholders, he said. \u201cI invest for myself and whoever wants to ride along with me.\u201dMatthew 25, with an expense ratio of 1.06 percent, returned 19.3 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 3.8 percent for the S.&P. 500.Mr. Miles said he and Mr. Green had learned, in 20 years of running the fund together, that many investors will take \u201cwhatever current earnings are, good or bad, and extrapolate them to an unreasonable level.\u201d Thus good news can lead to irrational exuberance, and bad news to unjustified avoidance. \u201cIf the market says this company is underperforming and will underperform forever, that\u2019s often an opportunity,\u201d he said.That kind of thinking had prevailed, Mr. Miles said, with financial companies, which, as a group, accounted for about a third of the fund\u2019s assets on Nov. 30. \u201cBanks haven\u2019t been given much hope since the financial crisis, and their earnings haven\u2019t been spectacular. So they\u2019ve been inexpensive, relative to the market,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been improving their capital position \u2014 they\u2019re fundamentally less risky. And with the new administration coming in, there\u2019s potential that some of the regulatory regime will relax. That would allow them to generate greater returns on capital, which would improve earnings.\u201dExpectations that President-elect Donald J. Trump will bring different policy priorities to Washington may have also given a lift to private prison companies, Mr. Miles said. The GEO Group, a prison operator based in Florida, was another recent winner for the fund and is a top holding.\u201cThe private prison industry is the low-cost source of supply,\u201d Mr. Miles said. \u201cIf there\u2019s more immigration enforcement, you\u2019d think there\u2019s going to be additional demand.\u201dThe managers of the Hotchkis & Wiley fund neither favor nor shun any particular sector or industry. They will consider any small-cap company that has a strong balance sheet and \u201cimportance to its customers\u2019 success or the broader economy,\u201d Mr. Miles said. The fund returned 17.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Its A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.29 percent.Mr. Coniaris said that three tenets unify the investment approach of all the funds in the Oakmark lineup. They invest in shares trading at discounts to the fund managers\u2019 estimates of their intrinsic value. The stocks\u2019 issuers must show \u201ca clear path to growing per-share value over time,\u201d he said. And their management teams must \u201cthink and act like owners.\u201dHe added that, when valuing stocks, Oakmark doesn\u2019t just seek statistical cheapness, such as a low price-earnings multiple. Its fund managers and analysts dig deeper. That can lead them to picks like Alphabet, which may seem unusual for a value hunter.When valuing the stock, the Oakmark team members made several adjustments, Mr. Coniaris said. They subtracted the company\u2019s big hoard of cash. They also factored out its money-losing \u201cmoonshot investments,\u201d like its effort to develop a driverless car. And they estimated that the market had misunderstood the value of YouTube, the company\u2019s video-streaming service.\u201cIf YouTube were to monetize its viewership like a cable company, it could be worth roughly $300 a share,\u201d Mr. Coniaris said. Alphabet has lately traded above $800.\u201cThe way we see it is, if you back out all that stuff, you\u2019re getting the core search business at a big discount.\u201dMr. Coniaris\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.17 percent, returned 7.6 percent for the quarter. The fund\u2019s sibling, Oakmark Global Select, also thrived in the quarter, returning 7.4 percent.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Ambivalence Toward Trump Turns to Anger", "Date": "2017-01-29", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Friday morning, Silicon Valley was largely ambivalent about President Trump. The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration.By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination.In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades.Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the 10th-richest man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He good-naturedly obliged.The tech companies\u2019 reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did.That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump\u2019s order proclaimed that \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d and would be suspended indefinitely.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said that his great-grandparents had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam.Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was \u201cnot the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201d Mr. Musk was born in South Africa.Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, \u201cthere was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is.\u201dBeyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world.\u201cAlmost every company\u2019s products \u2014 Google, Apple, Airbnb \u2014 has a global customer base,\u201d Mr. Levie said. \u201cThese policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors.\u201dBy early last week, the companies sensed trouble.Murtadha al-Tameemi, 24, an Iraqi-born software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out.\u201cIt may be my na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how politics and industries interact, but I don\u2019t interpret the tech community\u2019s opposition to the president as a political stance,\u201d Mr. Tameemi said. \u201cIt seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them.\u201dThe larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was \u201cconcerned.\u201d Apple said, \u201cIt is not a policy we support.\u201d Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards\u201d and said it would create \u201ccollateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dIt was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. \u201cIt feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,\u201d said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One.Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists.Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media.Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory team.That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day.In an email to employees on Saturday titled \u201cStanding up for what\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday.As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers \u2014 largely immigrants \u2014 began a one-hour work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order.Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen.\u201cAfter the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,\u201d Mr. Altman said. \u201cNow they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come.\u201dMr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p.m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join.Advertisement"}

Trump.As corporate executives around the globe try to understand the implications of the Trump administration on their businesses, they seem to be having an almost bipolar reaction: a euphoric sense that regulations and taxes could soon be lowered \u2014 which would likely increase their profits and paychecks \u2014 yet a simultaneous anxiety that they could become a target of one of the president\u2019s Twitter tirades, which could undo their businesses or possibly their careers.Over the last two months, dozens of chief executives have made pilgrimages to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The ritual involves being photographed in the lobby in front of the gold elevators and having your name hastily tweeted by the throngs (journalistic and otherwise) involved in the spectator sport.For the moment, the action seems to have shifted to Washington. On Monday, a bevy of executives \u2014 Elon Musk of Tesla, Kevin Plank of Under Armour and Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical among them \u2014 arrived for a 9 a.m. meeting at the White House.This meeting and similar ones, according to more than a dozen executives who have attended them, are viewed by the executive class not only as an opportunity to help shape policy in their favor, but also, perhaps more important, as a defensive measure aimed at making \u201cfriends\u201d with the new president so as to avoid his wrath later.Make no mistake: Companies are making changes \u2014 or, at least, public announcements \u2014 aimed (in part or in whole) at appealing to or appeasing Mr. Trump. Amazon said it was hiring 100,000 new employees. Ford canceled plans to build a factory in Mexico and said it would create 700 jobs domestically.The story, which garnered headlines all over the world, was a clear sop to Mr. Trump: In many ways, Foxconn\u2019s statement was seen as a hedge against the possibility that the new president, who has threatened a trade war with China and criticized Apple for manufacturing iPhones abroad, might seek to put further pressure on its business.Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, visited Mr. Trump two weeks ago and announced plans to build an online platform that he pledged would create a million jobs in the Midwest for farmers and small businesses to export goods to China. The plan had been in the works before Mr. Trump was elected, but clearly it helped grease the skids with Mr. Trump, who took Mr. Ma to pose for pictures in the lobby of Trump Tower.Mr. Icahn, a friend and supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s, who was recently named a special adviser on regulation, said in a telephone interview, \u201cYou are correct in saying my relationships with companies is somewhat analogous\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s own relationships with the leaders of them.\u201cIf they are taking advantage of the system, they should be scared,\u201d Mr. Icahn said of corporations. \u201cRemember, many of the guys I went after deserved to be scared \u2014 but in many cases, I bought stock in companies with managements I liked, and I helped them get things done with recalcitrant boards.\u201d\u201cIt will be a bumpy road,\u201d Mr. Icahn said. \u201cBut in the long run he will do a great job with the country.\u201dWhile some executives may be focused on the optics of their businesses in relation to Mr. Trump, Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, the largest money manager in the world overseeing over $5 trillion \u2014 that\u2019s with a \u201ct\u201d \u2014 suggests that each company must rethink its strategy.\u201cWe believe that it is imperative that companies understand these changes and adapt their strategies as necessary,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote in a letter to the nation\u2019s top public company executives that he is in the process of sending out. \u201cNot just following a year like 2016, but as part of a constant process of understanding the landscape in which you operate.\u201d\u201cWe will be looking to see how your strategic framework reflects and recognizes the impact of the past year\u2019s changes in the global environment,\u201d Mr. Fink added. \u201cHow have these changes impacted your strategy and how do you plan to pivot, if necessary, in light of the new world in which you are operating?\u201dOne of the big issues that companies are likely to confront \u2014 and that Mr. Trump may confront for them if they aren\u2019t lucky \u2014 is how they might use repatriated cash if tax reforms are passed in Washington. Mr. Trump has made his presidency about creating jobs. Yet many chief executives have already said that if they are able to repatriate cash at a low tax rate, they will engage in stock buybacks and mergers and acquisitions. (In the 12 months ending in the third quarter of 2016, BlackRock pointed out that \u201cthe value of dividends and buybacks by S&P 500 companies exceeded those companies\u2019 operating profit.\u201d)Mr. Fink warned that he was watching, too. \u201cIf tax reform also includes some form of reduced taxation for repatriation of cash trapped overseas, BlackRock will be looking to companies\u2019 strategic frameworks for an explanation of whether they will bring cash back to the U.S. \u2014 and if so, how they plan to use it. Will it be used simply for more share buybacks? Or is it a part of a capital plan that appropriately balances returning capital to shareholders with prudently investing for future growth?\u201dBetween Mr. Trump and the investor class, chief executives may be cornered in their offices more than ever as they try to adjust to the new reality.Adam Grant, a professor of management and psychology at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said behavioral scientists had a term to describe the way chief executives were thinking about Mr. Trump: It is called an \u201cambivalent relationship.\u201dThat sounds about right.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about corporate bosses\u2019 efforts to appeal to President Trump, referred incorrectly to the manufacturing company Foxconn, which said it might spend $7 billion in the United States to build a factory. Foxconn is based in Taiwan, not China.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dumping a Bad App? Tips for a Painless Breakup", "Date": "2017-01-25", "News": "Supported byTech FixEVERYONE is familiar with this scenario: An app you once loved no longer brings the same joy. It\u2019s gotten buggy over time, or an update transformed it to the point it became unusable.Chances are you thought about calling it quits. But after years of sharing your personal data with this app, you probably gave up and stayed in this stale relationship. You put up with the productivity-killing bugs and odd design changes because moving to a new, potentially better app felt harder than sticking with the bad one.Even so, people have stuck with Evernote partly because taking their notes elsewhere is hardly easy.\u201dWe understand those kind of changes don\u2019t make everyone happy,\u201d said Greg Chiemingo, an Evernote spokesman. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve seen continued growth of paying customers over the last two years.\u201dPeople deserve better than this. Every day you stay with a bad app is time you could be spending with a superior product that will make life better. Here are my tips, based on interviews and personal experience, for a clean break.No app is perfect, but you have to draw the line somewhere. The problem is, you may be in such a rut that you can\u2019t recognize the warning signs.An obvious one is when an app stops working reliably in a way that affects your life. For instance, I called it quits on Apple\u2019s Calendar app when I was planning a dinner with friends last month and the software sent a calendar invite in Greenwich Mean Time rather than Pacific Standard Time. As a result, one person thought we were meeting on Saturday instead of Friday and didn\u2019t show up. (It wasn\u2019t the first time this happened, either.)Brian Fitzpatrick, a former manager at Google who led a team that developed tools to help people move their data to and from Google, said he dumps an app when it has stopped improving.\u201cIt\u2019s still functioning, but you don\u2019t see any changes in it for a very long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a zombie app, I would call it at that point.\u201dAnother sign that it\u2019s time to move on is when you have nobody to talk to. Many popular apps for tasks like note taking, photo management and word processing are connected to social networks, or people you can share data with. If an app\u2019s audience is a ghost town \u2014 like Yahoo\u2019s photo-sharing app, Flickr, which sank in popularity after mobile photo-sharing services like Instagram emerged \u2014 then it\u2019s probably time to leave.Yahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Flickr.The hardest part of breaking up with an app is moving your data. So as a rule of thumb, save a backup copy of your data so that you can export it into a new app. Then carefully search for a better app to suit your needs.As a safety measure before changing apps, you should always keep extra copies of your data somewhere, whether it be in the cloud with a service like Dropbox or on a physical hard drive.Some companies deliberately make exporting your data difficult because they want you to stick around.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like moving into an apartment and finding out at the end of the lease you can\u2019t take your furniture and your books with you,\u201d Mr. Fitzpatrick said.Evernote is a good example. It includes an \u201cExport notes\u201d feature, but it only lets you export notes into two formats that are compatible with just a few other note-taking apps. Microsoft\u2019s note-taking app OneNote, along with Apple\u2019s Notes app, can easily import Evernote records. But if your app of choice is something else, such as Google Keep, you will have to manually paste your notes in the new app.Flickr is also difficult to part ways with. Getting out your photos requires lots of manual labor: You have to download all the photos, which can take a significant amount of time if you have thousands of high-resolution images, and then upload them to a new photo service.When companies don\u2019t provide convenient tools to export your data, look elsewhere by doing a quick web search for solutions. There are plenty of people in the same boat as you, and chances are they have written scripts, or lightweight programs, to automatically pull out your data for you.If there is no convenient way to export your data, sometimes it doesn\u2019t hurt to just take out what is most important to you. Perhaps you don\u2019t need five-year-old notes from Evernote anymore, so you could just manually paste your latest memos and get a fresh start with a different app.On the bright side, you can learn a lot from a tough breakup with an app \u2014 which can be especially useful when looking for a replacement.The biggest lessons: Pick a tool that supports a wide array of formats instead of proprietary ones. And before you commit to a new app, make sure it is as easy to get out as it is to get in.Ditching Apple\u2019s Calendar app was fairly easy. All my calendar data was already stored online and Apple\u2019s app supports calendars from multiple online services including Google, Microsoft and Facebook. The key was finding an app that also supported those services but performed better.After testing several apps, I decided that Fantastical 2, a new app with a cleaner interface for getting a glance at calendar events, was the best one. Once Fantastical 2 was installed, I added my Google calendar accounts to load all my events into the app.Google said it updated Google Voice on Monday with photo sharing and group messaging. But that was too late to keep people like Mr. Fitzpatrick.\u201cA lot of it comes down to, How interested are you in change?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Growing a Different Apple", "Date": null, "News": "Supported byAt Apple, Brian Latimer was in charge of protecting some of the company\u2019s deepest secrets.Under Apple\u2019s \u201cneed to know\u201d philosophy, he did not even have access to much of the information he helped to secure. And like all Apple employees, he was discouraged from talking about his job with co-workers.His current employer, Pearl Automation, could not be more different.Founded in 2014 by three former senior managers from Apple\u2019s iPod and iPhone groups, Pearl has tried to replicate what its leaders view as the best parts of Apple\u2019s culture, like its fanatical dedication to quality and beautiful design. But the founders also consciously rejected some of the less appealing aspects of life at Apple, like its legendary secrecy and top-down management style.The start-up, which makes high-tech accessories for cars, holds weekly meetings with its entire staff. Managers brief them on coming products, company finances, technical problems, even the presentations made to the board.\u201cIt\u2019s very liberating to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Mr. Latimer, who left Apple in May to join Pearl. \u201cEveryone is contributing here, so everyone has a need to know.\u201dBest of all, Mr. Latimer is working with many of his old Apple colleagues.Pearl, which is led by Bryson Gardner, has recruited heavily from Apple. More than 50 of Pearl\u2019s 80 or so employees worked for the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant at some point.Although Apple pays very well, many of the Apple recruits had gotten bored cranking out incremental improvements to the iPhone and the Mac, said Brian Sander, Pearl\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer. \u201cThey were vibrating. It was time for them to do something different,\u201d he said.Pearl\u2019s pitch was appealing: Make the roads safer by giving tens of millions of older autos the same high-tech safety features that the newest models have.Mr. Gardner declined to disclose specific sales figures but said Pearl had released the product too late to make it into physical retailers before the holidays. The company plans to expand distribution early next year.Like Apple, though, Pearl is playing the long game. Engineers are already testing self-parking technology and other driver-assistance features for future products. So far, the company has raised $50 million from prominent venture capital firms, including Accel, Shasta Ventures and Venrock, but Mr. Gardner said it would need to raise more money in 2017.Pearl\u2019s headquarters \u2014 in an office complex between vast redwood groves and Santa Cruz\u2019s beaches \u2014 are a world away from Apple\u2019s campus in the busy technopolis of Silicon Valley.The larger company\u2019s influence, however, is clear.Apple, which has about 110,000 employees, breaks big projects down into smaller tasks. Those are assigned to small teams, and each subtask is given to a specific employee, who must get it done \u2014 what Apple calls the \u201cdirectly responsible individual.\u201dPearl has copied this system. \u201cIn leading small teams, that\u2019s very effective,\u201d Mr. Gardner said.Pearl has also imported Apple\u2019s disciplined approach to engineering. Deadlines are regularly set, and flaws are relentlessly investigated. \u201cWhy did this fail?\u201d Mr. Gardner said. \u201cYou really understand the full bounds of the problem.\u201dAnother Apple hallmark \u2014 elegant design \u2014 is also a core value. \u201cWe\u2019re building something that has an Apple-quality fit and finish,\u201d Mr. Sander said.Unlike competing models, the RearVision has two high-definition cameras to provide a better view, and one is tuned for night vision. The cameras peek out of a license-plate frame and are powered by a hidden solar panel. They transmit data wirelessly to an adapter that plugs into the car\u2019s diagnostic port near the steering wheel. The images are displayed on an app on the driver\u2019s smartphone. The setup allows the company to frequently update the software to fix bugs and add new features.Like Apple, Pearl dealt with dozens of suppliers, mostly in Asia, to obtain the 400 unique components in RearVision.\u201cWe were used to doing this with the iPhone and iPad,\u201d said Joseph Fisher, Pearl\u2019s co-founder and head of engineering. Indeed, the Pearl team tapped many of the same suppliers they worked with at Apple.But Pearl\u2019s leaders also consciously rejected Apple\u2019s view that only the top executives should have a view of the whole company.Apple\u2019s longtime chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, exercised control over the smallest details about products. When he stepped down in 2011, his power was distributed among more of the company\u2019s executives, but decisions remained highly centralized.Apple, for all of its success creating phones and computers, has spawned very few start-ups like Pearl in recent years, especially compared to peers like Google and Facebook.Eswar Priyadarshan, who sold his mobile advertising company, Quattro Wireless, to Apple in 2010 and stayed for four years, said that he learned about design and aesthetics during his time there. But he noted that Apple\u2019s high compensation, focused product mission and top-down decision-making tended to damp the risk-taking necessary to start a company.Mr. Priyadarshan, who is now chief executive of BotCentral, a six-person start-up, compared Apple to a community of warrior monks. \u201cWarrior monks don\u2019t talk and do whatever is asked,\u201d he said.Nest Labs, the most successful company to have been founded by Apple veterans in the last few years, was born in part because its founders, Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, were told that Apple had no interest in their smart thermostat.\u201cIt was a great place to work: superhigh growth, great product, lots of innovation,\u201d said Mr. Rogers, who remained at Nest after its sale to Alphabet for $3.2 billion in 2014. \u201cBut Apple is very much, \u2018How do we ship our next iPhone for Christmas?\u2019\u201dBut Mr. Rogers, who worked with some of Pearl\u2019s founders at Apple and serves on its board, said that the start-up absorbed many of the positive lessons of Nest: Recruit top Apple people, control your hardware and software, establish a culture of openness and empowerment, and constantly upgrade the product.Apple, for its part, appears to hold no hard feelings toward Pearl, despite the start-up\u2019s steady recruitment of its employees.\u201cPearl Auto is a great example of the creativity and innovation driving the iPhone ecosystem,\u201d said Josh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman. \u201cWe wish them great success with their new product.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Alexa Fits Into Amazon\u2019s Prime Directive", "Date": "2017-01-24", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyWhen \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation\u201d first aired in the 1980s, it envisioned a number of technological advances for humankind\u2019s future. Set in the 24th century, the show featured 3-D printers, visors that could provide artificial sight and a virtual reality simulator called the holodeck. But perhaps its most prescient creation was the supercomputer onboard the ship. The software \u2014 usually referred to only as \u201cComputer\u201d \u2014 could locate people, open doors and retrieve answers to complicated questions. Crew members spoke their requests, and an always-present helper responded within seconds.Amazon brought a version of that computer to life recently \u2014 albeit a few centuries earlier than \u201cStar Trek\u201d predicted. Last July, David Limp, a company executive who works on the product, said in an interview with Fortune that the idea of an all-knowing machine, with access to all the world\u2019s information, had captured his imagination since the first time he saw it on television. It took, he said, a team of 1,000 engineers to write its code, and when the device was finished, Amazon decided to call it Alexa, shorthand for Alexandria, as in the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt. It is designed to work primarily with a suite of wireless speakers, also made by Amazon, called Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.The company bills Alexa as a smart personal assistant, one that can play your favorite song or read you a book or recite a recipe as you cook. You can also make purchases through Amazon simply by asking. The possibilities are seemingly endless, because Alexa can learn new \u201cskills\u201d (as Amazon likes to call them) from third-party developers who integrate Alexa into their own products. And developers have leapt at the opportunity to do so: At the beginning of 2016, there were 135 skills designed to work with Alexa, but this year that number increased to more than 7,000. Alexa can now order you an Uber or a pizza, check your bank balance, control your TV, turn your lights on and off and even measure your car\u2019s carbon-dioxide emissions. \u201c\u2009\u2018Alexa, buy me coffee\u2019 is just a fraction of what it\u2019s going to be over time,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an internet analyst who covers Amazon for the equities firm Macquarie Securities. \u201cWhat can they improve with the voice activation? Some of that has yet to be seen.\u201dAlexa has already evolved from an experimental device to an irresistible household fixture \u2014 perhaps surprisingly, given Amazon\u2019s spotty track record with hardware. Kindle e-readers are popular, but the company\u2019s attempt at a smartphone flopped hard. Schachter told me that part of Alexa\u2019s success was luck, in that there were few other shiny consumer offerings on the market this holiday season and the price point was affordable. But something about the future-feel of this device, its ease and convenience, has captivated a mass audience, even the most privacy-conscious among us. Alexa is always listening, ready to be of service. (This has already backfired: When a newscaster relayed a story about a little girl using her Alexa to order a dollhouse, it triggered dozens of Alexas in the homes of people watching the broadcast to also try to order one.)Five years ago, few would have guessed that Amazon would already be ahead of the top tech companies vying to be leaders in home automation. But Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of the company, has been shaping this vision since the earliest days of Amazon. I recently revisited \u201cThe Everything Store,\u201d a 2013 book by Brad Stone about how Bezos transformed the start-up from an online bookstore into the e-commerce behemoth it is today. \u201cBezos\u2019 long-term goal is to sell everything, everywhere,\u201d Stone writes. \u201cHe will attempt to move faster, work his employees harder, make bolder bets and pursue both big inventions and small ones, all to achieve his grand vision for Amazon \u2014 that it be not just an everything store, but ultimately an everything company.\u201dThe fact that I live in New York, a city that thrives on accessibility, might explain why I was slow to grasp the appeal of Alexa. Here we have bodegas on every corner, most open 24 hours, in case you need to pick up a roll of toilet paper or a bottle of hot sauce in the middle of the night. But most Americans don\u2019t live with the luxury of that immediacy. I didn\u2019t really understand this until the holidays, when I went home to visit my mom in Virginia and we ran out of seltzer. Carbonated water is not an essential item. But in that moment, it would have been easier to quickly tell Alexa to place an order for us and forget about it until it arrived two or three days later, rather than try to remember to pick up a case of Poland Spring the next time someone made the 20-minute drive to the store. That\u2019s the entire enticing promise of Amazon and Alexa: a much more efficient and manageable life, one in which you can outsource mundane tasks while you do something more important, like spend time with your family.It\u2019s not hard to imagine that Alexa might be displaced as rivals introduce their own efforts. Facebook is working on an intelligent assistant, called Jarvis (named for the smart computer that helps Tony Stark, or Iron Man, navigate his surroundings), as is Microsoft. There are rumors that Apple is working on a major update for Siri. Google is currently Amazon\u2019s closest competitor. The company has spent decades organizing the world\u2019s information and learning about our habits and preferences in the process, so that it will one day know what we want even before we do. Search, then, will evolve away from the actual act of searching to the act of surfacing. The company is working on a version of artificial intelligence called Google Assistant to perfect that very ability.But while Google is working to anticipate your needs, Amazon is readying itself to be the only place you need to go to fulfill them. Thinking about Amazon\u2019s restraints \u2014 the company has never tried to introduce a social network or an email service, for example \u2014 you can understand something about the future Amazon seems to envision: A time when no screen is needed at all, just your voice.Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of CB Insights, a trend-forecasting start-up in New York, told me that Amazon has something that its competitors only dream of \u2014 consumer attention and trust. \u201cIn the last few years, Amazon has become the search engine for consumer products, instead of Google,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to buy something, and you already have an Amazon account, you\u2019re probably going to just buy it there. With Google, you still have to go to Amazon or Walmart.\u201d Amazon is investing in supply trailers, drones and fulfillment centers to develop its own postal service and delivery system. And it\u2019s still pushing its Dash buttons, those small pieces of hardware with one purpose: to order a single item from Amazon, like laundry detergent or dish soap. They seem unnecessary, until you consider them with all of Amazon\u2019s other efforts: It\u2019s not just an everything store, or even an everything company, but an everywhere (and anytime!) store.The various products that Amazon is planning to roll out \u2014 including Pantry and Fresh, its grocery service \u2014 can be easily baked into default Alexa services. Restaurants, the company\u2019s version of Seamless, already is. All this in turn brings in more money for Amazon. As Limp put it back in July: \u201cThe nice thing about the Amazon device business is that when we sell a device, generally people buy more bluejeans. And little black dresses. And shoes.\u201dThere\u2019s a theory that behavioral economists use to explain our consumption habits called \u201chyperbolic discounting,\u201d which is the tendency to choose short-term rewards over long-term gains. The \u201cmarshmallow test\u201d of the 1960s tested the ability of preschoolers to resist temptation \u2014 the titular marshmallow, within reach \u2014 with the promise that they would be rewarded with two if they waited. In the experiment\u2019s most popular interpretation, those who had self-control grew up to be much more successful than those who did not. It is one of the most formative studies in self-control and how people make decisions. Alexa is the ultimate marshmallow test, and most of us are failing. We are being conditioned, as a population, to never wait, to never delay our gratification, to accept thoughtless, constant consumption as the new norm. But how we think about consumption and willpower carry enormous implications for the environment and the culture of society as a whole. Think about that the next time you ask Alexa to order you another roll of toilet paper.An article on Jan. 29 about Alexa, Amazon\u2019s home assistant, misstated the total number of marshmallows offered to subjects of the \u201cmarshmallow test,\u201d which measured the ability of preschoolers to delay gratification. If the subjects could resist the temptation of a single marshmallow, they were rewarded with one more \u2014 not two more.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Helping Mobile Publishing? Some Publishers Are Not So Sure", "Date": "2017-01-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last month, Federico Viticci, who runs MacStories, a news site devoted to Apple and its products, made a change in how the site publishes articles for mobile gadgets. MacStories, he declared, would no longer support a Google-backed method for faster loading of mobile web pages, called AMP.AMP has since delivered on its promise of faster mobile web pages. Even so, publishers \u2014 of smaller sites, especially, or individual bloggers \u2014 are beginning to worry about giving too much control to Google in exchange for zippier web pages. What\u2019s more, Google\u2019s approach to AMP has rankled some critics already suspicious of the company\u2019s outsize influence on the internet.Much of the publishers\u2019 unease is rooted in Google\u2019s presentation of AMP stories, which appear as if they are Google articles. That\u2019s because Google, to speed up AMP, stores copies of publisher\u2019s pages and serves them from its own internet network. So when a reader clicks an AMP link, the address bar at the top of the page displays google.com instead of the actual web address from the publisher.\u201cIt looks like a Google story,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a web search news site. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why you\u2019re getting the nervousness from some of these publishers.\u201dGoogle said that it had designed AMP to prioritize speed and that it wanted to help \u2014 not harm \u2014 publishers, who get full accounting of traffic, data and advertising revenue. Publishers also retain control of their content and design. Google said serving up articles from its own internet network was the best way it knew to achieve the AMP speeds, which are as much as four times faster than a regular mobile web page.\u201cWe always try to present the content that is the best experience,\u201d said David Besbris, Google\u2019s vice president of engineering.Google started AMP in 2015 because it worried that competitors like Facebook were drawing web surfers inside their networks with faster-loading articles and keeping them there. For Google, those rival sites were siphoning people away from the open internet, where the search company \u2014 which created the internet\u2019s most valuable property by organizing the expanse of the World Wide Web \u2014 typically operates.Now articles that use AMP appear prominently in Google search results on mobile devices. A Google search for \u201cDonald Trump\u201d on a smartphone brings back a horizontal carousel of articles from media organizations like Slate and The Wall Street Journal at the top of the page. If someone clicks the first story in the carousel, he or she is moved into a browser and can swipe instantly from one story to another without leaving Google\u2019s network.Another benefit of AMP for Google is that it keeps activity on the web, and away from apps. More browsing on the internet means more web searches, and, in most cases, that means more Google. This is even more pronounced on mobile devices, where Google accounts for about 95 percent of all global web searches, according to StatCounter.David Gehring, a former Google employee and the chief executive of Relay Media, a company that works with publishers to convert pages to AMP, said the format had been positive for publishers grappling with shrinking revenue in the shift from print to online advertising. He estimated that up to 10 percent of mobile web content was already on AMP.Yet Mr. Gehring also said Google suffered from \u201ctone deafness\u201d when it came to explaining the benefits of AMP, such as the ability for publishers to syndicate articles across the mobile web without losing advertising or traffic.\u201cIt made me feel like my site wasn\u2019t my own,\u201d Mr. Kras said.Still, Mr. Kras decided to keep AMP because it was fast. \"For that, a lot of little things can be (temporarily) forgotten,\u201d he said.Several bigger publishers say they are pleased with AMP and do not see anything worrisome with Google.\u201cGoogle has been a good partner,\u201d said Mark Silverstein, the head of business development at The Huffington Post, which is planning to push almost all of its news content into AMP. \u201cWhen they make decisions, they do a good job of explaining why they reached that decision.\u201dEmily Smith, head of content operations at Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s Wired magazine, said supporting AMP had pushed its mobile articles to the top of search results. For web surfers conditioned to believe that the most relevant information is presented first in search results, it\u2019s important for a media organization to be near the top.\u201cIt\u2019s like being above the fold in a newspaper,\u201d she said.About 15 percent of The Washington Post\u2019s traffic comes from AMP pages. The Post is now using the lessons from AMP to move its articles to a separate, faster-running mobile platform that runs like an app but does so over the web.Joey Marburger, director of products for The Post, said that its readers were scrolling further on AMP stories, but that it was building its own fast system to gain greater control over ads and features.\u201cWe have to be where our readers are coming from,\u201d Mr. Marburger said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also important to have more control over our own content.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frantic Phoning Among C.E.O.s: How to Address Trump Ban?", "Date": "2017-01-30", "News": "Supported byDealBookThe phone calls flew back and forth among the nation\u2019s top chief executives over the weekend, all asking the same questions: \u201cWhat are you going to say publicly about Trump\u2019s executive order? And what can we say about it without becoming his next punching bag?\u201dWelcome to the new reality for corporate America.Last fall, John Chipman, the director-general and chief executive of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, advanced the notion that in our globalized world, \u201cevery company needs a foreign policy.\u201d Now, our largest companies also have to think about having a domestic policy \u2014 and possibly a moral policy, too.For corporate executives, the decision about whether to speak out against a policy from Mr. Trump so early in his administration has clearly been nerve-racking.The reaction from major American companies to President Trump\u2019s order has ranged from silence to outrage.While it may appear as though a tidal wave of executives has come forward to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order over immigration during the last 48 hours, each did so with a different flavor and tone \u2014 and most didn\u2019t go public until some of their rivals and peers did first, as they sought safety in numbers.Much of the early criticism came from the West Coast: Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook weighed in first, and then Tim Cook of Apple as well as Howard Schultz of Starbucks, who pledged to hire 10,000 refugees.But other big firms, including those on Wall Street and in the consumer-goods sector, took much longer to respond \u2014 if at all \u2014 because of worries about blowback from regulators and customers.And for good reason: Mr. Schultz\u2019s comments prompted calls for a boycott from Trump supporters who started the hashtag #boycottStarbucks on Twitter. But there was a counterpunch. For every tweet about plans to boycott, someone else tweeted something like this: \u201cThere is a #boycottStarbucks going around because they\u2019re pledging to hire refugees, you know what that means? Time to get some Starbucks.\u201dCoca-Cola didn\u2019t say anything until late Monday, when the chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said the company opposed the travel ban. Many other large companies have so far remained silent on the issue. Among them are Blackstone Group, Disney, General Motors and Pepsico.And while the criticism (although limited) was real, few took shots directly at Mr. Trump, for fear of retribution. The harshest comment from a C.E.O. of a large, public company appeared to come from Reed Hastings of Netflix, who directly named the president: \u201cTrump\u2019s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all.\u201d(It\u2019s easy to surmise that Netflix could soon be on the losing end of Mr. Trump\u2019s possible plan to upend net-neutrality laws.)But most top executives took a more circuitous route. The wording was purposely dripping with politeness: \u201cThis executive order is one we do not support,\u201d became the language almost universally adopted by C.E.O.s.Of course, the business community, up until this past weekend, has largely cheered many of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to lower taxes, remove regulations and invest in infrastructure.Several dozen chief executives have found their ways onto a variety of councils to meet with Mr. Trump and advise him on business issues, making it even thornier to criticize him in public.By all accounts, people close to Mr. Musk say he was upset about Mr. Trump\u2019s order, but offered a somewhat tepid rebuke on Twitter: \u201cThe blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201dHe quickly found himself as the target of criticism from fans who wanted him to go further. \u201cExpected a much more forceful condemnation from someone like Elon,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.A lot of the discussion among C.E.O.s, which they shared with me anonymously for fear of retribution for even discussing the subject, said that in the Venn diagram they made about how to deal with public issues like this, they came back to the word \u201ctrade-off.\u201dWhat\u2019s the best alternative? One executive explained that he could offer a morally righteous argument that would feel good in the moment and probably cause a series of cheering \u2014 and booing \u2014 from his various constituents, while potentially losing whatever influence he might have on the president to guide him to make sensible policy in other areas. Or he could offer a Milquetoast response that appeased his employees and nodded at the issue without upsetting his relationship with the president.Given that Mr. Musk has been willing to bring up contentious subjects with Mr. Trump in the past \u2014 like introducing a carbon tax \u2014 perhaps making the point in person will do more than doing so in an email or on Twitter.Whatever the case, the first shots between the business world and the White House have been fired. And more are likely to come.\u201cThere\u2019s some strange mythology that when you go public you can\u2019t speak up,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve heard from plenty of investors appreciating our stance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: The Next Voice You Hear Will Be Amazon\u2019s", "Date": "2017-01-06", "News": "Supported byBitsThey say talk is cheap. In tech right now, it is also very valuable.That would require downloading an app and carrying a smartphone in the car. It would enable drivers to do things like get weather reports, stream music, juggle their calendars or remotely lock and unlock their cars. And, of course, shop on Amazon while driving.Other tech companies are also getting into using \u201cconversational computing,\u201d or voice commands, in cars. Apple has CarPlay software for dictating messages or getting map directions while behind the wheel. Google has Android Auto for something similar.In all, there seemed to be more than a dozen companies with Alexa capabilities at CES. Notably, Huawei, a Chinese electronics company, said its flagship Mate 9 phone would have Alexa preinstalled. That\u2019s particularly impressive, because the Mate 9 uses Google\u2019s Android operating system and thus has access to Google Voice, a voice assistant.Why the big push now?\u201cIf you own the voice-user interface, you own lots of data, and you know what people are talking about. That gives you a much better chance of selling them something,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, the president of Moor Insights & Strategy, a tech analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s also a Trojan horse for getting people to use A.W.S.\u201d (Amazon Web Services is by far the most profitable part of Amazon.)User data, direct digital knowledge of what people are doing with your products and in the world, is perhaps the most valuable currency in a world dominated by online life. It is the best way to know how your products are going over, and what to build next.Amazon collects lots of shopping data from its retail website, and now has the most information on how people use cloud computing systems like A.W.S., but it has an uneven record in many other areas. Its phone was a dud, and it has a relatively modest business in tablets mostly used for reading. It has no operating system of its own to speak of, and that is often how companies like Apple and Google obtain some of their best data.If the company can capture voice computing, it can gain lots of insights without having to build lots of low-margin hardware. Easy to see why the push is on.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg, in Suit, Testifies in Oculus Intellectual Property Trial", "Date": "2017-01-17", "News": "Supported byDALLAS \u2014 A few years ago, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook and one of tech\u2019s shrewdest seers, made a huge bet on a new technology, virtual reality, buying Oculus VR, one of the most prominent start-ups in the industry, for more than $2 billion.That frank assessment came from Mr. Zuckerberg on Tuesday in a federal courtroom of all places, where Facebook is tangling with a games publisher that has accused Oculus of stealing technology that went into the creation of the Oculus virtual reality headset. The trial offered a window into how Mr. Zuckerberg views the progress of one of his biggest bets, and a glimpse of Facebook\u2019s approach to making deals in Silicon Valley.\u201cI don\u2019t think that good virtual reality is fully there yet,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, who wore a suit and tie while testifying, instead of his regular uniform, a T-shirt and jeans. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take five or 10 more years of development before we get to where we all want to go.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg spoke during a court appearance, in which he was questioned about the Oculus deal. He denied accusations that Oculus had taken technology it did not own, and said he had never before testified in a courtroom.While fights over ownership of prominent technologies are common, this one defied some predictions by reaching a jury trial, which started in a federal court here in early January.\u201cWe are highly confident that Oculus products are built on Oculus technology,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cThe idea that Oculus products are based on someone else\u2019s technology is just wrong.\u201dFacebook could face as much as $2 billion in damages if it loses the suit. While there is still excitement throughout the technology industry over virtual reality, most headsets, including those from Oculus, are not selling in big numbers because of high prices and limited content for them.On Tuesday, a lawyer representing Oculus and Facebook asked Mr. Zuckerberg whether he had realized his goal of creating a new computing platform. \u201cThese things end up being more complex than you think up front,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf anything, we may have to invest even more money to get to the goals we had than we had thought up front.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg added that Facebook probably will have to invest more than $3 billion in the next decade to reach its goal of providing hundreds of millions of people with a good virtual reality experience.Later, a Facebook spokeswoman said that nothing had changed about the company\u2019s commitment to virtual reality. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said for years, VR is the next computing platform, and Facebook\u2019s Oculus team is leading the way,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Tera Randall.The core of ZeniMax\u2019s case is that one of its former employees, John Carmack, shared ZeniMax virtual reality technology with Palmer Luckey, a founder of Oculus, during the company\u2019s early days, technology for which ZeniMax was never compensated. Mr. Carmack, a game industry stalwart behind games like Doom, later joined Oculus.A lawyer for ZeniMax used some of his time questioning Mr. Zuckerberg to bolster the company\u2019s argument that Facebook rushed through its review of Oculus when buying it, overlooking details about its dispute with ZeniMax.In response to questioning from the lawyer for Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg said that the company spends weeks, months or even years thinking about the issues that lead it to make acquisitions. He said Facebook \u2014 which has also acquired Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 believes that negotiating deals quickly is important in an environment where it is often competing with companies like Google, Apple and Twitter.\u201cBeing able to move quickly not only increases our chance of getting the deal done, but it keeps us from having to pay a lot more as the deal process drives out,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.For companies that waffle about selling out to Facebook, the social network is willing to deploy fear as a tactic. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to help convince people that they want to join you, helping them understand all the pain they would have to go through is a valuable tactic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s a little less of what I tend to focus on.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said that Mr. Iribe was originally asking for $4 billion for Oculus. He settled for $2 billion, though Facebook also agreed to $700 million more in compensation to retain important Oculus team members and $300 million in pay for hitting certain milestones. Facebook\u2019s code name for the Oculus deal was Inception.Unlike Facebook, ZeniMax is not household name, but many of the games it publishes, including Fallout and Elder Scrolls, have a passionate following. It also has a board of directors stacked with famous names, including the Hall of Fame baseball player Cal Ripken Jr., the director Jerry Bruckheimer, CBS chief Leslie Moonves, and Donald J. Trump\u2019s brother Robert.A lawyer for ZeniMax asked Mr. Zuckerberg about his reaction to ZeniMax\u2019s lawsuit, which was filed not long after Facebook publicly announced its intention to buy Oculus.\u201cIt is pretty common when you announce a big deal or do something that all kinds of people just kind of come out of the woodwork and claim that they just own some portion of the deal,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cLike most people in the court, I\u2019ve never even heard of ZeniMax before.\u201dAdvertisement"}
