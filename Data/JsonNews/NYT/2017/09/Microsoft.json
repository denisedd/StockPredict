{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Courts Brand-Name Teachers, Raising Ethics Issues", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEducation DisruptedMAPLETON, N.D. \u2014 One of the tech-savviest teachers in the United States teaches third grade here at Mapleton Elementary, a public school with about 100 students in the sparsely populated plains west of Fargo.\u201cI will embed it in my brand every day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said of Seesaw. \u201cI get to make it better.\u201dTheir ranks are growing as public schools increasingly adopt all manner of laptops, tablets, math teaching sites, quiz apps and parent-teacher messaging apps. The corporate courtship of these teachers brings with it profound new conflict-of-interest issues for the nation\u2019s public schools.Moreover, there is little rigorous research showing whether or not the new technologies significantly improve student outcomes.Teachers said that more established start-ups gave them pricier perks like travel expenses to industry-sponsored conferences attended by thousands of teachers. In exchange, teacher ambassadors often promote company products on social media or in their conference talks \u2014 sometimes without explicitly disclosing their relationships with their sponsors.Many public schools are facing tight budgets, and administrators, including the principal at Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, said they welcomed potentially valuable free technology and product training. Even so, some education experts warned that company incentives might influence teachers to adopt promoted digital tools over rival products or even traditional approaches, like textbooks.\u201cTeachers can\u2019t help but be seduced to make greater use of the technology, given these efforts by tech companies,\u201d said Samuel E. Abrams, director of the National Center for the Study of Privatization in Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.Public-school teachers who accept perks, meals or anything of value in exchange for using a company\u2019s products in their classrooms could also run afoul of school district ethics policies or state laws regulating government employees.Ms. Delzer and other educators forcefully argue that they\u2019re motivated by altruism, and not company-bestowed status or gifts. \u201cI am in this profession for kids,\u201d Ms. Delzer said, \u201cnot for notoriety or the money.\u201dAnother important draw for teachers, who already often feel underappreciated: Having tech companies, the icons of American society, seek their views provides welcome attention. \u201cTeachers have really responded well to feeling like they are being listened to,\u201d said Carl Sjogreen, a co-founder of Seesaw.The benefits to companies are substantial. Many start-ups enlist their ambassadors as product testers and de facto customer service representatives who can field other teachers\u2019 queries.Microsoft and Apple said they worked with schools to make sure any conference travel expenses they covered for teachers complied with district ethics rules. Google said it provided meals but not teachers\u2019 travel expenses.An Amazon representative, responding to a question about the gift cards that TenMarks offered to certain teachers last year, said that the company had not given that incentive recently and that it had procedures \u201cto ensure our compliance with applicable laws and to help facilitate teachers\u2019 obligations to their schools.\u201dSo far, no teacher has asked for the payment, said Melissa Davis, GoEnnounce\u2019s chief executive. Still, she said, teacher referrals accounted for 20 percent of GoEnnounce\u2019s first-year sales.\u201cThese champions are really essential in giving us a really powerful foot in the door to meet with districts and schools,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Unlike industry influence in medicine, however, the phenomenon of company-affiliated teachers has received little scrutiny. Twitter alone is rife with educators broadcasting their company-bestowed titles.\u201cIf medical experts started saying, \u2018I\u2019m a Google Certified Doctor\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a Pfizer Distinguished Nurse,\u2019 people would be up in arms,\u201d said Douglas A. Levin, president of EdTech Strategies, a consulting firm.This is true for celebrities and teachers alike. And it applies equally to conferences, YouTube videos, personal blogs or Twitter posts.Some teachers and start-ups said they were not aware of those guidelines.\u201cIf you are receiving any sort of incentive to promote the company\u2019s product, that is what we call a material relationship,\u201d said Mary K. Engle, associate director of the trade commission\u2019s division of advertising practices, \u201cand that has to be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in the endorsement message.\u201dFor some teachers, corporate relationships can be steppingstones to lucrative speaking or training engagements. Schools often hire company-connected educators to give training sessions to their teachers. And technology conferences for teachers often book influential teachers as speakers.Ms. Delzer said her fees for such events started at several thousand dollars a day. Some veteran education influencers charge much more.To do it all, Ms. Delzer negotiated a special contract with her district, allowing her to take 10 unpaid days off a year. She uses those days off to give speeches and run teacher workshops for other schools.\u201cIt\u2019s like two full-time jobs,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.Just before 8:30 a.m. on school days, Ms. Delzer, 32, stations herself at the classroom door. She greets each of her third graders by name, ushering them in one by one with a brief shoulder squeeze. \u201cI want them to feel love when they walk in,\u201d she said.If her classroom looks less like a traditional schoolroom and more like a den \u2014 with a colorful rug and inspirational signs exhorting children to \u201cDREAM\u201d and \u201cLAUGH\u201d \u2014 that is no accident. A few years ago, Ms. Delzer decided to remodel her classroom to foster the kind of independent work habits she thought her students would need in life.So she ditched the standard-issue desks and rearranged the room to look more like the place where she goes to work on her conference talks: her local Starbucks. Today, her third graders sit wherever they please \u2014 on cushions, rocking chairs, balance balls.\u201cIf I\u2019m just feeling like relaxing, I usually sit on the rockers or the ball chairs or the beanbag chairs,\u201d Jennings, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class last spring, explained. \u201cBut if I want to be really, really focused, then I usually feel like going on something a little harder so that I don\u2019t lose concentration.\u201dSitting in her local Starbucks in West Fargo, Ms. Delzer noted: \u201cIf you Google \u2018Starbucks Classroom,\u2019 it\u2019s a thing now.\u201dBut Ms. Delzer said she did not start out seeking to influence the practice of teaching. It was serendipity, she said, and an iPad experiment.In 2011, Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, in Thief River Falls, Minn., bought a few iPads and asked her to try using them in class. Two years later, her school\u2019s technology director suggested that they speak at an education conference about her experiment.That was when Ms. Delzer realized, she said, that by addressing her peers, she could reach vastly more students.\u201cI see the ripple effect on teachers who leave the conference,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really gratifying to know that those classrooms are better because of it.\u201dToday, so many teachers from other districts want to visit her classroom that Mapleton Elementary has set aside every Tuesday to host them. \u201cWe limit it to four teachers a day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.One morning last spring, Ms. Delzer assigned her third graders a math problem to solve on their iPads using Seesaw. Developed by two former Facebook product managers, Seesaw lets students produce and share their schoolwork as written notes, diagrams, audio recordings or videos.Some children love the sharing aspect. \u201cThey can see what you are doing now that we have Seesaw,\u201d McCoy, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class, said of his parents. \u201cOther years they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they were only able to see on your papers.\u201dTeaching, by nature, is a helping profession. And educators have a long tradition of sharing ideas with colleagues.Ms. Delzer said she did not see a conflict between her teaching and other activities. She said she deliberately divided her work, devoting herself to her students during school hours while giving conference talks on days off and working with companies on some school nights.\u201cIt\u2019s really important to keep the two things separate,\u201d she said.She added that she worked only with companies whose products she personally believed in. Those relationships, she said, gave her valuable access to resources that could benefit her students, colleagues and teacher followers.\u201cIf I am going to put my name on it, it either has to make learning better for students or teaching better for teachers,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.But companies that tap public-school teachers to use or promote their products in exchange for perks are effectively engaging the educators as consultants \u2014 a situation that could conflict with teachers\u2019 obligations to their employer: schools.\u201cVendors offering free technology to teachers for their personal or professional use in exchange for teachers promoting it to students or other teachers is a very questionable activity,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.Tim Jacobson, the principal of Mapleton Elementary School, where Ms. Delzer teaches, offered a different view. He described the company-teacher relationships as mutually beneficial for schools and industry. After Ms. Delzer developed a relationship with Seesaw, he noted, the company gave every Mapleton teacher a premium subscription and training sessions.\u201cIt\u2019s a real advantage when she comes back and she shares with us what she sees happening at the forefront of education,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said. \u201cPlus, it is good recognition for Mapleton Elementary School. We do a lot of things you wouldn\u2019t expect in a school of our size.\u201dMr. Sjogreen, the Seesaw co-founder, said that his company\u2019s ambassador program did not pay teachers and that its premium software was not valuable enough to be a draw for them.\u201cThere is nothing that we are doing really to incentivize teachers to become ambassadors,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the extent that they give us great feedback and help us spread the word, we are happy to support them to become more knowledgeable.\u201dOne evening last spring, Mr. Provenzano, the English teacher and tech company ambassador, came home from school and went downstairs to his basement.He had just finished teaching \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d in his English classes at Grosse Pointe South, a public high school in a Detroit suburb. And he had given his students an unusual choice of assignments: They could make traditional class presentations, or use computer-assisted design software to draft objects illustrating themes from the novel.Now, he used a $1,299 3-D printer sent to him by Dremel, a tool brand for which he is an ambassador, to turn his students\u2019 designs into three-dimensional objects. He printed one student\u2019s design, a gavel, representing the struggle for justice in the novel.Mr. Provenzano also blogs and gives conference presentations to teachers, sharing interesting ways that he uses the 3-D printers. \u201cI feel comfortable saying teachers have bought Dremel because of me,\u201d he said.This teacher-influencer soft sell may be new in schools. But researchers who study medical marketing recognize it from techniques used for years by the pharmaceutical industry.If the ed-tech industry is now replicating these strategies, it is because, at least in medicine, they work.But there has been little public discussion about the ramifications of similar tech industry cultivation of teachers.Mr. Provenzano said he did not see a conflict of interest between his teaching and industry affiliations, noting that his blog prominently listed his company affiliations. He added that school districts often hired him to train their teachers precisely because his industry relationships had helped him become an expert.He left his public-school teaching job over the summer and started a position as director of maker spaces at a nearby private school. \u201cThese ambassadorships helped me get this job,\u201d Mr. Provenzano said.Among other things, the document said the company would provide a 3-D printer in exchange for a teacher\u2019s developing at least one four-minute video tutorial every other month featuring a classroom project using the device. It required the teacher to give Dremel-related presentations at two or more conferences. The document, as written, also included a noncompete clause prohibiting teachers from working with other 3-D printing companies.And Professor Reidenberg of Fordham Law pointed out that the document reviewed by The Times would give Dremel the right to settle any legal claims arising from the teacher\u2019s work, while making the teacher liable for legal costs. \u201cThis clause could bankrupt the teacher,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.Linda Beckmeyer, a spokeswoman for Bosch, the maker of Dremel, said its contract with teachers was confidential and declined to discuss its terms.\u201cThe purpose of the ambassador program is to advance the maker movement in education by giving teachers and students access to 3-D printing,\u201d she said.The Kittsona staff greeted her like a V.I.P.Last year, the store\u2019s owners agreed to outfit Ms. Delzer free of charge after she asked them to sponsor her in exchange for her tagging Kittsona on social media. Now, a stylist rushed about, picking out cute sleeveless dresses, embroidered tunics, layered necklaces and suede bootees for the teacher to try on.Kittsona ran several promotions this year in which Ms. Delzer offered her Instagram followers a store discount. Each one directly resulted in 50 to 100 sales, said Nicole Johnson, Kittsona\u2019s co-owner.It was an indication, she said, that young working women were responding to Ms. Delzer\u2019s ambitious-but-approachable schoolteacher brand. \u201cWe are not all Kim Kardashians,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.An hour or so later, Ms. Delzer left the boutique laden with shopping bags. But her working day was hardly done.After dinner, Ms. Delzer installed herself at her kitchen counter. Dozens of emails from companies, conferences, publishers and teacher fans on social media needed responses.Ms. Delzer recalled how, when she was starting out a few years ago, some veteran teacher influencers snubbed her. Tonight, she would try to respond to as many requests as possible. \u201cI just drink a lot of coffee,\u201d she said.If her Top Dog Teaching fans nationwide love her, so do her third graders. One reason is that she often treats them like budding adults.Every fall, for instance, Ms. Delzer holds a social media boot camp to teach her students how to run the class Instagram and Twitter accounts. She teaches them rules like \u201cnever share your password\u201d and helps them understand how to maintain an upbeat online image.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to post something bad,\u201d McCoy, the third grader, said, \u201cbecause if you want a job, those people are probably going to look at your social media page and they are going to decide if they\u2019ll let you have the job.\u201dLest they forget, a sign on the classroom wall reminded students and teacher alike: \u201cI am building my digital footprint every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lego Will Cut 1,400 Jobs as Profit Dips, Despite Big-Screen Heroics", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo hold children\u2019s attention, Lego has enlisted the help of Batman, Darth Vader and Harry Potter. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be enough.The toy company said on Tuesday that it would cut 1,400 jobs after earnings showed its revenue and profit both fell in the first half of the year. The results come as Lego faces an increasingly competitive landscape. More children use mobile devices for entertainment, leaving Lego to battle not just its traditional rivals like Mattel and Hasbro, but technology companies like Sony and Microsoft, the owner of \u201cMinecraft,\u201d and video game giants like Nintendo and Activision Blizzard.With its little plastic bricks \u2014 building blocks in children\u2019s hands but a bane of parents\u2019 feet \u2014 the company, based in Billund, Denmark, has grown into a global empire. But its struggles mirror the challenges facing toymakers that are seeking new revenue streams as growth slows in traditionally lucrative markets. Mattel, the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, went as far as to poach a Google executive to be its C.E.O. in a bid to reshape itself.Lego on Tuesday reported a 3 percent decline in net profit for the first six months of the year compared with the same period in 2016, falling to 3.4 billion Danish krone, or about $544 million, from 3.5 billion Danish krone. Revenue fell 5 percent to 14.9 billion Danish krone, from 15.7 billion Danish krone.In an interview, the chairman of Lego, Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, said it would take about two years for the business to return to growth, and he said that the job cuts, which equate to around 8 percent of the company\u2019s total work force, were necessary because Lego had become an unwieldy operation.\u201cA bit of bureaucracy has sneaked into what was quite an entrepreneurial organization,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has crept in on us and we want to root it out.\u201dLego had pulled itself out of a slump more than 10 years ago with an overhaul of the company. Since then, it has been growing apace, but its popularity has long been built off its classic collections, like the Lego City, Duplo and Technic lines.As the company has faced increased competition from other construction toy makers like Mega Brands, as well as a wider array of entertainment available for children, it has sought to sign licensing deals and other agreements to attract new forms of revenue.And when children do go shopping for toys, Lego often misses out on impulse buys, said Lutz Muller, an analyst focused on toys at Klosters Trading Corporation. \u201cThe buyers have a fixed amount of shelf space,\u201d Mr. Muller said. \u201cThey say to Lego, \u2018You already have all this shelf space in the construction aisle, we can\u2019t give you more shelf space in the action figure aisle.\u2019 \u201dLego\u2019s more established markets were expected to run out of steam eventually, said Matthew Hudak, senior toys and games analyst at Euromonitor International, a market researcher. And Lego will still have to grapple with mobile devices becoming a much bigger competitor for the attention of a demographic that can be fickle in its tastes, he said.The key will be to make sure that whatever children are doing on their mobile devices has some link to the toys being sold by Lego. \u201cAt the end of the day, they still have to try and keep themselves within the popular licenses,\u201d Mr. Hudak said. \u201cAll companies are competing with smartphones. So it\u2019s about partnering with the right ones.\u201dLego has also tried to lean heavily on faster growth in China, expanding its office in Shanghai to 200 employees this year, up from 80 in 2014.\u201cIn a market like China, where there\u2019s an emerging middle class that\u2019s becoming urbanized, moving into cities, it presents a growth opportunity,\u201d Mr. Knudstorp said.That has come as toy sales in Europe have fallen off \u2014 from $45 billion in 2014 to $40.5 billion last year \u2014 while sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew to $65 billion in that same period, from $57 billion, according to Euromonitor.The company has done well marketing its products as educational tools, said Mr. Hudak, and tapping into the aspirations that middle-class parents in China have for their children. Lego sells a range of learning products, including its latest robotics kit, Lego Boost, which is intended to teach coding to children ages 7 to 12. \u201cParents are starting to afford this more and they\u2019re using toys as more developmental tools,\u201d Mr. Hudak said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Amazon Pushes Forward With Robots, Workers Find New Roles", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFLORENCE, N.J. \u2014 Nissa Scott started working at the cavernous Amazon warehouse in southern New Jersey late last year, stacking plastic bins the size of small ottomans. It was not, she says, the most stimulating activity. And lifting the bins, which often weigh 25 pounds each, was also tiring over 10-hour shifts.Now Ms. Scott, 21, watches her replacement \u2014 a giant, bright yellow mechanical arm \u2014 do the stacking.Her new job at Amazon is to babysit several robots at a time, troubleshooting them when necessary and making sure they have bins to load. On a recent afternoon, a claw at end of the arm grabbed a bin off a conveyor belt and stacked it on another bin, forming neat columns on wooden pallets surrounding the robot. It was the first time Amazon had shown the arm, the latest generation of robots in use at its warehouses, to a reporter.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the most mentally challenging thing we have here,\u201d Ms. Scott said of her new job. \u201cIt\u2019s not repetitive.\u201dComplicating the equation even more, Amazon is also on the forefront of automation, finding new ways of getting robots to do the work once handled by employees. In 2014, the company began rolling out robots to its warehouses using machines originally developed by Kiva Systems, a company Amazon bought for $775 million two years earlier and renamed Amazon Robotics. Amazon now has more than 100,000 robots in action around the world, and it has plans to add many more to the mix.The robots make warehouse work less tedious and physically taxing, while also enabling the kinds of efficiency gains that let a customer order dental floss after breakfast and receive it before dinner.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that Amazon would not be able to operate at the costs they have and the costs they provide customers without this automation,\u201d said Martin Ford, a futurist and author of \u201cRise of the Robots,\u201d a book about automation. \u201cMaybe we wouldn\u2019t be getting two-day shipping.\u201dThe dynamics between people and machines play out on a daily basis on the floor of Amazon warehouses in places like Florence, N.J., and Kent, Wash. In Kent, the robots vaguely resemble giant beetles and scurry around with vertical shelves loaded with merchandise weighing up to 3,000 pounds on their backs. Hundreds of them move autonomously inside a large caged area, tailgating each other but not colliding.On one edge of the cage, a group of human workers \u2014 the \u201cstowers\u201d \u2014 stuff products onto the shelves, replenishing their inventory. The robots whisk those shelves away and when a customer order arrives for products stored on their backs, they queue up at stations on another edge of the cage like cars waiting to go through a toll both.There, human \u201cpickers\u201d follow instructions on computer screens, grabbing items off the shelves and putting them in plastic bins, which then disappear on conveyor belts destined for \u201cpackers,\u201d people who put the products in cardboard boxes bound for customers.Dave Clark, the top executive in charge of operations at Amazon, said the company wanted the machines to perform the most monotonous tasks, leaving people to do jobs that engage them mentally.\"It\u2019s a new item each time,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cYou\u2019re finding something, you\u2019re inspecting things, you\u2019re engaging your mind in a way that I think is important.\"The robots also cut down on the walking required of workers, making Amazon pickers more efficient and less tired. The robots also allow Amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic, because they no longer need aisle space for humans. The greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof, which means better selection for customers.The Amazon warehouse in Florence shows the latest example of the kinds of jobs machines can do better than people. Eight mechanical arms are in operation at the facility, a warehouse where large quantities of merchandise are broken down into smaller units and distributed to Amazon fulfillment centers across the country.Amazon began installing them late last year, not long after it opened the warehouse in Florence. The robot arm is configured to pick up only bins of a standard size, not objects of other dimensions. In a demonstration of future possibilities, Amazon showed a virtual reality simulation used to prototype new robot concepts, including an arm with a forklift attachment that moved pallets.When Amazon installed the robots, some people who had stacked bins before, like Ms. Scott, took courses at the company to become robot operators. Many others moved to receiving stations, where they manually sort big boxes of merchandise into bins. No people were laid off when the robots were installed, and Amazon found new roles for the displaced workers, Mr. Clark said.\u201cThe people didn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he said.The question going forward is: What happens when the future generations of robots arrive?Mr. Ford, the author, believes it is just a matter of time before the employment picture in Amazon\u2019s warehouses changes.\u201cMy assumption is this technology will eventually displace a lot of people in those warehouses,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cI would not say that overnight huge numbers of jobs disappear. Maybe the first indication is they don\u2019t get rid of those people but the pace of job creation slows down.\u201dAmazon\u2019s Mr. Clark said history showed that automation increases productivity and, in some cases, demand from consumers, which ultimately creates more jobs. He said warehouse workers would continue to work in technologically rich environments.\u201cIt\u2019s a myth that automation destroys net job growth,\u201d he said.In the case of the Florence facility, it opened up the new opportunity for Ms. Scott.At one point, one of the arms knocked over a tote, sending a dozen or so cone-shaped plastic coffee filters skidding across the ground. Ms. Scott hit a button that froze the arm so she could safely pick up the mess.Then the arms started working again.\u201cThe robot will work the same all day long,\u201d said Edward Cohoon, who supervises Ms. Scott and other Amazon workers as they tend to individual robots. \u201cTheir stomachs don\u2019t grumble.\u201dEarlier versions of the captions for the pictures of a robotic arm in Florence, N.J., and human \u201cpickers\u201d were reversed.Follow Nick Wingfield on Twitter @nickwingfield.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Begin Legal Assault on Trump\u2019s Move to End \u2018Dreamer\u2019 Program", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s immigration policies faced a renewed legal onslaught on Wednesday, as a coalition of Democratic attorneys general, nonprofit groups and private companies announced they would oppose his rollback of Obama-era protections for people who entered the country illegally as children.In an echo of the campaign against Mr. Trump\u2019s effort this year to ban travelers from parts of the Muslim world, a group of 16 attorneys general \u2014 all Democrats \u2014 filed suit in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, claiming that Mr. Trump had improperly upended the policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA.Led by Attorneys General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Bob Ferguson of Washington, they alleged Mr. Trump\u2019s shift was driven by racial animus toward Mexican Americans and that the Trump administration failed to follow federal rules governing executive policy making.On Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration would phase out DACA beginning next March. The decision came as a group of Republican attorneys general threatened to sue the administration if it did not end the program.Announcing the legal challenge Wednesday alongside a crowd of young immigrants and immigration advocates, Mr. Schneiderman accused the Trump administration of using the threat of lawsuits as a \u201cpretext\u201d that hid the president\u2019s true motives: bias against immigrants and Latinos.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s lawsuit said that \u201cending DACA, whose participants are mostly of Mexican origin, is a culmination of President Trump\u2019s oft-stated commitments \u2014 whether personally held, stated to appease some portion of his constituency, or some combination thereof \u2014 to punish and disparage people with Mexican roots.\u201dIn an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Schneiderman said, \u201cWe think the court will take a look at what\u2019s behind the change in policy and conclude that the rationales offered yesterday don\u2019t make any sense.\u201dAdditional lawsuits are expected: Attorney General Xavier Becerra of California, a Democrat, intends to file a separate challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s plans, according to people briefed on his plans. Several major companies intend to join the lawsuits, and two, Microsoft and Amazon, have pledged to pay the legal expenses of any employees who become vulnerable to deportation.The loosely coordinated legal strategy faces uncertain prospects, and may represent a kind of precautionary measure for supporters of DACA, who are also engaged in a ferocious campaign aimed at spurring Congress to pass a law protecting people in the program from deportation. The litigation is likely to become a political rallying point for opponents of Mr. Trump, and should the legislative effort fizzle, a court challenge could become an alternative vehicle to derail or delay his policies.To some extent, the court battle could reproduce some of the arguments surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s travel restrictions, pitting the traditionally sweeping powers of the presidency against claims that this particular administration, on a specific matter of policy, had misused its authority.But presidents typically have broad discretion in matters related to national security and border control, and legal opponents of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy are in the awkward position of arguing that while President Barack Obama had the presidential authority to create DACA, Mr. Trump does not have the authority to freely undo it. And the government can also assert that undercutting Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to rescind the program would impinge on his power to enforce immigration law.Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, said Mr. Obama\u2019s program was always going to be vulnerable to the whims of his successor.\u201cIt\u2019d be rather curious if President Trump could not use the same authority that President Obama used to create DACA,\u201d Mr. Turley said. Echoing conservative arguments that Mr. Obama had overstepped his power, he added: \u201cThis is a problem you have when you ignore the constitutional structure. This matter should\u2019ve always remained in Congress.\u201dBesides the argument that the Trump administration has violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution, the lawsuit filed Wednesday makes a more complex claim, saying that the administration failed to follow the right process, under the Administrative Procedure Act, for shutting down Mr. Obama\u2019s program.The states argue that DACA had become so entrenched in the immigration system that to abruptly end it was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d and that such a U-turn demanded a better explanation than what administration officials offered on Tuesday.\u201cNumerous public officials from both political parties have reinforced the federal government\u2019s promise to provide continuity and fair treatment to DACA grantees, and have recognized that DACA grantees have relied on the government\u2019s representations in applying for DACA,\u201d the lawsuit said.Michael J. Wishnie, a professor at Yale Law School who is helping to sue the administration on behalf of a DACA recipient in a separate lawsuit, said officials were, of course, allowed to change a policy.\u201cBut when people have come to rely on it,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have to explain themselves.\u201dAndrew J. Pincus, a Washington-based lawyer who has argued frequently before the Supreme Court, suggested Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to DACA might be vulnerable in court, in part because he had done relatively little to justify it as a matter of policy.The Trump administration has cast its withdrawal of Mr. Obama\u2019s policy largely as a matter of legal necessity, arguing that DACA would be unlikely to survive the expected challenge from Republican attorneys general. Devin O\u2019Malley, a spokesman for the Justice Department, defended the DACA announcement as a corrective to Obama administration overreach.\u201cWhile the plaintiffs in today\u2019s lawsuits may believe that an arbitrary circumvention of Congress is lawful, the Department of Justice looks forward to defending this administration\u2019s position,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley said.But Mr. Pincus said that if a court finds the underlying DACA policy is legal, it could unravel that rationale.\u201cThe whole basis for rescinding DACA is the conclusion that it\u2019s illegal,\u201d said Mr. Pincus, who is a supporter of the Obama administration policy. \u201cIf you\u2019re wrong, your decision is arbitrary and an abuse of discretion.\u201dIn the short term, the legal offensive may help galvanize further political opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, offering activists, businesses and other interest groups a way of magnifying their objections through court filings and placing additional pressure on lawmakers to act. A number of private companies, including Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks, have filed or are expected to file briefs supporting the multistate lawsuit.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, indicated the company would use its considerable resources to oppose Mr. Trump\u2019s policy in other ways: He said in a blog post on Tuesday that Microsoft would pay for the legal costs of any employee the government threatens to deport, and the company said in a legal document that 39 DACA beneficiaries were \u201cemployees or current or recent interns.\u201dLike Microsoft, Amazon said it intended to pay for legal representation for its affected employees, and stated in a legal filing on Wednesday that it had identified nine employees who qualified.Several state attorneys general said they were taking steps to thwart Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy in other ways. Mr. Schneiderman said his most immediate concern was to protect the sensitive information immigrants had supplied to the government while applying for DACA status, including addresses and fingerprints.Immigration officials said on Tuesday that information would not be \u201cproactively\u201d used to arrest the immigrants after DACA expires but could be made available for criminal and national security investigations.Mr. Becerra said the forthcoming litigation from his office would be one part of a larger strategy to marshal resistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s in the court of law or in the court of public opinion, we\u2019re going to fight,\u201d Mr. Becerra said.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting from Seattle.Advertisement"}

Nick Wingfield, a technology reporter based in Seattle, discussed the tech he is using.You cover Amazon and Microsoft. Do you use their technology?The one technology constant in my career as a journalist seems to be Microsoft Word. I take notes for all of my stories in it on a MacBook Pro. I\u2019ve tried Google Docs and OneNote, but can\u2019t stick with them for reasons I can\u2019t explain. I have a feeling I might be cremated with a copy of Microsoft Word.What do or don\u2019t you like about their tech products that you use?I find some of the things you can do on the Echo pretty silly and much easier on a smartphone app. I\u2019ll give you an example. A while back I was installing a sprinkler system in my garden that was connected to a wireless control unit. I found out I could use the control unit with Alexa to turn on the sprinklers with my voice.What are your favorite websites, apps or other tech tools for keeping on top of technology news?I get so much of my news diet, technology or otherwise, through Twitter and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. I have configured my phone to send me a text message every time Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, tweets because he\u2019ll occasionally make news that way.What tech gadgets or apps are you or your family currently obsessed with and why?I am a contrarian on the Apple Watch, which I believe has been unfairly maligned by tech pundits. I love mine, and I get pretty frustrated by a lot of Apple products. I\u2019m a runner and cyclist and track all of my workouts with it. I use Siri on the watch to respond to text messages.Apple somehow managed to create a wearable device versatile enough that you can wear it on a run and with a suit. That\u2019s impressive.Are there technologies that you\u2019re not crazy about?I\u2019ve never cared for reading books on screens, even though I almost exclusively read newspapers and magazines on my phone and computer.I don\u2019t play video games. My son does. I\u2019m embarrassed to say he spent a decent chunk of the summer wasting bad guys in Call of Duty. He also read a big stack of books and is a sweet, sensitive kid, which is how he got away with it.What\u2019s your advice about how much or how little kids should be on their devices and on games? This is such a difficult issue. Most of my daughter\u2019s homework is on a computer so policing her screen time is really about limiting certain applications or websites. The other day I gave her a hard time when I heard her listening to YouTube. It was for her Spanish class.Overall, I try to encourage personal responsibility rather than hassle my kids all the time about their devices. It has worked so far.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Understand Rising Inequality, Consider the Janitors at Two Top Companies, Then and Now", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsROCHESTER \u2014 Gail Evans and Marta Ramos have one thing in common: They have each cleaned offices for one of the most innovative, profitable and all-around successful companies in the United States.For Ms. Evans, that meant being a janitor in Building 326 at Eastman Kodak\u2019s campus in Rochester in the early 1980s. For Ms. Ramos, that means cleaning at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., in the present day.In the 35 years between their jobs as janitors, corporations across America have flocked to a new management theory: Focus on core competence and outsource the rest. The approach has made companies more nimble and more productive, and delivered huge profits for shareholders. It has also fueled inequality and helps explain why many working-class Americans are struggling even in an ostensibly healthy economy.The $16.60 per hour Ms. Ramos earns as a janitor at Apple works out to about the same in inflation-adjusted terms as what Ms. Evans earned 35 years ago. But that\u2019s where the similarities end.Ms. Evans was a full-time employee of Kodak. She received more than four weeks of paid vacation per year, reimbursement of some tuition costs to go to college part time, and a bonus payment every March. When the facility she cleaned was shut down, the company found another job for her: cutting film.Ms. Ramos is an employee of a contractor that Apple uses to keep its facilities clean. She hasn\u2019t taken a vacation in years, because she can\u2019t afford the lost wages. Going back to school is similarly out of reach. There are certainly no bonuses, nor even a remote possibility of being transferred to some other role at Apple.Yet the biggest difference between their two experiences is in the opportunities they created. A manager learned that Ms. Evans was taking computer classes while she was working as a janitor and asked her to teach some other employees how to use spreadsheet software to track inventory. When she eventually finished her college degree in 1987, she was promoted to a professional-track job in information technology.Less than a decade later, Ms. Evans was chief technology officer of the whole company, and she has had a long career since as a senior executive at other top companies. Ms. Ramos sees the only advancement possibility as becoming a team leader keeping tabs on a few other janitors, which pays an extra 50 cents an hour.They both spent a lot of time cleaning floors. The difference is, for Ms. Ramos, that work is also a ceiling.Eastman Kodak was one of the technological giants of the 20th century, a dominant seller of film, cameras and other products. It made its founders unfathomably wealthy and created thousands of high-income jobs for executives, engineers and other white-collar professionals. The same is true of Apple today.\u201cThink about the contrast between George Eastman, who pioneered fundamental innovations in photography, and Steve Jobs,\u201d Mr. Summers wrote in 2014. \u201cWhile Eastman\u2019s innovations and their dissemination through the Eastman Kodak Co. provided a foundation for a prosperous middle class in Rochester for generations, no comparable impact has been created by Jobs\u2019s innovations\u201d at Apple.Ms. Evans\u2019s pathway was unusual: Few low-level workers, even in the heyday of postwar American industry, ever made it to the executive ranks of big companies. But when Kodak and similar companies were in their prime, tens of thousands of machine operators, warehouse workers, clerical assistants and the like could count on steady work and good benefits that are much rarer today.Part of the wild success of the Silicon Valley giants of today \u2014 and what makes their stocks so appealing to investors \u2014 has come from their ability to attain huge revenue and profits with relatively few workers.Apple, Alphabet (parent of Google) and Facebook generated $333 billion of revenue combined last year with 205,000 employees worldwide. In 1993, three of the most successful, technologically oriented companies based in the Northeast \u2014 Kodak, IBM and AT&T \u2014 needed more than three times as many employees, 675,000, to generate 27 percent less in inflation-adjusted revenue.Many of the professional jobs from those companies in the 1980s and \u201990s have close parallels today. The high-paying positions setting corporate strategy, developing experimental technologies and shaping marketing campaigns would look similar in either era.But a generation ago, big companies also more often directly employed people who installed products, moved goods around warehouses, worked as security guards and performed many of the other jobs needed to get products into the hands of consumers.In part, fewer of these kinds of workers are needed in an era when software plays such a big role. The lines of code that make an iPhone\u2019s camera work can be created once, then instantly transmitted across the globe, whereas each roll of film had to be manufactured and physically shipped. And companies face brutal global competition; if they don\u2019t keep their work force lean, they risk losing to a competitor that does.But major companies have also chosen to bifurcate their work force, contracting out much of the labor that goes into their products to other companies, which compete by lowering costs. It\u2019s not just janitors and security guards. In Silicon Valley, the people who test operating systems for bugs, review social media posts that may violate guidelines, and screen thousands of job applications are unlikely to receive a paycheck directly from the company they are ultimately working for.\u201cWe\u2019re responsible for creating over two million jobs in the U.S., across all 50 states,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, \u201cranging from construction, customer care, retail and engineering to app development, manufacturing, operations and trucking. All Apple employees, whether full time or part time, are eligible for benefits and stock grants. We\u2019re also fortunate to have skilled contractors that contribute to our products and services daily, along with over 9,000 suppliers in every state.\u201dPerhaps the biggest indictment of the more paternalistic approach taken by an earlier generation of corporate behemoths is that, Kodak, despite having been an early innovator in digital photography, is a shell of its former self. After a bankruptcy and many years of layoffs, the company now has only 2,700 employees in the United States and 6,100 worldwide.The same forces that explain the difference between 1980s Kodak and today\u2019s Apple have big implications not just for every blue-collar employee who punches a timecard, but also for white-collar professionals who swipe a badge.Phil Harnden was coming out of the Navy in 1970 when he applied for a job at Kodak, and soon was operating a forklift in a warehouse. He made $3 an hour, equivalent to $20 an hour today adjusted for inflation. That is roughly what an entry-level contracting job testing software pays.The difference between the two gigs, aside from the absence of heavy machinery in Apple\u2019s sleek offices, is the sense of permanence. Mr. Harnden put in 16 years operating forklifts before he left in 1986 to move to Florida. When he returned 10 years later, he was quickly rehired and even kept his seniority benefits.In interviews, tech industry contractors in Silicon Valley describe a culture of transience. They can end up commuting to a different office park that houses a new company every few months; in many cases 18 months is the maximum a contractor is allowed to spend at one company.\u201cI would rather have stability,\u201d said Christopher Kohl, 29, who has worked as a contractor at several Silicon Valley companies, including a stint doing quality assurance on Apple Maps. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful to find a new job every 12 to 18 months.\u201dFor Silicon Valley\u2019s contracting class, there are reminders large and small of their second-class status. Contractors generally do not receive the stock options that have made some midlevel Silicon Valley workers wealthy over the years, nor the generous paid time off for vacation, illness or the birth of a child. The health insurance plans tend to be stingier than those that the tech giants they serve provide for their direct employees.The smaller reminders can be just as telling. One former Apple contractor recalled spending months testing a new version of Apple\u2019s operating system. To celebrate the release, the Apple employees they\u2019d worked closely with on the project were invited to a splashy party in San Francisco, while the contractors had beers among themselves in a neighborhood pub.The compensation these white-collar contractors receive puts them squarely in the middle rungs of workers in the United States, and the most skilled can make six figures (though that doesn\u2019t go far in the hyper-expensive Bay Area housing market). Apple, based on its consultants\u2019 report, expected to be indirectly responsible for nearly 18,000 jobs in Santa Clara County by now at an average pay of about $56,000 a year.There are some advantages. If they work for one of the companies like Apple or Google that feature a subsidized, high-quality cafeteria, contractors can enjoy the food. They can tell their friends that they work at one of the world\u2019s most admired companies, and enjoy predictable, regular hours. Once in a while, a contractor will be hired into a staff position.\u201cIt\u2019s not evil,\u201d said Pradeep Chauhan, managing partner of OnContracting, a site to help people find tech contracting positions. \u201cThey have a job and they\u2019re getting paid. But it\u2019s not ideal. The problem with contracting is, you could walk in one day and they could say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to come in tomorrow.\u2019 There is no obligation from the companies.\u201dAnd that is the ultimate contrast with the middle-skill, middle-wage jobs of earlier generations of titans \u2014 a sense of permanence, of sharing in the long-term success of the company.\u201cThere were times I wasn\u2019t happy with the place,\u201d Mr. Harnden said of his Kodak years. \u201cBut it was a great company to work for and gave me a good living for a long time.\u201dWhen an automaker needs a supplier of transmissions for its cars, it doesn\u2019t just hold an auction and buy from the lowest bidder. It enters a long-term relationship with the supplier it believes will provide the best quality and price over time. The company\u2019s very future is at stake \u2014 nobody wants to buy a car that can\u2019t reliably shift into first gear.But when that same automaker needs some staplers for the office supply cabinet, it is more likely to seek out the lowest price it can get, pretty much indifferent to the identity of the seller.Labor exists on a similar continuum.The right product engineer or marketing executive can mean the difference between success or failure, and companies tend to hire such people as full-time employees and as part of a long-term relationship \u2014 something like the transmission supplier. What has changed in the last generation is that companies today view more and more of the labor it takes to produce their goods and services as akin to staplers: something to be procured at the time and place needed for the lowest price possible.There\u2019s no inherent reason that work done through a contractor should involve lower compensation than the same work done under direct employment. Sometimes it goes in the other direction; when a company hires a law firm, it is basically contracting out legal work, yet lawyers at a firm tend to be paid better than in-house counsel.But as more companies have outsourced more functions over more time, a strong body of evidence is emerging that it\u2019s not just about efficiency. It seems to be a way for big companies to reduce compensation costs.Firms in the United States are legally required to offer the same health insurance options and 401(k) match to all employees \u2014 meaning if those programs are made extra generous to attract top engineers, a company that doesn\u2019t outsource will have to pay them for everyone.More broadly, there are a whole set of social pressures and worries about morale that encourage companies to be more generous with pay and benefits for employees who are on the same payroll.\u201cThere was an overriding concern about equity,\u201d said Mr. Cobb, the Wharton professor. \u201cFirms would try to set pay so that the gap between the security guard or administrative assistant and senior V.P. wasn\u2019t as great as you might expect, essentially by paying lower- and middle-skill workers more than they were probably worth on the market.\u201dLinda DiStefano applied for a secretarial job at Kodak during Easter week of her senior year in high school in 1968, and was hired to start immediately after her graduation for $87.50 a week, today\u2019s equivalent of $32,000 a year. She put in four decades at the company, first as a secretary, then helped administer corporate travel and other projects.\u201cI helped put on the dinners for the board of directors, which in retrospect someone of my grade shouldn\u2019t have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I had a series of managers who trusted me.\u201dIt bought her a house off Lake Avenue, a new car every few years and occasional long-distance trips to Motown reunion concerts. When her department was abolished in 2008, the travel bookings contracted out, she was making $20 an hour. The best job she could find was as a pharmacy technician at a grocery store for $8.50 an hour.As you drive around Rochester, the role of Eastman Kodak in the city is evident everywhere, in the Kodak Tower that looms over the center of town, in the Eastman Theater on Main Street, and in the hulking buildings and empty parking lots of the manufacturing center known as Kodak Park.In reading the company\u2019s old annual reports, you get a sense that its executives thought of the jobs created and the wages paid as a source of pride and achievement. On the first page of most years\u2019 annual reports was an accounting of how many employees the company had in the United States and worldwide, and the total pay and benefits they received.Apple, with a spaceship-like campus about to open, looms large over Cupertino in its own way, accounting for something like 40 percent of the jobs in the city, and investing $70 million in local environmental and infrastructure upgrades. It is no middle-class enclave; the median home price is $1.9 million.\u201cWe definitely feel a sense of pride to be the home of Apple,\u201d said Savita Vaidhyanathan, the mayor of Cupertino. \u201cBut they consider themselves a global company, not necessarily a Cupertino company.\u201d She said she has never met Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe would have a hard time getting an audience with anybody beyond upper-middle management,\u201d she said.Ms. Ramos, the Apple janitor, lives down the road in San Jose. She pays $2,300 monthly for a two-bedroom apartment where she and her four children live. Before overtime and taxes, her $16.60 an hour works out to $34,520 a year. Her rent alone is $27,600 a year, leaving less than $600 a month once the rent is paid. Overtime, in addition to the wages from one of her teenage children who works part time at a grocery store, helps make the math work, though always tenuously.She works from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. On days when one of the other cleaners doesn\u2019t show up, she may get a few extra hours, which is great for the overtime pay, but it means even less sleep before it is time to take her children to school.A 60-cent-an-hour raise this year negotiated by her union, the SEIU United Service Workers West, helped. Kodak in its prime was not unionized, though in that era when organized labor was more powerful over all, managers deliberately kept wages high to try to prevent the company\u2019s workers from forming one.There is little chance for building connections at Apple. \u201cEveryone is doing their own thing and has their own assignment, and we don\u2019t see each other outside of work,\u201d said Ms. Ramos in Spanish.Ms. Evans, who was a Kodak janitor in the early 1980s before her rise to executive there and at other leading firms like Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, recalls a different experience.\u201cOne thing about Eastman Kodak is they believed in their people,\u201d said Ms. Evans, now chief information officer at Mercer, the human resources consulting giant. \u201cIt was like a family. You always had someone willing to help open a door if you demonstrated that you were willing to commit to growing your skills and become an asset that was valuable for the company.\u201dBut in the 21st-century economy, many millions of workers find themselves excluded from that select group. Rather than being treated as assets that companies seek to invest in, they have become costs to be minimized.Neil Irwin reported from Rochester and Cupertino, Calif.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Mark Zuckerberg \u2018Like\u2019 This Column?", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The idea of Mark Zuckerberg running for president was always sort of scary.But now it\u2019s really scary, given what we\u2019ve discovered about the power of his little invention to warp democracy.All these years, the 33-year-old founder of Facebook has been dismissive of the idea that social media and A.I. could be used for global domination \u2014 or even that they should be regulated.Days after Donald Trump pulled out his disorienting win, Zuckerberg told a tech conference that the contention that fake news had influenced the election was \u201ca pretty crazy idea,\u201d showing a \u201cprofound lack of empathy\u201d toward Trump voters.But all the while, the company was piling up the rubles and turning a blind eye as the Kremlin\u2019s cyber hit men weaponized anti-Hillary bots on Facebook to sway the U.S. election. Russian agents also used Facebook and Twitter trolls, less successfully, to try to upend the French election.Finally on Thursday, speaking on Facebook Live, Zuckerberg said he would give Congress more than 3,000 ads linked to Russia. As one Facebooker posted: \u201cWhy did it take EIGHT MONTHS to get here?\u201dRobert Mueller\u2019s team, as well as House and Senate investigators, are hotly pursuing the trail of Russian fake news. On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security told 21 states, including Wisconsin and Ohio, that Russian agents had tried to hack their elections systems during the campaign.Some lawmakers suspect that the Russians had help in figuring out which women and blacks to target in precincts in Wisconsin and Michigan.Senator Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee looking into Russia\u2019s intervention in 2016, has a suspect in mind. \u201cPaul Manafort made an awful lot of money coming up with a game plan for how Russian interests could be pushed in Western countries and Western elections,\u201d Heinrich told Vanity Fair.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s C.O.O., apologized for this on Wednesday and promised to fix the ad-buying tools, noting, \u201cWe never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way \u2014 and that is on us.\u201dRoose noted that in addition to the Russian chicanery, \u201cIn Myanmar, activists are accusing Facebook of censoring Rohingya Muslims, who are under attack from the country\u2019s military. In Africa, the social network faces accusations that it helped human traffickers extort victims\u2019 families by leaving up abusive videos.\u201dThe Sandberg admission was also game, set and match for Elon Musk, who has been sounding the alarm for years about the danger of Silicon Valley\u2019s creations and A.I. mind children getting out of control and hurting humanity. His pleas for safeguards and regulations have been mocked as \u201chysterical\u201d and \u201cpretty irresponsible\u201d by Zuckerberg.Zuckerberg, whose project last year was building a Jarvis-style A.I. butler for his home, likes to paint himself as an optimist and Musk as a doomsday prophet. But Sandberg\u2019s comment shows that Musk is right: The digerati at Facebook and Google are either being na\u00efve or cynical and greedy in thinking that it\u2019s enough just to have a vague code of conduct that says \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d as Google does.In July, the chief of Tesla and SpaceX told a meeting of governors that they should adopt A.I. legislation before robots start \u201cgoing down the street killing people.\u201d In August, he tweeted that A.I. going rogue represents \u201cvastly more risk than North Korea.\u201d And in September, he tweeted out a Gizmodo story headlined \u201cHackers Have Already Started to Weaponize Artificial Intelligence,\u201d reporting that researchers proved that A.I. hackers were better than humans at getting Twitter users to click on malicious links.(Musk also tweeted that it was a cautionary tale when Microsoft\u2019s chatbot, Tay, had to be swiftly shut down when Twitter users taught her how to reply with racist, misogynistic and anti-Semitic slurs, talking approvingly about Hitler.)Vladimir Putin has denied digital meddling in the U.S. elections. But he understands the possibilities and threat of A.I. In a recent address, the Russian president told schoolchildren, \u201cWhoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\u201d Musk agreed on Twitter that competition for A.I. superiority would be the \u201cmost likely cause of WW3.\u201dOn Thursday, touring the Moscow tech firm Yandex, Putin asked the company\u2019s chief how long it would be before superintelligent robots \u201ceat us.\u201dZuckerberg scoffs at such apocalyptic talk. His project this year was visiting all 50 states, a trip designed by former Obama strategist David Plouffe, which sparked speculation that he might be the next billionaire to seek the Oval Office.Yep.

Pinnacle Faster Than His Counterparts", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt McVay\u2019s age, most current head coaches were unheralded assistants. Three were playing football. One was selling IBM software.And when the Rams start their season on Sunday, McVay, 31, faces a challenge that could frazzle even the most grizzled coach: The Rams went 4-12 last year and have not had a winning season since 2003. Defensive tackle Aaron Donald, one of the league\u2019s best players, ended a six-week holdout on Saturday but is still seeking a gargantuan contract. Quarterback Jared Goff, the No. 1 pick in last year\u2019s draft, averaged only 155 passing yards per game while the Rams lost all seven of his starts.Being a young coach guarantees neither success nor failure. Don Shula, John Madden and Jon Gruden were all hired before they turned 35, and they all won Super Bowls. Lane Kiffin, Raheem Morris and Eric Mangini were recent wunderkinds turned washouts.Gruden quarterbacked the Tampa Bay Storm to an Arena Football League title four times, but he showed no mercy against them in 1998, his first year as a coach. His team, the Orlando Predators, intercepted six passes in a 62-31 victory, the third-largest rout in ArenaBowl history.Washington finished 26th in points per game in 2011, Shanahan\u2019s second season as the Redskins\u2019 offensive coordinator.

In 1983, the Giants finished 3-12-1 \u2014 their worst record in a 16-game season \u2014 despite the presence of Belichick, the linebackers coach, and his star pupil, Lawrence Taylor.As defensive coordinator, Fox was not to blame for Pittsburgh\u2019s 5-5-1 finish in 1986. The Panthers lost games in which they allowed 10, 14 and 19 points. \u201cHe almost really didn\u2019t even have a script,\u201d the all-American defensive end Tony Woods said of Fox. \u201cHe could dissect the offense like nobody\u2019s business. He just knew what the offense was about to do.\u201dMany coaches can tell a defensive back how to backpedal efficiently, to avoid staring into the backfield, to catch the ball at the highest point. But Carroll was a hands-on defensive coordinator at North Carolina State. \u201cHe was running routes,\u201d said Dee Dee Hoggard, a starting cornerback in 1982. \u201cHe would jump into drills and say, \u2018This is how you get it done.\u2019 He had some energy and he had some fire.\u201dGeorgia Tech failed to make its fourth straight appearance in a New Year\u2019s Day bowl game in 2000, but Joe Burns still celebrated his growth under O\u2019Brien, the running backs coach. \u201cMost people who watch film look at themselves,\u201d Burns said, \u201cbut he taught me to watch what the defense was doing, what the safeties were doing before the play.\u201dThe consummate backup quarterback, Pederson spent seven seasons watching Green Bay\u2019s Brett Favre gambol across Lambeau Field. But Pederson set a career high with 1,276 passing yards in 1999, when he rolled out a nine-game red carpet for Donovan McNabb, the No. 2 pick by the Eagles.After almost a decade chasing down opponents as a Bears linebacker, Rivera started tracking Chicago story lines in 1993 for \u201cSports Central,\u201d a sports talk show on WGN Radio. \u201cRonnie would go over stats, crunch the numbers, he would prep,\u201d said Glen Kozlowski, who worked alongside Rivera in both jobs, adding, \u201cHe always had his information in line, and always wanted to get the little details right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Best Investment Since 1926? Apple", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe iPhone helped to catapult Apple into its position as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company. But now Apple has another and, arguably, more exalted stock market distinction.In the history of the markets since 1926, Apple has generated more profit for investors than any other American company.But a relative handful of stocks are extraordinary performers. Only 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks account for all of the net wealth earned by investors in the stock market since 1926, he has found. A mere 30 stocks account for 30 percent of the net wealth generated by stocks in that long period, and 50 stocks account for 40 percent of the net wealth.In a phone conversation, Professor Bessembinder reminded me that the stock market is a moving target and that his rankings, while valid through the end of 2016, don\u2019t capture the sharp movements of this calendar year. In his 2016 rankings, Exxon Mobil, not Apple, appears at the top, with net wealth creation of more than $1 trillion. Apple lags at about $745 billion.But it has been a wild year. Exxon Mobil shares have declined more than 11 percent at a time of weak energy prices, while Apple, which just introduced a raft of new iPhones, is on a spectacular stock surge, gaining more than 37 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that Apple has generated so much wealth in such a short period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cExxon has had decades to pile up those returns.\u201dExxon is among the top wealth-creating companies that have been publicly trading \u2014 under the name of a predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 since the inception of Professor Bessembinder\u2019s tally in July 1926. Others include General Electric, IBM, Altria, Coca-Cola, DuPont, PepsiCo and Schlumberger.General Motors, for example, ranks eighth. It was publicly traded in 1926, but the list says it ceased to exist in June 2009. A company called General Motors exists today, of course, but as Chloe Fu, senior support and relationship manager at the Center for Research in Security Prices, explained it, G.M.\u2019s bailout and bankruptcy led the center to declare the old company terminated, with a new G.M. coming to life in June 2009. Consequently, the new G.M. returns aren\u2019t included in the total for G.M. on the list.The list is a fascinating ranking of big winners in the stock market. But for a variety of technical reasons, it isn\u2019t a straightforward table of the greatest wealth generators in market history. For example, the long-term gains generated by Exxon Mobil and its predecessors are understated because of the database\u2019s limited duration and strict criteria.Exxon Mobil\u2019s wealth in the list doesn\u2019t include Mobil\u2019s, which Professor Bessembinder\u2019s listing says, ceased to exist in November 1999, when it merged with Exxon. And going back further, both Exxon and Mobil were among the descendants of the Standard Oil trust, established by John D. Rockefeller and his partners in the 19th century. The total wealth generated by the cluster of companies derived at least partially from the trust \u2014 which also include Amoco and Chevron \u2014 doesn\u2019t appear in a single notation, because of the list\u2019s logic.Other apparent oddities are explained by Professor Bessembinder\u2019s application of the center\u2019s criteria. There are two companies on the list called AT&T, for example, neither capturing the total net wealth generated by an investment in the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company at its 19th century inception.Other AT&T cousins are on the list: Verizon, as well as Comcast, which resulted from a merger between AT&T Broadband and an older company also known as Comcast.The listings for most of the recently created companies are less tangled.As I wrote in July, Amazon, which started trading in 1997, has soared to the 14th spot. Although it hasn\u2019t been in existence long compared with Exxon Mobil, its annualized return is the highest in the list, 37.4 percent through December. A group of young companies have also had remarkable results.Facebook, which started trading in June 2012, is the youngest on the list, with an annualized return of 34.5 percent. Visa, which had its initial public offering of stock in 2008, is the second-newest company, with a 21 percent annualized return, followed by Alphabet (Google), ranked 11th with a 24.9 percent annualized return.And then there is that great wealth machine, Microsoft, ranked as the third-greatest wealth creator. Since 1986, it has had an annualized return of 25 percent, making its founder, Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, with a net worth of more than $87 billion, according to Bloomberg.No list of wealth-generating companies is complete without Berkshire Hathaway. It ranks 12th, just behind Alphabet, with an annualized return of 22.6 percent. By comparison, Exxon Mobil\u2019s annualized return was only 11.94 percent.Why is Berkshire\u2019s annualized return so much higher?It is because the return doesn\u2019t include decades of mediocre performance for the old textile company Berkshire Hathaway, which started in 1929. The Center for Research says the Berkshire on this list started in November 1976. It was a holding company for Warren E. Buffett, who guided it to fabulous gains. Thanks to Berkshire, Mr. Buffett is a rich man, with a net worth estimated by Bloomberg at $79 billion.Anyone who invested in Apple or Microsoft or, really, in any of these companies at their inception and just held on did extraordinarily well. You might look at that record and conclude that you should just buy the best companies as a foolproof way to get rich.If only it were that easy.How do you find those companies? Not here.\u201cThe problem is, I have no idea which companies will generate the best returns over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, \u201c Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cProbably it will be some companies we\u2019ve never heard of. Maybe it will be companies that don\u2019t even exist now.\u201dThis list is worth studying for understanding the past. But, unfortunately, it\u2019s not a guide to the future, except for this: \u201cIn a market where most of the gains are attributable to a few big winners that are hard to identify in advance,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said, \u201cit makes a lot of sense to diversify your position \u2014 to avoid the danger of omitting the big winners from your portfolio.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Whether his start-up approach is effective is unclear.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn and a billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist, has made a half-dozen or so investments in recent months with a specific aim: to counteract the influence of President Trump.The venture-style investments include starting a new group, Win the Future, whose self-described goal is to make the Democratic Party relevant again. He also invested $1 million in Cortico, a start-up that encourages online discourse between people with opposing political views. And he invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into Vote.org, which has a goal of getting all eligible Americans to vote; Higher Ground Labs, a start-up for progressive politicians; and the Center on Rural Innovation, which is working for economic improvements in rural areas.\u201cMy approach to political investing is the Silicon Valley approach,\u201d Mr. Hoffman, 50, said in an interview. \u201cFind and back powerful entrepreneurs.\u201dBut how effective a Silicon Valley approach to political change can be is a question \u2014 and Mr. Hoffman has experienced stumbling blocks before.In the spring, Mr. Hoffman pumped almost $30 million in new financing into Change.org and installed new board members, to try again.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic about where we can get to,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a bumpy road.\u201dDebra Cleaver, a former Change.org employee who now runs Vote.org, said it was important to pursue innovative ways for achieving change. But, she added, politically driven investments can be more successful when they are \u201ctreated with the same level of accountability\u201d as traditional venture capital investments.\u201cI would describe Reid as left of center, with a very strong sense of empathy for those who are less fortunate,\u201d Mr. Thiel wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a character trait than an ideological position.\u201dIn 2000, he joined Mr. Thiel as an executive at PayPal, a stint that made Mr. Hoffman a millionaire. He founded LinkedIn, the career-oriented social network, in 2003, spurred by trying to connect people and the openness of online communities.By then, he had become involved in policy. During President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, Mr. Hoffman nurtured ties with the White House and Democratic politicians like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.\u201cReid was among the top leaders in Silicon Valley to whom we looked for good counsel\u201d on issues like immigration, said Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama.Last year, Mr. Hoffman joined the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Innovation Advisory Board, a group helping to modernize the military. Mr. Hoffman offered ideas about the impact that artificial intelligence would have on combat, and suggested ways to improve the military\u2019s personnel retention, according to a person who works with the board but was not authorized to speak publicly about it.Mr. Hoffman decided the tech industry had to confront the challenges created by social networks, including their potential to undermine democracy. He said the industry would at some point need to regulate itself with a standards body like the Motion Picture Association of America.Mr. Trump also embodied a specific cause of anxiety for Mr. Hoffman.\u201cWe\u2019re in turbulent times, when concerns about the future tend to lead us to try and enshrine the past,\u201d he said. He began hosting discussions to generate policies for creating economic opportunity and how the government can serve broader swathes of people.Mr. Hoffman has since used his cash and connections to shape the organizations and start-ups that support the issues where he wants to exert the most influence. He has also tried to convince the tech industry to take responsibility for how its products are built and used.In the spring, Mr. Hoffman convened a small group of tech leaders to dine with Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, at the Rosewood Hotel in Menlo Park, Calif. The group discussed the prospect of governments trying to regulate tech companies and, in particular, the unemployment problems being created by automation and artificial intelligence.\u201cAt the end of the day, most people don\u2019t want a handout,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven a chance, they\u2019ll work hard.\u201dMr. Altman said he agreed with Mr. Hoffman\u2019s concerns and that he appreciated \u201chis willingness to debate issues.\u201dMr. Hoffman has also given money to organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Union of Concerned Scientists, which are explicitly resisting Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. He increased his venture-style investments in new civic and political start-ups, as well as continuing to fund some he had previously invested in, like Change.org and political fund-raising start-up Crowdpac.Win the Future has already drawn criticism for floating the possibility of billboards with crowdsourced ideas to shape the Democratic agenda. Mr. Pincus said most things in the start-up ecosystem took time to evolve and that early criticism of the new group was helpful.Mr. Hoffman\u2019s colleagues said his start-up method to politics was the right one. \u201cIt\u2019s a different approach, so naturally there will be skeptics,\u201d said John Lilly, one of Mr. Hoffman\u2019s partners at Greylock. \u201cBut entrepreneurship has been the driver of the economy. It will work.\u201dMr. Hoffman said he would judge his investments in civic-change start-ups by their ability to affect society, not by any financial return.\u201cOne of the things that I get most frustrated with is this kind of American business psychology, this view that I\u2019m only responsible to my customers and employees and shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be part of the political process. We can\u2019t just invent the future without some kind of connectivity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Plans Second Headquarters, Opening a Bidding War Among Cities", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Wanted: A place with a million people, a diverse population, good schools and malleable lawmakers. Room to accommodate up to 50,000 workers. Canadian provinces also welcome to apply.Amazon took the unusual step on Thursday of announcing it wants a second home outside Seattle, starting what is sure to be a fierce bidding war to lure Amazon \u2014 and the thousands of high-paying jobs it will bring to town \u2014 using a combination of tax breaks and other sweeteners.By the end of the day, cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Diego, along with states like Michigan, were vocal about their interest, the first of many places expected to consider submitting proposals. Amazon has laid out in meticulous detail what it is looking for, even acknowledging that new laws may be required to get the high level of incentives necessary to hold the company\u2019s attention.\u201cThis is the trophy deal of the decade as far as I can tell,\u201d said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonpartisan research group that tracks economic development. \u201cWhat governor or mayor doesn\u2019t want to stand on a stage with Jeff Bezos to announce a deal like this?\u201dBut Amazon executives have talked internally and with outsiders in recent years about how much more of the company\u2019s hyper-growth Seattle would be able to handle. Housing prices here are skyrocketing, the competition for tech industry talent is getting more fierce and traffic chokes the roads.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.Those considerations and more are laid out in Amazon\u2019s detailed wish list for its new project, which it is calling HQ2. In addition to a metropolitan area with more than one million residents, Amazon insists that its new project have on-site access to mass transit, a commute of 45 minutes or less to an international airport and easy access to a major highway or arterial road \u2014 no more than two miles.It also asked for evidence of fiber optic internet connections and a coverage map showing strong cellular phone service at the location. Amazon also wants traffic congestion figures, lists of universities and statistics on the qualifications of local workers.The company is also requesting that the new location have a diverse population and recreational opportunities. In other words, it does not want to stray too far from the lifestyle of Seattle, the home of Starbucks and Nordstrom, sandwiched between mountains and water. The headquarters in Seattle has 24 cafes.Already, Amazon is one of the largest tech employers in the world. But the company said the total number of new employees at its second headquarters outside Seattle could reach 50,000.The announcement of its hiring plan comes at a time when President Trump has stepped up his attacks on Amazon on Twitter, accusing the company of hurting retailers and killing jobs.The local antipathy toward the company was summed up in graffiti that recently appeared on the wall of a busy downtown traffic tunnel: an expletive before the last name of Mr. Bezos.Amazon itself seemed to suggest that it was looking for a more welcoming atmosphere than in Seattle, emphasizing that it is looking for a \u201cstable and business-friendly environment\u201d for its new headquarters.\u201cWhen big corporations say \u2018business-friendly\u2019 climate, it\u2019s code for corporate giveaways and vicious policies seeking to make the biggest possible profits on the backs of working people,\u201d Kshama Sawant, a socialist member of the Seattle City Council, said in an email.Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group in Seattle, said he had heard concerns from executives at Amazon about the climate for businesses in Seattle.\u201cI recognize there are many factors that went in to Amazon\u2019s decision, but the Seattle City Council\u2019s focus on dividing the pie of economic opportunity rather than growing the pie for the city and the region is undoubtedly among them,\u201d he said.Maud Daudon, the chief executive of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, said she has heard similar concerns from Amazon executives and called the company\u2019s announcement of its plan a \u201cwake-up call for the region.\u201d\u201cWe have not said thank you enough\u201d to Amazon, Ms. Daudon said.Amazon has no plans to leave Seattle, where it employs 40,000 of its 380,000 total workers. It has an additional 6,000 open jobs in Seattle, a sprawling network of buildings downtown, with millions more square feet of office space under construction. Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment about the plan for the company\u2019s new headquarters.Political leaders elsewhere wasted no time saying how badly they want Amazon to join them.\u201cWe will aggressively demonstrate that Dallas and our surrounding area would be the perfect spot for their expansive business needs,\u201d Mike Rawlings, the city\u2019s mayor, said in a statement. Dallas representatives were already in touch with Amazon about next steps, he said.Amazon has been a beneficiary of generous public subsidies as part of its expansion of its warehouse network. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonpartisan research and advocacy group, published a report last year saying that Amazon had received forms of public subsidies totaling at least $613 million for 40 of the 77 warehouses it built from 2005 to 2014. Additional subsidies for Amazon data centers were about $147 million, the institute said.Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., said that the average incentive package from a state usually adds up to 2 to 3 percent of wages, although recently there have been a spate of megadeals, like the $3 billion in state tax credits that Wisconsin offered Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics supplier for Apple and other tech giants.Such outsize offers could end up being a \u201cwinner\u2019s curse,\u201d where the costs outweigh the benefits. He added that such gifts may not even be what is crucial.\u201cEither you have the things they want or you don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Bartik said, things like, reasonable housing costs, a pool of skilled talent, an international airport or the kind of amenities that would attract the kind of workers that Amazon wants to hire.When General Electric announced last year that it was moving its headquarters to Boston, G.E. executive said that some of city\u2019s most important selling points included the number and quality of its colleges and universities, a technically fluent work force, an atmosphere of innovation and entrepreneurial start-ups, and a quality of life that would attract current and future employees. Tax incentives were a factor, but not the most significant one by far, they said.Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said he was not bothered by Amazon\u2019s decision, which he said would give another city a chance to become a significant tech hub.\u201cI think there\u2019s no way to accommodate another 50,000 engineers and executives in Seattle,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t think it would be healthy for Seattle to have that. As much as I love Amazon, to have that great a density of a single company, it means you\u2019re a one-horse town.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Patricia Cohen from New York.

She said the $500 million in combined federal and corporate money would be directed to all schools with the goal of trying to bridge a skills divide that she said was hurting the American economy.Ms. Trump said that six million jobs in the United States were going unfilled largely because not enough students were being educated in computer science and other STEM-related skills. And nine out of every 10 software-related jobs in the country are outside Silicon Valley, according to Code.org, an organization working on the initiative with the Trump administration, and two-thirds of the companies that employ computer science professionals are banks, hospitals and other firms not strictly considered part of the tech industry.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to classify computer science as tech to enable getting a job in Silicon Valley or New York,\u201d Ms. Trump said in an interview, \u201cbut the reality is that computer skills and coding is relevant and foundational for every sector and every industry across the economy and tech is increasingly the way we work.\u201dMs. Trump said the Education Department would focus its attention on grant applications related to computer science and to proposals that catered to computer science education for girls and students from minority backgrounds.Mr. Trump\u2019s memorandum on the financing did not guarantee that $200 million in annual grants would go entirely toward computer science education. In a news release, the Education Department said it had a \u201cgoal of devoting\u201d that sum each year toward STEM and computer science education.

Standard-definition videos are less expensive to buy, often by about $5, and $1 or $2 less to rent in some online stores. Certain devices cannot fully display HD video anyway because the screens lack the needed resolution or the hardware is not compatible. (Some files may automatically download in standard definition anyway depending on the device you are using.)Because they contain more data, downloaded HD videos need more bandwidth to stream and, when downloaded, take up more space on your device. For example, the 720p HD version of \u201cThe Martian\u201d in Apple\u2019s iTunes Store is a 5.36-gigabyte file, while the SD edition weighs in at 2.54 gigabytes. If you are downloading a movie to a mobile device to watch offline, the SD edition is a space saver. If you plan to watch the movie on a high-definition television or high-resolution computer monitor, though, SD video can look flatter and less vibrant than the HD version.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Best Buy\u2019s Secrets for Thriving in the Amazon Age", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftWhile running errands the other day, I ducked into a local Best Buy to pick up a pair of new headphones. What I saw inside was shocking.Happy-looking people were huddled around tables filled with the latest gadgets from Microsoft and Apple. The video game aisle was bustling. Blue-shirted employees were helping a customer pick from a glowing wall of flat-screen TVs. There was a line \u2014 a line! \u2014 at the checkout counter.But Best Buy\u2019s rebound has been surprisingly durable. Revenue figures have beaten Wall Street\u2019s expectations in six of the last seven quarters. The company\u2019s stock price has risen more than 50 percent in the past year. Workers are happy. And judging from several other visits I paid to Best Buy stores, the chain appears to have avoided the bleak fate of other big-box retailers.How do they do it?To find out, I called Hubert Joly, Best Buy\u2019s chief executive.An upbeat Frenchman who spent more than a decade at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Mr. Joly, 58, explained that Best Buy\u2019s turnaround was years in the making, and that it involved reshaping nearly every piece of the business. It\u2019s a fascinating playbook for companies hoping to survive in the Amazon age.Here are the keys to Best Buy\u2019s turnaround, according to Mr. Joly:The most worrisome trend in big-box retail was \u201cshowrooming\u201d \u2014 customers were testing new products in stores before buying them for less money online from another retailer. To combat showrooming and persuade customers to complete their purchases at Best Buy, Mr. Joly announced a price-matching guarantee.\u201cUntil I match Amazon\u2019s prices, the customers are ours to lose,\u201d Mr. Joly said.Price-matching costs Best Buy real money, but it also gives customers a reason to stay in the store, and avoids handing business to competitors.Mr. Joly also realized that if Best Buy was going to compete with Amazon, which has spent billions building a speedy delivery system and plans to use drones to become even more efficient, it needed to get better at things that robots can\u2019t do well \u2014 namely, customer service.In his first months on the job, Mr. Joly visited Best Buy stores near the company\u2019s Minnesota headquarters to ask rank-and-file employees about the struggles they encountered. (Among their gripes: an internal search engine that was returning bad data about which items were in stock.)Best Buy fixed the search engine. It also restored a much-loved employee discount that had been suspended and embarked on an ambitious program to retrain its employees so they could answer questions about entirely new categories of electronics, such as virtual reality headsets and smart home appliances.\u201cThe associates in our stores are much more engaged now, much more proficient,\u201d Mr. Joly said.Customers had always loved Best Buy\u2019s Geek Squad, its army of specially trained tech support experts who could be hired to mount TVs and install other appliances at a customer\u2019s home. But sometimes, people needed help before they bought big and expensive gadgets. So it started an adviser program that allows customers to get free in-home consultations about what product they should buy, and how it should be installed. The service started as a pilot program last year and is now being rolled out nationwide.Best Buy has \u201creally come through the valley by making investments around the customer experience,\u201d said Peter Keith, a retail analyst with Piper Jaffray.When Mr. Joly arrived at Best Buy, the company\u2019s online ordering system was completely divorced from its stores. If a customer placed an order on the website, it would ship from a central warehouse. If that warehouse didn\u2019t have the item in stock, the customer was out of luck.Mr. Joly realized that with some minor changes, each of Best Buy\u2019s 1,000-plus big-box stores could ship packages to customers, serving as a mini warehouse for its surrounding area. Now, when a customer orders a product on Best Buy\u2019s website, the item is sent from the location that can deliver it the fastest \u2014 a store down the street, perhaps, or a warehouse five states away. It was a small, subtle change, but it allowed Best Buy to improve its shipping times, and made immediate gratification possible for customers. Now, roughly 40 percent of Best Buy\u2019s online orders are either shipped or picked up from a store.Best Buy also struck deals with large electronics companies like Samsung, Apple and Microsoft to feature their products in branded areas within the store. Now, rather than jamming these companies\u2019 products next to one another on shelves, Best Buy allows them to set up their own dedicated kiosks. (Apple\u2019s area inside a Best Buy, for example, has the same sleek wooden tables and minimalist design as an Apple Store.) It\u2019s a concept borrowed from department stores, and it\u2019s created a lucrative new revenue stream. Even Amazon has set up kiosks in Best Buy stores to show off its voice-activated Alexa gadgets.Granted, Best Buy has a last-man-standing advantage in these partnership deals. Many of its big-box rivals (Circuit City, Radio Shack, HH Gregg) have gone bankrupt or shut down completely. Which means that if Samsung wants to show off its newest line of tablets in a big-box electronics store, it has basically one choice.Best Buy has also found more creative penny-pinching methods. Once, the company noticed that an unusually high number of flat-screen TVs were being dropped in its warehouses. It revamped the handling process, reducing the number of times TVs were picked up by a clamp lift and adding new carts to prevent TV boxes from falling over. The changes resulted in less broken inventory and bigger profits.Mr. Joly didn\u2019t explicitly tell me this, but it is obvious: Best Buy has benefited from some serious good fortune.It\u2019s lucky that the products it specializes in selling, like big-screen TVs and high-end audio equipment, are big-ticket items that many customers still feel uncomfortable buying sight unseen from a website. It\u2019s lucky that several large competitors have gone out of business, shrinking its list of rivals. And it\u2019s lucky that the vendors who make the products it sells, like Apple and Samsung, have kept churning out expensive blockbuster gadgets.\u201cThey\u2019re at the mercy of the product cycles,\u201d said Stephen Baker, a tech industry analyst at NPD Group. \u201cIf people stop buying PCs or they don\u2019t care about big-screen TVs anymore, they have a challenge.\u201dMr. Joly is optimistic about Best Buy\u2019s chances against these Goliaths, but he\u2019s not ready to celebrate yet.\u201cOnce you\u2019ve had a near-death experience,\u201d he said, \u201carrogance, if you had it in your bones, has disappeared forever.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to how Best Buy selects locations for shipping online orders. The company chooses the location that can deliver the item the fastest, not always the location that is closest to the person who ordered it.Follow Kevin Roose on Twitter @kevinroose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Paris Biennale, Buyers Want Antiques. Just Not Too Many.", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 What is the future of the grand old art and antiques fair?\u201cIt\u2019s the most important art and antiques fair in Paris. It\u2019s been that for many years,\u201d said the second-time exhibitor Pascal Izarn, a Paris dealer who specializes in museum-quality 18th-century French clocks and decorative objects. \u201cPeople don\u2019t collect the 18th century from floor to ceiling anymore,\u201d Mr. Izarn said. \u201cThey mix with modern and contemporary.\u201dThe biennale\u2019s organizers, the Syndicat National des Antiquaires, adopted the atemporal, gray styling characteristic of Frieze Masters in London and other fairs trying to find a new audience for old things. The number of exhibiting dealers shrank to 94, compared with 125 last year, with two-thirds of them based in France.\u201cIt\u2019s not that international anymore. It\u2019s too French,\u201d said Nikolas Barta, an Austrian collector based in Vienna, who has been a regular visitor to the Paris biennale, as well as Art Basel, Tefaf and Frieze. Mr. Barta, 62, buys artworks from the 18th to 21st centuries. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a bit quiet,\u201d he added during a somnolent Tuesday afternoon at the fair, when there were fewer than 200 visitors browsing under the cast iron and glass roof of the Grand Palais. By this stage, most dealers had typically made just one or two sales.\u201cMelinda said to her decorator, \u2018If you find a place for them. I\u2019ll take them,\u2019 \u201d recalled the gallery\u2019s founder, Dominique Chevalier. Mrs. Gates\u2019s decorator, the New York-based Thierry Despont, duly found a place, and they were sold for a price that Mr. Chevalier declined to divulge.The tapestries have since been bought back by Galerie Chevalier, and were in its booth at the biennale, priced at \u20ac4 million, or about $4.7 million.\u201cThey weren\u2019t just decorators,\u201d said Camille Leprince, a former Paris biennale exhibitor. \u201cThey turned clients into collectors. It was great for dealers.\u201dMr. Grange, Mr. Peregalli and Mr. Garcia were all spotted at the V.I.P. previews of this year\u2019s biennale, but with the wealthy increasingly living in contemporary interiors, buyers of antiques are being more selective.\u201cMany clients today ask us for classic contemporary design, and at the biennale some of these clients are looking for a grandiose piece to embellish their d\u00e9cors,\u201d said Linda Pinto, the decorator\u2019s sister, who is now director of his Paris-based company.Mr. Leprince said that this year, he preferred to hold a pop-up show of mid-18th-century Strasbourg-factory faience at the Galerie Vandermeersch in Paris, rather than commit to the Grand Palais. \u201cWe\u2019d rather keep our expenses low and hold a small, academic exhibition,\u201d said Mr. Leprince, who estimated the cost of his gallery show and catalog at about \u20ac10,000, compared with \u20ac150,000 for a booth at the fair. \u201cBut you do lose some customers,\u201d he added.The star attraction at Galerie Vandermeersch was the only known set of four white Strasbourg faience commedia dell\u2019arte figures inspired by the artist Jean-Antoine Watteau and made under the supervision of the notable ceramist Paul-Antoine Hannong. On consignment from a French collector, who had reunited the figures after buying them as two pairs at separate Tefaf fairs, Mr. Leprince gave the price as between \u20ac200,000 and \u20ac250,000.But then 20 lots later, an amusing if hardly museum-quality pair of late 18th-century Chinese Export porcelain tureens shaped as ducks sold for \u20ac187,500 against a low estimate of \u20ac15,000.This result was a telling reminder that:\u2022 Auction house prices can only go up, while dealer prices can only go down, and\u2022 European 18th-century objects look seriously underpriced compared with their Chinese equivalents.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Politics: Liberal, With One Big Exception", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSilicon Valley has long preferred to remain aloof from national politics, but the Trump era has altered that stance.A politically awakened Silicon Valley, buttressed by the tech industry\u2019s growing economic power, could potentially alter politics long after President Trump has left the scene. But if the tech industry becomes a political force, what sort of policies will it push?The survey suggests a novel but paradoxical vision of the future of American politics: Technologists could help push lawmakers, especially Democrats, further to the left on many social and economic issues. But they may also undermine the influence of some of the Democrats\u2019 most stalwart supporters, including labor unions. And they may strive to push Democrats away from regulation on business \u2014 including the growing calls for greater rules around the tech industry.Over all, the study showed that tech entrepreneurs are very liberal \u2014 among some of the most left-leaning Democrats you can find. They are overwhelmingly in favor of economic policies that redistribute wealth, including higher taxes on rich people and lots of social services for the poor, including universal health care. Their outlook is cosmopolitan and globalist \u2014 they support free trade and more open immigration, and they score low on measures of \u201cracial resentment.\u201dOn most culture-war issues, they are unrepentantly liberal. They oppose restrictions on abortion, favor gay rights, support gun control and oppose the death penalty.Now for the twist. The study found one area where tech entrepreneurs strongly deviate from Democratic orthodoxy and are closer to most Republicans: They are deeply suspicious of the government\u2019s efforts to regulate business, especially when it comes to labor. They said that it was too difficult for companies to fire people, and that the government should make it easier to do so. They also hope to see the influence of both private and public-sector unions decline.\u201cYou would think that people with enough money to influence the political system would obviously use that influence to increase social and economic inequality in ways that benefit them,\u201d said David Broockman, an assistant professor of political economy at Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business and a co-author of the study.\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising to us,\u201d he continued, \u201cis that you could find this group that says, \u2018Actually, our taxes should go up and more money should go to things like universal health care, or that we should do more to protect the environment\u2019 \u2014 but at the same time believes that regulations and labor unions are a problem.\u201dThe researchers deliberately chose to examine what they call the tech industry\u2019s \u201celites\u201d \u2014 not rank-and-file workers, but the millionaire and billionaire founders and executives who are best positioned to influence politics. The study is based on a detailed survey of more than 600 such elites around the country (only about a third are in the Bay Area) conducted in February. The researchers also surveyed Republican and Democratic donors and voters for comparisons.The researchers were interested in the tech elite because the politics of Silicon Valley have always been something of a mystery. Many of Silicon Valley\u2019s pioneers initially thought of themselves more as freewheeling revolutionaries than as capitalists bent on global economic domination. They were hippies and draft resisters, as enthusiastic about LSD as about microprocessors, and they brought to their work the tenets of the counterculture.The Stanford study thoroughly debunks the idea that tech is lousy with libertarians. The researchers asked respondents whether they agreed or disagreed with this statement: \u201cI would like to live in a society where government does nothing except provide national defense and police protection, so that people could be left alone to earn whatever they could.\u201dFewer than a quarter of the tech elite agreed with that view. Democrats were almost twice as likely to agree, and Republicans agreed by huge margins.But if they\u2019re not libertarians, what accounts for techies\u2019 opposition to regulation? One idea might be that it\u2019s driven by self-interest. A large fraction said they opposed regulating car-sharing services as if they were taxis, for instance; to the extent that the tech elite have a lot of money riding on the sharing economy, they may worry that regulation of such companies could hurt their wallets.Yet the survey also shows that tech elites are generally willing to support other policies that go against their interest. Huge majorities supported increasing spending on programs that only benefit the poorest Americans, as well as increasing taxes on people who earn more than $250,000 per year.To tease out whether self-interest was at play in their views on regulation, surveyors asked a question about Uber\u2019s surge-pricing policy, which increases prices during periods of peak demand. But the researchers disguised it with a business unrelated to tech: \u201cOn a holiday, when there is a great demand for flowers, sellers usually increase their prices. Do you think it is fair for them to raise their prices like this?\u201dA majority of Democrats and Republicans said it would be unfair for a florist to do that. But 96 percent of the tech elite thought it would be fair.\u201cMy guess is there\u2019s an underlying principle to their views,\u201d Dr. Broockman said. \u201cThey see an entrepreneur trying to do what they want in the marketplace, and they see nothing unfair about that.\u201dThe tech elite\u2019s mix of views is unique; no other group in the survey favored both greater wealth redistribution and laxer regulation. It is genuinely difficult to think of any politician who aligns with that mix.But Mr. Khanna is no opponent of regulation. He has favored greater enforcement of antitrust laws, and recently said he was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods. When I asked him about the survey\u2019s findings on techie views of labor unions, he was adamant that he didn\u2019t share them.\u201cI\u2019ve always been a very strong supporter of labor,\u201d he said.But the Stanford researchers suggest that over time, given technologists\u2019 money and influence over media, they may have the power to subtly alter Democratic lawmakers\u2019 views. Indeed, that may already be happening \u2014 already, the researchers said, the Democratic Party looks far less interested in curbing the tech industry\u2019s reach than it once did.Consider that President Bill Clinton\u2019s Department of Justice waged a major war against Microsoft\u2019s market power. Just a decade later, the next Democratic president, Barack Obama, took little interest in stemming tech giants\u2019 growing clout.\u201cThere\u2019s one obvious difference between those time periods,\u201d Dr. Malhotra said. \u201cThat difference is the rising influence of the technology industry in politics.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As he decamped from his role as chief executive of Microsoft, he splashed out $2 billion for the Los Angeles Clippers in August 2014. That was nearly four times as much as the price paid for the Milwaukee Bucks in the same year.For a long time, sports franchises were considered little more than vanity acquisitions, but lucrative television contracts have changed the calculus a bit. Leslie Alexander purchased the Rockets in 1993 for $85 million. On that basis, he generated a healthy internal rate of return of 15 percent, Reuters Breakingviews estimates, assuming he did not collect any dividends along the way.For Mr. Fertitta, the transaction comes at a hefty premium. Mr. Alexander outbid him 24 years ago by $4 million, according to ESPN. What\u2019s more, he is paying nine times the $244 million that Forbes magazine estimated for the Rockets\u2019 revenue. That multiple is less than the assessed multiple that Mr. Ballmer shelled out for the Clippers, but well more than what the globally recognized Manchester United soccer club fetches on the public market.For Mr. Fertitta to match the current seller\u2019s return, the Rockets would need to sell for about $60 billion in 2042. That may not necessarily be the aim, however, for what Mr. Fertitta called a \u201clifelong dream come true.\u201dAs America\u2019s fourth-largest metropolis confronts a cleanup that could cost more than $100 billion, a luxury purchase like this might appear unseemly. The team acknowledged as much, calling the timing \u201ctruly unfortunate\u201d while noting that the process started in July. Even so, Mr. Fertitta\u2019s deal implies a long-term expectation that Houston will stage a successful comeback.He may be right. New Orleans in some ways marked its resurgence from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 with a Super Bowl victory by the Saints five years later. Sports have a way of uniting a community.

{"Headline": "For India, Toilets Are a (Mostly) Serious Issue", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 The most popular movie in India this summer is about a toilet. It nearly causes a divorce. It makes a father slap his adult son. It splits a village in half. But, ultimately, it\u2019s about a romance.India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, troubled by how many Indians still relieve themselves in the open, has vowed to build a staggering 100 million new toilets.All across the country, new latrines are going up, sometimes so fast they are not connected to anything, creating toilets to nowhere that are so fly-ridden and stinky that almost no one will use them.The lack of facilities is not just a matter of public health, as the movie makes clear, but also touches on issues of safety, women\u2019s rights and human dignity.She refused to come back until her husband built her one. He does, and she returns. \u201cOur love has grown since,\u201d she said.\u201cToilet,\u201d which was released this month across more than 3,000 screens in India and at dozens of theaters internationally, seems to have struck a chord, even among India\u2019s urban dwellers.\u201cI totally identify with the issue,\u201d said Nishua, a 16-year-old high school student who goes by one name. She had just stepped out of a theater in New Delhi on a recent muggy afternoon.When she was a child, Nishua recalled, her grandmother\u2019s house had no toilet.\u201cFor this one reason I wouldn\u2019t want to visit her,\u201d Nishua said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t look forward to visiting my grandmother for fear of being herded out in the fields to defecate.\u201dThat spreads diseases and causes other public and personal problems.\u201cThis is a real problem,\u201d said Jagmati Sangwan, a women\u2019s rights advocate. \u201cSo many women, especially landless women, face a lot of violence when they go to the bathroom outside.\u201dBut Mr. Modi\u2019s detractors say there may be more emphasis on image than deed, and that in many areas party apparatchiks are so eager to fall in line with the prime minister\u2019s directives that they are putting up latrines that are not connected to sewers or septic systems.Sanitation specialists say that with less than 5 percent of India\u2019s nearly 8,000 cities and towns having sewage treatment plants, it is far from clear where all the waste will go.\u201cThere\u2019s a blind scramble to make a toilet, whether it is usable or not,\u201d said Bezwada Wilson, an official with the Sanitation Workers\u2019 Movement, an advocacy organization. \u201cIt has become a business, and resulted in the corporatization of the toilet.\u201dThere\u2019s a tradition in Bollywood to make films that latch on to public campaigns, like those focused on the challenges of dyslexia or the rights of girls. State governments sometimes offer the filmmakers incentives. \u201cToilet,\u201d for one, received tax breaks that have helped it earn around $20 million, a nice haul by Bollywood standards.Akshay Kumar, 49, who is one of Bollywood\u2019s most bankable actors and also a celebrity ambassador for the government\u2019s Clean India campaign, said he chose to play the lead in \u201cToilet\u201d because it highlighted the problems so many women face.The judge was highly sympathetic.

Others, their bodies running on five days of adrenaline, find sleeping and even eating impossible. False news reports ricochet through social media, fueled by fear.There are reminders everywhere: buildings buckling, floes of concrete and brick spilling across sidewalks, familiar streets bifurcated by strands of red and yellow emergency tape and patrolled by soldiers in uniform. Service tents brim with volunteers, looking for ways to help, to turn angst into action.Nearly 4,000 buildings were damaged by the quake, and residents of high-rises wonder if their buildings may fall before they can make their way downstairs. And over the weekend, the trauma of last Tuesday was brought to the surface again as light tremors from an earthquake in southern Mexico on Saturday lightly rocked the capital, sending residents fleeing into the streets barefoot and in sleepwear.The fear, worn on faces across the huge city, has found its form in jitters, racing pulses and, in some cases, health problems. The mayor of Mexico City said two residents had died after from heart attacks following the tremors. A connection may be hard to prove, but the mayor\u2019s words conveyed the sense of terror permeating the capital.When Henry Rodr\u00edguez felt the tremors from the southern Mexico quake on Saturday, he fled his home without a shirt, socks or the grab bag he typically keeps with him during any emergency \u2014 and there have been many.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez is the head of mission for Doctors Without Borders in Mexico, and is largely focused on providing psychological care for survivors in the wake of disaster. He tells his staff members every time they are deployed that to counsel survivors of trauma, they must have their own necessities close at hand. But this time, he broke his own rule, springing onto the street with everyone else, wearing nothing but a pair of pants.Days earlier, when the big quake struck, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez witnessed the actual catastrophe, a first for him in 17 years of emergency service: the city convulsing beneath his feet, buildings toppling, friends left homeless. In the last few days, he manifests the same symptoms as his patients \u2014 coiled anxiety, sleepless nights woven with nightmares, near constant fear.This time, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez is a survivor.\u201cWe are part of a group that has to react to these events, whose responsibility it is to help others, but we are also humans, and we feel these traumas too,\u201d he said, processing for the first time the toll the earthquake had taken on his own mental well-being. \u201cWhen you are there for an emergency, involved in the incident, you become a part of it, too.\u201dAs the recovery effort slows, and shock gives way to the difficult step of trying to absorb what just happened, many have expressed a sense of confusion steeped in sadness.In Parque Espa\u00f1a, a verdant expanse with winding pathways and exercise stations in the center of the Condesa district, a sheet of brown paper has been erected for passers-by to write down their feelings and thoughts \u201cWhen the Earth Moved.\u201dDozens of buildings in Mexico City were destroyed by the earthquake and now pose a risk to rescue workers and residents.Testimonies are scrawled on its surface, anonymous snapshots of grief, sadness and loss. One writer recalled seeing the first building collapse in the neighborhood, another the moment when a friend passed out while racing out of their building.\u201cWe are still in a post-traumatic state where emotions run high, and there is a lot of contained energy, and we don\u2019t really realize we are in this state of crisis,\u201d said a psychologist, Claudia Quintanilla, her own eyes brimming with tears just hours after Saturday\u2019s fright. \u201cWe have not rationalized what has happened, and today\u2019s new earthquake re-traumatizes all of us.\u201dFor some families, the fears go deeper than this particular round of earthquakes, reaching all the way back to 1985, when a powerful earthquake claimed the lives of 10,000 people and pulverized the capital. (At least 318 people were killed in Tuesday\u2019s quake, officials said on Sunday.)Nictze Ximena Salcedo said her family lost everything in the 1985 earthquake and fled Mexico for her father\u2019s native Venezuela. It was not until 2008 that they returned and reclaimed their former life.Ms. Salcedo, 26, a photographer, lives in the south of the capital, not far from where a school building collapsed, killing 19 children and six adults. She saw it crumple, sending up a giant cloud of dust and emitting a roar as the concrete split. Her family home, her photo studio and her parents\u2019 shop are all now gone, too damaged to salvage or in danger of collapse.On Saturday, she was taking a shower when the earthquake alarm sounded, setting off panic in the house. She raced naked from the bathroom, grabbing a blanket to cover herself.\u201cI stumbled down the stairs soaking wet, slipping, shoeless and scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want it to be over already. I just want a little normality back in my life.\u201dMs. Salcedo\u2019s parents feel like their lives are playing on a cruel, 30-year loop. \u201cThey can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening all over again,\u201d she said.Stationed in Plaza R\u00edo de Janeiro, in the hard-hit neighborhood of Roma, were at least six different booths offering guided meditation and therapy to distressed residents. Others offer free massage, tables where children can draw and color, and psychological support. The smell of incense permeated the stone plaza, which stretches two city blocks.Over the weekend, throngs of residents wandered through Roma and Condesa, quietly absorbing the jarring changes to a once-familiar landscape.Jos\u00e9 Osorio Cruz stood outside a coffee shop, playing with his 9-month-old son, jogging in place while making faces at the boy. He seemed calm, even relaxed, going for a stroll with his family in a neighborhood warped by disaster.\u201cIt\u2019s like our emotions are so conflicted,\u201d said Mr. Cruz, 38, a sales manager for Microsoft. \u201cYou have this confusion, sadness, and overwhelming fear, and at the same time you know you have to keep fighting and searching for hope.\u201dHe held out faith that the incredible civic response of his countrymen might be replicated in other areas of society. Often, he said, citizens turn a blind eye to the corruption and violence that punctuate Mexican life. Maybe the disaster was an opportunity to turn the energy of the masses toward bettering the country, he suggested, a prospect that comforted him.\u201cI believe we will push forward as a nation,\u201d he said, rocking his son back and forth in his stroller along the jagged sidewalk. \u201cThis is an opportunity for the citizens to come together in the spirit of unity, to reconstruct Mexico.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chips Off the Old Block: Computers Are Taking Design Cues From Human Brains", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "New technologies are testing the limits of computer semiconductors. To deal with that, researchers have gone looking for ideas from nature.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 We expect a lot from our computers these days. They should talk to us, recognize everything from faces to flowers, and maybe soon do the driving. All this artificial intelligence requires an enormous amount of computing power, stretching the limits of even the most modern machines.Now, some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies are taking a cue from biology as they respond to these growing demands. They are rethinking the very nature of computers and are building machines that look more like the human brain, where a central brain stem oversees the nervous system and offloads particular tasks \u2014 like hearing and seeing \u2014 to the surrounding cortex.After years of stagnation, the computer is evolving again, and this behind-the-scenes migration to a new kind of machine will have broad and lasting implications. It will allow work on artificially intelligent systems to accelerate, so the dream of machines that can navigate the physical world by themselves can one day come true.\u201cThis is an enormous change,\u201d said John Hennessy, the former Stanford University president who wrote an authoritative book on computer design in the mid-1990s and is now a member of the board at Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. \u201cThe existing approach is out of steam, and people are trying to re-architect the system.\u201dThe existing approach has had a pretty nice run. For about half a century, computer makers have built systems around a single, do-it-all chip \u2014 the central processing unit \u2014 from a company like Intel, one of the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor makers. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll find in the middle of your own laptop computer or smartphone.Now, computer engineers are fashioning more complex systems. Rather than funneling all tasks through one beefy chip made by Intel, newer machines are dividing work into tiny pieces and spreading them among vast farms of simpler, specialized chips that consume less power.Changes inside Google\u2019s giant data centers are a harbinger of what is to come for the rest of the industry. Inside most of Google\u2019s servers, there is still a central processor. But enormous banks of custom-built chips work alongside them, running the computer algorithms that drive speech recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence.Google reached this point out of necessity. For years, the company had operated the world\u2019s largest computer network \u2014 an empire of data centers and cables that stretched from California to Finland to Singapore. But for one Google researcher, it was much too small.In 2011, Jeff Dean, one of the company\u2019s most celebrated engineers, led a research team that explored the idea of neural networks \u2014 essentially computer algorithms that can learn tasks on their own. They could be useful for a number of things, like recognizing the words spoken into smartphones or the faces in a photograph.In a matter of months, Mr. Dean and his team built a service that could recognize spoken words far more accurately than Google\u2019s existing service. But there was a catch: If the world\u2019s more than one billion phones that operated on Google\u2019s Android software used the new service just three minutes a day, Mr. Dean realized, Google would have to double its data center capacity in order to support it.\u201cWe need another Google,\u201d Mr. Dean told Urs H\u00f6lzle, the Swiss-born computer scientist who oversaw the company\u2019s data center empire, according to someone who attended the meeting. So Mr. Dean proposed an alternative: Google could build its own computer chip just for running this kind of artificial intelligence.This trend toward specialty chips and a new computer architecture could lead to a \u201cCambrian explosion\u201d of artificial intelligence, said Gill Pratt, who was a program manager at Darpa, a research arm of the United States Department of Defense, and now works on driverless cars at Toyota. As he sees it, machines that spread computations across vast numbers of tiny, low-power chips can operate more like the human brain, which efficiently uses the energy at its disposal.\u201cIn the brain, energy efficiency is the key,\u201d he said during a recent interview at Toyota\u2019s new research center in Silicon Valley.There are many kinds of silicon chips. There are chips that store information. There are chips that perform basic tasks in toys and televisions. And there are chips that run various processes for computers, from the supercomputers used to create models for global warming to personal computers, internet servers and smartphones.For years, the central processing units, or C.P.U.s, that ran PCs and similar devices were where the money was. And there had not been much need for change.By 2010, however, doubling the number of transistors was taking much longer than Moore\u2019s Law predicted. Dennard\u2019s scaling maxim had also been upended as chip designers ran into the limits of the physical materials they used to build processors. The result: If a company wanted more computing power, it could not just upgrade its processors. It needed more computers, more space and more electricity.At the time, Microsoft was just beginning to improve Bing using machine-learning algorithms (neural networks are a type of machine learning) that could improve search results by analyzing the way people used the service. Though these algorithms were less demanding than the neural networks that would later remake the internet, existing chips had trouble keeping up.Mr. Burger and his team explored several options but eventually settled on something called Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or F.P.G.A.s.: chips that could be reprogrammed for new jobs on the fly. Microsoft builds software, like Windows, that runs on an Intel C.P.U. But such software cannot reprogram the chip, since it is hard-wired to perform only certain tasks.With an F.P.G.A., Microsoft could change the way the chip works. It could program the chip to be really good at executing particular machine learning algorithms. Then, it could reprogram the chip to be really good at running logic that sends the millions and millions of data packets across its computer network. It was the same chip but it behaved in a different way.Microsoft started to install the chips en masse in 2015. Now, just about every new server loaded into a Microsoft data center includes one of these programmable chips. They help choose the results when you search Bing, and they help Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing service, shuttle information across its network of underlying machines.In fall 2016, another team of Microsoft researchers \u2014 mirroring the work done by Jeff Dean at Google \u2014 built a neural network that could, by one measure at least, recognize spoken words more accurately than the average human could.Xuedong Huang and his fellow Microsoft researchers had trained their speech-recognition service using large numbers of specialty chips supplied by Nvidia, rather than relying heavily on ordinary Intel chips. Their breakthrough would not have been possible had they not made that change.\u201cWe closed the gap with humans in about a year,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Mr. Huang said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the weapon \u2014 the infrastructure \u2014 it would have taken at least five years.\u201dBecause systems that rely on neural networks can learn largely on their own, they can evolve more quickly than traditional services. They are not as reliant on engineers writing endless lines of code that explain how they should behave.But there is a wrinkle: Training neural networks this way requires extensive trial and error. To create one that is able to recognize words as well as a human can, researchers must train it repeatedly, tweaking the algorithms and improving the training data over and over. At any given time, this process unfolds over hundreds of algorithms. That requires enormous computing power, and if companies like Microsoft use standard-issue chips to do it, the process takes far too long because the chips cannot handle the load and too much electrical power is consumed.So, the leading internet companies are now training their neural networks with help from another type of chip called a graphics processing unit, or G.P.U. These low-power chips \u2014 usually made by Nvidia \u2014 were originally designed to render images for games and other software, and they worked hand-in-hand with the chip \u2014 usually made by Intel \u2014 at the center of a computer. G.P.U.s can process the math required by neural networks far more efficiently than C.P.U.s.Nvidia is thriving as a result, and it is now selling large numbers of G.P.U.s to the internet giants of the United States and the biggest online companies around the world, in China most notably. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue from data center sales tripled to $409 million over the past year.G.P.U.s are the primary vehicles that companies use to teach their neural networks a particular task, but that is only part of the process. Once a neural network is trained for a task, it must perform it, and that requires a different kind of computing power.After training a speech-recognition algorithm, for example, Microsoft offers it up as an online service, and it actually starts identifying commands that people speak into their smartphones. G.P.U.s are not quite as efficient during this stage of the process. So, many companies are now building chips specifically to do what the other chips have learned.Google built its own specialty chip, a Tensor Processing Unit, or T.P.U. Nvidia is building a similar chip. And Microsoft has reprogrammed specialized chips from Altera, which was acquired by Intel, so that it too can run neural networks more easily.Other companies are following suit. Qualcomm, which specializes in chips for smartphones, and a number of start-ups are also working on A.I. chips, hoping to grab their piece of the rapidly expanding market. The tech research firm IDC predicts that revenue from servers equipped with alternative chips will reach $6.8 billion by 2021, about 10 percent of the overall server market.Across Microsoft\u2019s global network of machines, Mr. Burger pointed out, alternative chips are still a relatively modest part of the operation. And Bart Sano, the vice president of engineering who leads hardware and software development for Google\u2019s network, said much the same about the chips deployed at its data centers.Mike Mayberry, who leads Intel Labs, played down the shift toward alternative processors, perhaps because Intel controls more than 90 percent of the data-center market, making it by far the largest seller of traditional chips. He said that if central processors were modified the right way, they could handle new tasks without added help.But this new breed of silicon is spreading rapidly, and Intel is increasingly a company in conflict with itself. It is in some ways denying that the market is changing, but nonetheless shifting its business to keep up with the change.Two years ago, Intel spent $16.7 billion to acquire Altera, which builds the programmable chips that Microsoft uses. It was Intel\u2019s largest acquisition ever. Last year, the company paid a reported $408 million buying Nervana, a company that was exploring a chip just for executing neural networks. Now, led by the Nervana team, Intel is developing a dedicated chip for training and executing neural networks.\u201cThey have the traditional big-company problem,\u201d said Bill Coughran, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital who spent nearly a decade helping to oversee Google\u2019s online infrastructure, referring to Intel. \u201cThey need to figure out how to move into the new and growing areas without damaging their traditional business.\u201dIntel\u2019s internal conflict is most apparent when company officials discuss the decline of Moore\u2019s Law. During a recent interview with The New York Times, Naveen Rao, the Nervana founder and now an Intel executive, said Intel could squeeze \u201ca few more years\u201d out of Moore\u2019s Law. Officially, the company\u2019s position is that improvements in traditional chips will continue well into the next decade.Mr. Mayberry of Intel also argued that the use of additional chips was not new. In the past, he said, computer makers used separate chips for tasks like processing audio.But now the scope of the trend is significantly larger. And it is changing the market in new ways. Intel is competing not only with chipmakers like Nvidia and Qualcomm, but also with companies like Google and Microsoft.Google is designing the second generation of its T.P.U. chips. Later this year, the company said, any business or developer that is a customer of its cloud-computing service will be able to use the new chips to run its software.While this shift is happening mostly inside the massive data centers that underpin the internet, it is probably a matter of time before it permeates the broader industry.The hope is that this new breed of mobile chip can help devices handle more, and more complex, tasks on their own, without calling back to distant data centers: phones recognizing spoken commands without accessing the internet; driverless cars recognizing the world around them with a speed and accuracy that is not possible now.In other words, a driverless car needs cameras and radar and lasers. But it also needs a brain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Velocity School: Where Pitchers Pay to Throw Harder", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKENT, Wash. \u2014 Trevor Bauer is the son of a chemical engineer. Those are the genes he inherited. An engineer, Bauer explained, will consider a problem, develop a process to solve it, then implement, evaluate and adjust until finding a solution. Nothing is untrainable.Bauer did not want to be a chemical engineer, though. He wanted to be, and still wants to be, the best pitcher in baseball. He succeeded on the mound as a boy in California, yet his peers who threw harder, even by a little bit, made the best travel teams and attracted more attention.\u201cI was like, \u2018O.K., I\u2019m tired of those people getting opportunities over me because I don\u2019t throw as hard,\u2019\u201d Bauer said recently, in the Cleveland Indians\u2019 clubhouse at Fenway Park. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I throw harder?\u201dBauer threw 78 miles an hour as a high school freshman. The summer after that season, he visited a coach in Texas, Ron Wolforth, to do something about it. In a few years, Bauer became a hard-throwing first-round draft pick and was soon in a major league rotation.For most pitchers, from sandlots to stadiums, velocity has never been a decision. Anything else in pitching can be learned \u2014 from teammates, coaches, even books. But nobody teaches a fastball, it is said; either you throw hard or you don\u2019t.Dan Straily, a starter for the Miami Marlins, listed his pitches on the bench before a recent game. A college teammate taught him his slider. A major league teammate taught him his curveball. A minor league coach taught him his changeup.\u201cAnd then everyone throws a fastball,\u201d Straily said. \u201cI\u2019ve thrown the same four-seam fastball forever.\u201dYet Bauer and Straily have shown that the fastball can be taught \u2014 by building a better one, in Bauer\u2019s case, or restoring a missing one, in Straily\u2019s. Neither has been an All-Star, but both have become durable, dependable starters, the kind worth millions to teams. Without the baseline of a respectable fastball \u2014 94 miles an hour for Bauer, 90 for Straily \u2014 they probably could not survive in the modern game.They symbolize, and have helped fuel, the speed game baseball has gradually become. According to FanGraphs, the average fastball in 2002 was 89 m.p.h. It has crept higher in each of the last seven seasons, to 92.8 m.p.h. Rising velocity is changing the sport, and all but shutting out pitchers who can\u2019t keep up.That is why, under morning clouds in late June, dozens of young pitchers \u2014 mostly on break from college programs \u2014 strode purposefully around the parking lots of Driveline\u2019s modest home at an industrial park near Sea-Tac Airport, holding kettlebell weights over their heads or wiggling long sticks (called shoulder tubes, for warm-up and recovery) in front of their chests. They were some of the many aspiring pros who work with House, Wolforth, Boddy and other coaches who can help them throw hard enough to be noticed.And yet, if they do not know it already, they will soon learn that velocity alone is not enough to succeed at the highest level. The game is too intricate and filled with too many hitters who can adjust. But without that velocity, the rest may never come into play.\u201cThere\u2019s a floor, like: \u2018You have to throw this hard, and if you don\u2019t, then you\u2019re not a big leaguer,\u2019\u201d Boddy said. \u201cBut people take it way too far. It\u2019s only important insomuch that you need it to get past the gate.\u201dBoddy has several units at his complex, including one to store Driveline\u2019s inventory of brightly colored PlyoCare balls, weighing from 3.5 ounces to 4.4 pounds. (Standard baseballs are 5 to 5.25 ounces.) In another unit, while one pitcher works in a screened-in bullpen, others fire the weighted balls, from close range, at padded walls. Still another unit acts as a laboratory, with 12 high-speed cameras surrounding a mound, capturing biomechanical data while a cluster of computers tracks every movement in intimate detail.\u201cWhen you go watch the video,\u201d Straily said, \u201cyou can see the hair on your finger.\u201dOfficials from at least 10 major league teams have toured the facilities. Tony Cingrani, a reliever traded last month from Cincinnati to the Los Angeles Dodgers, spent a week at Driveline last fall to analyze his pitches in real time, study the spin of his slider and get a template for his off-season workouts. Dodgers starter Brandon McCarthy visited, too, after experiencing sudden, unsettling bursts of wildness late last season. He said he was drawn to Boddy\u2019s approach.\u201cIt\u2019s scientific, but it\u2019s also just very raw and aggressive,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt\u2019s lift-heavy, try to throw hard, less of the art of pitching and more just getting after it. There\u2019s also some science in what they\u2019re doing in terms of pitch development, and I like that it\u2019s an independent place that\u2019s not tethered to a team, where you have to take one person\u2019s philosophy. You go there and you can tinker and play. They\u2019re open to studying everything.\u201dBoddy pitched in high school, but his arm always hurt and no one could tell him why. He worked as a software developer at Microsoft but was endlessly fascinated by the science of pitching, and probing the secrets to arm health and potential. He started Driveline in 2008 and now works with more than 500 pitchers a year.The fastest pitch on record is 105 m.p.h., by Aroldis Chapman as a rookie in 2010. Boddy said the maximum, someday, will most likely be 107 to 110 m.p.h. \u2014 but more significantly, the velocity bell curve will continue shifting to the right. That is, more pitchers will cluster around 95 m.p.h., meaning that virtually all pro pitchers must be selected from that group. And some will become disposable, a trend that is already evident.\u201cThere\u2019s tons of guys that throw 95-plus, and their average career is like a running back in the N.F.L.,\u201d Boddy said. \u201cThey pitch two or three years and then they\u2019re done.\u201dBoddy tries to stay ahead of this evolution by equipping pitchers with the fastball to compete and the understanding of their craft\u2019s physiology. He hangs the jerseys of his major league clients on the wall behind the bullpen netting: Bauer, Straily, Detroit\u2019s Matt Boyd, Kansas City\u2019s Ryan Buchter and others.When Straily visits, he said, young hopefuls look at him in awe because they envy his status. He envies them, too, he said, for how hard they throw. Yet Straily knows something they don\u2019t: how to get outs in the majors, without fear. A 24th-round draft choice by Oakland out of Marshall University in 2009, he arrived in the majors in 2012 and started in the playoffs the next October.But in 2014, his shoulder ached. His velocity fell sharply, and hitters hammered his mistakes. He was sent to the minors, traded to the Chicago Cubs, then dealt to Houston, where he barely pitched. With the blessing of the Astros \u2014 whose general manager, Jeff Luhnow, has toured Driveline and consulted with Boddy \u2014 Straily went to Driveline after the 2015 season to strengthen his shoulder. He knew that harder throwers always get more chances, and hoped to raise his minimum velocity back to respectability.\u201cIf I would have just walked into Kyle\u2019s and said, \u2018Make me throw 95,\u2019\u201d Straily said, \u201che would have said, \u2018All right, there\u2019s the door, we\u2019ll see you later.\u2019\u201dFrom Driveline, Straily said, he simply wanted a foundation, so he could map out his ideal delivery to put his arm in its strongest, most stable position. The adjustments have turned around his career: In the two seasons before starting Boddy\u2019s program, he went 1-4 in the majors. In the two seasons since, he is 23-17, and he said his arm was never sore.\u201cThe most important stuff is the boring recovery work,\u201d Boddy said. \u201cThey do tons of stuff that you would do in rehab if you get injured.\u201dBauer has never had an arm injury, and believes hard throwers can stay healthy if they move properly. Though he has trained with Boddy since reaching the majors in 2012, his work before that, with Wolforth, helped put him on the path to dominance at U.C.L.A., where he struck out more than 11 hitters per nine innings and became the No. 3 overall draft choice in 2011.Wolforth started his business in 1993, and a decade ago, he said, teams viewed him as a pariah. He could help pupils throw hard enough to get signed, but mainly built pitchers who could win teddy bears at carnivals, not actual games. In that case, he thought, what was the point?\u201cThere was real criticism: You get a Wolforth guy in 2008, he\u2019s going to throw the ball through a carwash and not get it wet, but I\u2019m not sure he could throw it over the white thing,\u201d Wolforth said. \u201cAnd now, when we send a guy up, not only can they throw it over the white thing and throw it hard, but they can also recover, and their pitch ability goes very high. We have shifted our emphasis and broadened it.\u201dToday, Wolforth said, he spends more time teaching mechanics, secondary pitches and command than teaching velocity. He consults with about half of the major league teams and has helped rejuvenate the careers of several wayward pitchers, including at least two former Cy Young Award winners.When pitchers suddenly throw harder, Wolforth said, they must also learn the right way to decelerate in their follow-through; using Volkswagen Beetle brakes on a Maserati, he said, invites disaster. Wolforth believes that with a comprehensive, individualized program, all pitchers can find their maximum velocity. But that is only part of what they need.\u201cThe radar gun doesn\u2019t tell us if they can pitch or not,\u201d Wolforth said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple, snap way to tell something, and sometimes it\u2019s not the best way, but people like it because it immediately gives you feedback and it\u2019s comparable.\u201dThe Indians, in particular, have embraced some of the strategies used by Wolforth and Boddy. Four of their starters \u2014 Bauer, Josh Tomlin, Mike Clevinger and Danny Salazar \u2014 use weighted balls in their training, but Corey Kluber and Carlos Carrasco do not. Every pitcher has a program specifically tailored for him.Yet even the most carefully scripted training does not always work. Salazar, who missed two playoff rounds last fall because of a forearm injury, spent time on the disabled list this summer because of elbow inflammation. He is the Indians\u2019 hardest-throwing starter, with a fastball averaging about 95 m.p.h., but now he is in the bullpen, an afterthought in Cleveland\u2019s 21-game winning streak entering Thursday.As velocity rises, the theory goes, so do pitching injuries. Both are up this year. But simply blaming velocity may be too simple. Throwing too hard, too often, with improper mechanics, at too young an age \u2014 all of those factors can damage developing ligaments and tendons. And the best predictor of future injury is past injury.Yet it would also be wrong to scold amateurs for pitching to the radar gun. They are only following the new rules of the game.\u201cVelo is king, at least in the draft process, amateur ball and up into minor league ball,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cOnce you get to the big leagues, and you\u2019re here, getting outs and stuff like that is king. But up until the big leagues, velo is king, and in the minor leagues, guys that have poor results but throw really hard get a lot more opportunities than guys that have really good results but throw 86 or 88.\u201dWith so many hard throwers, House said, the traditional starting pitcher, as we know the role now, will soon cease to exist. Future staffs, he predicted, will be made up of 12 pitchers throwing three times a week, with nobody working more than 45 pitches per game or going more than once through the lineup.To some extent, this is happening. In the last World Series, no starting pitcher got an out past the sixth inning. Only 15 pitchers threw 200 innings last season, the fewest ever in a nonstrike year. Teams eagerly draw from the deep well of hard throwers stocking their farm systems.\u201cWhen I first got called up, the pitchers they were going with were guys that were 88 to 92, with sink and cut \u2014 veteran guys that could spot it up,\u201d said Houston catcher Brian McCann, a 13-year veteran. \u201cOver time, we\u2019ve realized that the prospect in Triple A that throws hard is a way more uncomfortable at-bat than the other guy.\u201dOf course, hitters would not be in the majors if they could not connect with straight fastballs. And while velocities are rising, pitchers are actually throwing fewer and fewer fastballs. Just 55.6 percent of all pitches have been fastballs this season, the lowest figure in the 16 seasons tracked by FanGraphs.Curveball and slider use is up, and Bauer is no exception. Almost 30 percent of his pitches this season have been curveballs, easily the highest percentage of his career. Just under 50 percent of his pitches are fastballs, even though he throws it harder than ever. Better fastballs lead to better off-speed pitches.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got to start your bat sooner,\u201d Wolforth said, \u201cthat makes your secondary stuff better immediately.\u201d\u201cThe only way they\u2019re doing damage against some of these guys is to keep swinging for the fences, keep going for the home run,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cThe pitching\u2019s so good now that you just don\u2019t see six consecutive singles anymore. Guys are throwing too hard and have too much nasty off-speed stuff.\u201dAnother overlooked factor in the home run surge across the majors \u2014 anecdotally, at least \u2014 is a general lack of fastball command.\u201cI feel like with the velocity that\u2019s been added to the game, the command has gone down, and there\u2019s a sacrifice that\u2019s being made,\u201d said Cincinnati\u2019s Joey Votto, who has both 30 homers and 100 walks for the first time in his decorated career. \u201cThere\u2019s more swings and misses, but there\u2019s also more mistakes that are cruising towards the middle of the plate or off for balls.\u201dIn such an environment, the pitcher with precise command, even with less heat, can still find a way to dominate. Dallas Keuchel won a Cy Young Award for Houston in 2015, and made the All-Star team again this season.Keuchel, whose fastball has never averaged 90 m.p.h., said he had been lucky to arrive in the majors when the Astros were struggling, because they could afford to be patient as he developed. In a different organization \u2014 with more pressure to win, harder-throwing prospects to try, or both \u2014 he might have been buried.\u201cDallas is an outlier,\u201d said Luhnow, the Astros\u2019 general manager. \u201cHis command is worth more than a guy who can throw 98.\u201dBauer led the American League in walks two years ago, but now he has the lowest walk rate and highest strikeout rate of his career, and has been one of the hottest pitchers in the majors, winning his last nine decisions to improve to 16-8.But opponents have hit .341 on balls in play, an unusually high number, and his earned run average is 4.33, roughly matching the major league average.Bauer considers more than those numbers, of course. He believes he moves as efficiently as, or more efficiently than, anyone else in baseball. All he needs, he said, is more strength and power, and sharper game theory. He said his continuing research projects might help.Bauer has filmed bullpen sessions of his teammate Kluber, whose pitches dart and swerve like few others. A few years ago, Bauer spent $30,000 on a TrackMan device, the kind installed at every major league park. He hoped it would help him understand why the ball came off his fingers and spun the way it did, so he could train himself to repeat it. He also spent $6,000 on a camera that shot 18,000 frames per second.This season, the Mets had four of the top 20 pitchers who threw the most pitches over 95 m.p.h.The investment in his future, and the curiosity that fuels it, has paid off nicely for Bauer. He doubled his salary from last year to this year and now makes $3.55 million, with another raise likely through salary arbitration.When he first came to the majors with Arizona, Bauer said, trainers worked against him, discouraging his use of weighted balls and long toss, trying to make him conform to their structure. Now, he said, when the Indians promote minor leaguers, the first question they ask is where to find the weighted balls.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a massive surge in ability level,\u201d said Bauer, who tries to continually evolve and hopes for the same from his sport. He wants to lead the way.\u201cIf I have one really good season and I\u2019m contending for a Cy Young Award, then hopefully it will blow up,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause now instead of like, \u2018Hey, you stink, these training methods don\u2019t work,\u2019 from some casual fan or Twitter troll, all of a sudden it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s pretty good, and he does this, maybe I should start trying to do that.\u2019\u201cIt will blow up,\u201d Bauer repeated, with an engineer\u2019s assurance. \u201cI need to have one good season.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are suddenly interested in working with you.\u201dWhich goes some way toward explaining why a cadre of nominees and presenters at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday night chose to march in lock step, decisively turning their backs on the intentionally contour-shrouding looks that have overtaken the high fashion runways.Cutting-edge fashion, as defined by a noisy claque of magazine editors and bloggers, is not their friend, they know. Better to stick with tradition, some reasoned, swapping vanguard style for old Hollywood vavoom.Shailene Woodley seemed to have embraced that brief. The best supporting actress nominee in a limited series, for the HBO show \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d wore a custom Ralph Lauren dress in witchy green velvet, its V-form neckline dropping to her waist.Still, red-carpet veterans like Nicole Kidman had other ideas. Ms. Kidman, named best actress in a limited series for \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d chose to underscore her stature as a worldly fashion muse. Deftly negotiating the wobbly line between steaminess and cool, she wore a scarlet ballerina-length Calvin Klein dress of silk gazar, demure except for its coyly slit neckline.Image-savvy and by no means trend-averse, Zo\u00eb Kravitz of \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d reinforced her reputation as tastemaker in Christian Dior couture, the varicolored panels of her dress embroidered in tufts of feathers.That dress was one in a series of departures from the vaunted midcentury throwback, the trumpet-skirted mermaid gown. Claire Foy, who had been nominated as the lead actress in a drama series for her role in the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown,\u201d wore a crystal-trimmed black Oscar de la Renta jumpsuit, racy in its sleekness. It was topped for sheer nerve by Evan Rachel Wood\u2019s riskier, if more memorable, choice: a white dinner jacket, bustier top and tails whipped up for the HBO \u201cWestworld\u201d best actress nominee by Jeremy Scott of Moschino.The event\u2019s stroll of fame did, unexpectedly, spawn a few trends. Any number of stars were sheathed goddess-style in molten silver. But Millie Bobby Brown of the Netflix series \u201cStranger Things,\u201d at 13 one of the Emmys\u2019 youngest-ever contenders, opted quite consciously for something more virginal, strolling the carpet in a strapless, full-skirted white Calvin Klein gown that could have doubled as a wedding dress. In a similar mood, Elisabeth Moss, named best actress for her role in \u201cA Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d from Hulu, chose a pale pink confection by Prabal Gurung that had all the freshness, and calculated na\u00efvet\u00e9, of a 1950s prom gown.Ms. Kravitz herself advanced this tender theme with a gamine look that brought to mind a waifish Mia Farrow.

{"Headline": "IBM Now Has More Employees in India Than in the U.S.", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "IBM has shifted its center of gravity halfway around the world to India, making it a high-tech example of the globalization trends that the Trump administration has railed against.Supported byBANGALORE, India \u2014 IBM dominated the early decades of computing with inventions like the mainframe and the floppy disk. Its offices and factories, stretching from upstate New York to Silicon Valley, were hubs of American innovation long before Microsoft or Google came along.But over the last decade, IBM has shifted its center of gravity halfway around the world to India, making it a high-tech example of the globalization trends that the Trump administration has railed against.Today, the company employs 130,000 people in India \u2014 about one-third of its total work force, and more than in any other country. Their work spans the entire gamut of IBM\u2019s businesses, from managing the computing needs of global giants like AT&T and Shell to performing cutting-edge research in fields like visual search, artificial intelligence and computer vision for self-driving cars. One team is even working with the producers of Sesame Street to teach vocabulary to kindergartners in Atlanta.\u201cIBM India, in the truest sense, is a microcosm of the IBM company,\u201d Vanitha Narayanan, chairman of the company\u2019s Indian operations, said in an interview at IBM\u2019s main campus in Bangalore, where the office towers are named after American golf courses like Peachtree and Pebble Beach.The work in India has been vital to keeping down costs at IBM, which has posted 21 consecutive quarters of revenue declines as it has struggled to refashion its main business of supplying tech services to corporations and governments.The tech industry has been shifting jobs overseas for decades, and other big American companies like Oracle and Dell also employ a majority of their workers outside the United States.But IBM is unusual because it employs more people in a single foreign country than it does at home. The company\u2019s employment in India has nearly doubled since 2007, even as its work force in the United States has shrunk through waves of layoffs and buyouts. Although IBM refuses to disclose exact numbers, outsiders estimate that it employs well under 100,000 people at its American offices now, down from 130,000 in 2007. Depending on the job, the salaries paid to Indian workers are one-half to one-fifth those paid to Americans, according to data posted by the research firm Glassdoor.Ronil Hira, an associate professor of public policy at Howard University who studies globalization and immigration, said the range of work done by IBM in India shows that offshoring threatens even the best-paying American tech jobs.\u201cThe elites in both parties have had this Apple iPhone narrative, which is, look, it\u2019s O.K. if we offshore the lower-level stuff because we\u2019re just going to move up,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a wake-up call. It\u2019s not just low-level jobs but high-level jobs that are leaving.\u201dWhile other technology titans have also established huge satellite campuses in India, IBM caught the attention of President Trump. At a campaign rally in Minneapolis just before the November election, he accused the company of laying off 500 Minnesotans and moving their jobs to India and other countries, a claim that IBM denied.IBM declined to make Ms. Rometty or another top executive available for an interview. But the company noted that it is investing in the United States, including committing $1 billion to training programs and opening new offices.Ms. Narayanan, who spent 12 years working at IBM in the United States and China before moving to India in 2009, said the company decided where to put jobs based on where it could find enough qualified workers and the customer\u2019s budget. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if someone says, \u2018Oh, jeez, let me just take these jobs from here and put them there,\u2019\u201d she said.William Lazonick, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, who has studied the globalization of business, said IBM and other tech companies had benefited greatly from the emergence of a low-cost, technically skilled English-speaking work force in India.\u201cIBM didn\u2019t create this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut IBM would be a totally different company if it wasn\u2019t for India.\u201dIBM, which opened its first Indian offices in Mumbai and Delhi in 1951, is now spread across the country, including Bangalore, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Chennai.Most of the Indian employees work in IBM\u2019s core business: helping companies like AT&T and Airbus manage the technical sides of their operations. Indians perform consulting services, write software and monitor cloud-based computer systems for many of the world\u2019s banks, phone companies and governments.But researchers here also try out new ideas. Looking to build a new system for searching with images instead of words, a team in Bangalore turned to Watson to index 600,000 photos from the world\u2019s top fashion shows and Bollywood movies. Last spring, a major Indian fashion house, Falguni Shane Peacock, tried the tool, which helps designers avoid direct copies or even do a riff on an old look, and generated new patterns for three dresses.\u201cIt has the capability of doing research in a couple of seconds that would take a long time,\u201d Shane Peacock, who runs the Mumbai firm with his wife, said in an interview.IBM even has a Bangalore \u201cgarage\u201d full of app designers who build corporate iPhone and iPad apps to simplify tasks like helping airline agents rebook passengers, bankers make loans and doctors update patient files.During a recent visit, Ramya Karyampudi, a user experience designer, was at the whiteboard sketching out an app for a smart refrigerator that would solve the universal problem of what to make for dinner.Starting with a drawing of a husband trying to plan a surprise meal for his wife, Ms. Karyampudi depicted the internet-connected refrigerator looking at what food was inside, sending over relevant recipes, telling him what extra ingredients he needed to pick up, and playing a video showing him how to cook it all.IBM re-entered the country through a joint venture with Tata in 1993, initially intending to assemble and sell personal computers. IBM\u2019s leaders soon decided that India\u2019s potential was far bigger \u2014 both as a market and as a base from which to serve customers around the world. The company took full control of the venture, established an Indian branch of its famed research labs, and in 2004, landed a landmark 10-year, $750 million contract from Bharti Airtel, one of India\u2019s biggest phone companies, which remains a major customer.IBM\u2019s chief executive at the time, Samuel J. Palmisano, was so proud of his India initiative that he rented out the grounds of the Bangalore Palace in June 2006, flew out the board, and told a crowd of 10,000 that IBM would invest $6 billion in India over the next three years.Today, India does not just deliver services to IBM\u2019s global clients. It is also a crucial market and the center of IBM\u2019s efforts to help businesses serve the next big slice of customers: the billions of poorer people who have been largely ignored by the tech revolution.For example, teams here have been applying IBM technology to process very small loans so that banks can make a profit on them.IBM has also been working with Manipal Hospitals, a chain based in Bangalore, to adapt Watson to help doctors treat certain cancers. Presented with a patient\u2019s medical history, the system taps into a database that includes advice from doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to recommend the best treatments \u2014 including the price, a big consideration since most Indians lack health insurance.Dr. Ajay Bakshi, Manipal\u2019s chief executive, said the biggest potential for the technology was in rural hospitals with few doctors. Manipal has just begun offering online \u201csecond opinions\u201d from Watson for 2000 rupees, or about $31. \u201cIt never sleeps. It never forgets. It doesn\u2019t get biased,\u201d he said.IBM executives say projects like these represent the company\u2019s future. \u201cI am looking for India to be my hub for affordable innovation,\u201d Ms. Narayanan said.Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Older Americans Stand to Lose if \u2018Dreamers\u2019 Are Deported", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move, Mr. Sheik said, would compound an already \u201cdisastrous situation in terms of shortages of supply.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is a big issue we\u2019re focusing on.\u201dIn health care, on the other hand, the economic impact could be significant, depriving patients of help they depend on and driving up costs for families and taxpayers.Surveys of DACA beneficiaries reveal that roughly one-fifth of them work in the health care and educational sector, suggesting a potential loss of tens of thousands of workers from in-demand job categories like home health aide and nursing assistant.At the same time, projections by the government and advocacy groups show that the economy will need to add hundreds of thousands of workers in these fields over the next five to 10 years simply to keep up with escalating demand, caused primarily by a rapidly aging population.Josue De Luna Navarro, a DACA beneficiary, came to the United States from Mexico when he was 9 years old. He became interested in a career in health care after his father nearly died from complications relating to heart disease.Now a 21-year-old senior at the University of New Mexico, Mr. Navarro works as a health assistant at a clinic in Albuquerque and plans to apply to medical school after he graduates.He worries that if DACA is revoked, he will not be able to work at all. \u201cWithout that work permit, my career in medicine will be very, very difficult,\u201d he said.Under the Obama-era program, recipients had to apply to renew their status every two years. The Trump administration said on Tuesday that some beneficiaries would be able to renew their status up until Oct. 5. Others could face deportation beginning in March, unless Congress intervenes beforehand.Experts say the effects of undoing the program could quickly ripple out from DACA beneficiaries to other workers.\u201cIt destabilizes that work force,\u201d said Robert Espinoza, vice president for policy at PHI, a group that advocates on behalf of personal care workers. \u201cIf you are seeing family members, children, neighbors being deported, threatened, and so on, the ability to be present on the job is undermined.\u201dThe health care field\u2019s reliance on immigrant labor makes it particularly vulnerable. According to census data Mr. Osterman analyzed, more than one-quarter of home health aides in 2015 were immigrants. The proportion in certain states is far higher, reaching nearly one-half in California and nearly two-thirds in New York.\u201cWe know from surveys that T.P.S. recipients are highly represented in the work force in certain areas,\u201d said Tom Jawetz, a vice president of the Center for American Progress, a think tank that favors more liberal immigration policies. \u201cIn particular, many \u2014 especially Haitians \u2014 work in home health care.\u201dThis may be welcome on some level: The department estimates that the typical home health aide made less than $25,000 in 2016, for a job that can be physically and emotionally grueling.The economic problem is twofold, however. First, the government, through Medicaid, often pays the salaries of home health workers, meaning that escalating wages could blow a hole in the federal budget. (Medicaid, through the decisions of the state and federal governments, effectively caps compensation for home health workers, but the caps could rise more quickly in a world of plunging labor supply.)Second, an acute shortage of home health workers could force many older and disabled Americans out of their homes and into care facilities, where costs are roughly two-to-three times the cost of home care for a full year. The government typically picks up that tab as well.Still, it is the personal toll that may be greatest: A patient\u2019s quality of life tends to be far higher when they can continue living in their own home.For patients and families who rely on immigrant workers, \u201cif that person is gone, can\u2019t get renewed, it\u2019s not a cute thing,\u201d Professor Osterman said. \u201cA home health aide is what lets you stay at home.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what else the company had to say.\u2022 iPhone X is priced at $999, the most expensive ever for a new iPhone model. It will ship on Nov. 3. (Pro tip: The X is pronounced 10, and not \u201cex.\u201d)\u2022 The phone has a newer screen technology known as OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD.\u2022 The screen on the X has a so-called edge-to-edge display that takes up the entire face by eliminating the borders around the screen. Apple also eliminated the physical home button that has been a signature feature of the iPhone for a decade.\u2022 iPhone 8 is also here, as well as its bigger sibling, the iPhone 8 Plus. The models include a glass body and a faster chip.\u2022 Apple TV, the company\u2019s set-top box that has never been a blockbuster hit, got an upgrade.

Called Apple Watch Series 3, it has cellular capabilities. There\u2019s also a new Watch OS.With the $999 iPhone X, Apple moved to a new premium level of pricing. The smartphone will cost $300 more than the iPhone 8 and $200 more than the iPhone 8 Plus.While that will be too expensive for many people, the company said it saw the iPhone X defining a new era for the smartphone, much like the original iPhone did 10 years ago. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the device would \u201cset the path for the next decade.\u201d That\u2019s because Apple will likely build on some of the iPhone X\u2019s most notable features, including infrared facial recognition, wireless battery charging and sophisticated camera effects.Consumer reaction to the new phone will have a big impact on the company\u2019s revenue and stock price. Right now, analysts are betting on a slow uptake of the top-end phone, both because of production delays and the high price. But if it turns out to be an unexpected hit, like the iPhone 6 Plus and 7 Plus, the company\u2019s sales \u2014 and stock price \u2014 could surge.Wall Street wasn\u2019t immediately dazzled by Apple\u2019s presentation, however, with the stock price down more than 1 percent by the end of the event.The iPhone X is the first redesigned iPhone in three years, and Apple says it is the blueprint for \u201cthe future of the smartphone.\u201d Many of the design details had leaked to the press before today\u2019s unveiling \u2014 we\u2019d heard that it would have a new display that stretched across much more of the phone\u2019s front, and that it would do away with the trademark home button.Much of that turned out to be true. The iPhone X is essentially the same size and overall shape as the iPhone 7, but because the screen occupies all of the front of the phone, it is far larger than that of older models. The screen uses a technology new for Apple (which many competitors already use), called OLED. It produces better image quality than Apple\u2019s older LCD screens.What we didn\u2019t quite know was how Apple would integrate the new button-free design with the operating system \u2014 how would you navigate the phone without a physical button?It\u2019s quite simple: You swipe. To go home, swipe up from the bottom of the screen. To see other apps, swipe up from the bottom and pause \u2014 now you see the multitasking pane. And to unlock your phone, you look at it. The iPhone X eliminates Apple\u2019s Touch ID, and replaces it with a facial-recognition system that Apple calls Face ID.Whether people will adjust to the button-free system remains to be seen. For better or worse, Apple has used essentially the same interface for the iPhone for the last decade. Swiping is easy, but it isn\u2019t as easy as hitting a button, and it may throw some people off at first. The learning curve will be interesting to watch.\u2014 Farhad ManjooThe brand-new feature in the iPhone X that has never existed on any other iPhone is infrared face scanning.The technology, called Face ID, uses an infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person\u2019s head to unlock the phone and authorize mobile payments. The technology works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can then stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.For Apple, Face ID has been years in the making. In 2013, the iPhone maker acquired PrimeSense, a company that developed sensors for Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, a camera system that scanned people\u2019s bodies so people could play Xbox games using body movements.Face ID is a direct response to the face-recognition feature in smartphones offered by Samsung, Apple\u2019s fiercest rival. Experts have criticized Samsung\u2019s face-recognition feature, which could be tricked by holding a photo of the smartphone owner\u2019s face in front of the camera.Brian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, gives answers to more than two dozen reader questions about Apple\u2019s new devices.The new iPhone 8 line includes the iPhone 8 and its bigger sibling, the 8 Plus.The phones include a six-core processor that will handle more complex tasks and 3D games more quickly and efficiently than previous iPhones. The phones generally look the same as their predecessors, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with the exception of glass bodies, as opposed to aluminum.Apple improved the phones\u2019 cameras with new sensors and added new motion sensors to better support applications made for augmented reality, which use data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through a smartphone lens.In particular, the dual cameras in the iPhone 8 Plus take photos with sharp details in low light. Apple also added a new portrait mode to improve the lighting on faces regardless of the background.Another notable new feature is the introduction of magnetic induction to the iPhones. Similar to Apple Watch, the iPhones can now be charged by being placed on a charging pad as opposed to being plugged in with a cable.The new iPhone 8 line will be one of the most important for Apple. Wall Street analysts have estimated that more than half of iPhone buyers will buy the 8 and 8 Plus over the next year. The models have a slightly higher starting price than their predecessors: The iPhone 8 starts at $699, up from $650 for older iPhone models.The new Apple TV, called Apple TV 4K, it is an iteration of the last model, which introduced a touch pad remote control. The new box will now be able to stream so-called 4K resolution, which refers to screens with two times the vertical resolution and twice the horizontal resolution of older high-definition TVs. Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services, added that 4K titles would cost the same to purchase as traditional high-definition titles, and those who previously bought high-definition titles would be upgraded to 4K at no additional cost.Apple said the new Apple TV 4K is also two times faster than the last one and includes support for a new color technology called H.D.R., or high dynamic range. This software feature enhances the contrast and color profile of a picture. In bright colors, you will see brighter highlights; in dark colors, you will see more details.The Apple Watch has been a sleeper hit for the company. Though early reviews were mixed, Apple has steadily improved the device, and now the smartwatch is the best-selling watch in the world, according to Apple.Today, Apple unveiled the third version of the device. It looks identical to the old version, but the new one carries a much-requested feature for the first time: It will come with a cellular chip, meaning it can access the internet even if it isn\u2019t connected to your phone. Among other capabilities, the cellular version can make calls, send texts and stream music when you\u2019re on the go.\u201cNow you have the freedom to go anywhere with just the Apple Watch,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer.The cellular version completes a long-term vision for the Watch \u2014 to liberate you, in some small way, from Apple\u2019s best-selling phone. In a demo, a live call was made from the keynote address to an Apple employee on paddle board in the middle of a lake.This is a slightly risky strategy, of course; Apple doesn\u2019t want to kill its golden iPhone goose. But the new cellular watch is unlikely to be a replacement for the phone, just a high-priced complement.The new cellular version sells for $399; a WiFi-only version of the new version sells for $329, and you can still buy the older version for $249. The new watch will begin shipping on Sept. 22.Apple is set to unveil several new gadgets later this morning, but the highlight of today\u2019s event isn\u2019t something you can buy. It\u2019s Apple Park, the company\u2019s new $5 billion spaceship-shaped campus, which the company is showing off to the media for the first time.The press were penned off just out of range of the main building, at the Steve Jobs Theater, the 1,000-seat venue with a commanding view of the spaceship. A quick review: This place is just what you\u2019d imagine an Apple-designed campus would look like. Think of the aesthetics of an Apple Store \u2014 lots of wood and glass, everything in muted tans and greys, all signage in white-on-black Apple Sans type \u2014 set on an otherwise barren landscape.It is, unsurprisingly, very pretty, but its beauty comes with a deliberate touch of fright. Nothing here is to human scale, and the overall impression is one of being overwhelmed by Apple\u2019s sheer might.\u2014 Farhad ManjooAn earlier version of this article misstated the cost comparison of content streamed in 4K resolution on the new Apple TV 4K that was given by Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services. Mr. Cue said that the 4K titles would cost the same to purchase as traditional high-definition titles, not rent.An article on Wednesday about Apple\u2019s newly released iPhone models described incorrectly a phone call made during Apple\u2019s product announcement at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. An executive onstage at headquarters demonstrated Apple Watch capabilities by calling an employee on a paddle board in a lake; the employee did not initiate the call.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Faces a New World as Officials Rein In a Wild Web", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a muggy, late spring evening, Tuan Pham awoke to the police storming his house in Hanoi, Vietnam.They marched him to a police station and made their demand: Hand over your Facebook password. Mr. Tuan, a computer engineer, had recently written a poem on the social network called \u201cMother\u2019s Lullaby,\u201d which criticized how the communist country was run.One line read, \u201cOne century has passed, we are still poor and hungry, do you ask why?\u201dThe diplomatic game that unfolded in Vietnam has become increasingly common for Facebook. The internet is Balkanizing, and the world\u2019s largest tech companies have had to dispatch envoys to, in effect, contain the damage such divisions pose to their ambitions.As nations try to grab back power online, a clash is brewing between governments and companies. Some of the biggest companies in the world \u2014 Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba among them \u2014 are finding they need to play by an entirely new set of rules on the once-anarchic internet.And it\u2019s not just one new set of rules. According to a review by The New York Times, more than 50 countries have passed laws over the last five years to gain greater control over how their people use the web.\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s a grand power struggle,\u201d said David Reed, an early pioneer of the internet and a former professor at the M.I.T. Media Lab. \u201cGovernments started waking up as soon as a significant part of their powers of communication of any sort started being invaded by companies.\u201dFacebook encapsulates the reasons for the internet\u2019s fragmentation \u2014 and increasingly, its consequences.The company has become so far-reaching that more than two billion people \u2014 about a quarter of the world\u2019s population \u2014 now use Facebook each month. Internet users (excluding China) spend one in five minutes online within the Facebook universe, according to comScore, a research firm. And Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, wants that dominance to grow.The Silicon Valley giant\u2019s tussle with the fracturing internet is poised to escalate. Facebook has now reached almost everyone who already has some form of internet access, excluding China. Capturing those last users \u2014 including in Asian nations like Vietnam and African countries like Kenya \u2014 may involve more government roadblocks.\u201cWe understand that and accept that our ideals are not everyone\u2019s,\u201d said Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of communications and public policy. \u201cBut when you look at the data and truly listen to the people around the world who rely on our service, it\u2019s clear that we do a much better job of bringing people together than polarizing them.\u201dBy mid-2016, a yearslong campaign by Facebook to get into China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest internet market \u2014 appeared to be sputtering.At a White House dinner in 2015, Mr. Zuckerberg had even asked the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whether Mr. Xi might offer a Chinese name for his soon-to-be-born first child \u2014 usually a privilege reserved for older relatives, or sometimes a fortune teller. Mr. Xi declined, according to a person briefed on the matter.But all those efforts flopped, foiling Facebook\u2019s attempts to crack one of the most isolated pockets of the internet.China has blocked Facebook and Twitter since mid-2009, after an outbreak of ethnic rioting in the western part of the country. In recent years, similar barriers have gone up for Google services and other apps, like Line and Instagram.For all the courtship, things never quite worked out.\u201cThere\u2019s an interest on both sides of the dance, so some kind of product can be introduced,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google in China who now runs a venture-capital firm in Beijing. \u201cBut what Facebook wants is impossible, and what they can have may not be very meaningful.\u201dOne factor driving Mr. Zuckerberg may be the brisk ad business that Facebook does from its Hong Kong offices, where the company helps Chinese companies \u2014 and the government\u2019s own propaganda organs \u2014 spread their messages. In fact, the scale of the Chinese government\u2019s use of Facebook to communicate abroad offers a notable sign of Beijing\u2019s understanding of Facebook\u2019s power to mold public opinion.Chinese state media outlets have used ad buys to spread propaganda around key diplomatic events. Its stodgy state-run television station and the party mouthpiece newspaper each have far more Facebook \u201clikes\u201d than popular Western news brands like CNN and Fox News, a likely indication of big ad buys.Fittingly, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s eagerness and China\u2019s reluctance can be tracked on Facebook.Last summer, emails winged back and forth between members of Facebook\u2019s global policy team. They were finalizing plans, more than two years in the making, for WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook had bought in 2014, to start sharing data on its one billion users with its new parent company. The company planned to use the data to tailor ads on Facebook\u2019s other services and to stop spam on WhatsApp.A big issue: how to win over wary regulators around the world.By late October, all 28 of Europe\u2019s national data-protection authorities jointly called on Facebook to stop the practice. Facebook quietly mothballed its plans in Europe. It has continued to collect people\u2019s information elsewhere, including the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing awareness that people\u2019s data is controlled by large American actors,\u201d said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France\u2019s privacy regulator. \u201cThese actors now know that times have changed.\u201dFacebook\u2019s retreat shows how Europe is effectively employing regulations \u2014 including tough privacy rules \u2014 to control how parts of the internet are run.The goal of European regulators, officials said, is to give users greater control over the data from social media posts, online searches and purchases that Facebook and other tech giants rely on to monitor our online habits.As a tech company whose ad business requires harvesting digital information, Facebook has often underestimated the deep emotions that European officials and citizens have tied into the collection of such details. That dates back to the time of the Cold War, when many Europeans were routinely monitored by secret police.Now, regulators from Colombia to Japan are often mimicking Europe\u2019s stance on digital privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural European regulators would be at the forefront,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer. \u201cIt reflects the importance they\u2019ve attached to the privacy agenda.\u201dIn interviews, Facebook denied it has played fast and loose with users\u2019 online information and said it complies with national rules wherever it operates. It questioned whether Europe\u2019s position has been effective in protecting individuals\u2019 privacy at a time when the region continues to fall behind the United States and China in all things digital.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the German government is a strong voice inside the European community,\u201d said Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. \u201cWe find their directness pretty helpful.\u201dEurope has the law on its side when dictating global privacy. Facebook\u2019s non-North American users, roughly 1.8 billion people, are primarily overseen by Ireland\u2019s privacy regulator because the company\u2019s international headquarters is in Dublin, mostly for tax reasons. In 2012, Facebook was forced to alter its global privacy settings \u2014 including those in the United States \u2014 after Ireland\u2019s data protection watchdog found problems while auditing the company\u2019s operations there.And on Sept. 12, Spain\u2019s privacy agency fined the company 1.2 million euros for not giving people sufficient control over their data when Facebook collected it from third-party websites. Watchdogs in Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere are conducting similar investigations. Facebook is appealing the Spanish ruling.\u201cFacebook simply can\u2019t stick to a one-size-fits-all product around the world,\u201d said Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who has been a Facebook critic after filing the case that eventually overturned the 15-year-old data deal.Potentially more worrying for Facebook is how Europe\u2019s view of privacy is being exported. Countries from Brazil to Malaysia, which are crucial to Facebook\u2019s growth, have incorporated many of Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules into their legislation.\u201cWe regard the European directives as best practice,\u201d said Pansy Tlakula, chairwoman of South Africa\u2019s Information Regulator, the country\u2019s data protection agency. South Africa has gone so far as to copy whole sections, almost word-for-word, from Europe\u2019s rule book.Blocked in China and troubled by regulators in Europe, Facebook is trying to become \u201cthe internet\u201d in Africa. Helping get people online, subsidizing access, and trying to launch satellites to beam the internet down to the markets it covets, Facebook has become a dominant force on a continent rapidly getting online.But that has given it a power that has made some in Africa uncomfortable.Some countries have blocked access, and outsiders have complained Facebook could squelch rival online business initiatives. Its competition with other internet companies from the United States and China has drawn comparisons to a bygone era of colonialism.For Kenyans like Phyl Cherop, 33, an entrepreneur in Nairobi, online life is already dominated by the social network. She abandoned her bricks-and-mortar store in a middle-class part of the city in 2015 to sell on Facebook and WhatsApp.\u201cI gave it up because people just didn\u2019t come anymore,\u201d said Ms. Cherop, who sells items like designer dresses and school textbooks. She added that a stand-alone website would not have the same reach. \u201cI prefer using Facebook because that\u2019s where my customers are. The first thing people want to do when they buy a smartphone is to open a Facebook account.\u201dAs Facebook hunts for more users, the company\u2019s aspirations have shifted to emerging economies where people like Ms. Cherop live. Less than 50 percent of Africa\u2019s population has internet connectivity, and regulation is often rudimentary.The company has struck partnerships with local carriers to offer basic internet services \u2014 centered on those offered by Facebook \u2014 for free. It has built a pared-down version of its social network to run on the cheaper, less powerful phones that are prevalent there.Facebook is also investing tens of millions of dollars alongside telecom operators to build a 500-mile fiber-optic internet connection in rural Uganda. In total, it is working with about 30 regional governments on digital projects.\u201cWe want to bring connectivity to the world,\u201d said Jay Parikh, a Facebook vice president for engineering who oversees the company\u2019s plans to use drones, satellites and other technology to connect the developing world.Facebook has already hit some bumps in its African push. Chad blocked access to Facebook and other sites during elections or political protests. Uganda also took legal action in Irish courts to force the social network to name an anonymous blogger who had been critical of the government. Those efforts failed.In Kenya, one of Africa\u2019s most connected countries, there has been less pushback.Facebook expanded its efforts in the country of 48 million in 2014. It teamed up with Airtel Africa, a mobile operator, to roll out Facebook\u2019s Free Basics \u2014 a no-fee version of the social network, with access to certain news, health, job and other services there and in more than 20 other countries worldwide. In Kenya, the average person has a budget of just 30 cents a day to spend on internet access.Still, Facebook\u2019s plans have not always worked out. Many Kenyans with access to Free Basics rely on it only as a backup when their existing smartphone credit runs out.\u201cFree Basics? I don\u2019t really use it that often,\u201d said Victor Odinga, 27, an accountant in downtown Nairobi. \u201cNo one wants to be seen as someone who can\u2019t afford to get online.\u201dAn article on Monday about the effect on Facebook and other technology companies of government efforts around the world to regulate online activity misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Allen.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, Mark Scott from Nairobi, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should the Middle Class Invest in Risky Tech Start-Ups?", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtJason Calacanis cuts an unusual figure for a financial savior in Silicon Valley, where it\u2019s fashionable for the world\u2019s richest men to feign embarrassed modesty about their wealth and power.Mr. Calacanis, an entrepreneur and investor who claims to be worth more than $100 million, harbors no such restraint. He is a rich man who often behaves like the caricature of a rich man \u2014 a brash, big-talking native New Yorker who flaunts his cars (\u201cI have all the Teslas\u201d), humblebrags about a popular podcast he hosts (he guesses it makes about $1 million in annual revenue, \u201cbut it\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s brand-building\u201d), and even promotes his own branded paper coffee cups.\u201cHave you seen my new cups?\u201d he asked by way of greeting during an interview last month. \u201cI love my cups. They\u2019ve got my tagline: \u2018Do The Work.\u2019 \u201dMr. Calacanis, 46, admits his personality is not for everyone. \u201cMost folks think I\u2019m lucky, some say I\u2019m a complete fraud, and a handful think I\u2019m a brilliant hype man, and I don\u2019t agree with any of them \u2014 I agree with all of them,\u201d he writes in his new book, published in July, whose full title is a mouthful: \u201cAngel: How to Invest in Technology Startups \u2014 Timeless Advice From An Angel Investor Who Turned $100,000 into $100,000,000.\u201dYet there is something refreshing and clarifying about Mr. Calacanis\u2019s frankness regarding his tech-fueled riches. He states plainly what many in Silicon Valley believe but are too politic to say \u2014 and which has lately been dawning on the rest of the world: that the tech industry is decimating the rest of the planet\u2019s wealth and stability.Still, Mr. Calacanis is offering a much more dismal view of the disruptions caused by tech \u2014 and a more radical, if also self-serving, plan for dealing with it. To survive the coming earthquake, he advises, you need to radically re-examine your plan for the future \u2014 and you need to learn Silicon Valley\u2019s ways rather than expect to defeat it.\u201cMost of you are screwed,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel,\u201d arguing that a coming revolution in robotics and artificial intelligence will eliminate millions of jobs and destroy the old ways of getting ahead in America. \u201cThe world is becoming controlled by the few, powerful, and clever people who know how to create those robots, or how to design the software and the tablet on which you\u2019re reading this.\u201dMr. Calacanis is not wholly optimistic about where all this change will lead. \u201cIn my mind, candidly, we\u2019ve got a 70 percent chance of figuring out this massive sea change without starting a full-on revolution in the streets, like we saw in Greece or Egypt, or any other place where unemployment among young adults breaks 20 percent,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dBe warned: One reason that Mr. Calacanis is willing to diagnose this economic ill is that he is also selling a prescription that he claims will alleviate it.His book is intended as a guide for getting into the business of investing in very young tech companies at their earliest stages, known as \u201cangel investing.\u201d Mr. Calacanis is peddling a kind of populist movement for investing \u2014 he wants doctors, lawyers and other wealthy people, and even some in the middle class, to bet on start-ups, which he says is the best way to prepare financially for tech change.\u201cI want to inspire 10,000 people to become full-time angel investors,\u201d he says.Financial advisers I spoke to were not won over by Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice. They called his method indistinguishable from gambling, and they warned that the potential gains were not worth the risks. Invest in start-ups with your \u201cfun money\u201d but not the money you are counting on for your future, advised Spencer Sherman, the founder of Abacus Wealth Partners.Even other tech investors aren\u2019t sold on Mr. Calacanis\u2019s movement. Hunter Walk, a partner at the seed-stage fund Homebrew, said ordinary investors would be better off putting their money into public tech giants rather than gambling on small firms. \u201cUnless you\u2019re willing to lose all your money, you shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Walk said.Mr. Calacanis genuinely believes that investing in start-ups is good advice; he has even offered his three children a chance to skip college and to use the tuition money on betting on start-ups. His 7-year-old daughter, he said, is leaning toward taking the deal.But like other recent populist movements, Mr. Calacanis\u2019s isn\u2019t without its apparent grifts. Mr. Calacanis runs a \u201csyndicate,\u201d a kind of investing club in which people co-invest their money alongside his bets. The book, he says, led to a surge in new investors on his syndicate \u2014 and if those investments pay off, Mr. Calacanis gets a 20 percent cut of his co-investors\u2019 returns.Not that he\u2019s shy about any of this. \u201cOf course, I plan to make a great deal of money in these revolutions,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dYou could call his attitude chutzpah, or you could call it hustle, which is a quality Mr. Calacanis has in spades. He grew up in a working-class family in Brooklyn and writes that he spent much of his youth wondering, \u201cWhat would it be like to be rich?\u201dHe got his start in the 1990s as a reporter covering the budding internet industry in New York. Later, he helped found Weblogs, one of the early digital media companies, which, in 2005, he sold to AOL for $30 million. Along the way, he made dozens of connections \u2014 he casually name-drops every big name in tech \u2014 and now, as an angel, he parlays those connections into \u201cdeal flow,\u201d getting early access to invest in the best start-ups.One charge against Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice is that his wins aren\u2019t widely replicable \u2014 not everyone can make a fortune off their friends\u2019 billion-dollar ideas, after all.But Mr. Calacanis isn\u2019t suggesting that people enter the angel business expecting to get rich quickly.\u201cLook, I\u2019m going to wind up being the GOAT,\u201d he said, using internet-speak for Greatest Of All Time. \u201cYou don\u2019t read a book by Michael Jordan or LeBron James and expect to start playing basketball like Michael Jordan or LeBron James.\u201dInstead, he outlines a careful and systematic approach for newcomers to the angel business. He said people should start slowly, first as part of syndicates like his. Those deals will help newbie investors get exposed to other investors and tech founders, which will bring them access to bigger and better deals. He said repeatedly that this would take time and effort \u2014 people should be willing to spend 20 hours a week on their investments, and if they really want to hit it big, they should be willing to move to Silicon Valley.And he is frank about the risks. The book begins with an all-caps disclaimer warning, \u201cDON\u2019T READ THIS BOOK IF YOU CAN\u2019T HANDLE LOSING YOUR MONEY INVESTING IN THE RISKIEST ASSET CLASS ON THE PLANET: START-UPS.\u201dBut to Mr. Calacanis, the risks are worth taking. The world seems to have lost its moorings; it\u2019s changing in ways that none of us can predict anymore.So shouldn\u2019t you do something big? As Mr. Calacanis argues: \u201cNo gamble, no future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Her Family\u2019s Footsteps, a Reporter Takes to the Classroom", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo spend a day in Kayla Delzer\u2019s colorful classroom at Mapleton Elementary School in North Dakota is to behold a bold experiment in next-generation learning unfolding in front of your eyes.In Mapleton, I found a teacher who judiciously uses digital tools \u2014 along with fun classroom furniture like beanbag chairs and rubber balance balls \u2014 to give her students some space to learn more freely. I also met some astonishing third graders who think and speak in paragraphs.\u201cI feel like this year has changed my life because, all the other years, all I have been doing is sitting in a plain old desk, writing down things on paper,\u201d Jennings, one of Ms. Delzer\u2019s students, told me. \u201cWe never got to actually go onto iPads and do our own thing. So we didn\u2019t get to be ourselves. They were maneuvering us, trying to be someone different.\u201dAlready, Ms. Delzer\u2019s third graders equate autonomy with technology.Then there were the companies that welcomed, or at least tolerated, my interest. Microsoft let me tag along with a group of schoolteachers visiting its headquarters in Redmond, Wash., where they learned how company products like Skype could be used in the classroom. Google set up interviews for me with its education executives at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.The reporting has been riveting.But I\u2019ve found myself devoting nights and weekends to the \u201cEducation Disrupted\u201d project for personal reasons as well.

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Google Gets Serious About Producing Better Phones", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle once owned a phone maker. It didn\u2019t work out. Now it\u2019s trying a different approach.Why? To double down on producing its own hardware. Google has been especially focused on its Pixel line of premium smartphones, some of which are made by HTC and have gotten good reviews.Apple has followed a similar strategy for years, and that has provided the iPhone maker with an easier path when adding new features, such as augmented reality functions, since it designs nearly all of the internal parts of its phone.A beefier hardware team should also help Google bring much more of the design in-house. It should also help it realize some of its bigger smartphone hardware ambitions, which include things like making its own SoCs and building machine learning coprocessors.FlashbackGoogle was in hardware once before: It paid $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in 2010. It sold that business to Lenovo for just $2.9 billion three years later.The decision to buy Motorola was \u201cthe extravagance of being a company with over $350 billion in market cap,\u201d said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Motorola was fixable, and growth is much easier to come by on a company that\u2019s not a fixer-upper.\u201dStandard & Poor\u2019s move, which cut China\u2019s sovereign rating to A+ from AA-, was its first reduction in the rating since 1999. The outlook on China was changed to stable from negative.\u201cChina\u2019s prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased its economic and financial risks,\u201d S.&P. said. \u201cAlthough this credit growth had contributed to strong real G.D.P. growth and higher asset prices, we believe it has also diminished financial stability to some extent.\u201dMoody\u2019s had cut China\u2019s credit rating in May.Hackers penetrated the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s electronic system for storing public company filings and may have traded on them.The commission said the hack was detected in 2016, but that regulators didn\u2019t learn about the possibility of related illicit trading until August, when they started an investigation and began cooperating with what the S.E.C. called \u201cappropriate authorities.\u201dSpecifically, a software vulnerability in the test filing component of the commission\u2019s Edgar system, which was patched promptly after discovery, was exploited and resulted in access to nonpublic information. It is believed the intrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, jeopardize the operations of the commission, or result in systemic risk.The disclosure, coming on the heels of a data breach at Equifax, the major consumer credit reporting firm, will likely intensify concerns over potential computer vulnerabilities lurking among pillars of the American financial system.\u201cSo, as you may have read, I was fired by the president of the United States.\u201dThe HighlightAt the start of the podcast, Mr. Bharara recounted his interactions with Mr. Trump in the months leading up to his dismissal as a United States attorney.

{"Headline": "At Google, Employee-Led Effort Finds Men Are Paid More Than Women", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Female employees are paid less than male staff members at most job levels within Google, and the pay disparity extends as women climb the corporate ladder, according to data compiled by employees that provide a snapshot of salary information at the internet giant.A spreadsheet, obtained by The New York Times, contains salary and bonus information for 2017 that was shared by about 1,200 United States Google employees, or about 2 percent of the company\u2019s global work force.While Google said the data painted an incomplete picture of how people are paid, the salary details shared by employees are likely to heighten concerns over gender disparities in Silicon Valley.Even as America\u2019s technology giants continue to grow in wealth and influence, most have shown little progress in leveling the playing field for women, who are underrepresented in key engineering and leadership roles and are paid less than men. These gender imbalances are reflected in long-term studies of large companies around the world by the McKinsey Global Institute.The scrutiny has been especially intense at Google. Long regarded as one of the world\u2019s best workplaces because of its perks and generous compensation, the company is under examination by the Labor Department and has faced criticism from investors and some of its own employees over differences in how women and men are paid.\u201cSilicon Valley has established itself as the boys\u2019 club of the West, just like how Wall Street has established itself as the boys\u2019 club of the East,\u201d said Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement at Arjuna Capital, a wealth management firm that takes activist positions on issues such as gender pay.At a shareholder meeting for Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, earlier this year, Arjuna Capital put forward a proposal for the company to disclose what women make compared with their male peers. Arjuna had successfully persuaded seven of nine technology companies, including Apple, Amazon.com and Microsoft, to disclose that data. Alphabet\u2019s directors urged shareholders to vote against the measure, and it failed.The self-reported Google salary spreadsheet was started in 2015 by a former employee who wanted to help co-workers negotiate better salaries. That employees were keeping track of this information became public knowledge soon after, but the spreadsheet\u2019s details remained private.The salary information in the spreadsheet cannot be viewed as an exact portrait of what people make at the company, because some employees may have erred when they put in their information. At some job levels, only a handful of employees volunteered to share their salary information, so a few salaries can skew the data. Even though it\u2019s not a random sample of staff members, the information is tracked closely throughout the company.The spreadsheet covers levels one through six of Google\u2019s job hierarchy, from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six. It does not include company executives and top-level engineers, who receive a wider range of salaries.At five of the six job levels, women are paid less than men. At level three, the entry level for technical positions, women make 4 percent less than men at $124,000 in salary and bonus. But it widens to 6 percent by the time employees reach midcareer status, around level five, with women earning, on average, $11,000 less than men.Google said the spreadsheet\u2019s information does not take into account a number of factors, like where employees are based, whether they are in higher-paying technical positions, and job performance.Based upon its own analysis from January, Google said female employees make 99.7 cents for every dollar a man makes, accounting for factors like location, tenure, job role, level and performance.Google said its analysis includes salary, bonus and equity compensation for 95 percent of employees between levels one and nine \u2014 three levels beyond what was reflected in the data shared with The Times \u2014 while excluding vice presidents and above. Google did not provide a breakdown of how it arrived at that calculation.Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, said the gender pay disparity reflected in the internal spreadsheet is \u201cnot a representative sample\u201d for other, more complex reasons. For example, a person in a nontechnical role may be at the same job level as an engineer, but will be paid significantly less because \u201cthere is a premium paid in all markets for highly technical talent.\u201dThe percentage of women in technical positions is lower than the overall percentage of female employees, with more women in sales, marketing, human resources or legal. Those roles, according to Ms. Naughton, do not have the same entry-level or midcareer salaries as technical positions.Other factors include geography and job performance. A position at Google\u2019s main office in Mountain View, Calif. \u2014 where the cost of living is high \u2014 may pay a lot more than a Google employee of a similar rank hired in a cheaper market. In addition, job performance significantly governs a person\u2019s pay over time \u2014 another factor not reflected in the spreadsheet.Google said it tries to exclude gender when determining salaries. Human resources analysts who determine what salary a person is offered when he or she joins Google do not know the candidate\u2019s gender. Similarly, when an employee\u2019s salary is up for annual review, the company takes into account the person\u2019s job performance, location and competitive salaries \u2014 but the analysts are not informed of the person\u2019s gender.\u201cThere\u2019s a meme around tech companies and Silicon Valley, around issues having to do with gender equity in tech,\u201d Ms. Naughton said. \u201cI do believe Google, because of its size and perhaps our size or our prominence in people\u2019s everyday lives, I think we\u2019re in the spotlight. It feels a little unfair.\u201dWhat Google pays men versus women is at the heart of a dispute with the Department of Labor. The company is fighting over how much data it needs to hand over as part of a routine audit of its pay practices. Google is a federal contractor because it sells advertising to the government.Google said it has already shared a lot of data and documents and that the Labor Department is overreaching by asking for employees\u2019 private information. An administrative law judge ruled in July that Google had to disclose some data but not as much as the Labor Department had wanted.James Finberg, a civil rights lawyer and partner at Altshuler Berzon L.L.P., said he expected to bring a class-action lawsuit against Google for \u201csubstantial gender disparities\u201d later this month. Mr. Finberg said more than 90 current and former female employees have come forward to be plaintiffs.He said that these women spoke about experiencing discrimination by being slotted into positions at a level below a man with similar qualifications and that women are not promoted with the same frequency as men. He said that some of the gender stereotypes cited in the memo are widespread and that they kept women out of higher-paying engineering jobs.\u201cIt is an atmosphere filled with stereotypes, that the comments espoused in the memo were not isolated incidents,\u201d Mr. Finberg said. \u201cThey are more of the norm than the anomaly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will a Corporate Tax Holiday Give Workers Anything to Cheer?", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThey had lobbied hard for this \u2014 dangling before members of Congress the promise that the repatriated money would add more than 500,000 jobs in the United States over the next two years, as companies paid down debt and engaged in more capital spending, acquisitions, and research and development.The smell of a tax holiday is back in the air. From Apple to Facebook to Starbucks, big business is waiting with bated breath for details on President Trump\u2019s promise to slash the tax rate on profits held abroad to encourage companies to bring the money home.Of course, the standard claims are being made about the vast stimulative effects of the repatriated cash. They are being met this time with vigorous counterclaims based on the results of the Bush administration\u2019s shot over a decade ago.Pfizer, for instance, brought back $35.5 billion, the largest amount repatriated by a single company during the tax holiday, according to the Senate report. Then it turned around and spent over $20 billion in stock repurchases from 2005 to 2007. By 2007, the aggregate compensation of its top five executives was nearly $13 million higher than in 2004. Its United States payroll was 12,000 smaller.The pattern was similar across most repatriating companies. Hewlett-Packard, which brought home $14.5 billion, bought back $22 billion worth of stock over the three years and cut its payroll by more than 8,500. The tobacco company Altria, which brought over $6 billion home during the holiday, spent $2.5 billion on share buybacks and bumped pay in the executive ranks by more than $50 million, but cut 6,000 jobs.With a new move afoot to put such holdings back on American books, there is a critical question that is too quickly glossed over: Why do businesses act this way? Why didn\u2019t corporate executives invest more in their businesses and their work forces? Why did they go to the trouble of dribbling around a rule forbidding the use of repatriated profits to pay themselves a bonus? (Note to Congress: Money is fungible.)Call me na\u00efve. Professor Forbes and her colleagues \u2014 indeed, many economists \u2014 might swat the question away by arguing that businesses didn\u2019t use the extra cash to invest and employ because they were well-run businesses, well invested and sufficiently staffed to maximize their profitability.Still, the question should resonate in an administration that came to power on a promise to address the plight of the working class. Because the working class stands on the other end of a deal with the corporate class. I don\u2019t think it is possible to fully address workers\u2019 demands without understanding, and changing, corporate motivations.Many forces have shaped this deal, including technology, which replaced workers performing routine tasks, and globalization, which squeezed the margins of many businesses and exposed their workers to competition from cheap labor markets. And yet it would be a mistake to ignore the impact of a corporate ethos that has come to focus on rewarding shareholders and executives at the expense of any other consideration \u2014 be it workers\u2019 welfare or even the company\u2019s long-term sustainability. Indeed, workers today amount to little more than a line on the cost side of businesses\u2019 balance sheets, with little claim to its prosperity.\u201cHow you divide the pie is a choice,\u201d said Rick Wartzman, who heads the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute of Claremont Graduate University. \u201cIt is being carved differently.\u201dThe good news is that it is not impossible to modify the behavior of the corporate leaders who have so drastically altered the contract with their work force over the last few decades. While it may be tempting to cast the new breed of executives as selfish villains who somehow lost their sense of right and wrong, the shift in their behavior responded to a shift in the incentives they faced. It was fed by a belief that snaked its way three or four decades ago from the halls of the University of Chicago through investment-bank trading floors and into the corner offices of corporate America: that the interests of corporate managers must be brought into tight alignment with those of shareholders. It was accompanied by one of the most destabilizing propositions in the modern history of corporate governance: This alignment was best achieved by paying corporate managers almost exclusively with stock.Professor Desai points out that in the end, this structure does not really serve shareholders, at least not those with an interest in a company\u2019s prosperity more than a few quarters down the road. \u201cCapitalism seems to be serving managers and investment managers at the expense of shareholders,\u201d he wrote.Changing this behavior is not beyond the reach of policy. Just as changes in the tax treatment of executive pay in the 1990s encouraged stock-based remuneration, tax reforms might motivate corporate executives to invest for the long term rather than for an immediate stock bump \u2014 maybe even encourage stable employment and worker training. Until then, offering tax breaks to American corporations seems more likely to line the pockets of executives and shareholders than to improve their long-term prospects or the prosperity of their workers.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bill and Melinda Gates Grade the World\u2019s Health", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal HealthBill and Melinda Gates handed the world a report card last week, assessing its progress on 18 global health indicators: infant mortality, AIDS, vaccine use, smoking rates and so on.In a series of recent interviews, they delivered several messages.In conversation, Mr. Gates displays such a deeply impressive grasp of the science fueling the discoveries he underwrites, and of the politics of the countries where they are deployed, that one forgets he was once a software geek.At 61, he could speak with the avuncular magniloquence of a professor emeritus; instead, he layers on supporting data like a star pupil seeking an A-plus. He rebuts skeptical inquiries and insists on teaching from his own syllabus \u2014 and on flicking his own birch switch.The report card will be issued annually, Mr. Gates said. He gave himself only a C+ on the first draft, promising sharper analytics in the future.In some areas, like infant mortality, he considers the progress made \u201cpretty miraculous.\u201d In 1990, more than 11 million children died before their fifth birthday; now, fewer than 6 million do.AIDS deaths have plummeted since 2004, and malaria deaths since 2005. Rates of childhood stunting, mothers dying in childbirth, and the miseries wrought by rare tropical diseases all have gone steadily down.In poor countries, vaccine use is way up, though only about 75 percent of children get all the shots they need. More people have toilets these days.Progress in other areas has been slower. Smoking is down, but tobacco companies are fighting back. Contraceptive availability is up, but almost half the women who want birth control still lack it.Access to basic health care is up, according to the new report. But the gap between rich and poor countries remains vast, because too much money goes to top hospitals instead of rural clinics.One key finding: Most of the progress was not bought by donors, but came organically as hundreds of millions of people scrambled out of the most abject tiers of penury.In 1990, 35 percent of the world lived below the international poverty line (currently $1.90 a day); now, only 9 percent do. Most of the great leap upward was in just two economic powerhouses: China and India.The report\u2019s scarier themes lie in its projections for the next 15 years.Assuming economic progress continues, improvements in most health categories will churn dutifully on, or at worst plateau. But since the 2008 economic crisis, donors have been losing their will to give.If that persists, the report says, chaos threatens. H.I.V. infections could double, returning to levels not seen since the 1990s. And malaria could climb back to the peak hit in 2005.H.I.V. and malaria are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in funding because they are concentrated in Africa, where economic progress has been slower than in Asia or Latin America and where birthrates remain high, producing a big pool of potential victims each year. Malaria has a history of rebounding as soon as pressure is eased; both the mosquitoes and the parasites quickly evolve resistance genes.The world\u2019s birthrate is now peaking \u2014 probably forever \u2014 at about 134 million babies a year. \u201cBut it\u2019s mind-blowing how much the shift in where kids are being born makes things hard for us,\u201d Mr. Gates said.Keeping infants alive gets tougher when they are born in lands with civil wars, dirt roads and healers who reject Western medicine.Surprisingly, the new report was not a reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to slash the foreign aid budget by 32 percent.According to Dr. Christopher J.L. Murray, director of the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which gathered the data, it was initiated three years ago because Mr. Gates feared the world was losing its focus on health.\u201cGoalkeepers\u201d refers to a metric that the world ignores but the Gateses do not: the targets periodically set by the United Nations, namely the 2000 Millennium Development Goals and the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals.The first sharply emphasized poverty and health. But the latter comprise 169 targets for everything from reducing overfishing to bringing clean energy and decent jobs for all \u2014 they have an \u201cI-want-a-pony-too\u201d air about them.He prefers \u201cMicrosoft-type thinking\u201d to set realistic goals. \u201cPeople expect a certain degree of honesty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to know, do Bill and Melinda track this stuff?\u201dEssentially, he is tracking the world\u2019s pursuit of his own goals as he helps it reach them.To hear Mr. Gates tell it, even the staunchest backers of an America First ideology, which he called \u201cselfish,\u201d succumb to his fusillades of data.Before Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, resigned, Mr. Gates met him in the White House. \u201cHe said, \u2018Africa has always been a mess,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cI went through the numbers on its progress with him. He was impressed.\u201dThe new report\u2019s weakness is that it cannot, for example, foretell how many more Ugandans would die of AIDS if American donations dropped 20 percent, in the way that the Congressional Budget Office can calculate how many Americans will lose insurance under a particular health care bill.There are too many unpredictables in global health. A country would not just brutally take 20 percent of its H.I.V. patients off treatment, Mr. Gates noted. It might cut its military budget; it might try to stretch supplies of the drugs it got, triggering shortages.Buried in the graphics-heavy report are some fun anecdotes that show how ingenuity can be just as important in the field as money.In Ethiopia, for example, pregnant women were given a special stretcher to help them reach birth clinics; they had feared regular stretchers because villagers carried away on them usually died.And an imam in Senegal described how he got other imams to accept birth control: by citing a saying from the Prophet Muhammad implying that children should be born about two years apart.A picture caption on Tuesday with an article about a recent global health report by Bill and Melinda Gates misidentified the location of a speech the couple gave concerning the report\u2019s findings. It was in Manhattan, not at the Seattle headquarters of the Gates Foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Building a Better Coral Reef", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "As reefs die off, researchers want to breed the world\u2019s hardiest corals in labs and return them to the sea to multiply. The effort raises scientific and ethical questions.Supported byON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF, off Australia \u2014 After a plunge beneath the crystal-clear water to inspect a coral reef, Neal Cantin pulled off his mask and shook his head.\u201cAll dead,\u201d he said.Yet even as he and his dive team of international scientists lamented the devastation that human recklessness has inflicted on the world\u2019s greatest system of reefs, they also found cause for hope.As they spent days working through a stretch of ocean off the Australian state of Queensland, Dr. Cantin and his colleagues surfaced with sample after sample of living coral that had somehow dodged a recent die-off: hardy survivors, clinging to life in a graveyard.The goal is not just to study them, but to find the ones with the best genes, multiply them in tanks on land and ultimately return them to the ocean where they can continue to breed. The hope is to create tougher reefs \u2014 to accelerate evolution, essentially \u2014 and slowly build an ecosystem capable of surviving global warming and other human-caused environmental assaults.The research here is part of a worldwide push that is growing increasingly urgent. After decades of accumulating damage, followed by a huge die-off in 2015 and 2016, some scientists say they believe half the coral reefs that existed in the early 20th century are gone.Instead of standing around watching the rest of them die, a vanguard of reef experts is determined to act.In Florida, they are pioneering techniques that may allow the rapid re-establishment of reefs killed by heat stress. In Hawaii, they are studying the biology of corals that somehow managed to cling to life as an earlier generation of people dumped raw sewage into a magnificent bay. In the Caribbean, countries are banding together to create a genetic storage bank for corals, a backup plan if today\u2019s reefs all die.This year is on track to be the third consecutive hottest year on record. Where does that heat go? The oceans, mostly.Yet this new push to aid the world\u2019s reefs comes with its own risks, and with many questions.A large-scale restoration effort could be expensive, and so far, governments have put up only modest sums, despite the hit that their multibillion-dollar tourism industries could take from continued deterioration of the reefs. Private philanthropists \u2014 including Paul G. Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft \u2014 are paying for much of the early work, spending millions. But will they ultimately commit billions?And while scientists are trying modest approaches first, the most effective strategy for saving reefs in the long run might be through genetic methods, including selective breeding or transferring heat-resistance genes into corals. That type of thing has been done for crops, but would it be ethical to do it in the wild?\u201cHow do you decide what interventions are right and when to intervene?\u201d said Madeleine van Oppen, a professor of marine biology at the University of Melbourne who is leading the experiments in Australia, aiming at what she calls the \u201cassisted evolution\u201d of coral reefs. \u201cThere\u2019s a long road ahead; that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting now.\u201dQuestions like these appear to be an inescapable part of the human future, and they go beyond coral reefs.Scientists first warned decades ago that coral reefs were particularly sensitive to heat stress and would be among the earliest victims of global warming if emissions were not brought under control.Extremely hot days are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades, potentially disrupting our everyday lives.They were ignored, and humanity continued burning fossil fuels with abandon \u2014 setting up an early test of whether the scientific predictions about global warming could be believed.Most of the heat trapped by those emissions has gone into the oceans, which have now warmed enough that just a bit of additional heat can cause massive coral die-offs. The extra jolt arrives during El Ni\u00f1o weather patterns that warm large parts of the tropics.The first global coral die-off began in 1982, and now they seem to be happening every few years. Along the Great Barrier Reef, the El Ni\u00f1o-related heat wave of 2015-16 left 35 to 50 percent of the corals dead along a 650-mile stretch of the Queensland coastline, a profound blow to what was the single most impressive reef on Earth.\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to be aggressive and make changes to preserve the reef of the future,\u201d Dr. Cantin said. But, he added, without a broad effort that includes tackling the emissions causing climate change, reefs could largely die within this century.Coral reefs are among the most beautiful sights on the planet, dubbed the \u201crain forests of the sea\u201d because, while occupying a tiny area, they harbor much of the variety of life in the ocean. The brightly hued corals attract equally vivid fish, as though the creatures had dressed to match their surroundings.Coral polyps are tiny animals that act a bit like farmers, raising even tinier plants \u2014 algae \u2014 that supply them with food. The corals excrete a hard substance that builds up into a reef, giving the coral polyps and many other creatures a place to live.The loss of coral reefs is not just an aesthetic disaster. A half-billion people depend on reef fish for food, and in some island nations, they are essentially the only source of protein. The continued destruction of reefs might well worsen global hunger. In wealthier nations, and especially in Australia, the reefs are a prime attraction in tourist economies worth billions.Dr. Cantin is among the many marine biologists who spent the past two years watching huge stretches of Australia\u2019s greatest natural wonder die from the heat.And yet, on a three-day trip in July to harvest coral samples, he repeatedly found himself surprised. The Rib Reef, where he was diving, had been healthy and vibrant only a year ago. But during his return visit, large sections were dead, covered in algae that looked like soot.The samples he collected \u2014 of the Pocillopora acuta species \u2014 were often the only healthy chunks of coral to be found among canyons of dead reefs.Near the end of their research trip, he and two other scientists dove for nearly an hour before finding just three samples, which they removed with a hammer and chisel and placed in a metal supermarket dish rack for transport to the surface.\u201cThis is probably a three-year-old coral,\u201d he said back on the boat, admiring a pinkish sample with a handful of healthy branches that made it look like a fist-size shrub. \u201cWe want to take the whole adult coral, collect its babies and then grow the larvae into adult coral.\u201dProfessor van Oppen, a senior scientist who oversees Dr. Cantin\u2019s research, said that part of what makes the Australian experiment stand out is the \u201csea simulator\u201d at the Townsville marine institute. It is a complex high technology laboratory where corals live in tanks with water temperatures that can be calibrated to a tenth of a degree and simulate seasonal patterns of warming events. Lighting systems replicate the moon cycles that corals use to time their spawning.Future generations of corals, the offspring of the those Dr. Cantin harvested, will be tested for resilience in this artificial environment, with warmer and more acidic water that mimics what scientists are predicting for the years 2050 and 2100.The strongest corals will then become parents again, with some crossbreeding of the same species from different sections of the reef and also crossbreeding of different species to create genetic hybrids.\u201cIf the speed of natural adaptation was fast enough to keep up with climate change, we wouldn\u2019t see the scale of loss we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Professor van Oppen said. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgent need to come up with ways to slow it down.\u201dOn a recent day at the lab, a manager, Jen Davidson, meticulously examined coral colonies growing in indoor tanks under artificial lights.Starting with hardy coral polyps that survived past environmental assaults in Kaneohe Bay, the Gates lab is trying to make them even hardier, crossbreeding the corals and testing offspring in water treated to mimic the hotter, more acidic conditions likely to prevail in a future ocean.Under normal conditions the animals grow and build their reefs only slowly, one of the factors that is stymying the effort to save them. \u201cWe can do all this work here, but can we scale it up enough to make an impact?\u201d Ms. Davidson asked.\u201cIt used to take us six years to produce 600 corals,\u201d Dr. Vaughan said in an interview. \u201cNow we can produce 600 corals in an afternoon, and be ready in a few months to plant them.\u201dFlorida\u2019s reefs have been badly damaged over the years, not just by climate change but by more direct human assaults, like overfishing that disturbs the ecological balance. Yet the Mote lab and other centers have already replanted thousands of small coral colonies.Though the risks remain unclear, the day may come when many of the reefs off Florida and Australia will be ones created by scientific intervention \u2014 a human effort, in other words, to repair the damage humans have done.\u201cWe\u2019ve shown that there is hope in all of this,\u201d said Kayla Ripple, manager of the science program at the Coral Restoration Foundation. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t just throw their hands in the air and say there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a photo caption with a previous version of this article gave the wrong name for the research center headed by Dr. Ruth Gates.

McKerrow, a retired business owner and politician from Darwin, Australia.She could hardly contain her enthusiasm: \u201cI might use my newfound skills to create personalized, all-singing-and-dancing online birthday cards \u2014 in fact, all sorts of greeting cards for my family and friends. Maybe I could even graduate to making greeting cards personalized for businesses or for members of Parliament to send to their constituents.\u201cI have all sorts of ideas,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut need to progress my skills a little further before I get too carried away.\u201dWhile millennials make up the bulk of those learning in-demand skills like web design, programming or digital marketing \u2014 the average age of students at coding boot camps, for instance, is just under 30 \u2014 some people old enough to be their parents or even grandparents are also acquiring these abilities.Some, like Ms. McKerrow, are taking free lessons or video instructions online. (About a million of Codecademy\u2019s 45 million users globally are 55 or older.) Others subscribe to web-based courses or take classes at community colleges, universities or boot camps.Many older coders want to develop new skills to keep their jobs or to start second careers. Some are looking for volunteer opportunities or hobbies in their retirement. Nearly all who have gone through the rigors of trying to understand correct syntax, algorithms and other technical foundations also gain a sense of confidence and accomplishment, while maintaining and improving their mental acuity.Liz Beigle-Bryant, 60, of Seattle, credits the online classes she took in HTML and CSS code, the building blocks of the web, for helping her land a \u201cdream job\u201d recently as a document control coordinator at the public transit agency Sound Transit. She expects to use these tools often in her new position.\u201cOne of the big obstacles in a job interview when you\u2019re older is that people think you\u2019re inflexible and you can\u2019t learn new things,\u201d said Ms. Beigle-Bryant, who was laid off from her job as an administrative assistant at Microsoft in 2011.The code lessons she took a few years ago, also through Codecademy, \u201cgave me an edge,\u201d she said. \u201cI developed a confidence that I didn\u2019t have before.\u201dOlder people have been part of these success stories, too, yet they are often hesitant even to get started.\u201cI think so many people are discouraged because they think they\u2019re too old,\u201d said Letta M. Raven, a tech support specialist for a payroll software company and a frequent speaker at women\u2019s tech conferences. She has observed this reluctance among some conferencegoers and even had it herself.\u201cI was considered old in this industry,\u201d said Ms. Raven, who is 42 and held many jobs, including pastry chef and artist, before settling into her current career. She was long interested in software development, but it wasn\u2019t until two years ago that she enrolled at PDX Code Guild, a boot camp, and took courses in programming languages like Python, Ruby and JavaScript.Ms. Beigle-Bryant also remembers being pointed away from anything technical and more toward the fine arts when she was younger. Programming \u201cwas something I\u2019ve wanted to do since high school,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I was always discouraged from taking computer classes.\u201d She did manage to take one, in Basic programming, in 1973.Successful coders \u201cdon\u2019t have to have a math background to succeed,\u201d said Zach Sims, a founder and the chief executive of Codecademy, which offers both free and premium coding programs, \u201cand this isn\u2019t something that requires a master of science.\u201d\u201cTenacity and persistence,\u201d he continued, \u201care two important traits.\u201dMr. Flombaum described programming as \u201cpretty transparent.\u201d\u201cYou can either do it or you can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd once a person can code, I don\u2019t think age is a setback.\u201d But he added: \u201cLearning anything from scratch can be difficult whether you\u2019re 23 or 50. Both age groups battle insecurities.\u201dSteve Deddens, 71, a retired commercial pilot from Austin, Tex., who flew fighter jets during the Vietnam War, admitted to being a little anxious about embarking on a second career in programming. He worried about keeping up with his younger classmates at General Assembly, where he took an immersive program two years ago.\u201cPeople my age still have an AOL account,\u201d he said.But Mr. Deddens, who is now a software engineer at a company that provides information technology services to Microsoft, found the transition relatively easy.\u201cI\u2019ve always been good at solving problems,\u201d he said. \u201cI like taking things apart. I\u2019m an engineer by nature.\u201dWhile the income he earns from his second career is certainly nice, he said, \u201cthe other side of it is the joy of doing something with your mind and keeping yourself young.\u201dMs. McKerrow agreed: \u201cI think learning computer skills is great for older people. There is no heavy lifting or physical demands, and exercise of the brain is so necessary to avoid atrophy, Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia.\u201dOne way to get started \u2014 or at least see if coding is a good fit \u2014 is to attend a meetup. These are organized get-togethers where people sign up online and meet offline to discuss common interests. Codecademy, for instance, holds regular meetups in 300 cities around the world.\u201cI made a commitment to go every month,\u201d said Laurie Alaoui, 59, from Lincoln, Calif., which is near Sacramento.There, she said, she became familiar with the industry lingo and observed coders of all levels. \u201cAt the third one, I understood maybe 5 percent of what was said,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I took notes, and words I had no idea what they meant, I came home and looked them up. And then the next month I would go to another one.\u201d\u201cBefore long, it got to where I could sit through the talk and understand what they were talking about,\u201d said Ms. Alaoui, who became disabled from a car accident in her teens and was looking for something less taxing physically.\u201cThat was the reason I wanted to get into coding,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw that you really can change the world.\u201dPaul Gruhn, a senior systems engineer at Yale University and an adjunct professor at Quinnipiac University and Manchester Community College, said some older students in his code classes had struggled to keep up with their younger classmates.\u201cWeb development is not for everyone,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is useful to have a broad understanding of technology.\u201dHaving a specific goal can help, too. One of Mr. Gruhn\u2019s students, Robert Maynard, 71, of East Windsor, Conn., wanted to build a blog to help promote his campaign for first selectman of his town. He decided to enter politics after retiring in 2009 as a systems analyst at an insurance company, where he specialized in mainframe computers.Mr. Maynard completed three classes at Manchester Community College (in HTML, PHP and SQL) and was elected in 2015. \u201cIt was nice to be with young people \u2014 it was invigorating,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Blocks WhatsApp, Broadening Online Censorship", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China has largely blocked the WhatsApp messaging app, the latest move by Beijing to step up surveillance ahead of a big Communist Party gathering next month.The disabling in mainland China of the Facebook-owned app is a setback for the social media giant, whose chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has been pushing to re-enter the Chinese market, and has been studying the Chinese language intensively. WhatsApp was the last of Facebook products to still be available in mainland China; the company\u2019s main social media service has been blocked in China since 2009, and its Instagram image-sharing app is also unavailable.WhatsApp now appears to have been broadly disrupted in China, even for text messages, Nadim Kobeissi, an applied cryptographer at Symbolic Software, a Paris-based research start-up, said on Monday. The blocking of WhatsApp text messages suggests that China\u2019s censors may have developed specialized software to interfere with such messages, which rely on an encryption technology that is used by few services other than WhatsApp, he said.\u201cThis is not the typical technical method in which the Chinese government censors something,\u201d Mr. Kobeissi said. He added that his company\u2019s automated monitors had begun detecting disruptions of WhatsApp in China on Wednesday, and that by Monday the blocking efforts were comprehensive.Facebook declined to comment, following past practice when asked about WhatsApp\u2019s difficulties in China.Lokman Tsui, an internet communications specialist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that WhatsApp seemed to have been severely disrupted starting on Sunday. But he said that some WhatsApp users might still be able to use the service.The Chinese authorities have a history of mostly, but not entirely, blocking internet services, as well as slowing them down so much that they become useless. The censorship has prompted many in China to switch to communications methods that function smoothly and quickly but that are easily monitored by the Chinese authorities, like the WeChat app of the Chinese internet company Tencent, which is based in Shenzhen.\u201cIf you\u2019re only allowed to drive one mile per hour, you\u2019re not going to drive on that road, even if it\u2019s not technically blocked,\u201d Mr. Tsui said.The disruption of WhatsApp comes as Beijing prepares for the Communist Party\u2019s congress, which starts Oct. 18. Held once every five years, the congress chooses the party\u2019s leadership, which in turn runs the country. Next month\u2019s meeting is expected to reconfirm President Xi Jinping\u2019s nearly absolute grip on power, but considerable uncertainty remains over who will join him on the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the party\u2019s highest-ranking group.Over the past several years, China has not only stepped up censorship but also closed numerous churches and jailed large numbers of human rights activists, lawyers and advocates for ethnic minorities.The shutdown of WhatsApp prompted considerable dismay on Chinese social media.\u201cLosing contact with my clients, forced back to the age of telephone and email for work now,\u201d one user complained on Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging site.\u201cEven WhatsApp is blocked now? I\u2019m going to be out of business soon,\u201d another Chinese social media user said on Weibo.In China, even the use of email is fading as residents embrace the convenience of WeChat. The messaging service, which has 963 million active users, bears some similarities to WhatsApp but has a wider array of features and one crucial difference: close ties to the government. This month, WeChat sent a notice to users reminding them that it complied with official requests for information.When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it agreed to open online data services and other enhanced telecommunications services to international competition. But it obtained the assent of other W.T.O. members to retain restrictions on the media. Technology multinationals, heavily dependent on the Chinese market, have been reluctant to accuse Beijing of falling short of its W.T.O. commitments.The Office of the United States Trade Representative has opened a formal investigation into whether China is violating the intellectual property of American companies, but it has released few details. The trade office has not said whether the inquiry will include the blocking of products that rely on American intellectual property, or whether it will focus more narrowly on cases in which China has allegedly purloined or otherwise copied it.WhatsApp has a strong reputation among cryptographers for security, which may have been what drew the attention of Chinese censors. The app provides so-called end-to-end encryption, which effectively means that even Facebook does not know what is being said in the text, voice and video conversations passing through its servers.WhatsApp\u2019s video, file sharing and other advanced features rely partly on broadly used internet data transfer protocols, and were disrupted over the summer. But its text messaging function relies on a different, heavily encrypted method for moving data that has seldom been used by companies.The latest disruption of the WhatsApp messaging system suggests that China\u2019s censorship apparatus may have figured out how to target the more uncommon and heavily encrypted data transport protocol as well, Mr. Kobeissi said.Other services provided by American technology companies are available in mainland China. The country tolerates Microsoft\u2019s Skype service for phone calls, which does not provide end-to-end encryption and as a result is easier for governments to monitor. Beijing also allows Apple\u2019s FaceTime service, which has end-to-end encryption but does not have a WhatsApp-like feature allowing users to exchange secret codes \u2014 letting WhatsApp users combat what are known as \u201cman in the middle\u201d attacks.By blocking the heavily encrypted WhatsApp service while making less secure applications like WeChat available to the public, the Chinese government has herded its internet users toward methods of communication that it can reliably monitor.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jerry Pournelle, Science Fiction Novelist and Computer Guide, Dies at 84", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJerry Pournelle, a prolific writer of science fiction novels and witty advice columns for computer users, died on Sept. 8 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 84.Dr. Pournelle, whose several degrees included a Ph.D. in political science, worked in the aerospace industry for years and advised the federal government on military matters and space exploration. But science fiction fans knew him as the author of novels like \u201cJanissaries\u201d (1979), about soldiers abducted by space aliens, and \u201cStarswarm\u201d (1998), about a boy being raised on a remote planet by an uncle and a computer program named Gwen, which his dead mother had left behind.Dr. Pournelle was also known to many through lively columns for Byte magazine in which, beginning early in the home-computing age, he talked about personal computers and the software for them. Much of any given column was about his own experiences at \u201cChaos Manor\u201d \u2014 his name for his home, and for the column \u2014 trying out new software products and wrestling with bugs, glitches and viruses.He named some of his computers \u2014 Zeke and Bette among them \u2014 and his columns, though well informed, were filled with humor and a dash of snark. In one, intended for the August 1998 issue of Byte (the magazine ceased print publication the month before, so Dr. Pournelle posted it on his website instead), he complained that Bill Gates\u2019s Microsoft was no longer bothering to fix flaws in Windows 95 because it wanted customers to buy Windows 98.\u201cProbably it\u2019s just hard to get bright young people to work on tedious stuff like fixing bugs when they can be adding new features and bringing in more sales,\u201d he wrote. \u201cProbably Gates is no longer really in control of his company, and people do what they want to do, and no one wants to fix bugs.\u201dHe applied that same curmudgeonly tone to his endless blog posts on politics, public issues, movies, science, technology and practically any other subject imaginable.Jerry Eugene Pournelle was born on Aug. 7, 1933, in Shreveport, La. His father, Percival, was a radio advertising executive and later general manager of several stations. His mother, Ruth, was a teacher and worked in a munitions factory during World War II.When Dr. Pournelle was a boy the family moved to rural Tennessee, where the school he attended was small, to say the least.But he supplemented the schoolhouse learning by reading the family Encyclopaedia Britannica. Dr. Pournelle, taking advantage of the G.I. Bill after serving in the Army during the Korean War, would eventually receive multiple degrees from the University of Washington.He spent years working in the aerospace industry, including at Boeing, on projects including studying heat tolerance for astronauts and their spacesuits. This side of his career also found him working on projections related to military tactics and probabilities. One report in which he had a hand became a basis for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the missile defense system proposed by President Ronald Reagan. A study he edited in 1964 involved projecting Air Force missile technology needs for 1975.His expertise at projecting the future was also evident in his novels.\u201cThe iPhone is a pocket computer,\u201d he once noted, \u201cand we had pocket computers in \u2018Mote in God\u2019s Eye\u2019 in 1972.\u201dDr. Pournelle\u2019s first novel, \u201cRed Heroin,\u201d appeared in 1969 under the pen name Wade Curtis. The books kept coming at a steady pace for the next 40 years.Dr. Pournelle would always tell would-be writers seeking advice that the key to becoming an author was to write \u2014 a lot.He certainly wrote, and finished, quite a bit himself. His Byte columns were on the long side, and his frequent blog posts were, too. There seemed to be nothing Dr. Pournelle was not willing to hold forth about, his views generally conservative with a touch of the libertarian. (He wrote the preface for his friend Newt Gingrich\u2019s book \u201cWindow of Opportunity,\u201d published in 1984.)In addition to his son Phillip, Dr. Pournelle is survived by his wife, the former Roberta Jane Isdell, whom he married in 1959; a daughter, Jennifer Pournelle; three other sons, Alex, Frank and Richard; and four grandchildren.Though Dr. Pournelle wore many hats, he had a license plate that focused on the storytelling side, Phillip Pournelle said; it read, SCIBARD.In the 2003 interview, Dr. Pournelle mused about the art of the science fiction writer.\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are not any different from the old storytellers, the old bards back in Bronze Age time who would go from campfire to campfire, and they\u2019d see a warrior sitting there and say, \u2018You fill my cup up with that wine you\u2019ve got there and chop me a piece of that boar you\u2019re roasting and I\u2019ll tell you a story about a virgin and a bull that you just wouldn\u2019t believe!\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

But Ms. Keller argued that there was intrinsic merit simply in bringing together like-minded people who aspire to make capitalism a bit more equitable.\u201cActually, there is real value in all these individual points of light coming together and saying there is a collective vision for a world that works for everyone and an economic system that works for all, including our planet,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you collide enough of the people that care about these issues, they start remembering that this is real and it\u2019s happening.\u201dMs. Keller and the B-Team steered clear of making any tangible promises on Monday, but others were more than happy to use the collective attention of the global press corps to announce grand new projects.The Bloomberg event on Wednesday, hosted at the opulent Plaza Hotel, drew some of the biggest names in town, including the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau; Mr. Ma of Alibaba; the PepsiCo chief executive, Indra K. Nooyi; and Mr. Clinton himself, who delivered the opening remarks. Travis Kalanick, the recently departed chief executive of Uber, roamed the halls.\u201cThe Clinton Global Initiative caused business to think about New York this week as a destination,\u201d said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation. \u201cThe end of CGI left a void, and this is filling that.\u201dMr. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said that if he were a head of state, \u201cI\u2019d want every smart person coming into my country.\u201d\u201cSmart people create jobs,\u201d he said onstage, in an allusion to immigration policy. \u201cI\u2019d have a very aggressive plan not to just let a few people in. I would be recruiting.\u201dAjay Banga, the chief executive of Mastercard, said he was using the day to speak with peers about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, a set of targets meant to improve quality of living for people around the world.\u201cThey\u2019ve convened good conversations with people who are deeply committed to the SDGs,\u201d Mr. Banga said in an interview on the sidelines of the event. \u201cThe SDGs really matter. More people should be thinking about them.\u201dNot all the dialogue was so serious, however.During an afternoon session, David Rubenstein, the billionaire founder of the private equity firm Carlyle Group, asked Mr. Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, if his financial support for medical advances meant people would live longer.\u201cI\u2019m not working on that problem,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cThere are other Silicon Valley billionaires who want to live forever.\u201d\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t whether we can solve poverty or climate change or income inequality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s whether or not we can work together. The willingness to just get together and talk \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201dBut Mr. Ulukaya had to run. On Thursday, his charity for refugees, the Tent Foundation, was hosting an event announcing new partnerships and featuring the Unilever chief executive, Paul Polman, and Airbnb\u2019s co-founder, Joe Gebbia. There were last-minute preparations to attend to.After that, of course, was a private dinner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Natasha\u2019s Week in Review: Tech Tackles Trump, Again", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsFor weeks, executives from across the business world, including tech, had been pushing the president to renege on his pledge to undo DACA \u2014 the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children to remain here legally. This week Trump ignored them and went ahead with his plan to undo DACA anyway, which prompted a lot of impassioned outrage from the tech companies.And yet, there was a kind of kabuki aspect to the whole thing \u2014 a feeling that all this was all going according to what has become a kind of script for Trump-tech relations. Trump does something, the tech industry condemns it, Trump ignores them, then we all move on to the next thing. For some of the most powerful companies in the world, the tech giants sure do seem powerless to get the president to do what they want, don\u2019t they?But I see a related big issue here for the tech industry: trust in the data economy.It seems to me the fate of the DACA database will not only give us clues about whether the Trump administration intends to use data as a weapon to further disenfranchise the already disenfranchised. It could also impact consumers\u2019 trust in the popular online services that are stockpiling their personal data.What this all means is pretty hazy. It could be that these ads were part of a Russian influence campaign aimed at changing votes during the election. Facebook is cooperating with investigators, so we may learn more at some point in the future. But this could all be disconnected from any alleged Russian plan to get Trump elected. For one thing, the ad buy is pretty small, and some of the ads were purchased even before Trump was in the running. Who knows?To me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we\u2019re learning about it 10 months after the election. Facebook was at the center of the postelection controversy over \u201cfake news\u201d and other shenanigans meant to monkey with the vote. So why did it take the company so long to figure this out? And should we take that to mean there\u2019s a lot more icky that happened on Facebook around the election that it still hasn\u2019t found?But back to your question on why it took Facebook so long to figure out that a Kremlin-linked group had bought ads on the social network.Is the latest news on the Russian ad buy indicative of a larger problem of weak Facebook oversight of its advertising system?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "World Leaders Urge Big Tech to Police Terrorist Content", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The establishment was challenging the disrupters: Get your algorithms to stop terrorists from using the internet.At an unusual session on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, leaders of one powerful government after another told the leaders of some of the most powerful internet companies to intensify their efforts to take down terrorist propaganda.Sometimes the government officials displayed na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how technology works. Other times, they sidestepped the more difficult questions, like how to distinguish between free expression and incitement to violence. They ignored the impassioned debates over what constitutes a terrorist. And they said little about how to address other kinds of hate speech \u2013 including posts that could incite racist or sexist violence. Both prevail on the internet.Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, one of the hosts of the event late Wednesday afternoon, pressed internet companies to put their army of bots to work to take down terrorist content. \u201cIndustry needs to go further and faster in automating the detection and removal of terrorist content online, and developing technological solutions which prevent it being uploaded in the first place,\u201d she said.Mrs. May said \u201chomegrown perpetrators\u201d had been radicalized online. And she took aim at encrypted messaging apps, which she said terrorist groups had used to \u201cplan, direct and coordinate\u201d their attacks, including in Britain in recent months.A joint statement, endorsed by Britain, France and Italy, said international leaders had \u201cchallenged\u201d Silicon Valley to build technology aimed at ensuring that internet users \u201ctempted by violent extremism are not exposed to content that reinforces their extremist inclination \u2013 so-called algorithmic confinement.\u201dThe prime minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, urged big companies to help small companies, especially those that offer users ways to communicate anonymously.Julie Bishop, the foreign minister of Australia, said she valued free expression. But the internet, she said, \u201ccannot be an ungoverned space where terrorists operate.\u201dBut the success of terrorist groups in exploiting social media platforms to promote their agendas is now putting internet brands in an uncomfortable position, and the industry has been forced to address the problem.At Wednesday\u2019s event, called the Leaders Meeting on Preventing Terrorist Use of the Internet, representatives of the world\u2019s most prominent technology companies described how they have been responding. They rushed to demonstrate what they were doing to take down terrorist propaganda from their platforms and pledged to do more.Facebook said that it was using artificial intelligence to identify when \u201cterrorist imagery\u201d was uploaded to the site, and that it had established a special team to assist with law enforcement requests for information about terrorist attacks.Monika Bickert, head of global policy management at Facebook, said the company had 150 people, including engineers and language specialists, \u201cworking primarily to counter terrorism.\u201d\u201cWe maintain a specialized terrorist threat team that responds within minutes to emergency requests from law enforcement,\u201d said Ms. Bickert, a former federal prosecutor. \u201cAnd if we become aware of a credible threat of real world harm, we proactively reach out to authorities and inform them.\u201dTwitter\u2019s annual transparency report took pains to say that Twitter had taken down more than 935,000 accounts in roughly the last two years, and that most of those had been detected by the company\u2019s own tools, before anyone flagged them.Google said it was targeting messages intended to change the minds of those who searching for what the company identifiesas terrorist content.But the companies also cautioned that technology alone was insufficient for the task. Machines cannot always distinguish between what is dangerous and what has social value, they said. Videos uploaded to YouTube by human rights groups to show atrocities, for example, were once taken down mistakenly, said Kent Walker, general counsel at Google, which owns YouTube.\u201cMachines,\u201d he said, \u201care not yet at the stage where they can replace human judgment.\u201d And Mr. Walker offered a sobering note of caution. \u201cThere is no magic computer program,\u201d he told the room of foreign dignitaries, \u201cto eliminate terrorist content.\u201dThe joint statement by Britain, France and Italy implicitly acknowledged how vexing the problem is.\u201cNo individual nation state can respond to this threat alone,\u201d they said. \u201cThe response must be global, and it must be collaborative.\u201dAdvertisement"}

According to Mr. Spicer, Mr. Colbert suggested the idea himself, and passed it to the former press secretary through his producer at CBS, who had gotten to know Mr. Spicer well years earlier when he was a producer on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201dWhen Mr. Spicer and his wife left Washington for Los Angeles on Saturday morning, he donned a disguise. He would not say what it was, though a friend of his hinted that it might have included fake facial hair. After checking in, he stayed in his hotel room, leaving only for a walk-through that took place after the hall had been cleared. When scripts were handed out to crew members and performers, his name was nowhere to be found \u2014 replaced by an innocuous surname that began with the letter \u201cS.\u201dA person familiar with the planning of the Emmy program said on Monday that Mr. Colbert and his staff regarded Mr. Spicer\u2019s appearance as both a joke at the expense of Mr. Trump and a way to poke fun at Mr. Colbert, too. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose private discussions involving the Emmys and Mr. Colbert.Just as Mr. Trump had been thin-skinned in employing a spokesman to exaggerate the size of his inaugural crowd, this person said, Mr. Colbert was mocking himself by using Mr. Spicer to overstate the size of his viewership.When Mr. Kimmel brought up the news conference where Mr. Spicer had talked about inaugural crowd sizes, Mr. Spicer answered: \u201cI\u2019m aware. I appreciate the reminder of how it went down.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to talk to that cat,\u201d Mr. Colbert said.Mr. Kimmel said, \u201cA certain part of me felt sorry for him.\u201dMr. Colbert replied: \u201cReally? \u2018Cause he wasn\u2019t apologizing. He wants to be forgiven, but he won\u2019t regret anything he did. You got to regret something you did to be forgiven.\u201dBut at least among some people in Hollywood, Mr. Spicer may have been forgiven \u2014 or at least worthy of an Instagram.At the Television Academy\u2019s Emmy after-party in Los Angeles, several gown- and tuxedo-clad revelers stopped to gawk at Mr. Spicer.Other guests patiently lined up nearby \u2014 Mr. Spicer was posing for selfies.Michael Grynbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As the Clintons Step Back From Global Stage, Bloomberg Steps Up", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut after Bill and Hillary Clinton announced the end of their signature conference during last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and billionaire, has stepped unto the breach.On Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg will host a reorganized and rebranded Bloomberg Global Business Forum at the Plaza Hotel, drawing a high-powered crowd and speakers from Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, to President Emmanuel Macron of France.In a symbolic passing of the guard, Mr. Clinton will be the first speaker on the day\u2019s agenda almost exactly a year after he urged attendees \u201cyou have to keep this alive\u201d in a farewell address at the last Clinton Global Initiative.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t just happen to be the first speaker,\u201d said Kevin Sheekey, one of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s top advisers and a key organizer of the event. \u201cThere is a bit of a handoff.\u201dA generational baton-passing this is not. Mr. Clinton is 71. Mr. Bloomberg is 75. But the event will still represent a marked shift. The festivities around the Clinton Global Initiative, which ran from 2005 through 2016, were fueled by the star power of one past president and a potential future one. The Clintons raised millions to underwrite the event, sometimes stirring accusations of pay-to-play along the way. Mr. Bloomberg is paying for the forum himself through his philanthropy.There will still be some star power \u2014 the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 LeBron James has recorded a video introducing the event \u2014 but it is expected to have a different feel. The 2017 version is slimmed down from a three-day affair to a day of speakers, panelists and meetings.Under the Clintons, billions of dollars were pledged year after year by attendees for charitable commitments worldwide, from AIDS relief to global poverty. That is not a part of the initial Bloomberg forum.\u201cBill Clinton and his team figured out something fundamental,\u201d Mr. Sheekey said. That the United Nations annual meeting \u2014 a week when the leaders of 193 countries all descend on Manhattan \u2014 is \u201cthe time and place in which more powerful people get together than any place in the world.\u201dEven though Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency is expected to be a dominant topic at the Bloomberg forum, only one administration official is participating in a panel: Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce.\u201cThere is a close working relationship that he and the former president have had,\u201d Mr. Sheekey said of Mr. Bloomberg, \u201cand he is very respectful of what the former president was able to do.\u201dMr. Sheekey first reached out to Doug Band, a Clinton adviser who helped start the Clinton Global Initiative in 2005, about a year ago to discuss the possibility of hosting the event after the Clintons announced 2016 would be their last.Angel Urena, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, said the former president\u2019s \u201chope when he started the Clinton Global Initiative is that it would show by example that partnership and innovation can make a measurable difference \u2014 and he is glad to see those ideas being carried forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
