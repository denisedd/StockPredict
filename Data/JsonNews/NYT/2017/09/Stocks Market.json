{"Headline": "Shimon Peres, in Memoir, Takes On Israel Past and Future", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAFFA, Israel \u2014 The ousted French prime minister had just signed the letter authorizing the sale of a nuclear reactor to Israel \u2014 for peaceful purposes, he had been assured \u2014 even though he no longer had the authority to do so.It was the morning after Maurice Bourg\u00e8s-Maunoury\u2019s government fell in late 1957. To get around the problem, he wrote the previous day\u2019s date at the top of the page as an anxious Shimon Peres, then the ever-resourceful director general of Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense, looked on.\u201cI asked no questions,\u201d Mr. Peres, who went on to serve as prime minister and president, related six decades after the event. \u201cI said nothing at all. What was there to say?\u201d It was, Mr. Peres said, \u201cthe most generous display of friendship I had ever known.\u201dThese are the final words of the last of the founding generation of Israeli leaders. But indefatigable dreamer that Mr. Peres was, his book also delivers a pointed, if veiled, message from the grave about the apparent dearth of vision in the present, and it looks to the future.\u201cWe need a generation that sees leadership as a noble cause,\u201d he wrote in his epilogue, \u201cdefined not by personal ambition, but by morality and a call to service.\u201dMr. Peres recounts episodes he considered the milestones of a life \u201centwined with the birth and construction of Israel,\u201d as he put it. They are described in vivid detail and, in some cases, for the first time in his own words, and amount to a kind of ideological will and testament.\u201cHe knew that there is a certain amount of time he was given on earth,\u201d Nehemya Peres, Mr. Peres\u2019s younger son, who is known as Chemi, said in a recent interview at the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, the nongovernmental organization established by his father in Jaffa, on the Mediterranean shore.Mr. Peres completed work on the book in his final weeks, Chemi Peres said, using it as \u201chis last voice\u201d and as \u201ca call to dream, to dare, to be optimistic, to transition ourselves into a new era.\u201dMr. Peres sat and recorded the memoir in English to reach as wide an audience as possible, in the hope, his son said, of inspiring future leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs. Versions will also be published in Hebrew and French.Mr. Peres played a central role at critical junctures in his country\u2019s history. He helped build defense and weapons stocks and industry, salvaging the economy during the hyperinflation of the 1980s, championing Israel\u2019s high-tech industry and then turning his efforts to peace. The lessons running through the narrative of his memoir are to reach for the impossible and never give up.The book by no means offers a full accounting or reckoning. Mr. Peres simply does not grapple with the more contentious episodes.So Mr. Peres, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of David Ben-Gurion, Israel\u2019s first prime minister, describes his exploits procuring weapons for the 1948 war over Israel\u2019s creation, and says the distance between their offices was, for a time, \u201conly the width of a thin piece of plywood.\u201d But he makes no mention of the Palestinians who became refugees, or of the traumatic chapter of the Altalena, the ship organized by Mr. Ben-Gurion\u2019s right-wing rivals to bring fighters and weapons to Israel. It was shelled on Mr. Ben-Gurion\u2019s orders and sunk just off the coast.Nor does Mr. Peres relate his early support for Jewish settlement in the West Bank or his \u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d operation in Lebanon when he was prime minister in 1996, when Israeli artillery shells killed more than 100 Lebanese civilians sheltering in a United Nations compound.\u201cMy father was the greatest optimist on earth,\u201d Chemi Peres said. \u201cHe believed that the future was the only thing that mattered because the past cannot be changed.\u201d The book, he added, was not meant to settle disputes or disagreements.Some of Mr. Peres\u2019s most evocative descriptions are of his childhood in a wintry Polish shtetl, where he marveled over his first taste of a Jaffa orange, and of his voyage, at 11, with his mother and brother to what was then the British Mandate for Palestine in 1934. Arriving on a steamship at the port of Jaffa, he recalls his tanned father, who had made the journey two years ahead of them, standing on a small Arab fishing boat in the sparkling waters, coming out to greet them.Growing up in the Zionist socialist youth movement, Mr. Peres found his political voice and began to emerge as a leader, even as he opted for a pioneering life as a shepherd on a spartan kibbutz, or communal farm, in the Galilee, called Alumot. His powers of persuasion and creative thinking were not lost on the leaders of the movement, and he was soon recruited into public service by Mr. Ben-Gurion.Mr. Peres describes how, when he was still in his 20s, Mr. Ben-Gurion tasked him with procuring an \u201cextensive shopping list of weapons\u201d when Israel had less than a week\u2019s worth of ammunition on the eve of the 1948 war. Faced with a Western arms embargo, Mr. Peres found a supplier in Czechoslovakia.After the war he moved to New York to complete his studies and buy weapons on the black market for Israel\u2019s fledgling armed forces. He went to meet dealers in Cuba at midday, only to find they had meant midnight, and bought two decommissioned British destroyers from Colombia, flying in to Cartagena to inspect them in a small plane whose left engine was on fire.In the early 1960s, in Washington on a mission to buy weapons from the United States government \u2014 this time legally \u2014 Mr. Peres was unexpectedly invited to meet President John F. Kennedy, who put him on the spot, inquiring about Israeli intentions regarding nuclear weapons. Mr. Peres formed a spontaneous and cryptic answer: \u201cMr. President, I can tell you most clearly that we shall not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons to the region.\u201dAnd that, he relates, was how Israel\u2019s policy of nuclear ambiguity was born. A powerful deterrent, it laid the foundations for peace with Arab nations, he says. \u201cBelieving that Israel had the power to destroy them, he writes, \u201cthey one by one abandoned their ambitions to destroy us.\u201dIn the final chapter Mr. Peres describes the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, an old rival who once described Mr. Peres as an \u201cindefatigable schemer\u201d for his political manipulations. When the shots rang out Mr. Peres was just yards from Mr. Rabin who, by the end, had become his close ally in the pursuit of peace with the Palestinians.That mission remained unfulfilled.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Understand Rising Inequality, Consider the Janitors at Two Top Companies, Then and Now", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsROCHESTER \u2014 Gail Evans and Marta Ramos have one thing in common: They have each cleaned offices for one of the most innovative, profitable and all-around successful companies in the United States.For Ms. Evans, that meant being a janitor in Building 326 at Eastman Kodak\u2019s campus in Rochester in the early 1980s. For Ms. Ramos, that means cleaning at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., in the present day.In the 35 years between their jobs as janitors, corporations across America have flocked to a new management theory: Focus on core competence and outsource the rest. The approach has made companies more nimble and more productive, and delivered huge profits for shareholders. It has also fueled inequality and helps explain why many working-class Americans are struggling even in an ostensibly healthy economy.The $16.60 per hour Ms. Ramos earns as a janitor at Apple works out to about the same in inflation-adjusted terms as what Ms. Evans earned 35 years ago. But that\u2019s where the similarities end.Ms. Evans was a full-time employee of Kodak. She received more than four weeks of paid vacation per year, reimbursement of some tuition costs to go to college part time, and a bonus payment every March. When the facility she cleaned was shut down, the company found another job for her: cutting film.Ms. Ramos is an employee of a contractor that Apple uses to keep its facilities clean. She hasn\u2019t taken a vacation in years, because she can\u2019t afford the lost wages. Going back to school is similarly out of reach. There are certainly no bonuses, nor even a remote possibility of being transferred to some other role at Apple.Yet the biggest difference between their two experiences is in the opportunities they created. A manager learned that Ms. Evans was taking computer classes while she was working as a janitor and asked her to teach some other employees how to use spreadsheet software to track inventory. When she eventually finished her college degree in 1987, she was promoted to a professional-track job in information technology.Less than a decade later, Ms. Evans was chief technology officer of the whole company, and she has had a long career since as a senior executive at other top companies. Ms. Ramos sees the only advancement possibility as becoming a team leader keeping tabs on a few other janitors, which pays an extra 50 cents an hour.They both spent a lot of time cleaning floors. The difference is, for Ms. Ramos, that work is also a ceiling.Eastman Kodak was one of the technological giants of the 20th century, a dominant seller of film, cameras and other products. It made its founders unfathomably wealthy and created thousands of high-income jobs for executives, engineers and other white-collar professionals. The same is true of Apple today.\u201cThink about the contrast between George Eastman, who pioneered fundamental innovations in photography, and Steve Jobs,\u201d Mr. Summers wrote in 2014. \u201cWhile Eastman\u2019s innovations and their dissemination through the Eastman Kodak Co. provided a foundation for a prosperous middle class in Rochester for generations, no comparable impact has been created by Jobs\u2019s innovations\u201d at Apple.Ms. Evans\u2019s pathway was unusual: Few low-level workers, even in the heyday of postwar American industry, ever made it to the executive ranks of big companies. But when Kodak and similar companies were in their prime, tens of thousands of machine operators, warehouse workers, clerical assistants and the like could count on steady work and good benefits that are much rarer today.Part of the wild success of the Silicon Valley giants of today \u2014 and what makes their stocks so appealing to investors \u2014 has come from their ability to attain huge revenue and profits with relatively few workers.Apple, Alphabet (parent of Google) and Facebook generated $333 billion of revenue combined last year with 205,000 employees worldwide. In 1993, three of the most successful, technologically oriented companies based in the Northeast \u2014 Kodak, IBM and AT&T \u2014 needed more than three times as many employees, 675,000, to generate 27 percent less in inflation-adjusted revenue.Many of the professional jobs from those companies in the 1980s and \u201990s have close parallels today. The high-paying positions setting corporate strategy, developing experimental technologies and shaping marketing campaigns would look similar in either era.But a generation ago, big companies also more often directly employed people who installed products, moved goods around warehouses, worked as security guards and performed many of the other jobs needed to get products into the hands of consumers.In part, fewer of these kinds of workers are needed in an era when software plays such a big role. The lines of code that make an iPhone\u2019s camera work can be created once, then instantly transmitted across the globe, whereas each roll of film had to be manufactured and physically shipped. And companies face brutal global competition; if they don\u2019t keep their work force lean, they risk losing to a competitor that does.But major companies have also chosen to bifurcate their work force, contracting out much of the labor that goes into their products to other companies, which compete by lowering costs. It\u2019s not just janitors and security guards. In Silicon Valley, the people who test operating systems for bugs, review social media posts that may violate guidelines, and screen thousands of job applications are unlikely to receive a paycheck directly from the company they are ultimately working for.\u201cWe\u2019re responsible for creating over two million jobs in the U.S., across all 50 states,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, \u201cranging from construction, customer care, retail and engineering to app development, manufacturing, operations and trucking. All Apple employees, whether full time or part time, are eligible for benefits and stock grants. We\u2019re also fortunate to have skilled contractors that contribute to our products and services daily, along with over 9,000 suppliers in every state.\u201dPerhaps the biggest indictment of the more paternalistic approach taken by an earlier generation of corporate behemoths is that, Kodak, despite having been an early innovator in digital photography, is a shell of its former self. After a bankruptcy and many years of layoffs, the company now has only 2,700 employees in the United States and 6,100 worldwide.The same forces that explain the difference between 1980s Kodak and today\u2019s Apple have big implications not just for every blue-collar employee who punches a timecard, but also for white-collar professionals who swipe a badge.Phil Harnden was coming out of the Navy in 1970 when he applied for a job at Kodak, and soon was operating a forklift in a warehouse. He made $3 an hour, equivalent to $20 an hour today adjusted for inflation. That is roughly what an entry-level contracting job testing software pays.The difference between the two gigs, aside from the absence of heavy machinery in Apple\u2019s sleek offices, is the sense of permanence. Mr. Harnden put in 16 years operating forklifts before he left in 1986 to move to Florida. When he returned 10 years later, he was quickly rehired and even kept his seniority benefits.In interviews, tech industry contractors in Silicon Valley describe a culture of transience. They can end up commuting to a different office park that houses a new company every few months; in many cases 18 months is the maximum a contractor is allowed to spend at one company.\u201cI would rather have stability,\u201d said Christopher Kohl, 29, who has worked as a contractor at several Silicon Valley companies, including a stint doing quality assurance on Apple Maps. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful to find a new job every 12 to 18 months.\u201dFor Silicon Valley\u2019s contracting class, there are reminders large and small of their second-class status. Contractors generally do not receive the stock options that have made some midlevel Silicon Valley workers wealthy over the years, nor the generous paid time off for vacation, illness or the birth of a child. The health insurance plans tend to be stingier than those that the tech giants they serve provide for their direct employees.The smaller reminders can be just as telling. One former Apple contractor recalled spending months testing a new version of Apple\u2019s operating system. To celebrate the release, the Apple employees they\u2019d worked closely with on the project were invited to a splashy party in San Francisco, while the contractors had beers among themselves in a neighborhood pub.The compensation these white-collar contractors receive puts them squarely in the middle rungs of workers in the United States, and the most skilled can make six figures (though that doesn\u2019t go far in the hyper-expensive Bay Area housing market). Apple, based on its consultants\u2019 report, expected to be indirectly responsible for nearly 18,000 jobs in Santa Clara County by now at an average pay of about $56,000 a year.There are some advantages. If they work for one of the companies like Apple or Google that feature a subsidized, high-quality cafeteria, contractors can enjoy the food. They can tell their friends that they work at one of the world\u2019s most admired companies, and enjoy predictable, regular hours. Once in a while, a contractor will be hired into a staff position.\u201cIt\u2019s not evil,\u201d said Pradeep Chauhan, managing partner of OnContracting, a site to help people find tech contracting positions. \u201cThey have a job and they\u2019re getting paid. But it\u2019s not ideal. The problem with contracting is, you could walk in one day and they could say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to come in tomorrow.\u2019 There is no obligation from the companies.\u201dAnd that is the ultimate contrast with the middle-skill, middle-wage jobs of earlier generations of titans \u2014 a sense of permanence, of sharing in the long-term success of the company.\u201cThere were times I wasn\u2019t happy with the place,\u201d Mr. Harnden said of his Kodak years. \u201cBut it was a great company to work for and gave me a good living for a long time.\u201dWhen an automaker needs a supplier of transmissions for its cars, it doesn\u2019t just hold an auction and buy from the lowest bidder. It enters a long-term relationship with the supplier it believes will provide the best quality and price over time. The company\u2019s very future is at stake \u2014 nobody wants to buy a car that can\u2019t reliably shift into first gear.But when that same automaker needs some staplers for the office supply cabinet, it is more likely to seek out the lowest price it can get, pretty much indifferent to the identity of the seller.Labor exists on a similar continuum.The right product engineer or marketing executive can mean the difference between success or failure, and companies tend to hire such people as full-time employees and as part of a long-term relationship \u2014 something like the transmission supplier. What has changed in the last generation is that companies today view more and more of the labor it takes to produce their goods and services as akin to staplers: something to be procured at the time and place needed for the lowest price possible.There\u2019s no inherent reason that work done through a contractor should involve lower compensation than the same work done under direct employment. Sometimes it goes in the other direction; when a company hires a law firm, it is basically contracting out legal work, yet lawyers at a firm tend to be paid better than in-house counsel.But as more companies have outsourced more functions over more time, a strong body of evidence is emerging that it\u2019s not just about efficiency. It seems to be a way for big companies to reduce compensation costs.Firms in the United States are legally required to offer the same health insurance options and 401(k) match to all employees \u2014 meaning if those programs are made extra generous to attract top engineers, a company that doesn\u2019t outsource will have to pay them for everyone.More broadly, there are a whole set of social pressures and worries about morale that encourage companies to be more generous with pay and benefits for employees who are on the same payroll.\u201cThere was an overriding concern about equity,\u201d said Mr. Cobb, the Wharton professor. \u201cFirms would try to set pay so that the gap between the security guard or administrative assistant and senior V.P. wasn\u2019t as great as you might expect, essentially by paying lower- and middle-skill workers more than they were probably worth on the market.\u201dLinda DiStefano applied for a secretarial job at Kodak during Easter week of her senior year in high school in 1968, and was hired to start immediately after her graduation for $87.50 a week, today\u2019s equivalent of $32,000 a year. She put in four decades at the company, first as a secretary, then helped administer corporate travel and other projects.\u201cI helped put on the dinners for the board of directors, which in retrospect someone of my grade shouldn\u2019t have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I had a series of managers who trusted me.\u201dIt bought her a house off Lake Avenue, a new car every few years and occasional long-distance trips to Motown reunion concerts. When her department was abolished in 2008, the travel bookings contracted out, she was making $20 an hour. The best job she could find was as a pharmacy technician at a grocery store for $8.50 an hour.As you drive around Rochester, the role of Eastman Kodak in the city is evident everywhere, in the Kodak Tower that looms over the center of town, in the Eastman Theater on Main Street, and in the hulking buildings and empty parking lots of the manufacturing center known as Kodak Park.In reading the company\u2019s old annual reports, you get a sense that its executives thought of the jobs created and the wages paid as a source of pride and achievement. On the first page of most years\u2019 annual reports was an accounting of how many employees the company had in the United States and worldwide, and the total pay and benefits they received.Apple, with a spaceship-like campus about to open, looms large over Cupertino in its own way, accounting for something like 40 percent of the jobs in the city, and investing $70 million in local environmental and infrastructure upgrades. It is no middle-class enclave; the median home price is $1.9 million.\u201cWe definitely feel a sense of pride to be the home of Apple,\u201d said Savita Vaidhyanathan, the mayor of Cupertino. \u201cBut they consider themselves a global company, not necessarily a Cupertino company.\u201d She said she has never met Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe would have a hard time getting an audience with anybody beyond upper-middle management,\u201d she said.Ms. Ramos, the Apple janitor, lives down the road in San Jose. She pays $2,300 monthly for a two-bedroom apartment where she and her four children live. Before overtime and taxes, her $16.60 an hour works out to $34,520 a year. Her rent alone is $27,600 a year, leaving less than $600 a month once the rent is paid. Overtime, in addition to the wages from one of her teenage children who works part time at a grocery store, helps make the math work, though always tenuously.She works from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. On days when one of the other cleaners doesn\u2019t show up, she may get a few extra hours, which is great for the overtime pay, but it means even less sleep before it is time to take her children to school.A 60-cent-an-hour raise this year negotiated by her union, the SEIU United Service Workers West, helped.

{"Headline": "What Jamie Dimon Is Missing About Bitcoin", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewJPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is the most successful banker of his generation. He has successfully navigated a challenging environment over more than a decade, and his firm is stronger than ever.It\u2019s no secret that Bitcoin and other digital currencies may dramatically fall in value at any time. How can an asset whose value jumps by 20 percent some days, and which no one can accurately value, plausibly not also suffer huge declines?But that\u2019s a long way from Bitcoin being a worthless fraud.While we are still in the early stages of digital currencies, and much can still go wrong, Mr. Dimon\u2019s rationale for his negativity was curious. His core problem with Bitcoin? \u201cYou can\u2019t have a business where people are going to invent a currency out of thin air,\u201d he said.And in any event, most of gold\u2019s value doesn\u2019t arise from its physical attributes, since it doesn\u2019t have any magical ability to create usefulness or generate financial dividends despite its attractive shiny yellow hue. It\u2019s instead because investors have believed in its value for thousands of years.Of course, fiat currencies like the dollar have the backing of a sovereign nation. Digital currencies are obviously far more speculative, have been around for only a few years, and don\u2019t have a government\u2019s underlying support. But almost all currencies today are conjured up from nothing \u2014 the euro didn\u2019t even exist 20 years ago \u2014 and their value is largely dependent on trust.Naturally, most people have more trust in the \u201cfull faith and credit of the United States\u201d than in an anonymous distributed group of miners and traders. But trust in digital currency is clearly building over time and is a self-reinforcing network. And one of the advantages of Bitcoin is that its total supply is fixed. A fiat currency, on the other hand, can be devalued by centralized monetary policy.Mr. Dimon is also too modest about JPMorgan\u2019s own achievements in this arena. His firm conjured up its own currency: Chase Ultimate Reward points, its credit card loyalty program. Millions of customers have accumulated billions of points, trusting in Chase\u2019s promise that this currency can be converted into cash or used for travel and other delights. And they hope that Chase won\u2019t unilaterally choose to devalue them, while living with the risk that, unlike their bank accounts, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides no insurance for this valuable currency.In Mr. Dimon\u2019s telling, Bitcoin has value only for people who want to bypass the traditional banking system for illicit purposes, including \u201cmurderers and drug dealers,\u201d or people living in countries with repressive governments like North Korea and Venezuela. He doubts that this is a large market opportunity, though perhaps he may concede that there are inherent difficulties in accurately sizing up markets where participants like to keep a low profile.Part of the promise of the blockchain, and associated digital currencies, is the absence of a central authority. It\u2019s fair to say that the cult of decentralization may have run too far, with some enthusiasts imagining it as a panacea for every business problem. Centralized networks work well for many functions, like trading stocks or managing flight reservations.But new use cases for digital currencies are just starting to take shape. They are now being used to create value in the way that Silicon Valley has traditionally done so: regulatory arbitrage. Ride-hailing got its start avoiding onerous taxi medallion costs; Airbnb avoided hotel taxes and regulations; and YouTube played fast and loose with copyright rules.Similarly, some entrepreneurs are using the blockchain as a way to avoid certain regulatory requirements for raising capital. As a rule, Silicon Valley prefers to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.Companies are also creating tokens to align incentives around decentralized efforts like open source software or distributed storage networks.Undoubtedly, there will be plenty of hits and misses, as one would expect in the early days of a new technology. And there will be some outright scams as well.But the toothpaste is now out of the tube, and there is sufficient momentum for legitimate use cases to develop. Presumably, that\u2019s why JPMorgan itself is investing resources in developing these technologies and applications.Economists use the term \u201ccheap talk\u201d for words that don\u2019t have any payoff. Despite his withering Bitcoin critique, Mr. Dimon also said, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to short it. It could be at $20,000 before this happens, but it will eventually blow up.\u201dMr. Dimon added that he would fire any employee who traded Bitcoin. But he didn\u2019t say how he would deal with an employee who publicly identifies a $70 billion fraud \u2014 then doesn\u2019t find a way to make a dime out of it.Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He has direct and indirect interest in shares of JPMorgan Chase, as well as in both digital currencies and platforms that trade in them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Best Investment Since 1926? Apple", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe iPhone helped to catapult Apple into its position as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company. But now Apple has another and, arguably, more exalted stock market distinction.In the history of the markets since 1926, Apple has generated more profit for investors than any other American company.But a relative handful of stocks are extraordinary performers. Only 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks account for all of the net wealth earned by investors in the stock market since 1926, he has found. A mere 30 stocks account for 30 percent of the net wealth generated by stocks in that long period, and 50 stocks account for 40 percent of the net wealth.In a phone conversation, Professor Bessembinder reminded me that the stock market is a moving target and that his rankings, while valid through the end of 2016, don\u2019t capture the sharp movements of this calendar year. In his 2016 rankings, Exxon Mobil, not Apple, appears at the top, with net wealth creation of more than $1 trillion. Apple lags at about $745 billion.But it has been a wild year. Exxon Mobil shares have declined more than 11 percent at a time of weak energy prices, while Apple, which just introduced a raft of new iPhones, is on a spectacular stock surge, gaining more than 37 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that Apple has generated so much wealth in such a short period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cExxon has had decades to pile up those returns.\u201dExxon is among the top wealth-creating companies that have been publicly trading \u2014 under the name of a predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 since the inception of Professor Bessembinder\u2019s tally in July 1926. Others include General Electric, IBM, Altria, Coca-Cola, DuPont, PepsiCo and Schlumberger.General Motors, for example, ranks eighth. It was publicly traded in 1926, but the list says it ceased to exist in June 2009. A company called General Motors exists today, of course, but as Chloe Fu, senior support and relationship manager at the Center for Research in Security Prices, explained it, G.M.\u2019s bailout and bankruptcy led the center to declare the old company terminated, with a new G.M. coming to life in June 2009. Consequently, the new G.M. returns aren\u2019t included in the total for G.M. on the list.The list is a fascinating ranking of big winners in the stock market. But for a variety of technical reasons, it isn\u2019t a straightforward table of the greatest wealth generators in market history. For example, the long-term gains generated by Exxon Mobil and its predecessors are understated because of the database\u2019s limited duration and strict criteria.Exxon Mobil\u2019s wealth in the list doesn\u2019t include Mobil\u2019s, which Professor Bessembinder\u2019s listing says, ceased to exist in November 1999, when it merged with Exxon. And going back further, both Exxon and Mobil were among the descendants of the Standard Oil trust, established by John D. Rockefeller and his partners in the 19th century. The total wealth generated by the cluster of companies derived at least partially from the trust \u2014 which also include Amoco and Chevron \u2014 doesn\u2019t appear in a single notation, because of the list\u2019s logic.Other apparent oddities are explained by Professor Bessembinder\u2019s application of the center\u2019s criteria. There are two companies on the list called AT&T, for example, neither capturing the total net wealth generated by an investment in the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company at its 19th century inception.Other AT&T cousins are on the list: Verizon, as well as Comcast, which resulted from a merger between AT&T Broadband and an older company also known as Comcast.The listings for most of the recently created companies are less tangled.As I wrote in July, Amazon, which started trading in 1997, has soared to the 14th spot. Although it hasn\u2019t been in existence long compared with Exxon Mobil, its annualized return is the highest in the list, 37.4 percent through December. A group of young companies have also had remarkable results.Facebook, which started trading in June 2012, is the youngest on the list, with an annualized return of 34.5 percent. Visa, which had its initial public offering of stock in 2008, is the second-newest company, with a 21 percent annualized return, followed by Alphabet (Google), ranked 11th with a 24.9 percent annualized return.And then there is that great wealth machine, Microsoft, ranked as the third-greatest wealth creator. Since 1986, it has had an annualized return of 25 percent, making its founder, Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, with a net worth of more than $87 billion, according to Bloomberg.No list of wealth-generating companies is complete without Berkshire Hathaway. It ranks 12th, just behind Alphabet, with an annualized return of 22.6 percent. By comparison, Exxon Mobil\u2019s annualized return was only 11.94 percent.Why is Berkshire\u2019s annualized return so much higher?It is because the return doesn\u2019t include decades of mediocre performance for the old textile company Berkshire Hathaway, which started in 1929. The Center for Research says the Berkshire on this list started in November 1976. It was a holding company for Warren E. Buffett, who guided it to fabulous gains. Thanks to Berkshire, Mr. Buffett is a rich man, with a net worth estimated by Bloomberg at $79 billion.Anyone who invested in Apple or Microsoft or, really, in any of these companies at their inception and just held on did extraordinarily well. You might look at that record and conclude that you should just buy the best companies as a foolproof way to get rich.If only it were that easy.How do you find those companies? Not here.\u201cThe problem is, I have no idea which companies will generate the best returns over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, \u201c Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cProbably it will be some companies we\u2019ve never heard of. Maybe it will be companies that don\u2019t even exist now.\u201dThis list is worth studying for understanding the past. But, unfortunately, it\u2019s not a guide to the future, except for this: \u201cIn a market where most of the gains are attributable to a few big winners that are hard to identify in advance,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said, \u201cit makes a lot of sense to diversify your position \u2014 to avoid the danger of omitting the big winners from your portfolio.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Feel That Post-Recession Bounce? The Rich Feel It the Most", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEight years after the Great Recession officially ended, the fruits of economic growth are finally spreading to low-wage workers, racial and ethnic minorities and other groups that were largely left out of the early stages of the recovery.But in a pattern that has become familiar in recent decades, the biggest gains continued to flow to the richest Americans.But despite the gains, wealth also become more concentrated:\u2022 The richest 1 percent of households controlled 38.6 percent of total wealth in 2016, up from 36.3 percent in 2013.\u2022 The bottom 90 percent of households controlled 22.8 percent of all wealth.Wednesday\u2019s data, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, shows the strength of the economic rebound in recent years, but also just how large a hole the recession left in many households\u2019 finances.The survey is notable for providing information not just on Americans\u2019 yearly income but also on their assets, debts and overall net worth \u2014 measures that are in many ways more important to families\u2019 financial security. In terms of income, the typical American has made significant progress in recent years, with median household income nearly back to its prerecession peak.The broader measures of household finances provided by the survey paint a less rosy picture. The recession sliced nearly 40 percent off the typical household\u2019s net worth, and even after the recent rebound, median net worth remains more than 30 percent below its 2007 level.For many groups, the recovery is even more incomplete.Younger, less-educated and lower-income workers have experienced relatively strong income gains in recent years, but remain far short of their prerecession level in both income and wealth. Only for the richest 10 percent of Americans does net worth surpass the 2007 level.Racial and ethnic minorities experienced the strongest gains in wealth in the 2016 survey, a stark reversal from three years earlier, when the survey showed minority families losing ground even as white families experienced modest gains.Black families\u2019 net worth rose 29 percent between 2013 and 2016, and Hispanic families had a 46 percent gain; white families saw a more modest 17 percent increase.Americans, and higher-income whites in particular, vastly overestimate progress toward economic equality between blacks and whites.Just over half of American families \u2014 52 percent \u2014 owned stock in 2016, the first time stockholders represented a majority of Americans since before the financial crisis. But only a relative handful of families own stock outside of retirement accounts, and even counting those accounts, their holdings are often small.The typical stock owner held $40,000 in stock in 2016; among those in the top 10 percent of earners, that figure was nearly $365,000.Households have made significant progress in one area: debt.Americans are significantly less indebted than before the recession and, significantly, they are better able to afford the debts they have. The median borrower had debts equal to 95.1 percent of income in 2016; the figure was 111.1 percent before the recession and rose to 118.8 percent in the immediate aftermath. Moreover, fewer Americans report being late on debt payments, filing for bankruptcy or taking out high-interest payday loans.One type of debt is still rising, however: student loans. More than 22 percent of families reported having education debt in 2016, up from 15 percent before the recession. The median borrower owed $19,000.The oldest Americans have seen a significant rebound in their wealth in recent years; the typical household headed by someone 75 or older is now worth modestly more than before the recession, after adjusting for inflation. But younger retirees and those on the verge of retirement haven\u2019t come close to making up what they lost in the recession.That\u2019s not surprising: Older workers were especially exposed to the stock-market plunge and didn\u2019t have much time to recover before retirement.The median household headed by someone between the ages of 55 and 74 had less than $60,000 in financial assets in 2016, down from roughly $80,000 in 2007. Adding to the challenge, older Americans\u2019 homes \u2014 the principal nonfinancial asset for many families \u2014 are still worth less than before the recession.\u201cThis is not good news for retirement security,\u201d said Monique Morrissey, an economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.E.C. Rules to Protect Investors From Cyberthreats Fall Short", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameAt first glance, the hacking disclosed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday didn\u2019t seem too much of a concern to investors.The intrusion, after all, appeared to be limited to the S.E.C.\u2019s database of corporate filings, like annual and quarterly financial reports and proxy statements.Still, said Jay Clayton, the S.E.C. chairman, the episode \u201chighlighted the importance of cybersecurity to the agency and market participants.\u201dI\u2019ll say.As a result of these holes, investors\u2019 trades on certain venues may be more vulnerable to hacking than on others. And because of the interconnectedness of the technologies supporting the nation\u2019s stock trading systems, hackers gaining access to one venue could easily disrupt entire swaths of the market.The S.E.C. rule required exchanges and certain other trading venues to have comprehensive procedures ensuring \u201cthe robustness and resiliency of their technological systems.\u201dBut many large trading venues did not have to comply with the rule. Among them were firms that buy stock orders from retail brokerage firms, known as wholesalers or internalizers. Certain alternative trading systems were also let off the hook, including some that are operated by large brokerage companies like Morgan Stanley.Among the entities that don\u2019t have to adhere to the cybersecurity rule are firms that handle vast volumes of trades in the nation\u2019s equity markets. Citadel Securities, the broker-dealer unit of the powerhouse founded by Kenneth Griffin, is an example.A division of the company \u2014 Citadel Execution Services \u2014 is what\u2019s known as a wholesale firm. It buys investors\u2019 orders from retail brokerage firms that don\u2019t have their own trading operations and executes the transactions against stocks it holds in inventory. Some 200 brokerage firms, including Charles Schwab, Scottrade and E-Trade, sell their customers\u2019 orders to Citadel.It seems odd, given the volume of trades handled by Citadel, that the S.E.C. would not require the firm to follow its heightened cybersecurity rules. So I asked the S.E.C. about this decision. A spokeswoman declined to comment.I also asked Citadel about its internal protections against cyberattacks. A spokesman declined to comment.Also disquieting about the rule: Nowhere does the agency publish the list of entities that comply with the systems integrity rule. If this regulation was supposed to protect investors, as the S.E.C. contended when it put it into effect, why aren\u2019t investors allowed to know which trading venues have strong cybersystems in place and which may not?\u201cInvestors are unable to determine whether their orders are being routed to market centers which are being held to the requirement of having a strong, audited cybersecurity program,\u201d Mr. Warner wrote in a letter to Mr. Clayton on Aug. 1. \u201cIf compromised, these market centers could destabilize markets by not having the protections in place that the S.E.C. has outlined in Reg SCI to strengthen the integrity of our markets.\u201dThe S.E.C. was right to require market trading venues to tighten their security systems. Investors rely heavily on these entities.But exempting major firms may mean it did only half the job. And surely investors have the right to know which firms are meeting the heightened standards.Mr. Warner thinks so. \u201cEfforts to strengthen our nation\u2019s financial infrastructure, such as Reg SCI, are critical to financial stability and the security of our country,\u201d he said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cProviding investors with information about which market centers are subject to Reg SCI and whether they are in compliance would encourage market center adoption of strong cybersecurity standards and help investors protect themselves from cyberrisks.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated which large stock trading venues are exempt from the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s cybersecurity rule. The alternative trading system operated by UBS must comply with the rule; it is not among those that do not have to comply.Advertisement"}

On Friday, for example, the rally continued despite news that North Korea had launched its second missile in a month over Japan. Instead, the market focused on strong performances from tech stocks.Standard & Poor\u2019s bellwether stocks index spent much of the day flirting with 2,500. In the final moments of the trading day, investors nudged the benchmark to 2,500.23, up nearly five points on the day.

Its shares rose 6.3 percent, or $10.71, to $180.11 after its leadership in artificial-intelligence development was lauded in a client note from Evercore ISI.Second, the extended period of ultralow interest rates has been a boon.

{"Headline": "Attacked by Rotten Tomatoes", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Hollywood had a horrible summer.Between the first weekend in May and Labor Day, a sequel-stuffed period that typically accounts for 40 percent of annual ticket sales, box office revenue in North America totaled $3.8 billion, a 15 percent decline from the same span last year. To find a slower summer, you would have to go back 20 years. Business has been so bad that America\u2019s three biggest theater chains have lost roughly $4 billion in market value since May.Ready for the truly alarming part? Hollywood is blaming a website: Rotten Tomatoes.\u201cI think it\u2019s the destruction of our business,\u201d Brett Ratner, the director, producer and film financier, said at a film festival this year.Some studio executives privately concede that a few recent movies \u2014 just a few \u2014 were simply bad. Flawed marketing may have played a role in a couple of other instances, they acknowledged, along with competition from Netflix and Amazon.But most studio fingers point toward Rotten Tomatoes, which boils down hundreds of reviews to give films \u201cfresh\u201d or \u201crotten\u201d scores on its Tomatometer. The site has surged in popularity, attracting 13.6 million unique visitors in May, a 32 percent increase above last year\u2019s total for the month, according to the analytics firm comScore.Studio executives\u2019 complaints about Rotten Tomatoes include the way its Tomatometer hacks off critical nuance, the site\u2019s seemingly loose definition of who qualifies as a critic and the spread of Tomatometer scores across the web. Last year, scores started appearing on Fandango, the online movie ticket-selling site, leading to grousing that a rotten score next to the purchase button was the same as posting this message: You are an idiot if you pay to see this movie.Mr. Ratner\u2019s sentiment was echoed almost daily in studio dining rooms all summer, although not for attribution, for fear of giving Rotten Tomatoes more credibility. Over lunch last month, the chief executive of a major movie company looked me in the eye and declared flatly that his mission was to destroy the review-aggregation site.How did a clunky website that has been around for 19 years amass such power?The 36 people who work for Rotten Tomatoes hardly seem like industry killers. The site\u2019s staff occupies a relatively ordinary Beverly Hills office complex \u2014 albeit one with conference rooms named \u201cLa La Land\u201d and \u201cOz\u201d \u2014 and includes people like Jeff Voris, an easygoing former Disney executive with graying hair who oversees operations, and Timothy Ryan, a former newspaper reporter who is a Rotten Tomatoes senior editor and lists \u201cLeonard Maltin\u2019s Movie Guide\u201d as favorite reading.The employee with the pink mohawk is Grae Drake, senior movie editor. She does a lot of video interviews and lately has been helping to fill a void created when Matt Atchity left as editor in chief in July for a bigger job at TYT Network, an online video company.Jeff Giles, a 12-year Rotten Tomatoes veteran and the author of books like \u201cLlanview in the Afternoon: An Oral History of \u2018One Life to Live\u2019,\u201d writes what the site calls Critics Consensus, a one-sentence summary of the response to each film. (Disney\u2019s latest \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movie was summarized as proving \u201cthat neither a change in directors nor an undead Javier Bardem is enough to drain this sinking franchise\u2019s murky bilge.\u201d)\u201cEveryone here sweats the details every day,\u201d said Paul Yanover, the president of Fandango, which owns Rotten Tomatoes. \u201cBecause we are serious movie fans ourselves, our priority \u2014 our entire focus \u2014 is being as useful to fans as we absolutely can be.\u201dHold on a minute. Fandango?Mr. Yanover said it was silly for studios to make Rotten Tomatoes a box office scapegoat.\u201cThere is no question that there is some correlation to box office performance \u2014 critics matter \u2014 but I don\u2019t think Rotten Tomatoes can definitively make or break a movie in either direction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who says otherwise is cherry-picking examples to create a hypothesis.\u201dHe cited \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d which was the No. 1 movie of the summer, with $410 million in ticket sales. It was undoubtedly helped by a strong Tomatometer score of 92. \u201cDunkirk,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d all received high scores and drew huge crowds. Other films did not do well on the Tomatometer (\u201cThe Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard,\u201d \u201cThe Emoji Movie\u201d) but still managed to find audiences.Some filmmakers complain bitterly that Rotten Tomatoes casts too wide a critical net. The site says it works with some 3,000 critics worldwide, including bloggers and YouTube-based pundits. But should reviewers from Screen Junkies and Punch Drunk Critics really be treated as the equals of those from The Los Angeles Times and The New Yorker?For the studios, the question of how individual reviews get classified as fresh or rotten is also a point of contention. Only about half of critics self-submit reviews and classifications to the site. Rotten Tomatoes staffers comb the web and pull the other half themselves. They then assign positive or negative grades.\u201cWe have a well-defined process,\u201d said Mr. Voris, the vice president of Rotten Tomatoes. \u201cOur curators audit each other\u2019s work. If there is any question about how a review should be classified, we have three curators separate and do independent reads. If there still isn\u2019t agreement, we call the journalist.\u201dStaff members also fact-check what critics have self-submitted. In one recent instance, a review of \u201cAlien: Covenant\u201d that was submitted as fresh seemed rotten. The site reversed the categorization after contacting the critic for clarification.Mr. Voris brushed aside the studios\u2019 protests \u2014 shared by many critics \u2014 that the Tomatometer ratings damage films because they reduce nuanced reviews to blunt scores.Still, it is the Tomatometer scores that have become ubiquitous across the web. Rotten Tomatoes makes money through partnerships with companies like Apple, which lists the scores next to iTunes movie rentals and purchases. And to the dismay of movie marketers, Google has started to prominently display the scores even when users do not specifically search for them: Enter the name of a film into the search bar and the Tomatometer results pop up on the top right side of the results page, directly under the film\u2019s poster.\u201cRotten Tomatoes isn\u2019t new, but its omnipresence is,\u201d said Tim Palen, Lionsgate\u2019s president of theatrical marketing. \u201cThe scores are even part of the local TV news on Friday going into the weekend.\u201dIn past years, studio publicists would occasionally lobby Rotten Tomatoes to include positive reviews from far-flung publications as a way of improving scores, especially for films with a 59 \u2014 on the line between receiving a red, plump fruit label (fresh) or the dreaded splotch of green goo (rotten). But Hollywood more or less lived with it.Four things changed.There was Fandango\u2019s integration of Tomatometer scores with its ticketing platforms, which service about 28,000 movie screens in North America. Now, when Fandango customers buy tickets to a movie in the days leading up to its release, they are confronted by the film\u2019s Tomatometer score. After the movie is released, a different Rotten Tomatoes rating \u2014 one based on audience response, which is invariably positive \u2014 begins to pop up on Fandango next to the Tomatometer score.Then there is Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 growth into a very popular hub. In 2009, the site, which sells advertising, attracted about 1.8 million unique visitors per month. It now attracts as many as 14 million unique visitors a month. The broader Fandango portfolio of sites reaches 60 million unique visitors a month.Consumer behavior is also changing. People increasingly rely on review aggregation sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor to make all kinds of spending decisions. The trend is especially visible among young people, who make up Hollywood\u2019s most important audience. According to National Research Group, a movie industry consulting firm, 34 percent of American teenagers now check Rotten Tomatoes before buying a ticket, up from 23 percent in 2014.Most importantly, studios are panicking because moviegoing is no longer a habit for most Americans. Because of climbing prices and competition from other forms of entertainment, a trip to the multiplex has become a special event. In particular, more movie fans are ignoring low- and mid-budget films when they are in theaters: Ehh, let\u2019s wait until they show up on Netflix.Studios are trying to battle Rotten Tomatoes on multiple fronts.Another way to undercut Rotten Tomatoes involves restricting reviews until the last possible minute. Sony set a review embargo of opening day for \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d which left the Tomatometer blank until after many advance tickets had been sold and families had made weekend plans. \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d which ultimately received a Tomatometer score of 8, squeezed out decent opening-weekend ticket sales of $24.5 million.If Rotten Tomatoes is a monster, the studios helped create it. As much as they fear and loathe low scores, they love high ones. Sony recently ended its trailer for \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d a heist thriller, by flashing the Rotten Tomatoes logo and \u201c100 percent,\u201d the film\u2019s Tomatometer score at the time. (It later slipped to 94.) Annapurna did the same thing for \u201cDetroit\u201d in television ads. (Not that it helped; that drama flopped.)And Rotten Tomatoes is getting stronger. The site is working to build its Tomatometer scores for TV shows into a more formidable force. Also in development are a half-dozen video series, including one built around a cheeky event created by Ms. Drake, the senior movie editor, called Your Opinion Sucks.At that event, which started at the Comic-Con International fan convention in San Diego a few years ago, movie fans debate critics. The hourlong sessions can get heated.\u201cLet\u2019s just say that it\u2019s not an accident that I chose a costume that needs a whip,\u201d Ms. Drake said as she prepared to co-host one of three sessions at Comic-Con in July. (She was dressed as Catwoman.)Snarky wisecracks from the critics and hosts started to fly. The stars have as much chemistry as \u201ca mop and a bucket,\u201d one said. Ms. Drake\u2019s co-host, the comedian Scott Aukerman, said that \u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d the eighth movie in the action series, should have been called \u201cNo one wants to act with Vin Diesel anymore\u201d because the actor had a separate storyline for much of the film.It was time for the audience to vote. Most of the 200 or so people assembled raised green paddles, and so the movie was pronounced rotten.With an intestinal gurgle sound effect.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vanguard Speaks Softly but Carries a Big Stick", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe activist hedge-fund manager Paul Singer recently warned that the rise of so-called passive investing risked distorting markets and \u201cdevouring capitalism.\u201dBut although index-tracking funds can\u2019t sell stocks when they spot trouble ahead, they aren\u2019t without influence.Vanguard demonstrated as much with its latest report on investment stewardship. The giant $4.5 trillion mutual-fund manager stepped up its corporate engagement activity in the 12 months that ended in June, holding discussions with more than 900 companies around the world on governance, pay and other issues. It also voted against management at Exxon Mobil, Viacom and Wells Fargo on climate change, pay and the like. And it supported 47 percent of board-related proposals put forward by outside shareholders at American companies, up from 17 percent the previous year.The company, founded by the indexing pioneer John C. Bogle, has been slower than its rival BlackRock to find a more active voice. Vanguard describes its engagements anecdotally without identifying companies, unlike BlackRock, a $5.7 trillion manager led by Laurence D. Fink, which used a recent report to provide detailed arguments against Exxon Mobil\u2019s refusal to disclose its climate-related risks and against drugmaker Mylan\u2019s executive-pay policies. Vanguard\u2019s detailed proxy-voting record shows its votes lined up alongside BlackRock\u2019s at both companies.In an open letter to corporate directors, Vanguard\u2019s chairman and chief executive, F. William McNabb III, said the firm was determined to press its investors\u2019 interest and prod companies to manage for the long term precisely because the index funds that make up nearly three-quarters of its assets hold their securities almost indefinitely.Among other things, he stressed the need for gender diversity on boards, an issue that another indexing heavyweight, State Street Global Advisors, championed this year, too.Index-tracking managers may not throw their weight around publicly like Mr. Singer\u2019s Elliott Management and other activists, but their sheer size gives them sway. Vanguard alone owns on average more than 6 percent of every company in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index. In one specific instance, it joined the large vote against Stephen Sanger\u2019s re-election to Wells Fargo\u2019s board over the bank\u2019s unauthorized accounts scandal, contributing to the bank\u2019s recent decision to replace Mr. Sanger as chairman with Elizabeth A. Duke.Mr. McNabb and his managers talk softly, but they carry a big stick.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fixing the \u2018Brain Damage\u2019 Caused by the I.P.O. Process", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cIt seems like a way of living in hell without dying.\u201dIt is no secret that the public stock markets \u2014 despite the heights they\u2019ve reached (and the credit that President Trump has taken for them) \u2014 are fundamentally broken. No chief executive wants to live in the glare of the public spotlight and deal with pesky investors who hold stocks in time frames of days and months, not years and decades.The number of companies listed on public stock exchanges is half what it was two decades ago. Last year, fewer companies went public than during the financial crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s a strange world. If it was 10 years ago, we\u2019d be public by now,\u201d Stewart Butterfield, chief executive of Slack, an office messaging company worth $5.1 billion, told The Financial Times over the weekend.The idea is to remove \u201cthe process of going public that is true brain damage,\u201d Mr. Palihapitiya said.At the same time, Spotify, the streaming music company worth some $13 billion, has been exploring a plan to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange directly, without raising any new money from public investors.Perhaps the most ambitious and provocative effort is a company that until now was in \u201cstealth mode\u201d: LTSE (Long-Term Stock Exchange), led by the entrepreneur Eric Ries. Backed by a who\u2019s who of venture-capital investors \u2014 Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman and Steve Case among them \u2014 the new exchange aims to reimagine what it means to even be a public company. Among its changes to the ecosystem: the voting rights of investors (the longer you own, the more voting power you have), new disclosure policies (including a moratorium on \u201cguidance\u201d) and a complete rewrite of compensation schemes so that executives truly focus on the long term (it recommends vesting stock over as long as a decade).Before we go too far down the rabbit hole of how to fix the problem, it is worth understanding how the I.P.O. process \u2014 and the markets themselves \u2014 became so broken.To hear Mr. Palihapitiya tell it, the shift \u2014 at least in Silicon Valley \u2014 began during the financial crisis, when he was working at Facebook. His candid explanation is surprising.\u201cWe at Facebook basically flipped the narrative, and we did it on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cOur whole thing was \u2018Let\u2019s stay private longer.\u2019 And the reason we did that was we were pretty sure it would trick a lot of other people into not trying to go public or take advantage of the capital markets.\u201dHe said Facebook hoped that \u201call those companies would eventually die because they were not that good and we would suck up all of their talent.\u201dWhether it was a trick or not, \u201cstay private longer\u201d became a mantra in Silicon Valley. And given all the cash sloshing around the technology industry, companies have been able to put off going public without going broke.But it has created all sorts of problems, not least of which is that employees have felt that their social contract with companies \u2014 working for little salary but lots of stock on the assumption the companies would go public \u2014 has fallen apart. And it may very well be affecting innovation.Mr. Palihapitiya said the lament of many employees had become this: \u201cI can\u2019t pay for my house on \u2018mission and values.\u2019 I actually need current compensation. Silicon Valley is now one of the most expensive places to live.\u201d So many employees, he explained, have been hopscotching from one company to the next in search of an elusive I.P.O.\u201cNow you have these attrition rates of like 20-plus percent,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you supposed to build an iconic legacy business when your entire employee base walks out the door every five years?\u201dMr. Palihapitiya\u2019s answer is to eliminate the I.P.O. process and its year and a half of \u201cdistractions trying to craft a bogus narrative,\u201d as he described it, to entice investors. Instead, through his publicly traded vehicle, a unicorn company \u2014 shorthand for a $1 billion-plus private technology company \u2014 could reverse merge into it, instantly becoming public.Unlike an initial public offering, in which employees and early investors all have certain \u201clockup\u201d dates for when they can sell stock, he can write the rules however the company wants. Certain employees, for instance, could sell early, or the sales could be staggered so there isn\u2019t an \u201coverhang\u201d on the stock that would depress the price before a major lockup period expired.Mr. Palihapitiya also was able to choose most of the company\u2019s big investors, who have agreed to their own lockups, making them much more oriented toward the long term. For all this, he takes a tidy fee: 20 percent of the $600 million. But if his company acquires a business five to 20 times its size through a reverse merger, he said, the fee is the same as or smaller than a banker\u2019s fee \u2014 and it is all in stock, so unlike the banks, Mr. Palihapitiya\u2019s interests are aligned with the company\u2019s.But Mr. Palihapitiya\u2019s approach is just the tip of the iceberg. The most provocative plan floating around Silicon Valley is Mr. Ries\u2019s LTSE. \u201cIt\u2019s an intellectually thoughtful idea,\u201d Mr. Palihapitiya said.The idea, at its core, is to change the dynamic between the stock exchange and whom it serves, Mr. Ries explained, suggesting that traditional stock exchanges focus more on investors \u2014 and all associated trading revenue \u2014 than on the companies listed. That, he believes, leads to short-term thinking and trading.Mr. Ries, who wrote a book titled \u201cThe Lean Startup,\u201d is hoping to create an exchange that is focused on the needs of companies with a long-term vision and investors who are similarly aligned. He believes the problem facing private companies isn\u2019t just the I.P.O. process but also \u201cthe lived experience of being a public company.\u201dPerhaps the most unusual part of his exchange\u2019s approach \u2014 which is still working to get approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 is how much influence and voting power investors would have over companies.Currently, an investor who owns one share for a month, or even a day, has the same voting power as someone who has owned a share for years. Mr. Ries wants what he calls \u201ctourists\u201d \u2014 short-term shareholders \u2014 to have less voting power than long-term shareholders, whom he calls \u201ccitizens of the republic.\u201d Over time, shareholders of companies on the LTSE would gain more votes based on their length of ownership.Such a system might make dual-class structures, like at Snap (or The New York Times) less attractive to its founders. That would also help end another problem that has emerged: Dual-class companies pay the chief executive, on average, three times as much as companies with a single share class.Mr. Ries also takes aim at compensation plans. He wants companies that list on his exchange to have stock vesting programs of at least five years and recommends 10 years, even for executives who leave the company.Now, this may be very hard to put into practice, and it\u2019s tough to know whether it would work. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult,\u201d Mr. Palihapitiya said. \u201cOurs is not as intellectually ambitious.\u201d But all of these efforts are meaningful attempts to fix the system. Even if they don\u2019t work as advertised, hopefully the establishment will take notes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For One Hedge Fund, a Bet on the Affordable Care Act Sours", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWagering that the new federal health care law would be a boon, the billionaire investor Larry Robbins bet big on hospital stocks five years ago. Those investments helped propel his hedge fund, Glenview Capital Management, to the ranks of the top-performing funds in 2013.Since then, the bet has soured. Glenview suffered steep losses as the stocks of many for-profit hospital chains sank, hurt by weak earnings and, more recently, by uncertainty over the lasting impact of the law, the Affordable Care Act.While Mr. Robbins sharply scaled back his fund\u2019s exposure, he held on to Tenet Healthcare, the large hospital chain, which is now a sore spot in his portfolio. Glenview, the largest investor in Tenet, has seen about $150 million of its money disappear as the stock has plunged by nearly three-quarters from its high three years ago.Analysts and investors are holding their breath, waiting to see if Mr. Robbins will wage a battle for control of the board at Tenet. Back in 2013, he won a proxy war against the hospital chain Health Management Associates.Three-quarters of its hospitals now command a leading share of their markets, he said. And Tenet plans to sell eight hospitals, including two in Philadelphia, as well its facilities in Britain for nearly $1 billion. The moves will allow Tenet to pay down its debt and focus on its best-performing facilities, he argued.\u201cDespite the industry headwinds, you should have confidence in Tenet\u2019s future,\u201d Mr. Fetter told investors.It has been a stark turnabout for the industry.In early 2012, Mr. Robbins took the stage at an annual New York conference in which hedge fund managers try to outdazzle one another with their best picks. His advice: Buy hospital stocks.Glenview, which before 2011 had never owned a hospital stock, emerged as a significant investor, taking stakes in for-profit giants like HCA Healthcare, Health Management Associates and Tenet.The investment thesis was simple. The Affordable Care Act would benefit hospitals by providing coverage for tens of millions of previously uninsured Americans.For a time, Mr. Robbins was right. But the law, whose fate remains unclear as Republicans contemplate another push to unravel it, has provided only a temporary increase in demand for hospital services.Many for-profit hospital chains began reporting weaker results, driven largely by a steady decline in patients being admitted. Hospital stocks went into a tailspin, hurting Glenview and other investors.\u201cI\u2019ve failed to protect your capital,\u201d Mr. Robbins wrote in a letter to investors in the fall of 2015, promising to forfeit his pay for the year.Hospitals are also being battered as medical care is increasingly delivered outside a hospital\u2019s walls in outpatient settings like surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms and urgent-care clinics. Emergency room visits and admissions are declining in hospitals across the country.Looking at hospital discharges from 2013 to 2016, \u201cyou saw almost an 11 percent drop in hospital admissions,\u201d said Sheryl Skolnick, director of United States equity research at Mizuho Securities U.S.A. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty stunning considering that period includes the A.C.A reform.\u201dSome of the shift can be explained by changes in consumer preferences. Seeking speed, convenience and lower expenses, consumers are popping into urgent-care centers instead of hospital emergency rooms for modest ailments or treatments.But some of the drop is being driven by health insurers, which are taking a harder line on expensive hospital care. Anthem, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers, recently announced that some of its health plans would no longer cover an M.R.I. or CT scan from a hospital unless medically necessary.The for-profit hospital chains are adapting, with mixed results.On one end of the spectrum, HCA has added hospitals and moved into free-standing emergency rooms and other businesses outside the hospital. Other large nonprofit systems have purchased physician groups as a way to shift more of their business to outpatient settings.On the other end, Tenet and Community Health Systems are struggling. Both systems, which made major acquisitions of rival chains, were left with extremely high debt. Paying it down has diverted cash that could have been used to invest in buying clinics or doctors\u2019 groups.These are \u201ctwo very large, very highly levered companies that are not operating particularly well in a tough operating environment,\u201d said Jessica Gladstone, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which follows the debt of for-profit hospitals.Both companies are also shifting their focus to care delivered outside the hospital. Tenet says the percentage of its revenue from its hospitals has dropped to 61 percent, from 88 percent five years ago. The company says it now has nearly 500 outpatient facilities.Many of those facilities are under an entity called United Surgical Partners International, a joint venture with a private-equity firm. This summer, Tenet paid $716 million to increase its stake in the business.None of those moves appeared to satisfy Mr. Robbins. In mid-August, Glenview pulled its two executives from Tenet\u2019s board of directors, citing \u201cirreconcilable differences.\u201d A spokesman for Glenview declined to comment.A showdown between Glenview and Tenet may be in the offing.To fend off a possible takeover from Glenview or someone else, Tenet adopted a so-called poison pill in late August. Its chief executive, Mr. Fetter, also agreed to step down by March, and the company will replace some board members.\u201cNew perspectives will be critical at this point as Tenet approaches its 50th year,\u201d Mr. Fetter told investors at the conference.It is unclear whether Mr. Robbins has a better strategy. While he has not said what he wants, there is widespread speculation that he could be pushing for Tenet to spin off or sell businesses unrelated to hospitals, such as Conifer Health Solutions, which provides health care management services.There is also the possibility that Mr. Robbins follows the same playbook he used with Health Management Associates. There, he persuaded shareholders to approve an entire new slate of directors for H.M.A. that had been nominated by his fund. Ultimately, H.M.A. was sold to Community Health.\u201cGiven the circumstances,\u201d said Emily Evans, the managing director of health policy with the research firm Hedgeye Risk Management, Tenet is \u201cprobably doing what should be done in order to survive into the next era of health care, which is going to look very different than the last 50 years.\u201d\u201cThat takes time, and that takes patience,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t see clearly what Glenview wants and what is reasonable to expect here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018False Peace\u2019 for Markets? A Trader Is Betting Millions on It", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Last Wednesday was another good day to make money on Wall Street: Stocks pushed up, interest rates were at rock bottom and the VIX gauge of investor unease was again trending downward.But as investors celebrated yet another bounce-back from a market slip, Christopher Cole, a trader who runs a hedge fund here that makes bets on various forms of financial apocalypse, spotted something amid the sprawl of data and code that decorated the wall of screens before him.\u201cOptically, volatility is still very low, but fear is increasing,\u201d Mr. Cole said, pulling up a chart on one of his six trading windows. It showed that in the months beyond the 30-day period measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s VIX index, investors were expecting some violent moves to come in the stock market.Betting against a flare-up of such turmoil has been one of the longest-running and most profitable trades in recent financial history.In doing so, he draws parallels to the stock market crash of 1987, when investors were similarly lulled into believing that volatility would not erupt.So far, those betting against chaos have carried the day.After peaking at close to 90 at the time of the financial crisis, the VIX recently sank to a multidecade low of just below 9, the occasional sharp spike upward notwithstanding. (As of Wednesday afternoon, it was 10.5.)Now, just a month ahead of the 30th anniversary of Black Monday, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index plunged 20 percent, Mr. Cole is wagering on a similar calamity, underpinned by a vicious spike in the VIX and a steep sell-off in stocks.\u201cThe fact that everyone has been incentivized to be short volatility has set up this reflexive stability \u2014 a false peace,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we have some sort of shock to the system, all these self-reflexive elements reverse in the other direction and become destabilizing as opposed to stabilizing.\u201dArtemis Capital is of a slightly different stripe. It is, as Mr. Cole likes to say, a hedge fund with a capital H. That means, in times of bull market fever, the fund will bet on a reversal, offering downside protection for cautious investors by finding creative ways to purchase exposure to financial chaos. These trades entail purchasing a variety of derivative instruments that pay off if there is a dramatic upward spike in the VIX, which can cause stocks to fall precipitously.Of late, money managers seeking such a hedge have grown markedly. Mr. Cole, who started with $1 million in 2012, is now sitting on $200 million, and demand has been so strong recently that he expects to hit $300 million soon, at which point he will restrict further access.Mr. Cole, 38, has the bouncy enthusiasm of a young child, and he spends each waking day reading, coding and free associating about what it will be that marks the bull market\u2019s end.At the moment, Mr. Cole calculates that as much as $1.5 trillion in investor money is betting the markets will remain as they more or less have been since 2009: volatility free.This sum, he says, includes about $60 billion in funds that are explicitly short volatility in its many forms. The bulk of this amount is in funds that deploy strategies where volatility is a critical input for allocating exposure to the stock market. So the lower volatility is, the more these funds load up on stocks.Piling on to the low volatility trade have been corporations, which this year may buy back close to $1 trillion worth of stock, analysts estimate.In 1987, portfolio insurance transformed a market decline into a historic rout when computer driven programs sold stock market futures into a panicked marketplace absent of willing buyers. Mr. Cole says this $1.5 trillion in short volatility money can play a similar role today if the fear gauge index spikes sharply.All of a sudden VIX sellers will become VIX buyers, which will send the index soaring and stocks plummeting.As he sees it, the formulaic strategies that sold stock market futures into a falling market in 1987 and the short volatility money of today are akin to barrels of petroleum that can turn a mere fire into a seismic conflagration.\u201cIn 1987, we were in a bull market, and the Fed was behind the curve with regard to inflation and interest rates,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cWhat could cause a crisis now is if rates suddenly spike higher, share buybacks seize up and then the volatility sellers turn into volatility buyers all at once.\u201dIt is, in many ways, a moral argument for him.Volatility sellers reap cheap and fleeting gains, which he compares to speeding, obesity and marrying for money. Those willing to suffer the immediate pain of being long volatility \u2014 before the reward of calamity comes \u2014 Mr. Cole sees as being more virtuous.Ultimately, though, he believes that those who have held volatility in abeyance for so long \u2014 from risk parity funds to global central banks \u2014 will face a reckoning.\u201cVolatility is an instrument of truth, and the more you deny the truth, the more the truth will find you through volatility,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cIf central banks want to keep saving the day, that is fine. But volatility will then be transmuted through other forms like populism and identity politics and threaten the fabric of democracy. And that is something that my hedge fund will never be able to protect against.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Skirmish in an Old Battle: Wall Street vs. the Customer", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameA corrosive custom forced on investors is finally getting the ax under new regulations in Europe. Too bad some on Wall Street are working overtime to ensure that United States investors don\u2019t get the same deal.The rule change governs how investors pay for brokerage-firm research. This may seem like a mundane administrative matter, but given the conflicts embedded in the process, it is not.Currently, big institutional investors pay indirectly for research services provided by brokerage firms; they include analyses on industries and companies as well as access to top corporate executives in events sponsored by the Wall Street banks. Rather than pay cash for these services, the investors send trades to the firms, generating commissions.Exchanging commissions on these trades for research \u2014 known in the vernacular as soft-dollar arrangements \u2014 has been the way of the world for decades. But pension funds and other institutions have chafed under the deals because they can harm investors while benefiting Wall Street.After more than a decade of regulatory inquiry into these arrangements, European regulators didn\u2019t like what they saw. So they decided to separate the two functions, requiring payments in hard dollars for both research and trade executions.As the regulators and others have noted, there are several problems with the research-for-commissions setup. One is a lack of transparency \u2014 bundling research costs with trading makes it difficult for investors to see what they are paying. Another downside: Exchanging trading commissions for research binds an investor to a firm regardless of how well or poorly it executes an investor\u2019s trades.Tying trading to research also hurts smaller research outfits that may be producing outstanding analyses but that don\u2019t have the trade-execution capacity needed to receive soft-dollar payments. The inverse is also true: Brokerage firms that produce junk research \u2014 nonstop \u201cbuy\u201d recommendations, for example \u2014 are perversely rewarded by the soft-dollar payments they receive on trades.Under the European rule, Mr. Jackson said in an interview, \u201cconsumers can see how much of their commissions are going to research.\u201d The rule \u201calso makes it easier to monitor best execution,\u201d and it could encourage the creation of high-quality independent research shops, he said.But greater transparency is not something Wall Street generally wishes for, which might explain why some firms are opposing an unbundling of research and trading costs.Another reason Wall Street prefers the status quo on research and trading is the information edge it provides. Big investor orders represent crucial information for brokerage firms, which can generate rich profits by trading around the transactions. If investors start sending orders to firms based only on superior execution, the big broker-dealers could lose that information source.Under the European system, research and trading are likely to improve, investors say. That\u2019s because they\u2019ll be able to reward firms that produce meaningful investment analysis as well as those that generate excellence and efficiency in trade executions.Even as Europe moves to a new and fairer regime, some on Wall Street are quietly urging the Securities and Exchange Commission to maintain the bundling of research and trading in American markets. Among them is Goldman Sachs, which has told some of its big investor clients that it opposes separating research from trading. A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment.The main argument offered against separating research and trading is that broker-dealers that publish analysts\u2019 reports would have to register as investment advisers, subjecting them to an additional regulatory burden.But many major firms are already registered as investment advisers. So all they would have to do to resolve the issue is move their research operations into their investment advisory units.Not all brokerage firms are against the unbundling of research and trading. A spokeswoman for Bank of America Merrill Lynch confirmed what some of its clients have told me \u2014 that the firm is willing to receive cash payments for research.Still, Wall Street\u2019s arguments against unbundling seem to be gaining traction at the S.E.C. And some investors are worried that they are being made privately at the agency, not as part of a public comment process.\u201cPart of our concern is something seems to be going on behind closed doors,\u201d Ken Bertsch, the council\u2019s executive director, said in an interview. \u201cMy sense of what\u2019s going on is brokers want to limit this to clients for whom the European rules apply. But the council would like to see it benefit U.S. investors as well.\u201dHow the S.E.C. rules on this question will tell a lot about where Mr. Clayton and his new team stand \u2014 with Wall Street or its customers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Manufacturing Is a Bright Spot in a Subdued Jobs Report", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMACUNGIE, Pa. \u2014 At the sprawling Mack Trucks factory here, the last of the workers laid off in 2016 after sales slowed down are back on the line, and for the first time in years, the company is hiring new employees.The turnabout in the Lehigh Valley, whose shuttered factories inspired Billy Joel\u2019s elegiac 1980s song \u201cAllentown,\u201d was evident more broadly on Friday, when the Labor Department reported that manufacturers nationwide added workers last month at the fastest pace in more than four years.Hiring in other sectors was more muted, with the economy creating 156,000 jobs, fewer than expected and well off the much bigger employment gains earlier this summer. The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.4 percent, while wages barely grew.Still, the latest payroll data underscores the striking rebound at American factories, which lost more than two million jobs in the recession, but have clawed their way back and recovered more than one million positions since 2010.Dennis Slagle, Mack\u2019s president, said his company\u2019s hiring reflected increased demand for its big trucks. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen confidence rise,\u201d he said, noting that truckers benefit whether shoppers do their buying online or at brick-and-mortar stores. \u201cIf you bought it, we brought it.\u201dAfter dropping to 1,287 at the end of 2016 from 1,875 a year earlier, employment at Mack\u2019s Macungie plant has rebounded to 1,800. To attract new workers, the company has set up tables at local job fairs, including one in May at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown, home of the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs baseball team.The company has had a presence in the Lehigh Valley since 1905, when the Mack brothers moved truck production to Allentown from Brooklyn, where the company was founded in 1900.It has endured even as giants like Bethlehem Steel, which once employed thousands of workers who turned hot metal into finished steel, vanished. And unlike many of its competitors, it builds both the truck cabs and components like engines and transmissions in the United States.Mack is foreign-owned \u2014 by the Volvo Group of Sweden \u2014 but the parent company recently completed an $84 million project to modernize and expand the Macungie factory. Mack plans to roll out its first new truck line in about two decades on Sept. 13.\u201cLabor relations are good enough that they were willing to spend that much money,\u201d said Edward Balukas, president of Local 677 of the United Automobile Workers union, which represents production line employees at Mack. Salaries start at $18.75, according to Mr. Balukas, rising to $27 after six years, and the jobs come with a full benefit package and retirement plan.One explanation for stagnant wage growth \u2014 even with low unemployment and steady hiring \u2014 is automation, as workers like retail store clerks, tollbooth operators and bank tellers are forced to move on and take whatever jobs they can find.Robots really are not much of a presence at Mack, however, where workers in T-shirts and shorts clamber atop newly finished chassis to attach hulking cabs that move on an overhead belt.Big rigs represent a major investment for buyers \u2014 prices start at about $115,000 and can run as high as $250,000 for a dump truck. And their customized nature makes it hard to automate production, said Jonathan Randall, senior vice president for North American sales at Mack.\u201cWe build fleets one at a time,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt takes skilled human beings to do that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a bed of roses when you go down to Mexico,\u201d said Mr. Slagle, Mack\u2019s president. \u201cWe feel this is the place to be.\u201dThe jump in manufacturing last month, along with construction, stands in sharp contrast to some service sectors, where job growth was much less impressive.Retailers shed 900 jobs, confirming the assault on traditional stores by online retailers. Leisure and hospitality, which has been especially robust in recent months, added just 4,000 positions, while the public sector lost 9,000.President Trump campaigned on reviving the kinds of jobs done in factories, coal mines and oil fields. Since he took office, hiring has indeed ticked upward in these sectors, but is there any connection?Those losses help explain why August\u2019s overall payroll increase fell well short of the 180,000 gain that economists on Wall Street had been expecting. But few took it as a sign of more fundamental weakness, especially because the initial August figure has come in below expectations in five of the last six years, only to be revised higher in some cases.\u201cIn months where there are anomalies like this, we look at the three-month average, which is 185,000,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cThe labor market is healthy, but we still have the conundrum that solid employment gains haven\u2019t translated into faster wage growth.\u201dOne wild card in the second half of 2017 will be gasoline prices. The surge following Hurricane Harvey\u2019s devastation in Texas will leave less money for consumers to spend on other goods and services.On Friday morning, the average price for regular gasoline nationwide was $2.52, a 7-cent increase from Thursday. Prices have risen 15 cents a gallon in the last week, and the current price is 30 cents above the national average for regular gasoline a year ago. Over the course of a year, every penny increase is equivalent to a $1 billion tax on consumers.But Wall Street was happy with the report \u2014 benchmark indexes closed up 0.2 percent Friday \u2014 as the slowdown in hiring and minimal wage growth mean the Federal Reserve is likely to stick to its promise to raise interest rates only gradually.\u201cFor the economy, it\u2019s steady as she goes, but for the markets, it\u2019s Goldilocks,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, referring to the not-too-hot, not-too-cold August payroll increase.Traders now assume a 30 percent chance of a rate increase when Fed policy makers meet in December, down from a 50 percent chance a few weeks ago. The Fed is set to meet later this month, but is not expected to raise rates.Like many economists, Mr. Slok does expect the Fed to move at the end of the year, even if market participants are betting otherwise. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign of inflation, which keeps the Federal Reserve on hold in terms of interest rate hikes, and it suggests stocks should keep doing well,\u201d Mr. Slok said.Clifford Krauss and Bill Vlasic contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mass Psychology Supports the Pricey Stock Market", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThat was the observation of John Maynard Keynes, who suggested that investors do not actually make money by picking the best companies, but by picking stocks that waves of other traders will want to buy.Investing, in other words, is an exercise in mass psychology.I\u2019ve spent decades studying it, and believe that one way to predict future market moves is to sort through the narratives that sweep through the population and influence decisions on whether to buy or sell. Such an analysis is a matter of art as much as science, however. Getting it right is crucial in the United States right now, because stock market valuations are already high enough to be worrisome.But are investors primed psychologically for a major decline in the stock market, or are they likely to keep bidding up stocks for some time to come? Those are critical questions.The C.A.P.E. ratio is above 30 today, compared with an average of 16.8 since 1881. It has been above 30 in only two other periods: in 1929, when it reached 33, and between 1997 and 2002, when it soared as high as 44.The current number is troubling. After the ratio\u2019s peak in 1929, real inflation-corrected stock prices in the United States lost four-fifths of their value by 1932, the biggest crash in the market\u2019s history. And from 2000 to 2003, they lost half of their real value.So current valuations make the market vulnerable. But it took more than high valuation numbers to precipitate those ugly declines in the past. The other ingredient was mass psychology. For information about what investors thought other investors were thinking, we can go to the newspaper archives.The notion that investors were laboring under \u201cfantastic illusions\u201d and had bid up prices to unsupportable levels appeared in many places. On the same day, The Atlanta Constitution ran a all-caps banner headline in its financial pages: \u201cSTOCK MARKET ACTIVITY AND PRICE FLUCTUATIONS SMASHED ALL RECORDS DURING YEAR JUST CLOSED.\u201dIn early 2000, for example, there was a surge in stories of foolish investors buying anything with \u201c.com\u201d in the company name. Dot-com investments morphed into embarrassing \u201cdot-bombs,\u201d articles said, affecting the self-confidence of stock market investors and plausibly bleeding over to the whole market.So where are we today?That said, speculation based on excessive lending is a worry, the newspaper database indicates, but less so than in the previous periods. References to tulipomania have been appearing from time to time, but widespread fear that we might already be immersed in a speculative orgy is simply not evident. And while there have been articles this year about the boom in so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), the database indicates that this issue is minimal compared with the attention given in the late 1990s to the dangers of dot.com stocks.Why people are so calm about the high-priced market is a bit of a mystery. On this, I can only speculate. Perhaps investors have been distracted by the endless flow of news about Donald J. Trump, North Korea, the back-to-back hurricanes and so much else.

{"Headline": "For Isolated Philippine Town, a Planned Road Is a Lifeline and a Worry", "Date": "2017-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPalanan JournalPALANAN, Philippines \u2014 There is no road to Palanan.The town, 190 miles northeast of Manila on a stretch of rugged Pacific coastline, is separated from the crowds and chaos of the rest of the Philippines by a three-day trek through tropical jungle, a seven-hour ride on a wooden pump boat or a 25-minute flight on a three-seater Cessna.Cloistered in the foothills of the Sierra Madre, Palanan\u2019s farmers cross fields on the backs of loping water buffaloes. Children in plaid uniforms walk to school along beaches of white sand. A few motorcycles with sidecars, brought in on boats, rumble through the carless streets of the dusty town center. Carved canoes slide down broad rivers, and narrow outrigger boats bob along the shore.But all that may change. The government is building a road that will cut a path of more than 50 miles through the Sierra Madre, from Ilagan City, the capital of Isabela Province, to Divilacan, a neighboring town, with plans to continue it into Palanan and a scattering of nearby villages.The road comes with many hopes. If stocks of rice run low during the rainy season, they can be replenished, and dry goods like sugar and packaged crackers will become cheaper. It will be easier to take sick people to the hospital in Ilagan.And with new access to markets on the other side of the mountains, locals envision planting yams, cassava, watermelons or bananas, which they could transport by truck.\u201cOur lives could become less burdensome,\u201d said Bulol Donato, a member of the Agta, an indigenous group in the Sierra Madre.But others fear that even as the road brings economic benefits \u2014 including tourism \u2014 it will put pressure on traditional ways of life and bring in outside ills. Palanan\u2019s population of about 17,000 consists of the Agta, an ethnic group descended from the Philippines\u2019 earliest inhabitants, who came to the archipelago 30,000 to 60,000 years ago; the Paranan, a group that arrived 4,000 years ago; and more recent arrivals.Many Agta continue to live in huts made of branches and dried leaves as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, diving for octopus and lobster, spearing reef fish, trapping wild boar and hunting deer. For thousands of years, they have maintained friendly trade relationships with the Paranan and other migrants, trading fish and meat for rice and, more recently, for instant coffee, beer, crystal earrings, T-shirts and cotton dresses.Arnold Alvarez, 53, an evangelical pastor in Palanan, worries that excitement over the road is obscuring the harsh reality that with the good will come the bad, particularly for the Agta. Their way of life \u201cwon\u2019t survive the road,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard now, and it will be harder once the road comes.\u201dAbout 1,800 Agta live in the Sierra Madre, and since at least the start of the 20th century, their population has grown slowly. That leaves some anthropologists concerned that Agta culture is facing possible extinction \u2014 particularly as hunter-gatherer societies, which depend on forest and ocean products, are vulnerable to changes in their environment.The Sierra Madre is susceptible to illegal logging and wildlife poaching, both of which are expected to worsen as the road makes the virgin forests and shores more accessible. And the arrival of migrants from surrounding provinces, drawn by open spaces and new economic opportunities, might leave the Agta vying for limited natural resources as the forest is cleared for farmland.As an indigenous group, the Agta can apply to claim vast tracts of the Sierra Madre as their ancestral land, which they first did in 1997. Previous applications have failed, however, and the group\u2019s most recent effort to secure land rights has been tied up in government bureaucracy for over a decade. Without legal rights to the land, the Agta risk having it claimed by others.In Palanan, which the town\u2019s mayor said was visited by nearly 300 Filipino tourists and a dozen foreign tourists last year, emerald jungles are laced with clear streams that empty into the dense slate blue of the Pacific. Wide beaches are crisscrossed by hermit crabs in extravagant shells, and vibrant coral reefs are visible through pristine waters.The beauty of the coast has not escaped the notice of developers, hoping to attract more tourists. Last year in Dimasalansan, an area of white sand and rugged rocky outcroppings, the Agta who lived there were told that a resort would be built in anticipation of the road, and the government asked them to leave. Some were given cement houses in the town, though many continue to live on huts by the beach, closer to their foraging.Dedi Malacasta, 60, an Agta pastor who has lived in Dimasalansan, said that when the mayor asked locals to leave, they did so without a fight. Nevertheless, he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want our own land grabbed away from us.\u201dRen\u00e9e Hagen, a Dutch anthropologist with the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies Agta in the Sierra Madre, said the group had long acquiesced to the decisions of government officials.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for them to oppose anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey feel that they don\u2019t have say in local issues, and in practice they don\u2019t really.\u201dMr. Malacasta wants to fight for land rights in court, although he lacks the money to do so. He dreams that one day Agta children will go on to college, maybe even become lawyers, so they can stand up for Agta rights. \u201cWe can\u2019t always be afraid,\u201d he said.On a quiet stretch of beach in Dipaguiden, Norma Plata, who is about 55, sat recently with her husband and children. The beach where she sat, where she was born and where she gave birth to her children, was sold last year to a doctor from Cauayan City, just over the mountains, who wants to build a resort there.When that happens, she and her tribe will walk over to another patch of unclaimed sand and set up their huts there.\u201cWe can\u2019t go far from the sea,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will die of hunger.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Simple Investing for Nonprofits", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe boards of small nonprofit organizations must make major investment decisions, but they are often flying in the dark.There is a simple answer, which works for many small institutions as well as for individuals saving for retirement. It is to put money into low-cost stock and bond funds, allocate the money appropriately and rebalance periodically. But the boards of nonprofits don\u2019t always find this straightforward approach appealing for a variety of reasons, many of them psychological.For one thing, not every nonprofit has board members who want to take responsibility for decisions that could affect their institution\u2019s financial health. Even members with financial expertise may feel ill equipped to make an investment decision in a stressful market.Hiring outside money managers to handle these burdens comes at a price and with no guarantee of success. Assembling a team of superb money managers, as Yale, Princeton and other universities have tried to do, may not be realistic for nonprofits that don\u2019t have an enormous endowment.That\u2019s why Larry Kochard, who oversees the University of Virginia\u2019s $8.6 billion endowment and sits on the board of the $18 million Virginia Environmental Endowment, says the simple solution, equity and bond index funds, makes sense for smaller institutions.Finding good outside advisers is possible for institutions without deep pockets, he said, but it is very difficult. \u201cThe odds of a small endowment finding the right managers are very slim,\u201d Mr. Kochard said.For the most part, he advocated modest goals, saying: \u201cIf we are watching our allocations and spending and rebalancing, we are meeting our obligations.\u201dMs. Shuman also favors index funds for nonprofits, but warns that the success of index funds over the past several years has largely been driven by companies like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.\u201cThey drove a disproportionate return,\u201d she said, and if these stocks decline, the indexes will fall, too. She recommends Vanguard\u2019s managed equity and international funds for low-cost but actively managed alternatives.When considering whether to hold hedge funds, which often do not allow immediate liquidation of investments, many nonprofits may need to examine whether they can afford to forgo access to their money for long periods.That\u2019s not always an issue, however. Before Patti Birch died in 2007, for example, she directed that her Patti and Everett B. Birch Foundation spend down all of its funds in the years ahead. The foundation\u2019s president, Vartan Gregorian, said it still gave money to \u201cthe arts, women\u2019s rights, religious and ethnic tolerance, freedom of speech and strengthening American democracy,\u201d all causes that were important to Ms. Birch. Mr. Gregorian is also president of the Carnegie Corporation.The foundation\u2019s remaining funds are all being held in low-risk short-term bonds, said Mark Imowitz, whose firm, Imowitz Koenig and Company, handles the finances.\u201cPatti was not worried about having great appreciation in her investment assets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was natural to keep them in low-return funds since the money was being spent down.\u201dMany nonprofits have to think much longer term, however, and don\u2019t have the luxury of holding all of their assets in a single low-risk asset class.Roughly 80 percent of it is allocated to Commonfund\u2019s multistrategy equity fund, which includes a smattering of hedge funds, and it underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index by 2.5 percentage points in the three years through April, Mr. Kempner said. The fund has improved lately, he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t be complacent,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a manager underperforms their benchmarks, you should not just immediately trade managers. You have to understand what is wrong and how can they plan to fix it \u201cFees vary widely and are not always transparent. Commonfund, which manages about $24 billion in nonprofit money for about 1,400 clients, charges an average fee of 0.3 percent directly, according to Keith Luke, Commonfund\u2019s president. But because the managers selected by Commonfund for nonprofit portfolios also charge fees and because there are additional expenses, the overall fee paid by nonprofits is about 1 percent on average, he said.Commonfund \u201cis like an institutional mutual fund,\u201d Mr. Luke said. \u201cWe create a commingled investment vehicle of managers who pick stocks across all strategies.\u201d\u201cThere is scaled pricing,\u201d he said, \u201cand the larger the portfolio, the smaller the fee.\u201d For sizable portfolios \u2014 about $20 million \u2014 the overall fee would be less than 0.14 percent with Vanguard, he said.Geraldine Fabrikant is a member of the board of directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is There a Cryptocurrency Bubble? Just Ask Doge.", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftVery bubble. Much scam. So avoid.Mr. Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin, was an early fan of cryptocurrency, a form of encrypted digital money that is traded from person to person. He saw investors talking about Bitcoin, the oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, and wanted to find a way to poke fun at the hype surrounding the emerging technology.So in 2013, he built his own cryptocurrency, a satirical mash-up that combined Bitcoin with the Doge meme he\u2019d seen on social media. Mr. Palmer hoped to use Dogecoin to show the absurdity of wagering huge sums of money on unstable ventures.Today, Mr. Palmer, 30, is one of the loudest voices warning that a similar fate might soon befall the entire cryptocurrency industry.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to crypto now is what happened to Dogecoin,\u201d Mr. Palmer told me in a recent interview. \u201cI\u2019m worried that this time, it\u2019s on a much grander scale.\u201dBut there remains no bigger mania among tech investors than cryptocurrency, which some see as an eventual replacement for traditional, government-issued money. Even with the recent declines, the price of Bitcoin has more than tripled this year; another cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has gained more than 2,300 percent. The success of these currencies has minted a new class of \u201ccrypto-millionaires\u201d and spawned hundreds of other digital currencies, called altcoins. In addition, it has given rise to an entire category of start-ups that take advantage of cryptocurrency\u2019s public ledger system, known as the blockchain.(If you\u2019re having trouble picturing it: Imagine that a friend is building a casino and asks you to invest. In exchange, you get chips that can be used at the casino\u2019s tables once it\u2019s finished. Now imagine that the value of the chips isn\u2019t fixed, and will instead fluctuate depending on the popularity of the casino, the number of other gamblers and the regulatory environment for casinos. Oh, and instead of a friend, imagine it\u2019s a stranger on the internet who might be using a fake name, who might not actually know how to build a casino, and whom you probably can\u2019t sue for fraud if he steals your money and uses it to buy a Porsche instead. That\u2019s an I.C.O.)Despite the obvious risks of these ventures, investor appetite has been ravenous. A group of Bay Area programmers this year used an I.C.O. to raise $35 million for their project, an anonymous web browser called Brave, in less than 30 seconds. There have been 140 coin offerings in 2017 that have raised a total of $2.1 billion from investors, according to Coinschedule, a website that tracks the activity.Mr. Palmer predicts that while some I.C.O.s may finance the creation of new and exciting enterprises, many will go up in smoke. He sees echoes of the first dot-com boom, when investors poured money into new and risky ventures only to get burned when the market came to its senses.\u201cPeople are treating cryptocurrency now like penny stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s become a securities market.\u201dWhen Mr. Palmer\u2019s interest in digital money began, just four years ago, cryptocurrency was the sole province of math geeks and early adopters.\u201cIt was fun, nobody took it seriously,\u201d he recalled. \u201cPeople threw it around like change because it wasn\u2019t worth anything.\u201dAs the price of Bitcoin climbed, investors got interested in other cryptocurrencies. With no explanation, the price of Dogecoin doubled, then tripled. Two months after it was introduced, Mr. Palmer\u2019s joke was worth $50 million, and some early Dogecoin adopters, who called themselves \u201cshibes,\u201d were sitting on lucrative stockpiles.The success of Dogecoin attracted unsavory characters. One scammer raised $750,000 from Dogecoin supporters for a cryptocurrency start-up that never materialized. A hacker broke into Dogewallet, a website where users stored their coins, and stole thousands of dollars worth of the currency. Soon, the Dogecoin Reddit forum was full of angry scam victims and get-rich-quick schemers, and the once tight-knit Dogecoin community started to disintegrate.\u201cWe tried to do everything right,\u201d said Ben Doernberg, a former board member of the Dogecoin Foundation. \u201cBut when you have a situation where people stand to put in a dollar and take out a thousand dollars, people lose their minds.\u201dMr. Palmer, a laid-back Australian who works as a product manager in the Bay Area and describes himself as \u201csocialist leaning,\u201d was disturbed by the commercialization of his joke currency. He had never collected Dogecoin for himself, and had resisted efforts to cash in on the currency\u2019s success, even turning down a $500,000 investment offer from an Australian venture capital firm.\u201cMy mission in all of this is to help people better understand things, rather than just thinking about profit,\u201d he said.Mr. Palmer worries that the coming reckoning in the cryptocurrency market \u2014 and it is coming, he says confidently \u2014 will deter people from using the technology for more legitimate projects.\u201cThe bigger this bubble goes, the bigger negative connotation it\u2019s going to have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like the dot-com bust, but on a much more epic scale.\u201dFollow Kevin Roose on Twitter @kevinroose.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sarbanes-Oxley, Bemoaned as a Burden, Is an Investor\u2019s Ally", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameSeismic accounting scandals like the ones that sank Enron and WorldCom in the early 2000s have, happily, been scarce in recent years. But they may well resurface if elements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the law created to curtail accounting fraud, are rolled back as some corporate executives are urging.He urged lawmakers to review the requirement because markets had evolved since it became law.Mr. Farley\u2019s comments notwithstanding, it seems smart to have an outside auditor check on management\u2019s oversight of financial reporting. If a company does not have solid controls in place, how can investors trust its financial reports?But investors do not seem to be a concern for Mr. Farley, who was speaking about the law (known as SOX) as an advocate for the big companies that list their shares on the New York Stock Exchange. \u201cDesigning, implementing and maintaining complex systems required to satisfy SOX\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting requirements can command millions of dollars in outside consultant, legal and auditing fees, in addition to other internal costs,\u201d he said.Through a spokesman, Mr. Farley declined my request to expand on his views in an interview.Since 1977, companies have been required by law to have effective internal controls over their financial reporting. But many failed to comply, as the subsequent accounting frauds and numerous financial restatements showed. That is why Congress decided in 2002, as part of Sarbanes-Oxley, to make auditors attest to corporate controls on financial reporting.\u201cCorporate frauds like Enron, WorldCom and Tyco cost investors hundreds of billions of dollars and the NYSE and Nasdaq trillions of dollars in lost market capitalization,\u201d Mr. Turner said. \u201cAnd they were a worldwide embarrassment to the United States.\u201dCritics of the provision on financial reporting contend that it has not prevented accounting fraud, but a new academic study shows otherwise.The academics collected auditors\u2019 opinions on internal controls at companies with more than $75 million in publicly held stock \u2014 about 3,500 companies per year \u2014 from 2004 through 2007. They searched for those with material weaknesses. Then they compared their findings with reports of financial fraud in S.E.C. and Justice Department enforcement actions from 2005 through 2010 as well as settled securities class-action lawsuits during the period.The exercise identified roughly 1,500 reports of material weakness at companies. And within three years, 127 of those companies faced legal actions that revealed fraud, the study said.That\u2019s not a big number. But here\u2019s where the study gets compelling. Auditors had identified material weaknesses in financial reporting at about 30 percent of the companies that later disclosed accounting problems. Chief executives were named in 111 of the 127 fraud cases, and chief financial officers were identified in 108 of the cases.\u201cOver all, we believe this link should be of interest to regulators and the general public,\u201d Mr. Ege said in an interview. \u201cWe need to ensure that entity-level weaknesses are being reported and not withheld.\u201dArguments like those raised by Mr. Farley of the NYSE Group and other corporate chiefs about accounting rules are nothing new, Mr. Turner said. During his years as the S.E.C.\u2019s chief accountant, from 1998 to 2001, officials from the New York Stock Exchange would regularly request exemptions from reporting rules, he said. \u201cI never once agreed to what they were asking for,\u201d Mr. Turner recalled.Clearly, investors will be hurt the most if this provision of Sarbanes-Oxley is watered down. Which raises a question, according to Mr. Turner: Why should a public company be able to raise money from investors if it can\u2019t generate accurate reports for them?Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Big Banks Became Our Masters", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTen years on from the financial crisis, it\u2019s hard not to have a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Financial scandal and wrangles over financial rule-making still dominate the headlines. The cyberhacking at Equifax compromised personal records for half of the adult population of the United States. At SoFi, a one-time fintech darling that offers student loans and other types of credit, the chief executive was forced to resign after revelations of sexual harassment and risky lending practices (the company misled investors about its finances and put inexperienced customer service representatives in charge of credit evaluations). The White House and Republicans in Congress in the meantime are trying to roll back hard-won banking regulations in the Dodd-Frank financial oversight law.All of it brings to mind an acronym familiar to financial writers like myself \u2014 BOB, or \u201cbored of banking.\u201d Even some of us that cover the markets for a living can find ourselves BOB. Over the last 10 years, there has been so much financial scandal, so many battles between regulators and financiers, and so much complexity (more liquidity and less leverage with your tier one capital, anyone?) that a large swath of the public has become numb to the debate about how to make our financial system safer.That\u2019s a dangerous problem, because despite all of the wrangling and rule making, there\u2019s a core truth about our financial system that we have yet to comprehend fully: It isn\u2019t serving us, we\u2019re serving it.Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, envisioned financial services (and I stress the word \u201cservice\u201d) as an industry that didn\u2019t exist as an end in itself, but rather as a helpmeet to other types of business. Yet lending to Main Street is now a minority of what the largest banks in the country do. In the 1970s, most of their financial flows, which of course come directly from our savings, would have been funneled into new business investment. Today, only about 15 percent of the money coming out of the largest financial institutions goes to that purpose. The rest exists in a closed loop of trading; institutions facilitate and engage in the buying and selling of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets that mainly enriches the 20 percent of the population that owns 80 percent of that asset base. This doesn\u2019t help growth, but it does fuel the wealth gap.This fundamental shift in the business model of finance is what we should really be talking about \u2014 rather than the technocratic details of liquidity ratios or capital levels or even how to punish specific banking misdeeds. The big problem is that our banking system would no longer be recognizable to Adam Smith, who believed that for markets to work, all players must have equal access to information, transparent prices and a shared moral framework. Good luck with that today.While the largest banks can correctly claim that they have offloaded risky assets and bolstered the amount of cash on their balance sheets over the last decade, their business model has become fundamentally disconnected from the very people and entities it was designed to serve. Small community banks, which make up only 13 percent of all banking assets, do nearly half of all lending to small businesses. Big banks are about deal making. They serve mostly themselves, existing as the middle of the hourglass that is our economy, charging whatever rent they like for others to pass through. (Finance is one of the few industries in which fees have gone up as the sector as a whole has grown.) The financial industry, dominated by the biggest banks, provides only 4 percent of all jobs in the country, yet takes about a quarter of the corporate profit pie.Perhaps that\u2019s why companies of all stripes try to copy its model. Nonfinancial firms as a whole now get five times the revenue from purely financial activities as they did in the 1980s. Stock buybacks artificially drive up the price of corporate shares, enriching the C-suite. Airlines can make more hedging oil prices than selling coach seats. Drug companies spend as much time tax optimizing as they do worrying about which new compound to research. The largest Silicon Valley firms now use a good chunk of their spare cash to underwrite bond offerings the same way Goldman Sachs might.The blending of technology and finance has reached an apex with the creation of firms like SoFi, which put the same old models on big data steroids. It\u2019s an area we\u2019ll likely hear much more about. A couple of weeks ago, at the Senate Banking Committee hearings on fintech, lawmakers once again struggled with how to think about these latest lending crises. But it\u2019s not data or privacy or algorithms that are the fundamental issue with our financial system. It\u2019s the fact that the system itself has lost its core purpose.Finance has become the tail that wags the dog. Until we start talking about how to create a financial system that really serves society, rather than just trying to stay ahead of the misdeeds of one that doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll struggle in vain to bridge the gap between Wall Street and Main Street.An Op-Ed essay on Wednesday about big banks included an outdated description of the online lending start-up Social Finance, or SoFi. It no longer uses crowdsourcing to fund loans.Rana Foroohar, an associate editor and global business columnist at The Financial Times, is the author of \u201cMakers and Takers: How Wall Street Destroyed Main Street.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will a Corporate Tax Holiday Give Workers Anything to Cheer?", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThey had lobbied hard for this \u2014 dangling before members of Congress the promise that the repatriated money would add more than 500,000 jobs in the United States over the next two years, as companies paid down debt and engaged in more capital spending, acquisitions, and research and development.The smell of a tax holiday is back in the air. From Apple to Facebook to Starbucks, big business is waiting with bated breath for details on President Trump\u2019s promise to slash the tax rate on profits held abroad to encourage companies to bring the money home.Of course, the standard claims are being made about the vast stimulative effects of the repatriated cash. They are being met this time with vigorous counterclaims based on the results of the Bush administration\u2019s shot over a decade ago.Pfizer, for instance, brought back $35.5 billion, the largest amount repatriated by a single company during the tax holiday, according to the Senate report. Then it turned around and spent over $20 billion in stock repurchases from 2005 to 2007. By 2007, the aggregate compensation of its top five executives was nearly $13 million higher than in 2004. Its United States payroll was 12,000 smaller.The pattern was similar across most repatriating companies. Hewlett-Packard, which brought home $14.5 billion, bought back $22 billion worth of stock over the three years and cut its payroll by more than 8,500. The tobacco company Altria, which brought over $6 billion home during the holiday, spent $2.5 billion on share buybacks and bumped pay in the executive ranks by more than $50 million, but cut 6,000 jobs.With a new move afoot to put such holdings back on American books, there is a critical question that is too quickly glossed over: Why do businesses act this way? Why didn\u2019t corporate executives invest more in their businesses and their work forces? Why did they go to the trouble of dribbling around a rule forbidding the use of repatriated profits to pay themselves a bonus? (Note to Congress: Money is fungible.)Call me na\u00efve. Professor Forbes and her colleagues \u2014 indeed, many economists \u2014 might swat the question away by arguing that businesses didn\u2019t use the extra cash to invest and employ because they were well-run businesses, well invested and sufficiently staffed to maximize their profitability.Still, the question should resonate in an administration that came to power on a promise to address the plight of the working class. Because the working class stands on the other end of a deal with the corporate class. I don\u2019t think it is possible to fully address workers\u2019 demands without understanding, and changing, corporate motivations.Many forces have shaped this deal, including technology, which replaced workers performing routine tasks, and globalization, which squeezed the margins of many businesses and exposed their workers to competition from cheap labor markets. And yet it would be a mistake to ignore the impact of a corporate ethos that has come to focus on rewarding shareholders and executives at the expense of any other consideration \u2014 be it workers\u2019 welfare or even the company\u2019s long-term sustainability. Indeed, workers today amount to little more than a line on the cost side of businesses\u2019 balance sheets, with little claim to its prosperity.\u201cHow you divide the pie is a choice,\u201d said Rick Wartzman, who heads the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute of Claremont Graduate University. \u201cIt is being carved differently.\u201dThe good news is that it is not impossible to modify the behavior of the corporate leaders who have so drastically altered the contract with their work force over the last few decades. While it may be tempting to cast the new breed of executives as selfish villains who somehow lost their sense of right and wrong, the shift in their behavior responded to a shift in the incentives they faced. It was fed by a belief that snaked its way three or four decades ago from the halls of the University of Chicago through investment-bank trading floors and into the corner offices of corporate America: that the interests of corporate managers must be brought into tight alignment with those of shareholders. It was accompanied by one of the most destabilizing propositions in the modern history of corporate governance: This alignment was best achieved by paying corporate managers almost exclusively with stock.Professor Desai points out that in the end, this structure does not really serve shareholders, at least not those with an interest in a company\u2019s prosperity more than a few quarters down the road. \u201cCapitalism seems to be serving managers and investment managers at the expense of shareholders,\u201d he wrote.Changing this behavior is not beyond the reach of policy. Just as changes in the tax treatment of executive pay in the 1990s encouraged stock-based remuneration, tax reforms might motivate corporate executives to invest for the long term rather than for an immediate stock bump \u2014 maybe even encourage stable employment and worker training. Until then, offering tax breaks to American corporations seems more likely to line the pockets of executives and shareholders than to improve their long-term prospects or the prosperity of their workers.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korea Nuclear Test Puts Pressure on China and Undercuts Xi", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 It was supposed to be Xi Jinping\u2019s moment to bask in global prestige, as the Chinese president hosted the leaders of some of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies at a summit meeting just weeks before a Communist Party leadership conference.Mr. Kim has timed his nuclear tests and missile launches with exquisite precision, apparently trying to create maximum embarrassment for China. And on Sunday, a gathering in southeast China of leaders from Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa, members of the so-called BRICS group, was immediately overshadowed by news of the test, which shook dwellings in China and revived fears of nuclear contamination in the country\u2019s northeast region.The confluence of North Korea\u2019s nuclear testing and Mr. Xi\u2019s important public appearances is not a coincidence, analysts said. It is intended to show that Mr. Kim, the leader of a small, rogue neighboring state, can diminish Mr. Xi\u2019s power and prestige as president of China, they said. In fact, some analysts contended that the latest test may have been primarily aimed at pressuring Mr. Xi, not President Trump.\u201cKim knows that Xi has the real power to affect the calculus in Washington,\u201d said Peter Hayes, the director of the Nautilus Institute, a research group that specializes in North Korea. \u201cHe\u2019s putting pressure on China to say to Trump: \u2018You have to sit down with Kim Jong-un.\u2019\u201dWhat Mr. Kim wants most, Mr. Hayes said, is talks with Washington that the North Korean leader hopes will result in a deal to reduce American troops in South Korea and leave him with nuclear weapons. And in Mr. Kim\u2019s calculation, China has the influence to make that negotiation happen.Even the North\u2019s claim that the weapon detonated was a hydrogen bomb that could be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile would probably not sway Mr. Xi, they said.\u201cThis sixth nuclear test should force China to do something radical; this will be a political test,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, a nuclear expert at Renmin University. \u201cBut the mood is not moving that way.\u201dChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry did express \u201cstrong condemnation\u201d of the test. But despite the North\u2019s repeated incitements, the Chinese leadership is likely to stick to its position that a nuclear-armed North Korea is less dangerous to China than the possibility of a political collapse in the North, Mr. Cheng said. That could result in a unified Korean Peninsula under the control of the United States and its ally, South Korea.China fears such an outcome if it uses its greatest economic leverage: cutting off the crude oil supplies that keep the North\u2019s rudimentary economy running.\u201cCutting off oil supplies could severely impact North Korean industries and undermine the regime\u2019s stability, a solution which China and Russia have serious qualms about,\u201d said Zhao Tong, a fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing.China has put forward a proposal that hinges on North Korea stopping its nuclear testing in exchange for an end to American military exercises around the Korean Peninsula.But Mr. Xi is consumed at the moment with domestic matters, Chinese analysts said. The political machinations surrounding the Communist Party\u2019s National Congress that will convene in Beijing in mid-October to select new members of the ruling elite are at the top of his agenda. Mr. Xi will be awarded his second five-year term at the meeting.China always aims for domestic calm in the period leading up to the secretive congress, and so it is unlikely to do anything before Oct. 19, the start of the conclave, Mr. Zhao said.The biggest concern for China\u2019s leadership is the possibility of North Korea turning on China, the country\u2019s only ally. \u201cIf cornered, North Korea could take military action against China, given the relationship has reached a historic low,\u201d Mr. Zhao said.China supplies more than 80 percent of the North\u2019s crude oil, and suspending delivery would be the ultimate economic sanction, more far-reaching than those imposed, with China\u2019s support, by the United Nations.Even The Global Times, the nationalist, state-run newspaper, said several months ago that China should consider cutting off its oil supplies to North Korea if Mr. Kim detonated a sixth nuclear bomb. But with the party congress looming, the paper modified its position Sunday.\u201cThe origin of the North Korean nuclear issue is the sense of uncertainty that is generated by the military actions of the U.S./South Korea military alliance,\u201d the paper said. \u201cChina should not be at the front of this sharp and complicated situation.\u201dThere were also some doubts whether severing oil supplies would make much a huge difference to the North Korean regime. \u201cThe economic effects will be substantial but not regime crippling,\u201d said Mr. Hayes of the Nautilus Institute, which specializes in the North\u2019s energy needs.The hardships, he said, would be most felt by ordinary people, with less food getting to market and fewer people able to travel between cities in buses.The North\u2019s army has oil stockpiles for routine nonwartime use for at least a year, Mr. Hayes said. \u201cThey can last for about a month before they run out of fuel in wartime, at best; likely much earlier,\u201d he said.Many residents in Yanji in Jilin Province, which borders the North, said they felt their apartments shake after the test. Some posted photos of stocks of food and drinks shattered on the floors of a grocery store. At first residents believed the cause was an earthquake, they said, and only later in the day heard the news from state-run media that North Korea had detonated a nuclear bomb.\u201cI was in my study when the earthquake began,\u201d said Sun Xingjie, an assistant professor at Jilin University in Changchun about 350 miles from the North Korean test site. Mr. Sun said he checked with friends on social media, and they determined from the location and the depth of the explosion that it was a nuclear test.Even though there is no evidence of any contamination from the test reaching China, it is a worry of residents, Mr. Sun said.\u201cWe are at the border region, so we have a sense of fear about leakage from the nuclear test,\u201d he said.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Harbin, China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.E.C. Hacking Response Provides Road Map for Compromised Companies", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchGuess whose database was hacked, exposing sensitive information that could be used for illegal profit, but who failed to disclose that information to the public in a timely manner?The Equifax hacking drew more attention because of its scope, but a potentially more threatening attack \u2014 for those who know what to do with the information \u2014 was the breach of the Securities and Exchange Commission electronic system known as Edgar, which receives 1.7 million corporate and securities filings a year.For an agency that prizes prompt disclosure of accurate information and has pursued enforcement cases for companies that fail to disclose or update information for investors, it appears that the S.E.C. could use a dose of its own medicine.But the hacking is more than a simple stumble for the S.E.C. It has provided a road map for what compromised companies can say in the future \u2014 using the S.E.C.\u2019s own words \u2014 and raised the question of how the commission would secure hugely valuable information if it succeeds in its goal of collecting even more of it.In announcing the breach last week, Mr. Clayton noted that \u201ceven the most diligent cybersecurity efforts will not address all cyberrisks that enterprises face.\u201d Those words are certain to be cited back to the S.E.C. by any company \u2014 especially Equifax \u2014 when questions are raised about the systems it uses to prevent digital attacks and make a timely disclosure to the public when they do occur.The more ominous message about the breach is that only recently has it come to light that the information may have been used to generate trading profit. Much of what is in the Edgar system is made available to the public, but any preview before the release of information can be turned into enormous profit now that trading strategies can be executed in milliseconds.Although Mr. Clayton claimed that the hacking did not \u201cresult in systemic risk,\u201d the misuse of confidential information \u2014 especially when noticing it may have taken months \u2014 threatens the integrity of the financial markets.The use of stolen information from the Edgar system has been likened to insider trading, but there is a crucial difference when hacking is involved. Insider trading requires showing a violation of a fiduciary duty in misusing the information for personal gain, but hackers are thieves who are bound by no such fiduciary duty.But what of those who might have acquired that information from them? For a start, they are not at risk of insider trading charges. And criminal charges could hinge on proving that they knew the information had been acquired illegally.That provision has been interpreted by the federal appeals courts to cover intangible property, so anyone buying confidential information from the Edgar database could come within this prohibition. Proving knowledge when someone buys stolen property can be a challenge because one can always profess ignorance, but prosecutors have had success in showing that a buyer was deliberately ignorant of how information had been acquired. Keeping your head in the sand does not mean you lacked the requisite intent.The C.A.T. will have enormous potential value \u2014 far beyond what is in the Edgar database \u2014 by potentially giving clues about the trading strategies of large investors, such as mutual funds and pensions, that buy and sell millions of shares daily. Imagine how much a peek at that information would be worth to traders looking to get out ahead of large transactions to profit from the small changes in stock prices when they hit the market.The temptation to hack the database will be powerful, which means protecting it will be one of the S.E.C.\u2019s highest priorities. Can the agency be trusted with that much valuable information? The industry has resisted the creation of the C.A.T., and the hacking at the S.E.C. will be an additional argument for those seeking to derail the program.If Mr. Clayton is right that cyberattacks are going to happen even with the best defenses in place, then the small software flaws that hackers exploited at the S.E.C. and Equifax add fuel to the fire of doubt about how secure anyone\u2019s information can be.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Angry Birds Empire: Games, Toys, Movies and Now an I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The digital world is littered with one-hit wonders \u2014 companies that tried to turn a single successful brand into a big-time business only to be eclipsed by changing technology and consumer tastes.The maker of Angry Birds, Rovio Entertainment, hopes to defy that trend.Rovio found success in a smartphone game that pitted a brightly colored feathered flock against an army of green pigs, spawning a series of sequels, a line of toys and clothing, and a feature film. Now, the Finnish company is planning an initial public offering that could value the company at roughly $2 billion, in a test of whether investors will find favor in a single franchise and whether the business can evolve.Rovio helped usher in the rise of smartphone games, building a juggernaut around the Angry Birds brand. In the game, released in 2009, users fling birds at elaborate structures built by pigs that have stolen their eggs.The game\u2019s idiosyncratic concept now has several spinoffs that rank among the most downloaded apps on smartphones and tablets. Rovio\u2019s titles have been downloaded 3.7 billion times, the company said.Rovio has ridden the wave of a rapidly expanding mobile gaming market. The industry\u2019s worldwide revenue was about $16 billion in 2012 and is forecast to top more than $50 billion this year, according to data from SuperData Research, a data provider on the games industry.But Rovio now needs to prove it can profit beyond the success of Angry Birds. Its games business, which includes the original Angry Birds and more than a dozen spinoff titles, accounted for 79 percent of its revenue in the 12 months through June.\u201cThey need to find a way to diversify their brand portfolio in the future,\u201d said Atte Riikola, a research analyst at Inderes in Helsinki, Finland. \u201cThey have had problems in their history when trying to diversify, so it won\u2019t be an easy task to do.\u201dThe company has done a good job creating offshoots of its flagship game, like Bad Piggies and Angry Birds Match. The company has also introduced several non-Angry Birds titles in recent years, including a puzzle game called Fruit Nibblers and a game tied to the pop singer Shakira.\u201cThe hardest part in the app market is to find the users, to get people to download your game,\u201d said Tero Kuittinen, chief strategist at Kuuhubb, a Finnish company focused on lifestyle and mobile video game applications. \u201cIf you have a well-known intellectual property \u2014 you have something that is instantly recognizable, James Bond, \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019 any kind of property like that \u2014 it helps you a lot. Why wouldn\u2019t they leverage Angry Birds?\u201dBut it is still unclear whether Rovio has the framework or model to fuel innovation and expand beyond its main brand. The mobile gaming environment is especially competitive.\u201cAt a certain stage, you will need a formula for more efficient innovation success,\u201d said Mark DiMassimo, the chief executive and chief creative officer at the advertising agency DiMassimo Goldstein. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need to get to winners faster than other folks, more efficiently than other folks. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to be on the losing end of the category.\u201dThe announcement of the public offering marks a turnaround for Rovio, which struggled financially in the years after the initial release of Angry Birds. The company, which started out by selling its games, was caught flat-footed as consumers gravitated to games offered through a so-called freemium model, in which players download the game for free and pay for additional features. Rovio has since switched from paid apps to free downloads of its games.Rovio returned to a profit in 2016 and reported revenue of 191.7 million euros, or about $228 million, last year.Rovio is the latest game maker to turn to the public markets after becoming a cultural phenomenon, following in the footsteps of Zynga and King Digital.The company rose to fame with social games played on Facebook, but it was slow to recognize the move to mobile gaming. While it has since shifted its focus, the company has not been able to repeat its earlier success.Rovio said that the aim of the initial public offering was to help it carry out a growth strategy, and that it would use its shares for possible acquisitions and rewards to its employees.\u201cThat\u2019s really the question for the market around this I.P.O.: To what extent do we believe the company can exploit its existing intellectual property, and to what extent can it go again and deliver another big hit?\u201d said Will McInnes, the chief marketing officer at Brandwatch, which monitors social media trends.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Trump Can Do to Prevent the Next Crash", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by The Federal Reserve arguably has more influence on the daily lives of Americans than any other government agency. In the coming year President Trump has a chance to appoint or replace five of the central bank\u2019s seven governors, including the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, and possibly the chairwoman, Janet Yellen.Few presidents have had so many seats to fill this quickly, and it\u2019s time to pay attention to how Mr. Trump will use the opportunity. The heavy hitters vying for seats are talking \u2014 often vaguely \u2014 about reforming the Fed, which has been praised for preventing a depression after the financial crisis of 2008, but questioned for failing to anticipate the crisis itself.The Fed missed the crisis in part because it has a dual mandate to keep unemployment and consumer price inflation low \u2014 and both were low before 2008. Real reform would add a third mandate: maintaining financial stability, and in particular stabilizing prices for assets like houses and stocks, which are not counted as \u201cconsumer prices\u201d but now have a bigger influence on the economy.Consumer price inflation has largely disappeared, in part because central bankers have been fighting it effectively since the 1970s, and in part because heightened global competition began restraining prices for consumer goods from TVs to toys. Meanwhile, asset prices are getting pushed in the opposite direction.To ease the Great Recession after 2008, central banks adopted zero to negative interest rates and provided huge amounts of cash, effectively giving investors free money. In a world with few barriers to the flow of capital across borders, this is spurring buying sprees, and thus bidding up prices for stocks, bonds and real estate in markets from New York to Shanghai.Today, global financial assets (including just stocks and bonds) are worth over $250 trillion and amount to about 330 percent of global gross domestic product, up from $12 trillion and just 110 percent in 1980. Traditionally, economists have looked for trouble in the economy to cause trouble in the markets. But the ocean of money in financial markets is now so large, it\u2019s possible that ripples on its surface could trigger the next big downturn.Since 1990, every major economic shock has been preceded by a collapse in prices for houses, stocks or both, including Japan\u2019s crash in 1990, the Asian crisis of the late 1990s, the dot-com crash of 2000-01, and the global financial crisis of 2008.The Fed has changed with the world before. After the Great Depression, it focused on fighting unemployment. Amid crippling consumer price inflation in the 1970s, it shifted its focus to fighting this scourge. Now, amid looming market bubbles from China to Norway, central bankers are tentatively starting to recognize that they can\u2019t ignore asset price inflation. At the Federal Open Market Committee, its key policy-making body, financial stability rarely came up before 2012 but has come up at 27 of 39 meetings since.Of course, even market insiders can\u2019t spot when asset prices are ready to crash, so skeptics say the Fed can\u2019t be expected to either. Better to let bubbles pop and \u201cmop up\u201d after. However, the painfully slow recovery from 2008 shows how ineffective mess-mopping can be: Losses after the crash tend to be much bigger than gains on the way up. The Fed need not try to predict the market\u2019s peak; it needs only to identify signals of crises, so that it can act early to forestall them, controlling asset price inflation by raising rates or reducing cash infusions into the economy.At least equally telling is the pace of increase in debt. When asset prices collapse, the owners suffer instant pain. But when debt used to buy those assets collapses, the resulting defaults ripple through banks and become a drag on the economy. The longest and deepest recessions tend to follow real estate busts, because homes are almost always purchased on credit, and during booms, so many buyers are tempted to borrow excessively for that dream house.Nonetheless most economists \u2014 even conservative deficit hawks who worry about the Fed \u201cblowing bubbles\u201d \u2014 still look mainly for economic threats to the financial markets, rather than the threat that overgrown markets pose.They thus don\u2019t recognize fully that the world has changed, and the tail now wags the dog. Many mainstream economists still argue that the economy can\u2019t be overheating if consumer price inflation is quiet, and they want to keep rates lower for longer, hoping that easy money will stoke growth in the economy, and jobs, for the poor and the working class.However, since 2008, easy money has produced an unusually weak economic recovery alongside an unusually long and strong run-up in prices for stocks, bonds and housing. The rich own the fattest share of these assets, so wealth inequality is increasing. In addition, easy money is fueling monopoly power by helping entrenched companies borrow.Liberals who question the value of promoting monopolies and the superrich might also question their fondness for easy money. Instead, to stabilize financial markets, most favor upholding tough post-2008 regulations \u2014 but regulation alone can\u2019t contain the ocean of money in financial assets. From Australia to Canada to Sweden, central banks are keeping rates low because consumer price inflation is weak, thus fueling housing bubbles. Regulatory attempts to contain those bubbles are failing.Central bankers are starting to recognize that when loose monetary policy is driving up asset prices to potentially unstable levels, it sows the seeds of a recession and hurts everyone. But only a minority are prepared to lean against the wind now. Asset prices from stocks to real estate have never been this expensive simultaneously.In general, government agencies, including the Fed, change their ways only after crises. The big threat is that the Fed will fully commit to preserving financial stability only after instability in the markets has triggered the next crisis. Mr. Trump should be looking for governors who are willing to commit now.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rovio, Angry Birds Maker, Valued at $1 Billion in I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 It turns out Angry Birds is a billion-dollar idea.Rovio Entertainment, the company behind the Angry Birds empire that encompasses video games, films and merchandise, was valued at about $1 billion as it prepared to go public on Friday.Rovio helped usher in the rise of smartphone games, with the release of the original Angry Birds in 2009. That original game, where players aimed a flock of birds at an array of evil green pigs, spawned several spinoff titles, all of which have ranked among the most downloaded apps on smartphones and tablets. Overall, Rovio\u2019s titles have been downloaded 3.7 billion times, the company said.But the Finnish company, which initially charged for downloads, struggled financially following its initial Angry Birds success. Consumers gravitated to games offered through a so-called freemium model, in which players download the game for free and pay for additional features.Rovio has since switched from paid apps to free downloads of its games, and its public offering is the latest sign of its changing fortunes. Angry Birds merchandise is widely available, and a sequel to the original Angry Birds film is slated for release in 2019.The pricing of its shares equates to a market capitalization of 896 million euros, or about $1 billion, when Rovio begins initial trading on Nasdaq Helsinki on Friday. That is below the $2 billion valuation that some had estimated the company could receive earlier this summer.Rovio said it would receive about 30 million euros in gross proceeds from the sale of new shares. Existing shareholders, including the investment vehicle of its vice chairman, Kaj Hed, are expected to pocket 458 million euros from the sale of their shares.The company has said that the aim of the initial public offering was to help it carry out a growth strategy, and that it would use its shares for possible acquisitions and rewards to its employees.The public offering marks the latest step in a tumultuous journey for Rovio.Mr. Hed is still executive chairman of Rovio Animation, which helped bring \u201cThe Angry Birds Movie\u201d to the big screen last year.Rovio returned to a profit in 2016 and reported revenue of 191.7 million euros last year.Its games business, which includes the original Angry Birds and more than a dozen spinoff titles, accounted for 79 percent of its revenue in the 12 months through June.Advertisement"}

Federal prosecutors alleged that 32 traders and hackers reaped more than $100 million in illegal proceeds in a scheme so brazen that the traders would send shopping lists of corporate news releases for sneak-peeking purposes to the hackers in order to place trades.The agency said it did not believe that the breach had involved personal information or that it would jeopardize the agency\u2019s activities.\u201cCybersecurity is critical to the operations of our markets, and the risks are significant and, in many cases, systemic,\u201d said Mr. Clayton, the agency\u2019s chairman, in the statement. \u201cWe must be vigilant.

{"Headline": "Irma May Force Florida Insurers to Turn to Deeper Pockets", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith Hurricane Irma\u2019s destructive force having pushed north, Floridians are beginning to check on what has become of their homes. They may also want to check on their insurers.The big national carriers like State Farm and Allstate cut back on writing homeowners\u2019 insurance policies in Florida years ago, citing catastrophic risks and unhelpful state regulators. Those reductions left a vacuum that was filled, initially, with a state-owned insurer, Citizens Property Insurance. Eventually, the state offered incentives to coax some brave new insurers into the market.As a result, all that stands between many Florida homeowners and potential ruin is one state-owned insurer and dozens of relatively little-known companies that do most \u2014 or all \u2014 of their business in the state. They all have the benefit of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, which, with no major storms in the past 12 years, has $17 billion at the ready \u2014 a sum that may not be nearly enough.\u201cThis can really be a hurricane that can bust the insurance industry,\u201d said Shahid Hamid, a finance professor at Florida International University\u2019s International Hurricane Research Center. \u201cWhen I saw Irma\u2019s track, I was tremendously concerned.\u201dWhether policyholders can be made whole will most likely depend on reinsurance \u2014 the custom-tailored insurance that the Florida insurers themselves take out \u2014 and other financial vehicles that they have to fall back on. But the variables at play \u2014 the storm\u2019s path, the companies\u2019 balance sheets and the details of their reinsurance contracts \u2014 could produce differing fortunes for the various companies.By missing a direct hit on Miami, and inflicting less damage than expected on Florida\u2019s Atlantic Coast, Irma turned out to be bad, but not as bad as experts had feared.AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling firm in Boston, predicted on Monday that Irma\u2019s insured damage in the United States would cost the industry $20 billion to $40 billion. If insured property in the Caribbean is included, the total projected losses would range from $25 billion to $55 billion, according to Kevin Long, a spokesman.Insurer strength could be more of an issue in Florida than it was in eastern Texas, where most of Hurricane Harvey\u2019s damage was caused by inland flooding. Homeowners\u2019 insurers do not generally provide flood insurance. While Irma brought flooding to Florida, too, the greater damage was expected to be from high winds, a peril covered by standard homeowners\u2019 policies.Investors dumped the stocks of Florida insurers last week as they anticipated the resulting claims and losses. Not all the insurers are publicly traded, but the second largest in the Florida market, Universal Property & Casualty Insurance, saw the shares of its corporate parent, Universal Insurance Holdings, drop by 15 percent on Thursday. It regained some of that ground Friday and was up more than 13 percent Monday.Mr. Hamid led the development of the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model, which is used by state regulators to assess insurers\u2019 financial strength, among other things. But he said it was impossible to predict which insurers might be vulnerable, because the companies\u2019 exposures vary by region and the terms of their reinsurance contracts are not known.Long before Hurricane Irma started bearing down, Mr. Hamid stress-tested the larger homeowners\u2019 insurers in Florida and found that they would withstand a worst-case scenario, as he defined it at the time: a storm like Hurricane Andrew in 1992.Until now, Andrew was ranked as Florida\u2019s most destructive storm, causing $27 billion in damage \u2014 $47 billion in today\u2019s dollars. Twenty-two insurers failed, leaving a million policyholders without coverage.Joseph L. Petrelli, president of Demotech, an Ohio-based company that reviews and rates regional and specialty insurers \u2014 including about 50 in Florida that represent 60 percent of the state\u2019s homeowners\u2019 insurance market \u2014 suggested that Irma could be more significant because it would cause such a wide swath of damage.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in history that every county in Florida was on hurricane watch,\u201d he said.Using the same benchmark as Mr. Hamid, Mr. Petrelli said he believed his Florida client insurers could withstand a storm like Hurricane Andrew, mainly because they currently hold more reinsurance than ever. He said he could not speak for the other insurers because he does not rate them.Reinsurance allows companies to transfer some of their exposure to other, well-capitalized companies, adding capacity but reducing their profits. Mr. Petrelli said that was why the national insurers pulled back from Florida \u2014 their reinsurance needs in other states were far less expensive and did not undermine profits.\u201cWe make them buy more reinsurance every year,\u201d he said of his Florida clients, \u201cbecause the value of homes goes up every year, the number of homes goes up every year, and the cost of repairs goes up every year.\u201d For the last few years, reinsurance prices had fallen, even for companies in high-risk Florida, because the state has not had a major storm since 2005.Specialized vehicles known as catastrophe bonds have also been more affordable for insurers. Michael Peltier, a spokesman for Citizens Property Insurance, said that when the company issued its first catastrophe bond, in 2012, investors demanded a yield of 21 percent. This year, he said, the rate was only 7 percent. Between reinsurance and catastrophe bonds, he said Citizens was able to increase its capacity to absorb losses this year by $1.3 billion, at a cost of $97 million.Industry experts think the losses from this year\u2019s storms could put an end to the buyer\u2019s market for reinsurance, however.The insurers pass at least some of the cost on to their customers. Homeowners in Florida spent about $1 billion on insurance in 1991, the year before Hurricane Andrew. Last year, they spent nearly $9 billion.\u201cInsurance rates are pretty high,\u201d said Mr. Hamid. \u201cThe average rate for $300,000 coverage, built pre-1992, is $11,500, and it\u2019s higher if you\u2019re near the coast.\u201dHe said the state\u2019s building codes had improved since Hurricane Andrew, and people who upgrade older houses to the new standards can get \u201ca huge discount\u201d on their premiums.The largest homeowners\u2019 insurance company in Florida remains Citizens Property Insurance. It was formed in 1993, and for many years it dominated the market in Florida, causing consternation because its size meant the state was bearing significant risk.By 2011, Citizens estimated that a 100-year storm would cause $24.5 billion in losses, and it had the resources \u2014 including the state catastrophe fund and reinsurance \u2014 to cover just $13 billion.That year, Citizens opened up its books and let the private insurers buy its most profitable policies, in big batches. The goal was to reduce the role of the state, so that while big risks would still be there, for-profit companies would bear more of them.The initiative succeeded, said Mr. Peltier, the company spokesman. Today, Citizens is about one-third its former size. With fewer policyholders, it estimated that it would get only $6.6 billion in claims after a 100-year storm. It has enough resources to cover that without taxpayers getting involved, company projections show. Citizens now screens prospective customers to make sure it takes only those deemed too risky for the companies to insure, like homeowners near the coasts.Citizens builds reserves, buys reinsurance and issues catastrophe bonds to sophisticated investors, just as the private insurers do, Mr. Peltier said. But Citizens also has a risk-management tool that private companies do not: the taxing power of the state. If Hurricane Irma turns out to be devastating enough to use up other resources, Citizens has the authority to assess virtually all policyholders in the state, no matter what type of insurance they hold or whether they bought it from Citizens.The private companies have nothing like that. If one exhausts its resources, it will end up insolvent. In such cases, the company is typically closed, and a state-led \u201cguarantee\u201d mechanism takes over, seeking to pay homeowners as much as possible from what is left and assessments on other insurers. Homeowners\u2019 claims would be unlikely to be paid in full.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the participation of big national carriers like State Farm and Allstate in the homeowners\u2019 insurance market in Florida. While they have cut back on writing policies, they have not withdrawn.Advertisement"}
