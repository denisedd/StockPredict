{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s War Games With Fake Enemies Cause Real Alarm", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The country does not exist, so it has neither an army nor any real citizens, though it has acquired a feisty following of would-be patriots online. Starting on Thursday, however, the fictional state, Veishnoriya, a distillation of the Kremlin\u2019s darkest fears about the West, becomes the target of the combined military might of Russia and its ally Belarus.The nation was invented to provide an enemy to confront during a six-day joint military exercise that is expected to be the biggest display of Russian military power since the end of the Cold War a quarter-century ago.Zapad, \u201cwest\u201d in Russian, used to include military forces from countries under the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet-led military alliance whose non-Soviet members have now all joined NATO. Today, the military exercise has shrunk to just two participants \u2014 Russia and Belarus \u2014 but it is still viewed warily by military planners in the West.It comes at a time of deteriorating relations between Russia and the West, with Washington and Moscow trading diplomatic penalties seemingly weekly. From bitter experience over Russian election meddling and military adventurism in recent years, Western officials have developed a deep distrust of the Kremlin\u2019s motives and its proclamations of good intentions.\u201cNATO will be monitoring the exercises closely,\u201d the alliance\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in an interview recently in Brussels, the site of NATO\u2019s headquarters. Russia, he said, is entirely within its rights to train its forces, but has stirred unease by routinely skirting mutually agreed upon rules designed to calm jitters.The Baltic States and Poland, which fear that the fictional nations invented by Zapad planners are thinly disguised proxies for their own countries, say they believe that the number of Russian troops taking part in Zapad-2017 could reach 100,000.Russia, Mr. Stoltenberg said, has a record of exploiting loopholes in the Vienna Document, habitually understating the number of troops taking part in war games by tens of thousands.Moscow and Minsk insist that this week\u2019s Zapad exercise will involve just 12,700 troops. This means that, like all previous Russian military exercises since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, it weighs in just under the 13,000-troop threshold and is therefore is free of observers from the West.But Estonia\u2019s defense minister, Margus Tsahkna, has pointed to a tender issued this year by Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense for more than 4,000 railway wagons to transport military equipment and soldiers to Belarus. The figure suggests that far bigger military contingents would be on the move than declared, the minister said, a sign that Moscow may intend to leave some behind.The United States military has echoed such worries, with Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who heads the Army forces in Europe, describing Zapad as a possible \u201cTrojan horse\u201d that would send in Russian forces but not take them out.Belarus, which depends on Russian supplies of cheap energy to keep its economy afloat and shares Mr. Putin\u2019s belief that the West is plotting to sow division and even to invade, says it has no such concerns itself.Military exercises, including those conducted by NATO, often feature invented enemies, a practice that blurs their real purpose and avoids upsetting real countries that do not like to be used as a punching bag for military training \u2014 especially when this involves simulated nuclear attacks. Western experts say they believe that Russian war games in 2009 and 2013 included simulated nuclear strikes against Warsaw and Stockholm.\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the concentration of Belarusian military equipment at the borders of Veishnoriya,\u201d reads one message posted by the nonexistent nation\u2019s Foreign Ministry. Others include a call for volunteers from \u201cbrotherly countries\u201d to repel an invasion from the east and warnings that Veishnoriyans are \u201cwarlike beasts\u201d who will not surrender.Russia has dismissed Western anxieties over Zapad-2017, saying that the exercises are purely defensive. Fueling unease is Russia\u2019s silence on what exactly the exercises will involve. Belarus has invited foreign military attach\u00e9s based in Minsk to watch and released some details of its war games with Russia, including airstrikes and tank battles on Sunday and Monday.But it is not clear that the attach\u00e9s will have the freedom they need to move about and to talk with soldiers. Moscow, for its part, has said only that the exercises threaten nobody and will involve operations in Belarus, in Russia\u2019s Western Military District and in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, next to Poland.This vagueness, according to NATO officials in Brussels, continues a pattern of obfuscation deeply entrenched since the Soviet era.A declassified C.I.A. report on Soviet military exercises prepared in the 1980s said that deception was always a central feature of Moscow\u2019s training program, with Soviet forces deploying elaborate ruses to camouflage the real number of troops and purpose of their major exercises. It noted that a Soviet naval exercise designed to practice landing troops on islands off Denmark, a member of NATO, had been disguised as training devoted to the defense of Soviet shores.Measures taken to deceive NATO, the C.I.A. report said, included leaking fake information on Soviet radio frequencies monitored by the West and planting disinformation through human agents. In some cases, the Soviet military deployed special \u201ccamouflage forces\u201d that operated \u201cin totally different regions\u201d from those taking part in a real exercise \u201cso as to mislead NATO intelligence.\u201d It also generated phony radio traffic \u201cin a manner intended to deceive foreign intelligence to the type of the exercise, its aim, conduct etc.\u201dMr. Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said he could not speculate about the real purpose of Zapad-2017, saying that this would become clear only once it was over next week. At the same time, he noted, the exercise fits a \u201cpattern of a more assertive Russia\u201d that is \u201cexercising more aggressively\u201d and, through its actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, has shown that \u201cit is willing to use military force against its neighbors.\u201dOleg Matsnev contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even College Doesn\u2019t Bridge the Racial Income Gap", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialLast year, black college graduates earned about 21 percent less per hour on average than white college graduates; in 1979, the gap was 13 percent. The racial disparity in earnings is even greater for men: Last year, the average hourly earnings of black college-educated men were about 25 percent less than of white college-educated men. The gaps widen up the economic ladder. The top 5 percent of black male earners make about 47 percent less than the top-earning white men.The racial pay gap is narrower among women, but the gender pay gap in average hourly earnings is large. Last year, white college-educated women made 31 percent less than white college-educated men, while black college-educated women made 38 percent less than white college-educated men. Those gaps are reflected in other data, too. Specifically, white college-educated women consistently have a lower employment rate (currently, 67.2 percent) than similarly educated white men (76.1 percent), black men (75.4 percent) and black women (72.7 percent).Clearly, the question is why economic disparities persist even among college-educated workers.But even if Washington took those steps, they would not be enough. Racism and sexism are entrenched, and leaders need to acknowledge that and address the problem head-on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy Isn\u2019t Broken", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMiddle-class wage stagnation is the biggest economic fact driving American politics. Over the past many years, so the common argument goes, capitalism has developed structural flaws. Economic gains are not being shared fairly with the middle class. Wages have become decoupled from productivity. Even when the economy grows, everything goes to the rich.This account of reality, which I\u2019ve certainly repeated, explains why the Democratic Party has moved from the Bill Clinton neoliberal center to the Bernie Sanders left. It explains why the Republicans have moved from the pro-market Mitt Romney right to the populist Donald Trump right.On both left and right, movements have arisen to fix capitalism\u2019s supposed structural flaws, either by radically interfering in the marketplace (Bernie) or by clamping down on global competition (Trump).But what if there are no structural flaws? What if the market is working more or less as it\u2019s supposed to?That\u2019s certainly the evidence from the last two years. Over this time, the benefits of economic growth have been shared more widely.In 2015, median household incomes rose by 5.2 percent. That was the fastest surge in percentage terms since the Census Bureau began keeping records in the 1960s. Women living alone saw their incomes rise by 8.7 percent. Median incomes for Hispanics rose by 6.1 percent. Immigrants\u2019 incomes, excluding naturalized citizens, jumped by over 10 percent.The news was especially good for the poor. The share of overall income that went to the poorest fifth increased by 3 percent, while the share that went to the affluent groups did not change. In that year, the poverty rate fell by 1.2 percentage points, the steepest decline since 1999.In a well-functioning economy, workers are rewarded for their productivity. As output, jobs and hours worked rise, so does income. Over the past two years, that seems to be exactly what\u2019s happening.The evidence from the past two years strongly supports those who have argued all along that income has not decoupled from productivity. A wide range of economists, including Martin Feldstein, Stephen Rose, Edward Lazear, Joao Paulo Pessoa, John Van Reenen, Richard Anderson of the St. Louis Fed and a team from Goldman Sachs, have produced studies showing wages tracking very predictably with productivity.The problem of the middle-class squeeze, in short, may not be with how the fruits of productivity are distributed, but the fact that there isn\u2019t much productivity growth at all. It\u2019s not that a rising tide doesn\u2019t lift all boats; it\u2019s that the tide is not rising fast enough.If productivity itself is the problem, not distribution, radically different politics is demanded than we\u2019re seeing today. If productivity is the problem, we need more dynamism, not less, more openness, not less, more growth-oriented policies, not more dirigiste and redistributive ones.There are a few things government can do to help boost productivity: Increase market competition with more antitrust enforcement and fewer licensing regulations; admit more skilled immigrants; invest more in human capital; deregulate urban land usage back to the 2008 levels; introduce more market incentives into the low productivity sectors, like health care and education; fund more research into promising technologies like new energy storage systems.Today politics is polarizing to the populist left and the populist right. But if productivity is the problem, what we actually need is a resurgence of the moderates. The moderate-left policies of Barack Obama must have had something to do with the middle-income gains of the last two years. Moderate Democrats can plausibly argue that government should not be interfering in the markets, but it should be addressing the inequalities that are the result of deeper social forces. There is still a yawning gap dividing the median Asian-American household, which makes $81,000 a year; the median white household, which makes $65,000; and the median African-American household, which makes $39,490.Moderate Republicans can argue that while government should be active in boosting human capital, and in helping rural America, most of what\u2019s needed is more dynamic capitalism \u2014 more trade, more immigration, more free competition, fewer regulatory burdens, more growth.Right now moderates are in retreat. The populist extremes are on the march. But the fact is they are basing their economic and political agendas on a story that is fundamentally untrue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "RT, Sputnik and Russia\u2019s New Theory of War", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "FeatureHow the Kremlin built one of the most powerful information weapons of the 21st century \u2014 and why it may be impossible to stop.Supported byBut even Steltner found the phone calls he received that morning confounding. They came from police officers from towns far outside Berlin, who reported that protests were erupting, seemingly out of nowhere, on their streets. \u201cThey are demonstrating \u2014 \u2018Save our children,\u2019 \u2018No attacks from immigrants on our children\u2019 and some things like that,\u201d Steltner told me when I met him in Berlin recently.The police were calling Steltner because this was ostensibly his office\u2019s fault. The protesters were angry over the Berlin prosecutor\u2019s supposed refusal to indict three Arab migrants who, they said, raped a 13-year-old girl from Berlin\u2019s tight-knit Russian-German community.Steltner, who would certainly have been informed if such a case had come up for prosecution, had heard nothing of it. He called the Berlin Police Department, which informed him that a 13-year-old Russian-German girl had indeed gone missing a week before. When she resurfaced a day later, she told her parents that three \u201cSouthern-looking men\u201d \u2014 by which she meant Arab migrants \u2014 had yanked her off the street and taken her to a rundown apartment, where they beat and raped her.But when the police interviewed the girl, whose name was Lisa, she changed her story. She had left home, it turned out, because she had gotten in trouble at school. Afraid of how her parents would react, she went to stay with a 19-year-old male friend. The kidnapping and gang rape, she admitted, never happened.An official in the Merkel government told me that the administration was completely perplexed, at first. Then, a few days later, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, held a news conference in Moscow. Bringing up Lisa\u2019s story, he cast doubt on the official version of events. There was no way, he argued, that Lisa left home voluntarily. Germany, he suggested, was \u201ccovering up reality in a politically correct manner for the sake of domestic politics.\u201d Two days later, RT ran a segment reporting that despite all the official denials, the case was \u201cnot so simple.\u201d The Russian Embassy called Steltner and asked to meet, he told me. The German foreign ministry informed him that this was now a diplomatic issue.The whole affair suddenly appeared a lot less mystifying. A realization took hold in the foreign ministry, the intelligence services and the Chancellery: Germany had been hit.The intelligence assessment detailed some cloak-and-dagger activities, like the murky web of Russian (if not directly government-affiliated or -financed) hackers who infiltrated voting systems and stole gigabytes\u2019 worth of email and other documents from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. But most of the assessment concerned machinations that were plainly visible to anyone with a cable subscription or an internet connection: the coordinated activities of the TV and online-media properties and social-media accounts that made up, in the report\u2019s words, \u201cRussia\u2019s state-run propaganda machine.\u201dThis makes RT and Sputnik harder for the West to combat than shadowy hackers. You can tighten your internet security protocols to protect against data breaches, run counterhacking operations to take out infiltrators, sanction countries with proven links to such activities. But RT and Sputnik operate on the stated terms of Western liberal democracy; they count themselves as news organizations, protected by the First Amendment and the libertarian ethos of the internet.But the ratings are almost beside the point. RT might not have amassed an audience that remotely rivals CNN\u2019s in conventional terms, but in the new, \u201cdemocratized\u201d media landscape, it doesn\u2019t need to. Over the past several years, the network has come to form the hub of a new kind of state media operation: one that travels through the same diffuse online channels, chasing the same viral hits and memes, as the rest of the Twitter-and-Facebook-age media. In the process, Russia has built the most effective propaganda operation of the 21st century so far, one that thrives in the feverish political climates that have descended on many Western publics.Something like the dissemination of Ford\u2019s conveyor belt, he said, was now happening in media; the sort of global news networks the West built were being replicated by Russia, to great effect. What was making \u201cthe whole story successful,\u201d he said, \u201cis a tectonic change of the global system that all of a sudden started to develop 10 years ago.\u201dThe transformation and acceleration of information technology, Peskov said, had unmoored the global economy from real value. Perception alone could move markets or crash them. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen bubbles like we\u2019ve seen in the greatest economy in the world, the United States,\u201d he said. The same free flow of information had produced \u201ca new clash of interests,\u201d and so began \u201can informational disaster \u2014 an informational war.\u201dPeskov argued that this was not an information war of Russia\u2019s choosing; it was a \u201ccounteraction.\u201d He brought up the \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d throughout Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which led to the ousters of Russian-friendly governments in Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan in the mid-2000s. Russia blamed American nongovernmental organizations for fomenting the upheavals. But now, Peskov argued, all you might need to shake up the geopolitical order was a Twitter account. \u201cNow you can reach hundreds of millions in a minute,\u201d he said.By way of example, he pointed to \u201cthis girl, from show business, Kim Kardashian.\u201d Kardashian is among the most popular people in all of social media, with 55 million Twitter followers, nearly 18 million more than President Trump. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine that one day she says, \u2018My supporters \u2014 do this,\u2019\u2009\u201d Peskov said. \u201cThis will be a signal that will be accepted by millions and millions of people. And she\u2019s got no intelligence, no interior ministry, no defense ministry, no K.G.B.\u201d This, he said, was the new reality: the global proliferation of the kinds of reach and influence that were once reserved for the great powers and, more recently, great media conglomerates. Even Peskov sounded slightly amazed considering the possibilities. \u201cThe new reality creates a perfect opportunity for mass disturbances,\u201d he said, \u201cor for initiating mass support or mass disapproval.\u201dOne way of looking at the activities of Russia\u2019s information machine is as a resumption of the propaganda fight between the United States and the U.S.S.R. that began immediately following the Second World War. In the late 1940s, the Marshall Plan, the herculean development project helmed by Secretary of State George Marshall, flooded postwar Europe with money and advisers to help rebuild cities, advance democracy and form an integrated economic zone. Joseph Stalin immediately saw it as a threat \u2014 and saw propaganda as one of his best weapons to contain it.For the counterinformation campaign, the U.S. government enlisted journalists, including the Washington Post Pulitzer winner Alfred Friendly and the Christian Science Monitor\u2019s Roscoe Drummond; Hollywood filmmakers; and the top marketers of Madison Avenue, including McCann-Erickson and Young and Rubicam. The new effort \u2014 which eventually fell under a new United States Information Agency \u2014 produced upbeat posters with slogans like \u201cWhatever the weather, we only reach welfare together,\u201d which offered a bright contrast to the Communists\u2019 anti-Marshall Plan messaging. Operating on the theory that local voices would have more credibility than American ones, it fed news to foreign reporters about how well the Marshall Plan was progressing in their countries and recruited top European directors to produce hundreds of news features and documentaries that promoted \u201cWestern values\u201d like free trade and representative democracy.America went into the propaganda war with distinct advantages. At the time, the Marshall Plan was pumping $13 billion into Europe, while the Soviets were taking $14 billion out in the form of reparations and resource seizures; America\u2019s image abroad was as squeaky clean as it would ever be. \u201cThis was the time when finally the United States came of age as an international power \u2014 when it still had its virginity, as it were,\u201d David Reynolds, a Cambridge University history professor, told me.And unlike the Soviets, the United States benefited from the existence of a vast ecosystem of nongovernment media that, even when it crossed swords with the American government, still reflected an American outlook and implicitly promoted American cultural values. The first international, 24-hour networks to come online in the 1980s, like CNN, were American, and they provided their audience \u2014 which eventually included many behind the Iron Curtain \u2014 an unsparing view of the last days of Communism: student protesters staring down tanks in Tiananmen Square, protests and strikes in Poland, East Germans exulting on the ruins of the Berlin Wall. When Mikhail Gorbachev signed his resignation, ceding power to the new presidency of Boris Yeltsin in the last official act of Soviet Communism, he invited CNN to capture the moment in his Kremlin office suite. Finding his own pen out of ink, Gorbachev turned to the CNN president at the time, Tom Johnson, who lent Gorbachev the Mont Blanc he had in his breast pocket. After making sure the pen wasn\u2019t American-made, the last Soviet leader used it to sign one of the most important documents in Russian history. \u201cYou have built your empire better than I built mine,\u201d he told Johnson.Lesin was a sharp-witted hard drinker who was concerned about Russia\u2019s image in the world. He had a vision for an international network that would familiarize Russia in the same way that CNN familiarized America. But the chaos of the later Yeltsin years, in which the ruble collapsed and Yeltsin\u2019s government foundered, made such a thing impossible.Lesin found a more receptive patron in Putin, who succeeded Yeltsin in 1999. Putin \u2014 who, as a deputy in the St. Petersburg mayor\u2019s office half a decade earlier, once chauffeured Ted Turner around the city \u2014 was an attentive student of the power of television. At times, he could not contain his frustration with the way the foreign media covered Russia. \u201cAll they can talk about is crisis and breakdown,\u201d he complained to a nationalist youth group in 2005.That year, with the Russian economy rebounding thanks to strong oil prices, Lesin and Alexei Gromov, Putin\u2019s press strategist, secured the approval and financing to start the network, which they called Russia Today. To run the new operation, they hired a 25-year-old TV reporter named Margarita Simonyan.When she heard she got the job, \u201cI almost fainted,\u201d Simonyan told me recently. We were sitting on plush couches on an exclusive, dimly lit floor of Voronezh, a fashionable restaurant in the Khamovniki district in central Moscow. \u201cDr. No,\u201d the James Bond film about a plan to disrupt the American space program, was on a TV screen opposite us. Before us was a spread of venison, oysters and shrimp, themselves an unsubtle statement: They were imported from Russia\u2019s far east, a menu adjustment in response to the sanctions and countersanctions that had cut off Western food imports.Simonyan grew up poor in Krasnodar, a southern Russia river town, and was 11 when the Soviet Union collapsed. \u201cWe adored the fact that we are now going to be like America and taught like America and to be even patronized by America and be America\u2019s little brother,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel in any way humiliating or contradictory to the Russian pride.\u201d Her infatuation with the United States led her to apply for a slot in a new State Department \u201cfuture leaders\u201d exchange program, which placed top students from the former Soviet Union in United States high schools to \u201censure long-lasting peace and understanding between the U.S. and the countries of Eurasia.\u201dFor one academic year, she attended a public high school in Bristol, N.H. \u201cShe was fascinated with news,\u201d Patricia Albert, whose parents hosted Simonyan, and who remains close with her, told me. \u201cMaggie,\u201d as the family still calls her, would sit transfixed every night when she joined them on the couch to watch the local news, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cCBS Evening News With Dan Rather.\u201d But she also came to resent some of her American classmates for what she viewed as their sheltered na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201c\u2009\u2018Do you have dogs?\u2019 I remember that,\u201d she told me. \u201cI still have a letter I wrote to my parents saying, \u2018I can\u2019t believe they are seriously asking me whether we have dogs.\u2019 They were grown-ups \u2014 18-year-olds \u2014 in a normal high school in New Hampshire, which is supposed to be a sophisticated place.\u201dBack home in Krasnodar, her view of the United States, like many Russians\u2019, started to curdle after the 1999 NATO bombing campaign against the regime of Slobodan Milosevic in the former Yugoslavia, with which Russian had strong ethnic, cultural and political ties: \u201cOur Slavic brothers and sisters,\u201d she told me, leaning forward for emphasis. \u201cYou bombed them with no permission, with no reason,\u201d she said, \u201cand in one day you lost Russia.\u201dWhen she took the helm of Russia Today the following year, Simonyan modeled the new network on CNN and the BBC, and she hired TV consultants from Britain to help give Russia Today a modern cable-news look and feel. (The RT studios in Moscow, when I visited them this spring, were as state-of-the-art as any I\u2019d seen in the United States.) \u201cNobody in Russia had experience of that kind,\u201d Simonyan told me. \u201cTwenty-four-hour news had not been established yet.\u201d One of her employees, Andrey Kiyashko, who started at RT in his late teens, told me: \u201cCNN, BBC \u2014 we were watching it and taking notes on how to be broadcast journalists.\u201dRussia Today \u2014 incorporated as an independent company with state financing \u2014 was getting into hotels and even American cable systems. But three years into its existence, the network still had not gained much notice or had much discernible impact abroad. Simonyan says she concluded that the network\u2019s mission of solely focusing on Russia needed revising. \u201cWe had basically too much Russian news,\u201d she told me.So in 2008, Russia Today began to reposition itself. The network was reintroduced with a new name, RT, and hired McCann \u2014 the same American advertising firm that once helped the United States sell the Marshall Plan. It soon debuted a new satellite channel in the United States, RT America. Instead of celebrating Russia, Simonyan\u2019s network would turn a critical eye to the rest of the world, particularly the United States. As Peskov sees it, the idea was: \u201cWhy are you criticizing us in Chechnya and all this stuff? Look at what you are doing there in the United States with your relationship with white and black.\u201d He went on: \u201cRT said: \u2018Stop. Don\u2019t criticize us. We\u2019ll tell you about yourself.\u2019\u2009\u201dWith that, he said, \u201call of the sudden, Anglo-Saxons saw that there is an army from the opposite side.\u201d RT\u2019s new slogan, dreamed up by McCann, was \u201cQuestion More.\u201dAt the time, state journalism back in Russia was enjoying a kind of renaissance under Dmitri Medvedev, who was elected president in 2008. (Russian presidents are limited to two consecutive terms; Putin endorsed Medvedev as his successor and served as his prime minister before returning to the presidency.) The main Russian international news service, RIA Novosti, hired journalists from The Moscow Times, Agence France-Presse and Reuters, following the philosophy that Russia served its interests best by providing traditional warts-and-all news, with a Russian voice and perspective. \u201cThere was no talk about censorship,\u201d Nabi Abdullaev, a former Moscow Times deputy chief editor who oversaw RIA Novosti\u2019s foreign-language news service, told me. \u201cAll they wanted from me was quality professional standards in reporting; that was it.\u201d\u201cObjectivity is a myth,\u201d Kiselyov said. \u201cJust imagine a young man who puts an arm around the shoulder of a girl,\u201d he went on, \u201cand tells the girl, \u2018You know, I\u2019ve wanted to tell you for a long time that I treat you objectively.\u2019 Is this what she\u2019s waiting for? Probably not. So in the same way, our country, Russia, needs our love. If we speak about the editorial policy, of course, I would certainly want it to be associated with love for Russia.\u201d Journalism, he said, was an instrument of the country.Military officials in America and Europe have come to refer to this idea alternatively as the \u201cGerasimov doctrine\u201d and \u201chybrid war,\u201d which they accuse Russia of engaging in now. When I asked Peskov about those charges, he shrugged. Everyone was doing it, he said. \u201cIf you call what\u2019s going on now a hybrid war, let it be hybrid war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter: It\u2019s war.\u201dShortly after the election, academic and corporate clients hired him to track the proliferation of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 that is, unequivocally false content. He confined his search to social accounts that shared fake news at least 10 times during the last month of the campaign. This September, in his airy, loft-style office suite on the West Side of Manhattan, he called up the results of the study on a laptop screen. They were visualized as a black sphere on which each of the 14,000 fake-news-spreading accounts appeared as a dot, grouped and color-coded according to ideological affiliation. The sphere was alive with bursts of purple (\u201cU.S. Conservative\u201d), green (\u201cU.S. Far Left\u201d), pink (\u201cPro-Russia/WikiLeaks\u201d), orange (\u201cInternational Right\u201d) and blue (\u201cTrump Core\u201d).Within the fake-news network, Kelly explained, RT was high on the list of most-followed accounts, but it was not the highest \u2014 it ranked No. 117 out of roughly 12,000 accounts he was tracking. Its website was the 12th-most-cited by the fake-news consumers and purveyors \u2014 ahead of The New York Times and The Washington Post but behind Breitbart and Infowars.What was more interesting was who followed RT. It drew substantially from all quadrants of Kelly\u2019s fake-news universe \u2014 Trump supporters and Bernie Sanders supporters, Occupy Wall Streeters and libertarians \u2014 which made it something of a rarity. \u201cThe Russians aren\u2019t just pumping up the right wing in America,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey\u2019re also pumping up left-wing stuff \u2014 they\u2019re basically trying to pump up the fringe at the expense of the middle.\u201dNearly 20 percent of the fake-news-spreading accounts, Kelly\u2019s analysis determined, were automated bot accounts, of the sort the American intelligence assessment claimed were working in tandem with RT and Sputnik. But who was operating them was unclear \u2014 and regardless, they were far outnumbered by accounts that appeared to belong to real human beings, reading and circulating content that appealed to them. In this paranoid, polarized and ill-informed subset of American news consumers, RT\u2019s audience crossed all ideological boundaries.RT flew in several members of its leadership team from Moscow for a ceremony and held a cocktail party in the lobby of the General Assembly building, with hot plates and canap\u00e9s of shrimp dumplings and meatballs and ham. Giant banners proclaimed \u201cRT: Member Broadcaster of the United Nations In-House Network.\u201dHis speech was about his mother, who grew up under Stalin. She was orphaned at 3, \u201cwhen she was thrown out of her apartment in the middle of Moscow winter together with her brother, when their parents were arrested by the N.K.V.D., the Stalin secret police,\u201d he said, speaking haltingly. \u201cMy grandfather, her father, as she only found out many years later, was tortured and executed. And my grandmother, her mother, died in a labor camp. And similar stories happened to millions of my compatriots back in the 1930s.\u201dHe was building toward something. \u201cWhat I see today is more and more frequently people produce the highfalutin talk about using the word \u2018propaganda\u2019 that eerily echoes those dark days of the Soviet era, when even thinking their own thoughts, not to mention speaking or printing them, was a crime.\u201d People, he declared, \u201cmust have the right to know different news, coming from different sources, and then make their own judgment.\u201dWhen I asked Simonyan recently what she made of the proliferating attempts to map RT\u2019s influence in the Russian information network that United States intelligence agencies describe as a hybrid-war machine, she replied by email: \u201cThese projects simply blacklist all reporting, including by American media, as some pro-Russian campaign if any facts or views in them don\u2019t support the right kind of narrative.\u201d At the moment, she said, that narrative was: \u201cAll world problems are Putin\u2019s fault.\u201d In her view, \u201cit\u2019s the sad history of McCarthyism repeating itself.\u201d (These were arguments that echoed Trump\u2019s own.)It also reflected the genius of \u201cQuestion More\u201d: Every attempt to contain or counteract the Russian state-backed media\u2019s influence simply validated it. Churkin, the ambassador, acknowledged as much at RT\u2019s U.N. ceremony. As he stood to speak, he seemed to be almost bouncing on the soles of his feet, delighted at RT\u2019s newfound prominence. \u201cEverybody watches them,\u201d he said. \u201cDiplomats do it, ambassadors do it, foreign ministers do it, heads of state and government do it.\u201d In an oblique allusion to the recent American intelligence report, he noted that some people had been criticizing the network, but perhaps this was not such a bad thing. Grinning, he said: \u201cThey sound as if they are P.R. representatives of RT.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He emphasized an \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda, and said that while the United States would \u201cforever be a great friend to the world and especially to its allies,\u201d his primary responsibility was to Americans.\u201cAs president, I will always put America first, just like you as the leaders of your countries will always \u2014 and should always \u2014 put your countries first,\u201d he said.\u2014 MEGAN SPECIAAfter condemning North Korea, Mr. Trump pivoted to the next \u201crogue nation\u201d \u2014 Iran.He called the Iran nuclear deal \u201can embarrassment\u201d that is \u201cone of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.\u201d\u201cIt is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran\u2019s government end its pursuit of death and destruction,\u201d he said.The world\u2019s nuclear inspectors recently declared that they had found no evidence that Iran is breaching the agreement.

The only exceptions to that are if it is sanctioned by the Security Council or if it is an act of self-defense.In this instance, there is no such authorization from the Security Council. And so the question is: Was Mr. Trump justified on the basis of self-defense?John B. Bellinger, who served as a legal adviser in the administration of George W. Bush, said that despite his \u201ccolorful\u201d choice of words, Mr. Trump invoked the self-defense argument explicitly.\u201cHis threat to destroy North Korea did not violate the U.N. Charter because he said that the United States would use force only \u2018if the United States is forced to defend itself or its allies,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bellinger said by email. \u201cThe Charter specifically allows a U.N. member to use force in self-defense.\u201dMark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association, said the International Court of Justice had stipulated that countries can act unilaterally if facing an armed attack, but there is a lack of clarity on what armed attack means.Kevin Jon Heller, a law professor at the University of London, said he believed Mr. Trump had overstepped.First he derided North Korea\u2019s leader as \u201crocket man.\u201d Then President Trump was served rocket salad for lunch.Wild rocket actually. The menu described it as a salad that also combined romaine lettuce, chanterelle mushrooms and haricot verts, grilled stone fruit and \u201csmothered in white balsamic & truffle vinaigrette.\u201dIt was paired with a 2016 Sancerre.The president sat at the head table with Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, whose speech earlier at the General Assembly was a sharp counterpoint to Mr. Trump\u2019s bellicose, nationalist remarks in the hall.Lunch for world leaders was served in the second-floor North Delegates Lounge, where on most days diplomats drink espresso out of paper cups.Mr. Trump gave a toast \u2014 barely sipping because he does not drink alcohol \u2014 to the \u201cgreat, great potential\u201d of the United Nations, telling those assembled there, \u201cYou\u2019re going to do things that will be epic.\u201dOn the wall behind the podium was a large tapestry of the Great Wall of China \u2014 a gift to the United Nations from Beijing.Also seated at the head table with him were the presidents of Japan, South Korea and Liberia, along with the king of Jordan.The main course was beef Wagyu tenderloin. Dessert included a chocolate mousse and raspberries, accompanied by a 40-year-old Port from the secretary general\u2019s home country, Portugal.How much jet fuel was spent on bringing this lunch to the table was unclear.\u2014 SOMINI SENGUPTAPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey used his General Assembly speech to remind the world of a crisis that has preoccupied the United Nations for nearly seven years: the Syria war and the humanitarian crisis it has caused, particularly the refugees that have flowed into Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and elsewhere, including Europe.Turkey is by far the largest single recipient of Syrian refugees, housing more than 3 million, and has spent more than $30 billion caring for them, Mr. Erdogan said.Opening the General Assembly session, Mr. Guterres gravely warned about nuclear peril and climate change, and offered pointed reminders about \u201cstronger international cooperation.\u201d\u201cTrust within and among countries is being driven down by those who demonize and divide,\u201d he said in a speech that included English, French and Spanish.President Trump could not be seen in the hall.To Myanmar\u2019s government, Mr. Guterres issued a blunt directive. \u201cThe authorities in Myanmar must end the military operations and allow unhindered humanitarian access,\u201d he said.On climate change, Mr. Guterres referred to the hurricanes that recently ravaged the United States and the Caribbean, and called for the world to step up its promises, made under the Paris climate agreement, to contain carbon emissions.\u201cWe know enough today to act,\u201d he said. \u201cthe science is unassailable.\u201dOn the rights of refugees and migrants, he assailed what he called \u201cclosed doors and open hostility\u201d and called on countries to treat those crossing borders with \u201csimple decency and human compassion.\u201d\u2014 SOMINI SENGUPTA\u2014 RICK GLADSTONE\u2014 RICK GLADSTONEBrazil has almost always been the first to speak at the General Assembly, a tradition traced to the early days of the United Nations and the Cold War.According to Antonio Patriota, a former Brazilian ambassador to the United Nations, Brazil demonstrated deft diplomacy in presiding over the first few General Assembly debates.

{"Headline": "How Low-Cost Airlines Alter the Economics of Flying", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than three years, the average one-way fare between Detroit and Philadelphia never dipped below $308, and sometimes moved higher, topping $385 at one point.But then, early in 2016, fares suddenly started to fall, according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. By the end of the year, the average one-way ticket between the two cities stood at just $183.What changed? The primary factor was Spirit Airlines.The low-cost carrier began operating flights from Philadelphia International Airport to Detroit in April 2016, offering one-way fares for less than $100, in some cases. Spirit\u2019s move into the route pushed down average ticket costs at all carriers on it, including Delta Air Lines and American Airlines.\u201cWithout the low-cost carriers, we would have been looking at a pretty significant downturn in activity,\u201d said James Tyrrell, chief revenue officer at Philadelphia International Airport.Frontier Airlines, another low-cost carrier, had also added flights from Philadelphia, Mr. Tyrrell said. Without such airlines, he added, \u201cyou would have absolutely seen a different pricing structure.\u201dEven as a wave of mergers has cut the number of major carriers to four and significantly reduced competition, lower-cost airlines continue to play a role in moderating ticket costs.While such airlines offer a no-frills passenger experience and charge plenty of fees for such luxuries as additional bags or extra legroom, they are able to stimulate new demand from occasional fliers with relatively cheap prices and even take passengers from the major carriers.Here is what happens when people fly more often, in fuller planes and pay higher fees.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to underestimate just how important the effect of low-cost carriers are on a given route,\u201d said William McGee, the aviation adviser for Consumers Union.Carriers like United and American do not compete with carriers like Frontier and Spirit on every type of passenger. Lucrative corporate accounts are owned by the big carriers, and business travelers avoid the cheaper airlines, often choosing to pay premium prices at the last moment to get seats on the flights that best fit their schedules.But the low-cost carriers nonetheless force the big airlines to figure out a way to draw the most price-sensitive fliers in any given market \u2014 those who scour the internet for the cheapest tickets possible. Those customers make up a significant portion of travelers, meaning the major carrier cannot just ignore them.\u201cThose passengers certainly are important,\u201d said David Weingart, an economist at the aviation consultant GRA. \u201cThe larger airlines have proven that in how they\u2019ve reacted, in how they\u2019ve tried to capture or recapture those passengers.\u201dDelta, American and United Airlines have all rolled out \u201cbasic economy\u201d fares. Such tickets are priced competitively against Spirit and Frontier, but do not offer the amenities that most consumers have come to expect on a flight, like receiving a seat assignment ahead of a flight or obtaining a refund for a ticket.Of all the major carriers, United is fighting on price the most aggressively.Scott Kirby, who was appointed as United\u2019s president a year ago, has shifted the carrier\u2019s strategy toward the low-cost airlines, mirroring one he helped to drive when he served as a top executive at American.Pushing back against Wall Street\u2019s wishes to limit capacity growth, United is adding seats in a number of its major markets across the country. It has, for example, swapped out smaller jets for larger planes to increase the number of seats it has available to sell, and matched fares offered by low-cost carriers.By expanding capacity, United aims to get back to what Mr. Kirby calls its \u201cnatural\u201d share of passengers in some of its hubs. The carrier now expects to increase its seat capacity in the domestic market by as much as 4.5 percent this year over last year, double the 2 percent growth Delta has forecast. American does not expect its capacity to change.\u201cWe\u2019re just returning to where United\u2019s natural market share is,\u201d Mr. Kirby told stock analysts in April. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very careful to calibrate how it\u2019s working and how we\u2019re doing.\u201dUnited\u2019s new approach has put it into direct competition with Spirit in Newark, Houston and Chicago, according to analysts and executives. Spirit has certainly noticed.\u201cWhile we are not surprised that the environment remains very competitive, it is surprising to see our competitors resort to the unusual level of discounting we are currently seeing, especially since we are still in the summer peak period,\u201d Matthew Klein, chief commercial officer at Spirit, said during a call with analysts in July.Denver has also emerged as a battleground. Frontier, a privately held carrier, announced in July that it planned to add 21 flights from Denver International Airport, mostly to smaller cities like Albuquerque; Louisville, Ky.; and Charleston, S.C. The company said that it planned to double the number of nonstop routes it operates to 314 and its total number of routes to 1,000 by next summer.Because of the underlying strength of the economy in the Denver area, United, Southwest and Spirit have added flights there in recent years as well. Kim Day, the chief executive at the Denver airport, said fares at the hub are now 15 percent below the national average.She said that she believed each of the airlines that use the sprawling facility 25 miles from the city\u2019s downtown is drawing different kinds of passengers.\u201cThey\u2019ve all found their niches,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they can make money here, they\u2019re going to continue to flow connecting passengers in here.\u201dThe current skirmishes do not amount to a broad-based fare war. Many routes in the United States are dominated by a single carrier, insulating them from price competition.The cost of a round-trip domestic ticket averaged more than $490 in the first half of the year, up slightly compared with 2016, according to Airlines Reporting Corporation, a company that settles flight transactions between a number of carriers and booking services like Expedia.The jostling, however, has left airline investors skittish. As the publicly traded airlines in July reported earnings for the second quarter, shareholders sold off their shares, worried about the fight over fares and capacity increases.But anxiety among investors is good news for fliers. Travelers on routes that are competitive will probably be able to snap up good deals.\u201cI don\u2019t see the prices really rising that much from year to year, based on that ability to have that competition and keep prices at a normal level,\u201d said Merritt Pullam, a real estate agent who lives with his wife and two young children in Denver and flies to places like California and Hawaii for vacations.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect surname for a traveler who lives in Denver. He is Merritt Pullam, not Pullman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Battle Over Tax Cuts, It\u2019s Republicans vs. Economists", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican lawmakers are gearing up to battle a powerful force in the coming skirmish over a $1.5 trillion tax cut: Economists.Party leaders are rejecting criticism that their yet-to-be-unveiled tax plan will add to the ballooning federal deficit, saying the tax cuts will essentially pay for themselves by generating robust economic growth. And they are determined to secure economic assessments that prove those optimistic assumptions.Their position is setting the stage for a fight with Washington\u2019s economic scorekeepers \u2014 such as the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 who are required to assess the cost of tax legislation and its impact on the federal deficit. Those assessments \u2014 a so-called budget score \u2014 could ultimately determine the scope and permanence of any tax overhaul because of budget rules limiting legislation that adds to the long-term deficit.Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who sits on the budget committee, seemed to throw down the gauntlet this week, saying he would push for a pro-growth tax overhaul that pays for itself using \u201cvalid models.\u201d He singled out the Joint Committee on Taxation in comments to reporters, suggesting that Republicans would be looking beyond their analysis when assessing the plan\u2019s cost.Mr. Corker, in an interview on Friday, said that the experience of working with the Congressional Budget Office during Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act buttressed his view that analyses from economists outside the government should be considered when scoring tax legislation.\u201cI do think it is time for us to have a real debate and to have real economists weighing in and we should take other things into account other than Joint Tax and C.B.O,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair for us to get outside help.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve learned during the health care debate, these guys are not super-people.\u201dTo some fiscal conservatives, anti-deficit groups and veterans of past tax bill battles, the reluctance to rely on traditional, nonpartisan scorekeepers is a sign the math needed to support tax legislation is going to get fuzzy.\u201cWithout massive budget gimmicks, there\u2019s no way they can do what they want to do,\u201d said David Brockway, chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation from 1983 to 1987.The debate over budget scoring comes ahead of a big tax week. On Sunday, Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee will hold a two-day policy retreat to crystallize their thinking on the tax plan. On Wednesday, the \u201cBix Six\u201d Republican working group of Congressional and Trump administration officials are expected to finally release a framework of policy principles so the legislative process can begin.Simmering beneath the discussions are a set of arcane rules that dictate how the Senate and House must account for policy changes that touch every corner of the economy. Optimistic growth assumptions are important because Republicans are planning to use a procedural tool called budget reconciliation to pass a tax bill through the Senate with a simple majority. The drawback of this expedited path is that if official projections from the Joint Committee on Taxation find that the plan will add to the deficit after a decade, the changes made to the tax code have to expire after that period of time.Budget scoring can be influenced by a variety of factors, including economic forecasts and assumptions about future tax and spending levels. For instance, a model that assumes higher economic growth will project lower deficits since stronger growth tends to raise taxable income and reduce spending on low-income programs. The Office of Management and Budget and Congressional Budget Office both estimate that each 0.1 percentage point increase in annual economic growth reduces deficits by roughly $300 billion over the coming decade. Future deficit levels can also go up or down depending on the assumptions economists make about future tax and spending levels.Republicans fret that the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office will underestimate the amount of economic growth from their tax cuts and plans to simplify the tax code. The Trump administration says its policies will get the economy growing at a rate of 3 percent, which they say will generate more than enough revenue to pay for the tax cuts.\u201cAny plan we put forward we believe should be paid for with economic growth,\u201d Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a Senate hearing in May. \u201cI am concerned as to whether some of the models will attribute enough growth in dynamic scoring, but when we present the details, we will present how we think it should be paid for.\u201dMeanwhile, veterans of past budget fights say while economic growth can alleviate the deficit hit from a $1.5 trillion tax cut it cannot offset it entirely.\u201cIf it is a well-designed tax policy, it will partially offset the cost,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who served in the George W. Bush administration and advised John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. But, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence anywhere that a tax cut of that magnitude, regardless of composition, will offset\u201d the entire $1.5 trillion.Some budget watchers are concerned that the Senate could move away from relying on the taxation committee or the Congressional Budget Office and procure rosier projections from friendlier agencies such as the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, the Treasury Department or partisan think tanks.It is ultimately up to the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Mike B. Enzi of Wyoming, to determine who handles the scoring. Thus far he does not appear inclined to make radical changes to the rules.A spokesman for Mr. Enzi declined to comment on his position.Conservative groups are urging Republicans to stop relying on the taxation committee, saying it uses an antiquated economic model that underestimates growth.\u201cThe concern is if they just blindly follow the Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s numbers, it will show significantly less economic growth than the reality will be,\u201d said Adam Michel, a tax policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cThis could harm the chances for tax reform.\u201dBut the stakes are getting higher as the nation\u2019s debt level continues to rise \u2014 it topped $20 trillion this year and is expected to grow by an additional $10 trillion over the next decade as federal health and retirement programs spend more on an aging population.\u201cThe ultimate issue here is that we have a federal budget that\u2019s on an unsustainable track,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.In addition to using alternate scorekeepers, Republicans have also discussed switching from a \u201ccurrent law\u201d budget baseline to a \u201ccurrent policy\u201d baseline. This would allow Republicans to avoid offsetting nearly $500 billion of expiring tax breaks, making the tax plan appear less costly. Earlier this year there was a push by some lawmakers, led by Senator Pat J. Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican, to expand the budget \u201cwindow\u201d from 10 years to 20 years or more. This idea, which has been dismissed by party leaders, would allow for tax cuts that add to the deficit to last longer before expiring.\u201cIf you change the rules in ways that allow you to make the debt grow larger, it\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d said David Wessel, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAll that\u2019s doing is putting on blinders and pretending tax cuts will pay for themselves.\u201dRohit Kumar, a former top aide to Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said Republicans should be careful when considering making unorthodox changes to budget policy to make their tax cuts appear more palatable. Such tricks could come back to haunt them, he said, when Democrats are in power.\u201cYou quickly have a slippery slope where you decide whatever result you want and find a model that works with that,\u201d said Mr. Kumar, who now works at PwC, an auditing firm. \u201cIf you are going to do this, you have to understand that there are potential risks down the road.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Return of Bigger Banks Means Bigger Risks for Everyone Else", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialTo reduce the risks from too-big-to-fail institutions, Congress in 2010 passed the Dodd-Frank financial oversight bill. But ever since, even as the stock market soared, wages stagnated and the victims of predatory lenders continued to struggle, Wall Street\u2019s champions have demanded an end to Dodd-Frank\u2019s regulations.Step by step, the Trump administration has made it clear that it is on their side, that Wall Street need have no real concern about Dodd-Frank\u2019s provisions and that the lessons of the financial crisis will be ignored.The next report is expected to propose lighter regulation for financial firms other than banks, by restricting the government\u2019s ability to designate insurance companies, corporate lending subsidiaries and other firms as too big to fail, a label that subjects a company to additional rules and higher capital requirements.The rollback would be blind to history. Non-banks proved as unstable as banks in the crisis. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Wall Street\u2019s other big investment houses survived by converting into federally insured banks, and raking in bailouts, cheap loans from the Fed and federal guarantees. The insurer American International Group required a $182 billion bailout, and GE Capital needed $139 billion in federal backing to borrow money to stay afloat. Federal deposit insurance was temporarily extended to money market funds to prevent a catastrophic run on the financial system.Financial corporations are being given the nod to re-establish their unholy alliances, in which vast interconnections through lending, borrowing, derivatives and other transactions spread and amplify risks throughout the financial system \u2014 while regulators look the other way. The greater the risk, the greater the potential return for bank executives and traders. For everyone else, heightened risk means greater economic peril, including threatened destruction of jobs, pay, savings, home equity and career opportunity.The Republican-controlled Congress is too jammed up to move ahead with legislation to weaken Dodd-Frank. But that won\u2019t be necessary, since the administration is doing a good job of dismantling the regulations on its own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After New Travel Warning, Questions About Safety in Mexico", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateThe warning notes that murder, kidnapping, carjacking and robbery have been on the rise as rival gangs battle over territory. Recent shootings in Los Cabos, Canc\u00fan and Playa del Carmen indicate those conflicts have surfaced in popular beach destinations, although the statement notes that tourists have not been targets.\u201cResort areas and tourist destinations in Mexico generally do not see the level of drug-related violence and crime that are reported in the border region or in areas along major trafficking routes,\u201d the warning stated.Tourism groups in Mexico are quick to point out the rarity of violent events relative to the 28 million American tourists who travel to the country each year.\u201cIf you see this in the context of how many people come, the chance of any situation happening is really truly very small,\u201d said Rodrigo Esponda, the managing director of the Los Cabos Tourism Board. The board reported that 2 million tourists visited Los Cabos, at the southern tip of the Baja Peninsula, last year, and that arrivals are up 20 percent to date this year.With both Caribbean and Pacific ports, Mexico is also a popular destination for cruises. The Cruise Lines International Association, which represents the major cruise companies in the industry, issued a statement, noting that ships \u201chave the flexibility to alter their itineraries, as needed, to avoid areas of higher risk.\u201dGovernment forces and the private sector have stationed more police and military in tourist zones. But some business leaders worry that anti-Mexico sentiment, fueled by President Trump\u2019s border wall promise and immigration threats, combined with the travel warning and the recent discovery that tainted alcohol was served at some resorts on Mexico\u2019s Caribbean coast, will weaken demand for travel in the country.Security experts suggest taking some precautions, including avoiding traveling at night.Several areas that are popular with American travelers, including San Miguel de Allende, Merida and Mexico City, were not included in the warning, which covers 23 of Mexico\u2019s 31 states. Parts of Mexico City, however, are recovering from a destructive 7.1-magnitude earthquake that struck earlier this month.Here is the latest on security in the following tourist destinations mentioned in the State Department warning.The state of Quintana Roo, the northeastern section of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, is home to the popular beach destinations Canc\u00fan and Riviera Maya, which have recently experienced shootings linked to gang wars.\u201cWhile most of these homicides appeared to be targeted criminal organization assassinations, turf battles between criminal groups have resulted in violent crime in areas frequented by U.S. citizens. Shooting incidents, in which innocent bystanders have been injured or killed, have occurred,\u201d the warning states.In June, a gunman opened fire in a crowded area of downtown Canc\u00fan, killing one. In January, an attack on a state prosecutor\u2019s office killed four. Neither incident took place in the beach destination\u2019s resort-lined hotel zone.In Playa del Carmen, the largest town on the Riviera Maya, which runs 86 miles along the Caribbean south of Canc\u00fan to Tulum, a shooting at a popular nightclub in January killed five. In July, another shootout in town injured three.The destinations have responded by adding police and military patrols.\u201cWe have had special operations since July and August,\u201d said Dario Flota Ocampo, the general director of the Cozumel and Riviera Maya Tourism Board. \u201cThe presence of federal and local forces is continuing. They focus on tourist zones and their presence is permanent.\u201dThe warning covers the state of Baja California Sur, home to Los Cabos, a 20-mile-long resort region bracketed by two towns, Cabo San Lucas and San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo, at the end of the Baja Peninsula.\u201cShooting incidents, in which innocent bystanders have been injured, have occurred during daylight hours,\u201d the warning stated, seemingly referring to an August shooting at a popular beach in the area in which gunmen opened fire, killing three and sending tourists fleeing. Other slayings, including the discovery of a mass grave, have the markings of gang warfare.According to the Los Cabos Tourism Board, the destination has received over $46 million from government and private sources to bolster security. Some 190 federal police have arrived this year to patrol the area. The private sector has invested more than $7 million to fund supplemental police training, provide equipment and operate security cameras in the destination.\u201cWithout tourists, we would have nothing here,\u201d said Mr. Esponda of the Los Cabos Tourism Board. \u201cThe destination was built from scratch.\u201dThe state of Guerrero, home to Acapulco, was already included in the previous State Department warning based on gang-related violence. While there is no change in its status, the destination has adopted some new security measures designed to ease travelers\u2019 minds. This summer, the Acapulco police deployed five drones to patrol the beaches, sending live video monitored by law enforcement.The travel warning calls out the state of Jalisco, home to Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara, but focuses on the border regions with neighboring states of Michoac\u00e1n and Zacatecas because of \u201ccontinued instability.\u201dThe Puerto Vallarta Tourism Board distanced itself from those regions, issuing a statement that read, \u201cThe U.S. Department\u2019s Travel Warning as it pertains to the State of Jalisco highlights rural highways and areas that border states to the south, almost 250 miles from Puerto Vallarta or the distance between New York and Boston; or Los Angeles to Las Vegas.\u201dThe board noted that the average occupancy rate for hotels in the first six months of 2017 is close to 90 percent, compared with 73 percent in 2016, with 1.8 million international arrivals by air during the period, up 12 percent over last year.A spokesman for the Riviera Nayarit Convention and Visitors Bureau wrote in an email that the highway that runs from the airport in Puerto Vallarta, the main gateway to the region, and San Blas in the north is patrolled around the clock by state and tourism police. It also employs tourism police to patrol beaches and towns. Private security personnel at each resort monitor guest arrivals as well as the beach.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Health Bill Appears Dead as Pivotal G.O.P. Senator Declares Opposition", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A last-ditch attempt by President Trump and Senate Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act appeared to collapse on Monday as a pivotal senator announced her firm opposition to the latest repeal plan, virtually ensuring that Republicans would not have the votes they need for passage.The announcement by the senator, Susan Collins of Maine, effectively dooms what had been a long-shot effort by Republicans in the Senate to make one more attempt at repealing the health law after failing in dramatic fashion in July.The demise of the latest repeal push means that Republicans are now all but certain to conclude Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office without fulfilling one of their central promises, which the president and lawmakers had hoped to deliver on quickly after Mr. Trump took office.For seven years, Republicans have said they would repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement and replace it with a new health care system more palatable to conservatives. But they were never able to formulate a replacement that was both politically and substantively viable.Ms. Collins, one of three Republican senators who opposed the last repeal attempt in July, described the latest plan as \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d She expressed concerns about cuts to Medicaid as well as the rolling back of protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.\u201cHealth care is a deeply personal, complex issue that affects every single one of us and one-sixth of the American economy,\u201d Ms. Collins said in a statement, lamenting the rushed process and the content of legislation that has shifted as Republican leaders scrambled for votes. \u201cSweeping reforms to our health care system and to Medicaid can\u2019t be done well in a compressed time frame, especially when the actual bill is a moving target.\u201dThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Monday released its findings on the latest Republican health care bill.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, now faces the unpalatable choice of admitting defeat or moving ahead with a vote that appears certain to fail.Republican leaders in the Senate can afford to lose only two of their members, and they now have three firm opponents within their ranks: Rand Paul of Kentucky, John McCain of Arizona and Ms. Collins. Additionally, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has withheld his support and requested changes to the bill.Time is not on their side: Republicans have only until the end of the month to pass the bill through the Senate while being protected from a Democratic filibuster.Beginning in October, Republicans would need Democratic votes in order to pass a repeal bill, a seeming impossibility given that Democratic senators have been unified in opposition to the repeal push.Some Republican senators have suggested starting over, with parliamentary language in a new budget blueprint that once again would shield repeal legislation from a filibuster. But that could terribly complicate Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code, a risk the leadership may not want to take.Thirteen lawmakers from 12 states have opposed at least one of the Senate\u2019s five major repeal efforts in recent months.\u201cWe\u2019re going to press on,\u201d Mr. Graham said hours later, during a Monday night CNN debate on health care. He raised the possibility of still holding a vote, even as he acknowledged it might fail: \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. to vote. It\u2019s O.K. to fall short, if you do, for an idea you believe in.\u201dThe senators released a revised version of their bill on Monday morning, hoping to win over holdout Republicans in part by shifting more funds to states like Alaska and Maine. The bill would take money provided under the Affordable Care Act for insurance subsidies and the expansion of Medicaid and send it to states, with vast new discretion over how to use it for health care or coverage.But writing a repeal bill that could win over at least 50 of the 52 Republican senators has proved extraordinarily difficult, and putting together a complicated bill against the backdrop of a ticking clock only added to the challenge. Insurers, hospitals, doctors and patient advocacy groups assailed the proposal, as did the late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.The Capitol complex looked at times like a hospital ward on Monday as patients swarmed through the corridors, pleading with senators not to take away their health insurance. Some wore T-shirts that said, \u201cI Am a Pre-Existing Condition.\u201dThe Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on the repeal bill on Monday, and it was immediately disrupted by people in the audience shouting opposition to the proposal. \u201cNo cuts to Medicaid,\u201d they chanted. \u201cSave our liberty!\u201d Capitol police officers removed the protesters, some of whom were in wheelchairs.As Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Graham revised their bill to try to build support, critics asserted that their last-minute changes further weakened protections for patients, including those with cancer and other pre-existing conditions.Dick Woodruff, senior vice president at the lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society, said that under the bill, patient protections provided by the Affordable Care Act would be up to each state to decide.\u201cSome states could decide not to cover even preventive services, like cancer screenings, routine mammography or colonoscopy,\u201d Mr. Woodruff said.Republican senators had to make up their minds with little information about the measure\u2019s implications.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Monday that \u201cmillions of additional people would be uninsured\u201d under the Graham-Cassidy bill, compared with the number of people expected to lack coverage under current law.\u201cEnrollment in Medicaid would be substantially lower because of large reductions in federal funding for that program,\u201d the budget office said.But the budget office said it did not have time to produce a more complete assessment, leaving senators without specifics on how the bill would affect coverage and health insurance premiums.A comparison of the Cassidy-Graham measure with four other bills that failed in Congress.The rushed process contributed to the bill\u2019s demise.Mr. Paul had previously said he would oppose the Graham-Cassidy bill because it did not go far enough in repealing the health law. On Monday, he continued to denounce it as a \u201cfake repeal.\u201dMr. Paul presented himself as open to compromise, voicing support for a narrower measure. But he rejected the Graham-Cassidy bill\u2019s core concept of providing block grants to the states to use for health care \u2014 leaving little room for Republican leaders to win his vote unless they radically altered the legislation.\u201cI think if you vote for this bill, you put your stamp of approval on a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of Obamacare spending,\u201d he said.Mr. Paul was not the only conservative with reservations. Mr. Cruz said on Sunday that he had not yet been won over and was seeking changes to the repeal plan, though he said he wanted to ultimately wind up in favor of the bill. An aide to Mr. Cruz said on Monday that he still wanted to see changes.Before Ms. Collins\u2019s announcement on Monday, Mr. Trump expressed frustration that Republicans had talked for years about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act but failed to deliver now that a Republican was in the White House.On the \u201cRick & Bubba Show,\u201d a radio program, Mr. Trump singled out Mr. McCain, calling his vote in July \u201ca tremendous slap in the face of the Republican Party.\u201d And the president seemed resigned to defeat in the latest attempt at repeal.\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose two or three votes,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s the end of that.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shimon Peres, in Memoir, Takes On Israel Past and Future", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAFFA, Israel \u2014 The ousted French prime minister had just signed the letter authorizing the sale of a nuclear reactor to Israel \u2014 for peaceful purposes, he had been assured \u2014 even though he no longer had the authority to do so.It was the morning after Maurice Bourg\u00e8s-Maunoury\u2019s government fell in late 1957. To get around the problem, he wrote the previous day\u2019s date at the top of the page as an anxious Shimon Peres, then the ever-resourceful director general of Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense, looked on.\u201cI asked no questions,\u201d Mr. Peres, who went on to serve as prime minister and president, related six decades after the event. \u201cI said nothing at all. What was there to say?\u201d It was, Mr. Peres said, \u201cthe most generous display of friendship I had ever known.\u201dThese are the final words of the last of the founding generation of Israeli leaders. But indefatigable dreamer that Mr. Peres was, his book also delivers a pointed, if veiled, message from the grave about the apparent dearth of vision in the present, and it looks to the future.\u201cWe need a generation that sees leadership as a noble cause,\u201d he wrote in his epilogue, \u201cdefined not by personal ambition, but by morality and a call to service.\u201dMr. Peres recounts episodes he considered the milestones of a life \u201centwined with the birth and construction of Israel,\u201d as he put it. They are described in vivid detail and, in some cases, for the first time in his own words, and amount to a kind of ideological will and testament.\u201cHe knew that there is a certain amount of time he was given on earth,\u201d Nehemya Peres, Mr. Peres\u2019s younger son, who is known as Chemi, said in a recent interview at the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, the nongovernmental organization established by his father in Jaffa, on the Mediterranean shore.Mr. Peres completed work on the book in his final weeks, Chemi Peres said, using it as \u201chis last voice\u201d and as \u201ca call to dream, to dare, to be optimistic, to transition ourselves into a new era.\u201dMr. Peres sat and recorded the memoir in English to reach as wide an audience as possible, in the hope, his son said, of inspiring future leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs. Versions will also be published in Hebrew and French.Mr. Peres played a central role at critical junctures in his country\u2019s history. He helped build defense and weapons stocks and industry, salvaging the economy during the hyperinflation of the 1980s, championing Israel\u2019s high-tech industry and then turning his efforts to peace. The lessons running through the narrative of his memoir are to reach for the impossible and never give up.The book by no means offers a full accounting or reckoning. Mr. Peres simply does not grapple with the more contentious episodes.So Mr. Peres, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of David Ben-Gurion, Israel\u2019s first prime minister, describes his exploits procuring weapons for the 1948 war over Israel\u2019s creation, and says the distance between their offices was, for a time, \u201conly the width of a thin piece of plywood.\u201d But he makes no mention of the Palestinians who became refugees, or of the traumatic chapter of the Altalena, the ship organized by Mr. Ben-Gurion\u2019s right-wing rivals to bring fighters and weapons to Israel. It was shelled on Mr. Ben-Gurion\u2019s orders and sunk just off the coast.Nor does Mr. Peres relate his early support for Jewish settlement in the West Bank or his \u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d operation in Lebanon when he was prime minister in 1996, when Israeli artillery shells killed more than 100 Lebanese civilians sheltering in a United Nations compound.\u201cMy father was the greatest optimist on earth,\u201d Chemi Peres said. \u201cHe believed that the future was the only thing that mattered because the past cannot be changed.\u201d The book, he added, was not meant to settle disputes or disagreements.Some of Mr. Peres\u2019s most evocative descriptions are of his childhood in a wintry Polish shtetl, where he marveled over his first taste of a Jaffa orange, and of his voyage, at 11, with his mother and brother to what was then the British Mandate for Palestine in 1934. Arriving on a steamship at the port of Jaffa, he recalls his tanned father, who had made the journey two years ahead of them, standing on a small Arab fishing boat in the sparkling waters, coming out to greet them.Growing up in the Zionist socialist youth movement, Mr. Peres found his political voice and began to emerge as a leader, even as he opted for a pioneering life as a shepherd on a spartan kibbutz, or communal farm, in the Galilee, called Alumot. His powers of persuasion and creative thinking were not lost on the leaders of the movement, and he was soon recruited into public service by Mr. Ben-Gurion.Mr. Peres describes how, when he was still in his 20s, Mr. Ben-Gurion tasked him with procuring an \u201cextensive shopping list of weapons\u201d when Israel had less than a week\u2019s worth of ammunition on the eve of the 1948 war. Faced with a Western arms embargo, Mr. Peres found a supplier in Czechoslovakia.After the war he moved to New York to complete his studies and buy weapons on the black market for Israel\u2019s fledgling armed forces. He went to meet dealers in Cuba at midday, only to find they had meant midnight, and bought two decommissioned British destroyers from Colombia, flying in to Cartagena to inspect them in a small plane whose left engine was on fire.In the early 1960s, in Washington on a mission to buy weapons from the United States government \u2014 this time legally \u2014 Mr. Peres was unexpectedly invited to meet President John F. Kennedy, who put him on the spot, inquiring about Israeli intentions regarding nuclear weapons. Mr. Peres formed a spontaneous and cryptic answer: \u201cMr. President, I can tell you most clearly that we shall not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons to the region.\u201dAnd that, he relates, was how Israel\u2019s policy of nuclear ambiguity was born. A powerful deterrent, it laid the foundations for peace with Arab nations, he says. \u201cBelieving that Israel had the power to destroy them, he writes, \u201cthey one by one abandoned their ambitions to destroy us.\u201dIn the final chapter Mr. Peres describes the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, an old rival who once described Mr. Peres as an \u201cindefatigable schemer\u201d for his political manipulations. When the shots rang out Mr. Peres was just yards from Mr. Rabin who, by the end, had become his close ally in the pursuit of peace with the Palestinians.That mission remained unfulfilled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michigan Gambled on Charter Schools. Its Children Lost.", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "The Education IssueFree-market boosters, including Betsy DeVos, promised that a radical expansion of charter schools would fix the stark inequalities in the state\u2019s education system. The results in the classrooms are far more complicated.Supported bySylvia Brown lives in the suburbs now, but she still proudly calls herself a Parker, the local term for a Highland Park native. When Brown was a kid, she\u2019d tell people she lived in the capital of Detroit. Her father worked for the city, and her mother taught at the public elementary school. In high school, Brown played on the volleyball and tennis teams and won a scholarship her junior year to study abroad in Japan. She fretted about traveling such a long distance \u2014 she never expected the judges to pick a black girl from Highland Park \u2014 but her guidance counselor encouraged her not to be afraid to cross 8 Mile Road, the famous divide between city and suburbs.So when the offer came last summer to take a job as the superintendent of George Washington Carver Academy, a pre-K-8 charter school in Highland Park, Brown thrilled at the chance to come home. She also had no illusions about what she was signing up for. In 1992, Brown\u2019s sophomore year at Highland Park High, Chrysler\u2019s corporate headquarters decamped to exurban Auburn Hills, a departure that cost Highland Park a quarter of its tax base and 50 percent of its annual budget. Today the city is staring down the same problems as much of Detroit: crime, abandonment, disinvestment. (A local pastor once described Highland Park to me as \u201cDetroit writ small.\u201d) The public library closed in 2002. In 2011, the local power utility dug up two-thirds of the city\u2019s streetlights in response to $4 million of unpaid bills; the mayor-elect advised citizens to leave on their porch lights instead.A major victim of the city\u2019s borderline insolvency was its public-school system, which had been under state control since 2012. (Six different state-appointed emergency managers have run the district since then.) Plummeting enrollment, legacy costs and financial mismanagement had left the school system with a projected deficit of $10 million. The state\u2019s solution that year was to \u201ccharterize\u201d the entire district: void the teacher\u2019s union contract, fire all employees and turn over control of the schools to a private, for-profit charter operator. But enrollment at Highland Park High continued to decline, so the state closed the school in 2015. Highland Park now has no high school, either public or charter. Families send their children to high schools in Detroit or the suburbs, where they have no electoral influence over local officials or school boards.The Carver Academy sits a block from the defunct Model T plant, now used primarily as a storage facility. The school building is an old Farmer Jack grocery store that has been converted into classrooms, with an added wing and a handful of trailers. On my first visit, in January, I met with Brown in her office. She had curly hair and a casually stylish work look: black skirt, matching sweater, pearls on her wrists and neck. Brown had been having a rough couple of weeks. Only a few days earlier, Michigan\u2019s Department of Education released its annual Top-to-Bottom List of every school in the state, and Carver wound up in the lowest fifth percentile. Brown wasn\u2019t surprised by the ranking: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I was hoodwinked and thought I was coming into a top-performing school,\u201d she said. But she also bristled at the \u201cscarlet letter\u201d Carver, and by extension its students, had been branded with. The Top-to-Bottom List, she pointed out, largely reflects the results of a single standardized test, the Michigan Student Test of Educational Progress (M-STEP), and the latest rankings are based on testing data from the two years before she arrived.Even setting aside standardized test scores, which are debatable as measures of \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure,\u201d Carver probably isn\u2019t the sort of institution where most school-choice proponents would send their own children. In past years, headlines involving Carver included a 2008 cheating scandal (in which teachers were caught improperly coaching fourth and fifth graders on the answers to standardized tests) and a 2011 felony embezzlement conviction (of the school\u2019s treasurer, who used $25,000 earmarked for textbooks to buy herself a house). Today, the school still lacks needed funds. The roof leaks: On rainy days, buckets are placed in classrooms and teachers cover their electronic blackboards with garbage bags so they don\u2019t short-circuit. At various points during the winter, children had to be moved to different wings of the building when the heat in their homerooms died. Security doors and cameras need replacing. The neighborhood isn\u2019t safe: After a man in an overgrown lot tried to grab a student on her way to school one morning, parents began their own patrols, flashing headlights at kids to let them know everything was O.K.Charter proponents will point out, correctly, that you could work up a similar indictment of any number of public schools in struggling cities like Detroit. But in theory, at least, public-school districts have superintendents tasked with evaluating teachers and facilities. Carver, on the other hand, is accountable to more ambiguous entities \u2014 like, for example, Oak Ridge Financial, the Minnesota-based financial-services firm that sent a team of former educators to visit the school. They had come not in service of the children but on behalf of shareholders expecting a thorough vetting of a long-term investment: Brown was in negotiations with Oak Ridge about refinancing the school\u2019s debt in order to make much-needed repairs, and the firm was performing the sort of oversight normally handled by a school district. Michigan schools remaining in the bottom fifth percentile for three years running must close, which, in the case of Carver, would leave Oak Ridge on the hook for a 13-year loan.The crisis at Carver Academy was not unfolding in isolation. Michigan\u2019s aggressively free-market approach to schools has resulted in one of the most deregulated educational environments in the country, a laboratory in which consumer choice and a shifting landscape of supply and demand (and profit motive, in the case of many charters) were pitched as ways to improve life in the classroom for the state\u2019s 1.5 million public-school students. But a Brookings Institution analysis done this year of national test scores ranked Michigan last among all states when it came to improvements in student proficiency. And a 2016 analysis by the Education Trust-Midwest, a nonpartisan education policy and research organization, found that 70 percent of Michigan charters were in the bottom half of the state\u2019s rankings. Michigan has the most for-profit charter schools in the country and some of the least state oversight. Even staunch charter advocates have blanched at the Michigan model.The story of Carver is the story of Michigan\u2019s grand educational experiment writ small. It spans more than two decades, three governors and, now, the United States Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, whose relentless advocacy for unchecked \u201cschool choice\u201d in her home state might soon, her critics fear, be going national. But it\u2019s important to understand that what happened to Michigan\u2019s schools isn\u2019t solely, or even primarily, an education story: It\u2019s a business story. Today in Michigan, hundreds of nonprofit public charters have become potential financial assets to outside entities, inevitably complicating their broader social missions. In the case of Carver, interested parties have included a for-profit educational management organization, or E.M.O., in Georgia; an Indian tribe in a remote section of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula; and a financial firm in Minnesota. \u201cThat\u2019s all it is now \u2014 it\u2019s moneymaking,\u201d Darrel Redrick, a charter-school proponent and an administrator at Carver at the time I visited, told me.Redrick can pinpoint the precise moment he experienced this revelation: \u201cOne of my former principals \u2014 this is like 10 years ago, at another school \u2014 he said: \u2018Redrick, I can tell you why we don\u2019t kick kids out. This child right here represents $6,700.\u2019\u2009\u201d The principal was referring to the per-pupil state funding at the time. \u201cAnd if you put out 10 kids, Red,\u201d the principal went on, \u201cthat\u2019s about $70,000. And where are we going to get that money?\u201dTo understand Michigan\u2019s educational system, it\u2019s crucial to consider the decades-long ideological battle waged by groups like the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. In 2013, the Michigan-based conservative think tank released a celebratory analysis of the privatization of the Highland Park school system, noting that charterizing an entire district was \u201cunprecedented at the time.\u201d A 13-minute video released with the report, titled \u201cThe Highland Park Transformation,\u201d opened with slow-panning, verit\u00e9-horror-film footage of derelict public school buildings, including a shot of a filthy toilet. Bill Coats, chief executive of Leona Group, the for-profit charter operator that took over the district, told the filmmakers that Highland Park\u2019s public schools \u201chad the resources, all right? They just blew them.\u201dOver the last 30 years, the Mackinac Center, which was founded in 1987 by, among others, John Engler, a Republican state senator, has become a model for state-level conservative policy shops around the country. When Engler was elected governor in 1990, the intellectual foundation of his signature policy issue \u2014 education reform \u2014 came via a Mackinac Center white paper that pushed school choice as a means of breaking up the \u201cbureaucratic monopoly\u201d of a public-education system smothering risk-taking and entrepreneurial moxie. The author of the study, Lawrence W. Reed \u2014 then the center\u2019s president \u2014 argued that it was time \u201cto put our faith in the virtues that made America great in all areas where they have been tried: competition, private initiative and, of course, consumer choice.\u201d He cited private-school vouchers as a possible model and also gave a nod to an experiment taking place in Minnesota, where they were testing \u201cindependently run public schools, known as \u2018chartered schools.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe Minnesota charter experiment, which began with two schools in 1992, quickly spread to other states \u2014 first California and then, in 1994, to Michigan, at Engler\u2019s behest. The Soviet Union had just collapsed, and a triumphalist faith in the free market was bleeding into spheres like education. Engler referred to Michigan\u2019s public-school system as an \u201ceducational gulag,\u201d and during a 1993 speech in which he pitched state legislators on the idea of charters, he hoisted a sawed-off 20-gauge shotgun as a prop. (The weapon, he said, had been confiscated from a student.) A year later, in his State of the State address, Engler celebrated the passage of \u201cthe nation\u2019s most far-reaching charter-school legislation,\u201d predicting a \u201crenaissance.\u201dBetsy DeVos, a wealthy, deeply religious conservative willing to spend millions of dollars lobbying for a radical redefinition of public education, and her husband, Dick, the heir to the Amway fortune, provided significant financial backing to the Mackinac Center, as well as to pro-charter lobbying groups like Teach Michigan and their own Great Lakes Education Project. To further set the stage for school choice, Engler backed a 1994 ballot measure described that year by The New York Times as \u201cthe nation\u2019s most dramatic shift in a century in the way public schools are financed\u201d: Rather than funding local schools based on property taxes, Michigan would shift to a per-pupil funding model, in which the money would come from state sales taxes. Each district would receive a baseline amount of $4,200 per student, which would rise over time; districts already spending more money per student \u2014 like the wealthy Detroit suburb Bloomfield Hills, which spent $10,400 per student \u2014 would not be subject to cuts, and municipalities could still supplement the state money with bonds and local taxes.In theory, poorer districts with lower property-tax bases would ultimately benefit, but per-pupil spending increases, bound to the economy of a state facing its own fiscal challenges, were lagging and inconsistent, and the gap between rich and poor districts never closed. A 2016 review commissioned by the National Education Policy Center found that Michigan\u2019s per-pupil spending, compared with that of neighboring Midwestern states, had fallen \u201cfrom the middle of the pack to near the bottom.\u201d To Gary Miron, a professor in the College of Education and Human Development at Western Michigan University who has long studied the state\u2019s charter movement, per-pupil funding represented a \u201clong game,\u201d a means of paying lip service to greater equality while creating \u201ca more efficient, market-oriented system where money follows students.\u201dThe lack of regulation had the desired effect: Michigan became a boom state for a growing new education sector. By 2000, Michigan had 184 charter schools, by Miron\u2019s count, more than any state but Arizona and California. In a 2002 book that Miron wrote with Christopher Nelson called \u201cWhat\u2019s Public About Charter Schools?\u201d the authors consider two different charter models deployed by states: competitive and collaborative. While the collaborative approach encouraged the public and private sectors to \u201cshare innovations,\u201d Michigan favored the other approach: \u201cEngler wanted to lift public schools,\u201d Miron told me, \u201cbut he believed in getting as much competition as quickly as possible. It became the Wild West state: Push, push, push.\u201d While other states \u2014 Miron cited Ohio, Texas and Arizona \u2014 also emerged as exemplars of the \u201ccompetitive\u201d model, most have since reintroduced some regulation. \u201cMichigan is still an outlier,\u201d Miron said. \u201cNo state comes near us when it comes to privatization.\u201dThe results have been stark. The 2016 report by the Education Trust-Midwest noted:Michigan\u2019s K-12 system is among the weakest in the country and getting worse. In little more than a decade, Michigan has gone from being a fairly average state in elementary reading and math achievement to the bottom 10 states. It\u2019s a devastating fall. Indeed, new national assessment data suggest Michigan is witnessing systemic decline across the K-12 spectrum. White, black, brown, higher-income, low-income \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter who they are or where they live. ...Charters continue to be sold in Michigan as a means of unwinding the inequality of a public-school system in which districts across the state, overwhelmingly African-American \u2014 Detroit, Highland Park, Benton Harbor, Muskegon Heights, Flint \u2014 grapple with steep population declines, towering financial obligations, deindustrialization and the legacy of segregation. By allowing experimentation, proponents argue, and by breaking the power of teachers\u2019 unions, districts will somehow be able to innovate their way past the crushing underfunding that afflicts majority-minority school districts all around the country. In reality, however, a 2017 Stanford University analysis found that increasing charter-school enrollment in a school district does little to improve achievement gaps. And in unregulated educational sectors like Michigan\u2019s, there\u2019s evidence that charters have actually increased inequality: A 2015 working paper by the Education Policy Center determined that Michigan\u2019s school-choice policies \u201cpowerfully exacerbate the financial pressures of declining-enrollment districts\u201d \u2014 and districts with high levels of charter-school penetration, the authors found, have fared worst of all. Today, all but seven states have some version of a charter law, though few have adopted a model as extreme as Michigan\u2019s. Twenty-one states have a charter cap, 31 require charters to submit annual reports and 33 have statewide authorizing bodies. Michigan, abiding by none of those rules, has allowed 80 percent of its own charters to be operated by for-profit E.M.Os. Only 16 percent of charters nationwide are run by for-profit companies.Nationally, the pro-charter tent is large and unwieldy enough to include education-reform wonks, hedge-fund managers, billionaire philanthropists and politicians from both parties, and Trump\u2019s tapping of DeVos has placed the movement in a complex situation. Despite the policy ignorance displayed in her confirmation hearing, she\u2019s an ally, and one whose influence on the 2018 Trump administration budget is already evident: Amid huge cuts to overall education spending, there\u2019s a $517 million increase in funding for charters and private-school vouchers and an additional $1 billion worth of grants set aside for local districts willing to implement \u201copen enrollment\u201d programs (allowing students to attend any area public schools, charters included, and take allotted state and federal funds with them). Eighteen Republican governors sent the Senate\u2019s education committee a letter in strong support of DeVos and what they called her promise to \u201cstreamline the federal education bureaucracy\u201d and \u201creturn authority back to state and local school boards.\u201dBut even many charter proponents are troubled by the Michigan model that DeVos had such a crucial role in creating. In a column in Education Week published in March, Greg Richmond, the president of the National Association of Charter School Authorizers, corrected \u201cfriends and neighbors\u201d who assumed he must be happy about the new education secretary, explaining that he rejected a \u201cfree-market approach to charter schooling\u201d that \u201cembraces the principles of choice and autonomy while gutting accountability\u201d and insisting that \u201ctrue supporters of charter schools will not abide by this co-optation of what it means to be a charter school.\u201d With DeVos and her ideas ascendant in Washington, Michigan has become a symbol \u2014 and, for some, a cautionary tale \u2014 of a movement gone astray.Before Carver Academy could move ahead on the loan refinancing, the school had to obtain permission from its \u201cauthorizer,\u201d Bay Mills Community College. Perhaps the most startling feature of Michigan\u2019s system is its lack of centralized oversight. In most of the country, state governments play some role in determining who can open charter schools and monitor their progress. But Engler ceded nearly all control to dozens of groups throughout Michigan \u2014 universities and community colleges, as well as existing public-school districts \u2014 granting them the power to approve the charters of would-be schools and act as sole oversight bodies. A result has been an inconsistently regulated glut of schools, all fighting over the same pool of students and money, a situation that the authorizers, which receive up to 3 percent of their schools\u2019 per-pupil funding, have little incentive to rein in.There are no geographical rules governing authorizers and their schools, and inconveniently for Sylvia Brown, the campus of B.M.C.C. is 338 miles north of Highland Park, on the shore of Lake Superior. Her appearance in February before the Board of Regents involved a flight to Marquette and a morning drive through a white-out blizzard. More stressful than her journey, though, was the unwelcome news that Carver\u2019s low ranking on the Top-to-Bottom List had prompted Oak Ridge Financial to temporarily rescind the refinancing offer. The bank ultimately reconsidered, but it hadn\u2019t left Brown and her team much time to prepare for the presentation.B.M.C.C. is owned and operated by the Bay Mills Indian Community, an Ojibwa tribe with over 2,000 members and 5.5 square miles of reservation land. For years, Indians living on the reservation attended public school in the nearby town of Brimley, but they had a high dropout rate and often felt discriminated against. Bryan Newland, a board member and tribal judge who graduated from Brimley High School in 1999, told me: \u201cI remember in world-history class \u2014 this is a very vivid memory \u2014 our textbook was divided up into units, and we skipped over \u2018The Americas Before 1492.\u2019 And I raised my hand and asked the teacher, \u2018Why are we not studying this unit?\u2019 And the teacher said, \u2018We\u2019re only studying the things that matter to world history.\u2019\u2009\u201d In 2003, the tribe started its own K-8 charter, which would offer classes devoted to Ojibwa language and culture. In addition to serving as authorizer for the tribal school, Bay Mills Community College began authorizing other schools around the state. Today, with 42 schools in locations as far-flung as Flint, Benton Harbor and Detroit, B.M.C.C. is the third-largest charter authorizer in Michigan.The board meeting took place in a gray-carpeted classroom with a portrait of Chief Pontiac hanging on the wall. Brown looked anxious as she stood before the 12 board members, seated behind long tables, and talked about the importance of Carver to the children of Highland Park. \u201cWe provide breakfast, lunch and dinner for our students,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re not in session, we\u2019re often sending them to a worse environment.\u201d The refinancing would lower monthly debt payments, she noted, freeing up an extra $63,000 a year to spend on the kids.The B.M.C.C. president, Mickey Parish, nodded sympathetically as Brown spoke. A jowly, avuncular presence, Parish was the first member of the tribe, 37 years earlier, to earn a law degree. He told Brown the charter office would have to look over the school\u2019s test scores and financials before making a decision. He also asked about Carver\u2019s maximum occupancy. Brown said 650. The school currently had about 550 students, but the other K-8 in Highland Park had only one year left in its contract, and if the school closed, enrollment at Carver would likely increase. \u201cHighland Parkers are loyal,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey\u2019ll come to us.\u201dAt Michigan\u2019s current funding level, roughly $7,600 per pupil, 100 extra students would translate to $763,000. An authorizer\u2019s 3 percent cut of its schools\u2019 per-pupil state funding can add up to millions of dollars, if it approves large schools, and enough of them. Keeping the schools open, even if they\u2019re low-performing, can become a temptation, Miron told me. He found authorizers rarely closed schools in Michigan \u2014 typically, only if the school had \u201cbeen shamed by the media.\u201dAt the B.M.C.C. board meeting, two other struggling downstate charters were unanimously reauthorized. The first, the Academy of Warren, sits on a grim stretch of 8 Mile Road, in a largely abandoned strip mall. The school occupies a row of run-down, contiguous storefronts. Little effort has been made to brighten up the exterior of the buildings or landscape the oceanic, mostly empty parking lot. I found it difficult to picture an environment more aesthetically at odds, at least externally, with its supposed goal of nurturing children.And yet for years now, Detroit parents have been fleeing across 8 Mile to suburbs like Warren, in order to get their children out of the free-falling Detroit public-schools district. Michigan already had an open enrollment program that allowed schools with empty seats to accept students from other districts. It\u2019s no small oddity that formerly lily-white suburbs built on racist housing policies \u2014 as recently as the 1990 census, Warren was 96 percent white \u2014 now had schools openly courting black children from Detroit, because, like all school districts, they desperately needed those per-pupil dollars. (Much national focus has been placed on Detroit\u2019s declining population, but the state\u2019s overall population drop has also been reflected in suburbs like Warren, hence the pupil shortage.)The Academy of Warren was operated by a large, for-profit E.M.O. called CS Partners. Of the Academy\u2019s 646 students, 99 percent qualified for free or reduced breakfast and lunch; it had fallen into the bottom fifth percentile in 2014-15, but notched back up to the bottom sixth percentile last year. Parish, whose face had a resting look of concern, as if he\u2019d just received bad news via whisper, acknowledged the school \u201chas had a few difficulties.\u201d Still, he recommended that the board renew the charter for another four years. The charter-office staff \u201cthought four years would give us a chance to review them in the near future and make sure they move forward,\u201d Parish explained. Reading from the charter office\u2019s report, he noted the school \u201chad an end-of-year balance of over a million dollars, so from a financial standpoint, very stable. They own their facility.\u201dThe next charter, a K-7 called the Mildred C. Wells Academy, was located in Benton Harbor, a poor, predominantly African-American city in the southwestern corner of the state, about a seven-hour drive from Bay Mills. Parish offered a blunter assessment this time. The school\u2019s facilities, a pair of modular buildings, were \u201cvery poor,\u201d and the same went for student test scores, though Parish stressed the context: \u201cThe level of learning is comparable to that of the local public-school system, which is dismal. So ours is dismal.\u201d B.M.C.C.\u2019s curriculum specialist, Kathy Tassier, pointed to selective testing gains, and suggested that the students had been motivated to \u201creally take ownership for that growth\u201d after learning of another local charter\u2019s slated closure. Tassier meant the remark as a compliment. But inadvertently or not, she\u2019d applied the language of market capitalism, of increasing productivity via brutal Darwinist competition, to a group of K-7 students. They could have been assembly-line workers being warned that the factory would close if the Chinese kept eating their lunch. The board voted to renew the charter for another four years \u2014 again, unanimously, and with minimal debate.After the meeting, when I spoke with Parish alone, he acknowledged that the 3 percent fee, beyond covering charter-office expenses, \u201cdoes provide a little bit of extra money to help our college activities.\u201d But he said that he had no interest in expanding the charter office to maximize profit and that he thought there were too many charter schools in Detroit.When I later spoke to Newland, pointing out the cultural and geographical chasm between B.M.C.C. and the downstate, urban neighborhoods so many of their charters served, he shot back that Indians knew poverty as well anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a different stage for the same play,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think we understand it very well.\u201d Were he \u201cdesigning an education system from scratch,\u201d Newland continued, he\u2019d make funding levels the same for every district and pay teachers \u201clike the white-collar professionals that they are.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t, so he supported charter schools. Unlike Parish, Newland was willing to discuss DeVos. \u201cI learned at a relatively young age not to ascribe malice to people as a motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think when she says, \u2018I care about having our kids learn,\u2019 I believe that.\u201d But, Newland went on: \u201cShe didn\u2019t go to public school. Her kids didn\u2019t go. My guess is she doesn\u2019t hang out with a lot of people who know what it\u2019s like going to a school with 50 percent people of color. And I haven\u2019t seen evidence that she\u2019s taken the time to learn.\u201dWhen Brown took over at Carver Academy, one of the many problems she inherited was enormous real estate debt. The problem is not uncommon: Michigan does not mandate that its charter schools buy or lease property at fair-market prices, resulting \u2014 predictably \u2014 in wildly inflated real estate spending. In Carver\u2019s case, the situation was especially frustrating because the debt was a legacy from yet another for-profit entity. Though the school was founded in 1999 by Birdlene Esselman, a beloved local educator (she was Brown\u2019s elementary-school principal), it contracted with a for-profit E.M.O. called Mosaica Education. After only a year of operation, Carver, still run by Mosaica, signed a mortgage agreement to buy and upgrade the school property for $7.1 million \u2014 the loan Brown found herself facing down 17 years later.When she began talks with Scott VanderWerp, who runs the public-finance group at Oak Ridge Financial, Brown mainly hoped to lower the school\u2019s annual interest payments. But VanderWerp told her to write up a wish list of capital improvements. After he performed a refinancing analysis on Carver\u2019s outstanding debt, he told her he could deliver nearly $900,000 in savings over the remaining 13 years of the 30-year loan. A team of educators and financial auditors contracted by Oak Ridge made a two-day visit to the school and, in Brown\u2019s words, \u201cattacked the building,\u201d observing classrooms and interviewing everyone: teachers, administrators, security guards. Three weeks later they returned and did it again, analyzing strengths and weaknesses to determine, Brown said, \u201cif we are an investment that is going to make it or not.\u201dBefore joining Oak Ridge in 2015, VanderWerp spent nearly three decades in the bond market, often trading riskier, high-yield credits, and became an expert in municipal debt. \u201cOur basic function is to find funding solutions for public and charter schools, private schools, small community hospitals, not-for-profit senior living facilities,\u201d VanderWerp told me. In the 2015-16 fiscal year, he said, Oak Ridge was the No. 1 issuer, by total schools, of charter-school debt in Michigan.Carver\u2019s debt made no sense to VanderWerp: $6.5 million of debt on a building that\u2019s surrounded by public-housing complexes, in a place where 49 percent of people live under the poverty rate. \u201cThe crime rates are high, there are vacant buildings everywhere,\u201d VanderWerp said. \u201cI think you\u2019d readily agree that that building and land isn\u2019t worth $5- or $6 million. Quite candidly, it\u2019s probably worth $500,000 or $600,000.\u201d He said charters often entered bad deals because authorizers and school boards, which must approve loans, lacked a basic understanding of bond finance. \u201cThe vast majority of Michigan authorizers don\u2019t have anybody in-house who understands bond financing or researches it, even to the point of becoming a novice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in my experience, they rarely say no.\u201d (Carver\u2019s authorizer was Central Michigan University at the time of the building purchase.)At the same time, banks and hedge funds, Miron told me, profit greatly from the charter sector, thanks to large tax breaks dating back to the Clinton presidency that benefit investors in schools located in struggling \u201crenewal communities.\u201d And with so many eager lenders and bond underwriters lined up, E.M.O.s realized they, in turn, could make money from one of the largest expenses charter schools face. \u201cA bunch of them thought, Wow, I can start a real estate division!\u201d VanderWerp said. \u201cWe\u2019ve run into this all over the place\u201d: E.M.O.s buy buildings \u201cfor a couple hundred thousand bucks, lease them to the school for a couple of years and then sell them\u201d to the school \u201cfor a few million.\u201d In Michigan, 80 percent of charters are currently operated by for-profit E.M.O.s. The state\u2019s largest E.M.O., the Grand Rapids-based National Heritage Academies, operates 84 charters in nine states and has been criticized for charging wildly above-market annual rents to its schools: A Detroit Free Press investigation found that 14 National Heritage schools in Michigan pay the company $1 million or more.VanderWerp is pro-charter school: \u201cI love to see people compete to teach kids and shake up the norm,\u201d he says. But he finds the Michigan model deeply flawed. In Minnesota, he points out, a school must wait five years before purchasing a building, in order to demonstrate a proven track record. Michigan has no such rule, which was why Carver was able to purchase its building after a single year of operation. According to a 2015 study, Michigan was the state leader in charter-school bond defaults, responsible for more than a third of the nationwide total. In his own practice, VanderWerp makes sure the buildings being financed have intrinsic value, so they can be converted into offices or apartments if the charter school fails. \u201cIt\u2019s a real estate investment,\u201d he says, not \u201can investment in a business that has to stay afloat to pay a real estate loan.\u201dFor many students in Detroit, this unruly new education sector has made the vaunted ideal of \u201cchoice\u201d a question of least-bad options. One afternoon, I had coffee with Aleka Simmons, a senior at the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy, a Detroit charter school, and her mother, Caprice. Aleka had attended another charter, the University Yes Academy, since middle school. Her freshman year, she told me, U.Y.A. expanded to include kindergarten through sixth grade, but the building wasn\u2019t big enough to house all of the students. The school buses became so crowded, six kids would squeeze onto a seat. (Aleka posted photos online, and it became a local news story.) For part of her junior year, all 11th-grade classes were held off-campus, in the basement of Detroit\u2019s African-American history museum, \u201cone big room with wall dividers,\u201d she said. The school explained the move as a \u201cmulticultural experience,\u201d Caprice said, but she was convinced \u201cit was really just a space issue.\u201d And then the academy\u2019s high school abruptly closed in August 2016, less than a month before the start of Aleka\u2019s senior year. She and her classmates all had to scramble to find new schools. Aleka had made a couple of friends at Jalen Rose, but at U.Y.A., she said, \u201cI had three best friends \u2014 we all had 4.0 G.P.A.s, and we were always together \u2014 and we all wound up at different schools. We thought we\u2019d be going to prom together, but now we have a hard time even seeing each other.\u201dSince 2002, K-12 student enrollment has dropped by 214,000 in Michigan, but the number of charter schools has doubled. In 2011, state lawmakers abolished the longstanding charter-school cap, a project DeVos\u2019s Great Lakes Education Project strongly backed. So many new schools have opened in Detroit that there are an estimated 30,000 empty seats in the district.Last year, State Senator Goeff Hansen, a Republican from the tiny city of Hart, tried to rein things in. Setting his sights on Detroit, Hansen sponsored a bipartisan bill that would have increased oversight of charters in the city, creating a seven-member Detroit Education Commission with mayoral appointees and a mandate to determine where new charter schools could open and whether existing schools would expand or be closed. The bill passed the Senate with the support of Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, and Detroit\u2019s Democratic mayor, Mike Duggan, but it was derailed in the 11th hour by Republicans in the State Legislature \u2014 thanks, in large part, to the lobbying efforts of the DeVos family, which, The Detroit Free Press reports, showered the state Republican Party with \u201cnear-unprecedented amounts of money\u201d during the campaign cycle. Hansen, in a teary speech on the Senate floor, denounced the gutted version of the bill that eventually passed. \u201cThis was a just and honest cause,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWhy should Detroit children accept less than what other children across the state are willing to accept?\u201dThroughout Michigan, though, the experiment goes on. The latest trend, virtual charter schools, could prove particularly lucrative for operators, who receive the same per-pupil funding as physical schools, but operate entirely online. The Michigan Virtual Charter Academy in Grand Rapids, the largest such school in the state, has over 2,800 students and is operated by a for-profit charter operator based in Virginia called K12 Inc. In a 2013 presentation, the hedge-fund operator and staunch charter proponent Whitney Tilson blasted K12\u2019s \u201cdismal academic results\u201d and \u201csky-high dropout rates\u201d (in some cases more than 50 percent annually), and described the publicly traded company as his \u201clargest short position.\u201d In 2010-11, only 27 percent of K12 schools met national Adequate Yearly Progress measures, versus roughly 52 percent of public schools overall. (Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut pointed out during DeVos\u2019s confirmation hearing that her family had invested in K12.) But after only three years of a pilot program in which the results were, in Miron\u2019s words, \u201cjust terrible across the board,\u201d the Michigan Legislature voted to gradually lift the cap on virtual charter schools.\u201cThese are the most vulnerable students we have,\u201d Miron said, referring to the students of Detroit. \u201cWhy do we experiment on them? If this is such a good idea, why aren\u2019t we doing it in West Bloomfield? There has been more than a decade of experimenting on these kids, and we\u2019ve seen nothing that works.\u201dKids sat at desk-clusters of four, wearing neat uniforms (powder blue shirts, navy blue pants or dresses) and appearing alert and engaged. Though the covers of their textbooks featured the hands of a dozen or so children stacked together in a multiracial huddle, all 17 of the girls and boys in Borden-Davis\u2019s classroom were black. Today\u2019s lesson centered on the conceptual distinction between \u201cwants\u201d and \u201cneeds.\u201dPacing at the front of the room, Borden-Davis began, \u201cWe know that \u2018needs\u2019 are things we need in order to ... what?\u201d\u201cLive!\u201d the first graders shouted.\u201cGood,\u201d Borden-Davis said. \u201cWho can name a need for me? Julian?\u201d\u201cWater?\u201d Julian offered.\u201cWater is a need,\u201d Borden-Davis said. \u201cMaleah?\u201d\u201cAir!\u201d Maleah cried.\u201cGood. Who can name another need?\u201d\u201cTV?\u201d another boy asked.\u201cNo, you don\u2019t need TV in order to live,\u201d Borden-Davis said.\u201cThat\u2019s a want,\u201d someone else chided.Borden-Davis shot the know-it-all a look. Then she elicited a few other suggestions \u2014 \u201cshelter,\u201d \u201cfood,\u201d \u201cclothes\u201d \u2014 before shifting the discussion to wants.\u201cI\u2019d like a cat,\u201d one girl said.\u201cO.K., give me another want.\u201dThe children cried out: \u201cA toy!\u201d \u201cA doll!\u201d \u201cCookies!\u201dNobody said \u201cschool.\u201d But it\u2019s an intriguing question: How would you classify free, high-quality primary and secondary education to a roomful of first graders? Want or need?When I went back to the superintendent\u2019s office, Brown was stewing about the all-important state M-STEP exam, only 27 school days away, the results of which would determine Carver\u2019s placement on the following year\u2019s Top-to-Bottom List. And then, right after the M-STEP, came the Measures of Academic Progress test administered three times a year to gauge whether students were improving throughout the course of a school year. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it, these kids are getting double-tested,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re spending every minute on instruction.\u201dShe sighed. Bay Mills had approved the refinancing plan, and Oak Ridge Financial\u2019s board was scheduled to finalize its decision shortly. Another disastrous set of M-STEP scores wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean the end for Carver, but it would most likely mark the beginning of a death spiral, as parents and teachers, not to mention financial partners like Oak Ridge, picked up on a gathering sense of failure. Brown believed her reforms were already working, but she also understood that they wouldn\u2019t necessarily carry over into a single standardized testing day.After college, Brown spent eight years as the director of a Detroit welfare-to-work program. Most of her clients had never received a high school diploma. \u201cAnd then I realized, I\u2019m on the wrong end of this,\u201d Brown said. She went back to school for a master\u2019s in education and began working at a charter school in Oak Park, a Detroit suburb. She had no real opinion of charters at the time, aside from having heard that they paid less. She planned to move to a public school after gaining a couple of years of experience.But soon, Brown had been won over. Charters, she told me, had less bureaucracy, more freedom to experiment. At Carver, Brown had started an intervention program for at-risk students, brought a reading specialist on board, reinstated art classes. She readily acknowledged the problems with for-profit E.M.O.s. The glut of schools in Michigan had also contributed to a teacher shortage, Brown said, making lower-salaried, nonunionized charter school jobs a tougher sell. Just a week before the start of the school year, one of Brown\u2019s science teachers quit unexpectedly, and she\u2019d been unable to find a replacement. When I visited, the classes were still being taught by a substitute, an engineer with little teaching experience, so Brown had also contracted with a private company called High Touch High Tech to provide hands-on science lessons.Brown told me she believed that there should be a cap on the number of charters in Michigan, that the unlimited growth had \u201ccreated a war, an enrollment war, over the last 10 years\u201d and that it had been destructive. \u201cWe\u2019re just trading kids,\u201d she said. When I asked Brown her thoughts on DeVos, she said the secretary\u2019s confirmation hearings had raised concerns about her level of understanding. Nonetheless, she appreciated DeVos\u2019s support of charters and hoped she would push for increased funding. Brown\u2019s own children attended public school in West Bloomfield, the affluent Detroit suburb where she and her husband had settled. (Her husband, also an educator, taught at a well-funded public school in Ann Arbor.) At her daughter\u2019s orientation, Brown met teachers who had been at the school for 20 years. She said she\u2019d love to have the financial ability to retain teachers like that.On my last visit to Carver, though, Brown said the school board had voted, just the night before, to hold off on refinancing the loan. The board\u2019s lawyer had looked at the terms being offered by Oak Ridge Financial and hadn\u2019t liked the fine print, and Oak Ridge\u2019s people \u201cweren\u2019t happy we were asking questions,\u201d Brown said. (Oak Ridge says that the school wasn\u2019t willing to meet the terms set by the team of experts.) She shrugged. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to shop around.\u201dIn the meantime, she would gut her budget, cutting popular but unnecessary expenses, like field trips and sports uniforms, in order to cover the repairs, pay for new computers, hire social workers and reading and math specialists. It wasn\u2019t easy, but the school was moving forward, Brown told me a few months later. The roof couldn\u2019t wait.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of an organization.

{"Headline": "How Local Housing Regulations Smother the U.S. Economy", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsIf you live in a coastal city like New York, Boston or San Francisco, you know that the cost of housing has skyrocketed. This housing crisis did not happen by chance: Increasingly restrictive land-use regulations in the last half-century contributed to it.But what appears to be several local housing crises is actually a much more alarming national crisis: Land-use restrictions are a significant drag on economic growth in the United States.The creeping web of these regulations has smothered wage and gross domestic product growth in American cities by a stunning 50 percent over the past 50 years. Without these regulations, our research shows, the United States economy today would be 9 percent bigger \u2014 which would mean, for the average American worker, an additional $6,775 in annual income.For most of the 20th century, workers moved to areas where new industries and opportunities were emerging. This was the locomotive behind American prosperity. Agricultural workers moved from the countryside to booming cities like Pittsburgh and Detroit. In the Great Migration, some six million African-Americans left the South for manufacturing jobs in cities like Chicago and Buffalo.What allowed this relocation to places with good-paying jobs that lifted the standard of living for families? Affordable housing.Today, this locomotive of prosperity has broken down. Finance and high-tech companies in cities like New York, Boston, Seattle and San Francisco find it difficult to hire because of the high cost of housing. When an unemployed worker in Detroit today finds a well-paying job in San Francisco, she often cannot afford the cost of housing there.New housing construction in America\u2019s most dynamic cities faces growing regulatory costs, delays and enormous opposition from neighboring homeowners. Since the 1970s, a property-rights revolution \u2014 what critics call Nimbyism, from \u201cnot in my back yard\u201d \u2014 has significantly reduced the development of new housing stock, especially in cities where the economy is strongest.And once a project is approved, it faces an endless series of appeals and lawsuits that can add years of delay. Appeals are remarkably easy and affordable to file and can be done anonymously. This basically gives every neighbor a veto over every new project, regardless of how desirable the project might be. It\u2019s as if BlackBerry had veto power over whether Apple should be allowed to sell a new iPhone.To make things worse, well-intentioned regulations are often used by neighborhood groups to further delay projects. The California Environmental Quality Act, for example, was written to protect green areas from pollution and degradation from large industrial projects, like new refineries or power plants. Its main effect today is making urban housing more expensive. It has added millions of dollars of extra costs to a sorely needed high-rise on an empty parking lot on Market Street in downtown San Francisco.The Bay Area\u2019s hills, beaches and parks are part of the area\u2019s attractions, but there is enough underused land within its urban core that the number of housing units could be greatly increased without any harm to those natural amenities. To be clear, we are not advocating unconstrained suburban sprawl like Houston\u2019s, with all its negative environmental consequences. We are talking about building on existing parking lots or on lots with single-story buildings near transit, not in Golden Gate Park.Because of the prohibitive cost of housing caused by these regulations, innovative companies in Silicon Valley and Boston do not grow as much as they could, and new businesses do not get created. This means slower economic growth, fewer jobs and lower wages across the nation.Housing constraints also highlight the critical importance of investing in regional networks of public transportation that link high-paying job markets to areas with lower-cost housing. For example, the high-speed train under construction in California will connect cities in the Central Valley \u2014 Sacramento, Modesto, Fresno, Bakersfield \u2014 to high-wage jobs in the Bay Area. This will allow the number of workers benefiting from the strong San Francisco economy to increase overnight without changing the Bay Area\u2019s existing housing supply.The benefits of these investments are apparent in other countries. The metropolitan areas of London and Tokyo are illustrative: The cities\u2019 housing costs are significantly above the British and Japanese averages, but thanks to public transportation networks, workers have access to their remarkable economic dynamism. In fact, the economies of Britain and Japan are significantly larger because of the transportation network.There is a lot of debate in Washington about the costs of regulations for economic growth. Exclusionary land-use regulations in our most dynamic labor markets impose demonstrable high costs on our nation\u2019s economic well-being.Reforming these regulations through smart growth policies is a policy that should appeal to both Democrats and Republicans. The primary beneficiaries would be America\u2019s middle-class workers.Chang-Tai Hsieh is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

The net effectiveness of global institutions is being challenged because they are not delivering the goods. Look at the U.N.

The other big achievement is the Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 Agenda 2030. I do not see any hope of the current U.N. machinery in the way it\u2019s structured, or the way in which nation states are providing it with political and financial support, to deliver on Agenda 2030. It is a ticking time bomb for the legitimacy of the U.N. system if the Sustainable Development Goals are not delivered. States increasingly perceive the U.N. as ineffective. What I worry about is death by a thousand cuts to the U.N. Unless we radically turn this around, you will see it slowly drift to occupying the margins of global irrelevance.

If we don\u2019t do it ourselves, then there should probably be ways in which we are forced to do that through entities and constituencies that would push us in that direction. President of Robert F.

All of Eastern Europe was under Communism. And today, there\u2019s not a Communist government left. South Africa was under the height of apartheid, and South Africa has had a series of freely elected governments elected by a majority of its people. Women\u2019s rights was not on the international agenda. Today, the women\u2019s rights convention has been ratified by 183 countries. All those changes happened not because governments wanted them to, but because small groups of determined people harnessed the dream of freedom and made it come true.

But we should hold governments accountable. I think governments should be there in the debate. I think education is the key to many issues. It\u2019s about skills, jobs, values and human rights education. It\u2019s about democracy at the end of the day.

{"Headline": "Rape Accusations Against Italian Police Dismay Florence", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFLORENCE, Italy \u2014 As a group of American students studying abroad followed their professor on a field trip through an exquisite Renaissance palazzo, an Italian television reporter around the corner offered viewers a different kind of tour.In the apartment building where two of the students\u2019 classmates lived, he dramatically pointed to the elevator and staircase where, the two students say, two uniformed members of the country\u2019s iconic Carabinieri police force raped them in the predawn hours of Sept. 7.The students, whose names have not been released, told prosecutors they were drunk and were raped. But the officers said that the women were not intoxicated, and that the sex was consensual.The episode has especially touched nerves in a city where American students make up a tenth of the entire student population and help fuel the economy, but also can be seen, and heard, drinking on the streets. Many native Florentines are moving out of the city, and those who remain are increasingly bothered by the proliferation of people who are speaking English in Florence and disgusted by the drunken behavior on their streets.Here in Florence the accusations have instead generated cringeworthy media coverage and conversations about American students behaving badly, with Italian television news programs accompanying reports with supplemental footage of anonymous women walking in short leather skirts.And the thorny issues of victimhood, and where bad judgment ends and malice begins, have been eclipsed by the national disgust over the involvement of members of the Carabinieri, a police force that operates under the control of the Defense Ministry and is celebrated with collectible calendars and television dramas.\u201cOur fear is that from today, a foreign student who sees an officer in uniform might be worried,\u201d said Mayor Dario Nardella in an interview, adding that he was working with the American Consulate, scores of American universities and law enforcement agencies to make sure students had faith in the city\u2019s uniformed police officers after an \u201cunjustifiable\u201d breach. \u201cWe have to regain their trust,\u201d Mayor Nardella said.The mayor is desperate to avoid the sensationalism that inundated Perugia a decade ago during the long trial of Amanda Knox, an American college student accused, and ultimately exonerated, of murder. He said he had urged the Carabinieri commander to hire more women and instructed city lawyers to file a civil suit against the officers, whom he called \u201cdisgusting,\u201d primarily to ensure that the case moves as quickly as possible through the byzantine Italian judicial system.The provincial commander of the Carabinieri, Giuseppe De Liso, said in an interview that when he heard the news, he called the American consul right away. Disciplinary action was immediately taken against the two officers, he said, which could eventually result in their expulsion, an outcome the Italian Defense Minister, Roberta Pinotti, who oversees the Carabinieri, has all but said is a certainty.In his headquarters, a former convent, decorated with antique illustrations of Carabinieri uniforms throughout the centuries, Mr. De Liso said he needed to eradicate any suspicion of a cover-up and to restore the honor of his beloved police force.\u201cWe can\u2019t let those two officers smear 200 years of history,\u201d he said.Taken together, the accounts of local law-enforcement authorities, officials, lawyers for the Carabinieri officers and the women make for what many Italians have called an almost unimaginable scandal.The two women arrived in Florence at the end of August for a semester abroad from their university in New Jersey. On Sept. 6, they began drinking wine and limoncello at a popular piazza, or public square, where Italians sip on the steps of a church and Americans tend to guzzle in the bars.After midnight, they joined other Americans on a party bus up to the nightclub Flo\u2019, which sits atop another piazza on a hill overlooking the city.The Carabinieri command center sent three cars to the club in response to a customer\u2019s complaint. Two cars left shortly thereafter, but the officers in the third car \u2014 Marco Camuffo, 43, and Pietro Costa, 31 \u2014 remained.After 2 a.m., the officers tried to help the students call a cab, said Gabriele Zanobini, the lawyer for one of the students. When no cabs were available, the officers offered the women a ride home, breaking protocol by failing to notify their command that the students were in their vehicle.The car drove the switchback streets down to central Florence. Shortly after 3 a.m., a security camera recorded it turning toward the students\u2019 street. Mr. Zanobini said his client was so incapacitated that she could barely open the door. The two officers helped the students inside, where the alleged assault took place.\u201cShe had no idea what was happening,\u201d said Mr. Zanobini, who said his client was assaulted by Mr. Costa. \u201cAs soon as she got in the house she passed out from drinking. It\u2019s shameful, he took advantage of a person who was as if in a vegetative state.\u201dMr. Costa denied that accusation when interviewed by Florence prosecutors. On Thursday, Corriere della Sera, an Italian newspaper, reported that he told investigators that he simply followed his senior partner\u2019s lead. Mr. Costa\u2019s lawyer declined to comment.Cristina Menichetti, a defense lawyer for Mr. Camuffo, a father of three who had been transferred to Florence only weeks earlier, said her client denied that he took advantage of the student, who he insisted never seemed drunk.\u201cHe knows that he did something idiotic and that it has hurt his family,\u201d she said, adding that he had \u201cabsolutely not\u201d done anything similar before.Prosecutors said that both women had elevated blood alcohol levels, with one especially high, but that it would take time to determine their level of intoxication.About 20 minutes after the officers arrived at the students\u2019 building, another camera, this one opposite Ferragamo\u2019s Florence flagship store, recorded their car leaving the street. Upstairs, Mr. Zanobini said, the students entered their apartment and told their roommates what had happened. The students then called the police.The authorities said that as the women were taken to the hospital for DNA tests and other exams, the officers returned to duty as if nothing had happened, even meeting with the officers who also had responded to the call at the nightclub Flo\u2019 earlier that day.But even as Mayor Nardella organizes meetings with law enforcement agencies, university leaders and students, the party goes on.On Wednesday around midnight, bouncers at Flo\u2019 turned away an American girl for being visibly intoxicated. Minutes later, a packed bus similar to the one that brought the two American students to the club last week, stopped in front of a towering replica of Michelangelo\u2019s David. Students, many from Istituto Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, spilled out, boisterous and tipsy.\u201cGo with the flow!\u201d one young woman shouted.Outside the Istituto Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici earlier in the day, another student, Giselle Canko, 19, lamented that many classmates thought the city\u2019s noise and drinking ordinances \u201cdon\u2019t apply to them.\u201d\u201cThey think, well, my mother\u2019s not here!\u201d Ms. Canko said.As a result, Ms. Burns, the student from Boston, said: \u201cItalians have a really low opinion of Americans. They think we are stupid.\u201dStill, none of that behavior could possibly justify what had happened to her two classmates, she said. \u201cThe scariest part is I would have said yes to the ride, too,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to trust them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Deftly knifing a window through the tender pith, he inserts a straw and hands the fruit across the counter at Dinga-Fling, his roadside stall outside this drowsy coastal town. Selling coconuts is his livelihood, and Mr. Steele, 21, says it is a good one, though neither as promising, lucrative or downright implausible as his other.It was just over a year ago that Mr. Steele was scouted at his stall by a modeling agent, who detected in his whippet frame and chiseled cheeks the same potential that soon led him to sign an exclusive contract to walk in a fall 2017 runway show for Saint Laurent.Roughly 5,000 miles, and a universe, lie between Port Antonio and Paris.\u201cI never knew about modeling, I never thought about modeling or talked about it when they brought it to me that I have a nice style to be a model,\u201d said Mr. Steele, who on a busy day during high season here might earn 15,000 Jamaican dollars (or $115) selling coconuts. \u201cI always wanted to go on a plane and stuff. When they called me for Saint Laurent, my life just changed.\u201dAs it happens, \u201cchanging lives and expanding horizons\u201d is both the mission and the vaguely homiletic slogan of Saint International, a small, independent modeling agency in Kingston founded by Deiwght Peters close to two decades ago.When he started in the business, Mr. Peters told a reporter on a visit to Jamaica, even the concept of ethnic diversity in modeling was a long way off. And the beauty standards of the multibillion-dollar fashion industry clung stubbornly to a \u201ctraditional ideal of thin, white and young,\u201d as Jennifer Davidson, the editor in chief of the website The Fashion Spot, said.\u201cWhy would there be?\u201d James Scully, a seasoned casting agent, asked. \u201cFive years ago, the world wasn\u2019t even open enough to racial diversity for anyone to consider the thought.\u201dJust how radically that has changed can be seen in the steady stream of island models Mr. Peters found at coconut stands and other unlikely places and developed into nascent superstars in a market that has suddenly taken them into its embrace.Most notable of this new crop is probably Barbra-Lee Grant, a shy and leggy 22-year-old beauty who was working as a clerk when Mr. Peters first encountered her and who languished for a time at the agency until Mr. Peters encouraged her to grow her hair out in an Afro.\u201cWe then sent her digitals to Balenciaga,\u201d Mr. Peters said. \u201cAnd they immediately booked her for the 2017 campaign.\u201dThere is Brad Allen, a quiet 23-year-old from Kingston, who is currently starring in a Polo Ralph Lauren advertising campaign; and Jonny Brown, a 23-year-old whose hooded almond eyes peer out from behind a pair of tinted aviators in a new series of Topman ads; and the teenage Vivienne Westwood campaign models Shaun Holder and Tiffany Johnson; and the Saint Laurent campaign star Jenese Roper, whose soft features were toughened up when her hair was styled in a geometric Grace Jones fade; and the elegant catwalk specialists Naki Depass or Tami Williams, who at 19 is already a seasoned veteran of shows for Valentino, Dior and Chanel haute couture; and Kai Newman, a 19-year-old who is one of those beings with a beauty that seems to radiate from some deep inner source.Like Mr. Steele, Ms. Newman had no ambitions to become a model when she was spotted on the streets of Kingston on her way to the dentist.\u201cWe saw her walking with her mother, and we slammed on the brakes,\u201d Mr. Peters said. \u201cI said to her mother: \u2018Is that your daughter? Make sure you have her come in to see me. That\u2019s a star.\u2019 \u201dThe path to success was far from direct for Ms. Newman, who first misplaced Mr. Peters\u2019s business card and who, eventually sent for development by an affiliated agency in New York, was judged too green and packed off home.\u201cI said: \u2018I don\u2019t care if they return her. I\u2019m going to send her right back,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Peters, whose belief in the young model was rewarded when she embarked on a tour of the European circuit and immediately booked a runway exclusive for Gucci.The hits scored by an obscure agency on an island of fewer than three million people owe much to the missionary zeal of Mr. Peters, a voluble and avuncular man (his models call him Pops) with a shaven head and a cowcatcher smile who, besides running his modeling agency, organizes Style Week Jamaica and is host of a popular talk show on cable TV. They also underscore the economic impact that lack of diversity has had on those excluded from opportunity.\u201cMy thought was always to give young Jamaican kids the chance to dream and see a world they may never had known existed and a chance to be world phenoms that they may have thought impossible by their circumstances,\u201d Mr. Peters said.Though his rhetoric may be that of a public service announcement, the facts bear out Mr. Peters\u2019s message. A persistently sluggish economy and the high levels of public debt that have plagued the island nation for decades have kept Jamaica among the slowest growing developing countries in the world, according to the World Bank. And in 2016, the Statistical Institute of Jamaica found that the country\u2019s overall unemployment rate of 12.9 percent was more than twice as high among the young.\u201cNow the whole Caribbean is becoming a new space for people to be scouting that wouldn\u2019t have existed without this new wave of diversity,\u201d said Mr. Scully, the casting agent.What that means for people like Mr. Allen, Ms. Newman or Ms. Grant is a ladder out of Kingston neighborhoods like Central Village, Waterhouse or Allman Town, where drug gangs divvy up and control the unpaved streets and gun violence is commonplace.\u201cNo, we never saw Vogue,\u201d Ms. Newman\u2019s mother, Kerriann Brown Walters, said one afternoon at a betting parlor in Allman Town, a scabbed wood building where she sells lottery tickets from behind a wire screen.In an adjacent shack, a television blasted out a cricket game as gamblers cheered and some women with the chemically bleached complexions common here idled on a bench listening to Lil Uzi Vert on their smartphones.In a nearby part of Allman Town that his mother calls \u201cthe heart of the ghetto,\u201d Mr. Allen was raised in a modest frame structure set behind a gate of corrugated aluminum. Handsome and at ease in Ralph Lauren ads, he looks like a natural inheritor of a world of affluence and boundless opportunity, a sphere sharply unlike the reality he returns to when the fashion shows come to an end.A thin sheet covers the cot where Mr. Allen sits to talk to a reporter in his childhood bedroom. An emaciated dog wanders through a dirt courtyard, and Tasmin Hamilton, his mother, who single-handedly raised her four children here, hangs in a doorway.\u201cI can\u2019t really guess what he would have done if the modeling hadn\u2019t come along,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause in Jamaica no matter what drive you have, the opportunities are not readily there.\u201cIt is like a blessing that he can earn a living and go to places we never heard of,\u201d Ms. Hamilton added. \u201cSometimes Brad will call home and say he\u2019s in Milan or Paris, and we ask ourselves \u2018What part of the world is that?\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, 20 years later, Mike Wallace has finished Volume II. And he\u2019s still not done.Supported byIn 1998, an unlikely tome by two academics became the most popular narrative of New York. The 4.7-pound, 1,424-page doorstop that focused on the city\u2019s first three centuries won the Pulitzer Prize and was instantly hailed as a definitive history.Now, nearly two decades later, the second installment has arrived, a 4.6-pound sequel written this time without a collaborator. Producing both books (plus teaching and other projects) might have left another 75-year-old historian sapped and hoping for more laurels on which to rest. Instead, Mike Wallace is poised to complete Volumes III and IV.The endpapers of his \u201cGreater Gotham,\u201d which is being published Oct. 2, epitomize the conflicts that transformed New York City during the first two decades of the 20th Century.Inside the front cover of Mike Wallace\u2019s magisterial sequel to the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cGotham\u201d is a signature pink-and-mustard Sanborn Insurance Co. map of Lower Manhattan with Wall Street at its core. Inside the back cover is another building-by-building survey, this one of the Lower East Side, then the densest place on the planet.Sandwiched between the Sanborn maps are 1,196 pages that bristle with a gripping narrative of the competing agendas that defined the two neighborhoods and reverberated from the 19th century to the 20th. \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d traces the historic conflicts amplified by two developments.First, the mania to curb destructive competition through consolidation, both in corporate America through trusts and monopolies and in government. While Europe was Balkanizing, the city fathers were amalgamating what become the five boroughs into Greater New York. Second, the specter of the First World War was emerging. Debates over immigration and Americanization magnified the perpetual predicament of a wealthy elite symbolized by Wall Street: how to mitigate class conflict to maintain order over a more and more diverse population now sprawling on the newly opened subways.Exploring the roots and ramification of both trends, \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d elaborates on the message that Professor Wallace, who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and Edwin G. Burrows of Brooklyn College, an expert on the colonial period, conveyed in \u201cGotham\u201d: That current events, indeed, occur as part of a current, an ongoing momentum, and that you cannot understand New York today without appreciating the city\u2019s history from a global perspective.Professor Wallace was born in Queens to a bandleader father, spent his early childhood in San Francisco and then returned to New York City and Nassau County as a teenager.As a graduate student at Columbia, his exposure to the 1968 strikes against the university\u2019s administration and the war in Vietnam transformed him into a radical historian, determined to look beyond the conventional Anglo male version of events.Even as a radical student of history, a half-century later, at 75, he is rather old-fashioned in some ways. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 proudly proclaims \u201cNo Twitter, No Facebook, No Webpage.\u201d (He does use email.)\u201cGotham,\u201d which embraced nearly three centuries of history, was published in 1998 on the centennial of the city\u2019s consolidation, after 20 years of work.Since then, Professor Wallace consulted on Ric Burns\u2019s \u201cNew York: A Documentary Film\u201d and established the Gotham Center for New York City History at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.Now, 20 years after the first volume, \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d encompasses the booms and busts from 1898 until the end of World War I.Nestled in the front parlor of the cozy townhouse in which he lives with his wife, the novelist Carmen Boullosa, on the border of Park Slope, Brooklyn, Professor Wallace ruminated the other day about \u201cGreater Gotham.\u201dYou said that \u201cGotham\u201d and \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d originated back in the mid-1970s. What was their genesis?In the 1960s, the official mainstream narrative had a pretty benign view of America\u2019s presence in the world. We were in the middle of a historiographical revolution, which was happening in tandem with social movements in the streets by blacks and other groups who wanted to be included in the historical narrative. We were not simply inserting blacks, but repeopling the national perspective. Once you have blacks in the picture, you have racism in the picture. Then, you have women \u2014 oops, we left out half the population.My generation began collectively rewriting the official narrative, but our impact on popular understanding was limited. There was no accessible narrative, one that pulled together all the new research into one coherent overview.How did that get you to \u201cGotham\u201d?Working with Ted Burroughs on a history of American capitalism, we had written hundreds of pages, but had barely gotten out of the 17th century. That\u2019s when we decided to make it more manageable and tell the story through New York City.How did you divide the volumes chronologically?\u201cGotham\u201d ended in 1898 if for no other reason than because we had surpassed the limits of bindery technology. Ted delivered his part, and I just kept going garrulously. \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d was going to go to 1945, to get through the war and reflect the kind of rhythm that repeats itself, boom bust, boom bust, and the busts are often ended by war. This one covers the recovery from the Great Depression of the 1890s to the end of World War I instead.Was that because those two decades were so transformative?We entered that war a massive industrial power, but second ranked in terms of finance and trade and as a debtor nation to Europe. Then they started killing each other, and there was this roar of demand for guns and this whole panoply of modern industrial war, and they ran out of money. They sold off their 60 years of holdings in American companies, and then they began borrowing. Britain ends the war still having the empire and the navy, but the United States ends as a creditor country. And New York is poised to become the capital of the capitalist world.You wrote \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d without a collaborator. What was the biggest difference about writing so big a book solo?For one thing there was no one to call at 2 in the morning to say I figured something out.What\u2019s striking about both books is that the same themes recur.There are things that are built into the historical structure. It still happens, and it\u2019s almost unnervingly repetitious. You can predict that every 20 years the economy will fall apart: the minks come out of the closet, and then comes collapse, unemployment, homelessness, in some instances political movements demanding federal intervention to support people who are down on their luck. But even in that rhythm, in that oscillation of the economy, things change. In the 1830s, people who were out of work were lazy. By the 1890s depression, it was patently clear that people were being pitched into joblessness through no fault of their own.Why did the five boroughs merge into Greater New York?One of the fundamental structural transformations that takes place in this period was the emphasis on consolidation and hatred of competition. For all the big bankers and corporate executives\u2019 putative love of free markets, real capitalists of that era thought competition is lunatic. They have to cut wages, which leads to unionism, which has to be repressed, which leads to socialism. This is an argument that is posed not just as economic, but as morally superior. If you impose order, you\u2019ll eliminate disorder. It\u2019s an advance in civilization. The big bankers and corporate executives consider themselves progressives. And they were instrumental in applying the consolidationalist ethos above all to the city.Has there been any change in the ambivalence with which the rest of the country viewed New York? There\u2019s tremendous hostility then because it\u2019s considered to be not really American, it\u2019s full of the wrong kind of people, who are resisting moral imperatives. On the other hand is this glittering attractiveness. I argue that by the end of this period, New York has really become, love it or not, the unofficial capital of the country with street names fulfilling national enterprises: Wall Street is finance, Madison Avenue is advertising, Broadway is theater, the Bowery is poverty.Isn\u2019t another theme, though, about an elite seeking to establish control over an increasingly diverse population?The Anglo-Protestant community in New York, which encompasses the upper echelons of the economic order, was definitely in favor of the British side of the war. And they had to confront the fact that the vast majority of New Yorkers were either Germans who were not disposed to war against Germany, or Irish not disposed to do anything positive for Britain, or Jews not disposed to support a Czarist regime busily massacring their colleagues, or a black population, which was divided.There\u2019s something special about New York; it becomes a cosmopolitan place. The ethnic enclaves in the city are a spectacular development. But they ran up against the grain of the Americanizers, who are saying that you have to pour everyone into the same mold, which is really an Anglo mold and pretending it\u2019s American. And cultural conservatives open up a new front, which is biological, eugenics: not only were we here first, but that we\u2019re a superior breed.By the end of this period something big has happened: Harlem has become a stronghold. The notion of whites invading Harlem and attempting to burn down churches, which they did in the old days, is preposterous and never more so than after the war.Is your book a radical history?Usually, when you\u2019re thinking radical, you\u2019re thinking history from the bottom up. It\u2019s usually seen as a counterbalance to the relentless focus on power and whiteness. But I did my theory work decades ago. From here on in, it\u2019s letting the theory inform, not guide, not dictate. It\u2019s a sensitivity to questions. And one of the questions is, class isn\u2019t the structure, class is something that happens. I don\u2019t think you can do history and call it history and call it radical if you only look at radicals, the downtrodden trodding up.You need the interaction, you need to understand the appeal of a system, not just that people are bamboozled into behavior that doesn\u2019t work for them, the same way that New York is appealing and appalling to the rest of country, between black and white, haves and have-nots.Novelists do this better because academics tend to dig tunnels in particular directions, but real life doesn\u2019t work like that. Real life happens all at once.Did anything you learned change your mind?That\u2019s a toughie. No, I don\u2019t think so. I had written a 200-page outline down to the 1980s, and that process helped clarify for me the historical forces which have been repetitively operative. There were endless specific instances where things turned out to be more complicated, but to the degree that I\u2019ve been able to allow for complexity, I try to incorporate that into the story and convey it as a narrative. I\u2019m sure this is a matter of provincial New Yorkism, but it\u2019s hard to think of a place on the planet that has evolved into such a complex social organism, with the constellation of cultures, the tremendous disparity of wealth, Wall Street\u2019s efforts to finance what it can\u2019t officially control, and \u2014 this is an issue not to moralize but to understand \u2014 well, it seemed like New York deserved to have its story told in a way that honored its complexity.Does your research make you more or less optimistic about the city\u2019s future?It\u2019s very tricky for a historian. You can get a swelled head and think you know so much about the past, you know about the present, that you can predict the future. If your reference is slavery, it\u2019s hard not to see improvement. If you insert yourself back in 1909 and the debates of the day, you\u2019d be appalled by the cultural assumptions and the arrogance of the people at the top. The disparities are enormous. I tend to think there has been a grindingly slow improvement on a variety of scores, but I also believe that history can go backward.\u201cGreater Gotham\u201d took 20 years and covers two decades. Does that mean, at that rate, the next volume won\u2019t be published until 2042?When \u201cGotham\u201d came out it, a considerable amount of work had been done on the next period. In fact, there\u2019s a fair amount of stuff that\u2019s already been written down to 1945. A lot of what will now be Volume III is done. While it looks like we went into micro-detail and went at a molasses pace, that is a little misleading.Will there be a Volume IV?This depends on sufficient longevity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Moves to End DACA and Calls on Congress to Act", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday ordered an end to the Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, calling it an \u201camnesty-first approach\u201d and urging Congress to pass a replacement before he begins phasing out its protections in six months.As early as March, officials said, some of the 800,000 young adults brought to the United States illegally as children who qualify for the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, will become eligible for deportation. The five-year-old policy allows them to remain without fear of immediate removal from the country and gives them the right to work legally.Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who announced the change at the Justice Department, both used the aggrieved language of anti-immigrant activists, arguing that those in the country illegally are lawbreakers who hurt native-born Americans by usurping their jobs and pushing down wages.Mr. Trump said in a statement that he was driven by a concern for \u201cthe millions of Americans victimized by this unfair system.\u201d Mr. Sessions said the program had \u201cdenied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs.\u201dFormer President Barack Obama, who had warned that any threat to the program would prompt him to speak out, called his successor\u2019s decision \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201cself-defeating\u201d and \u201ccruel.\u201dBoth he and Mr. Trump said the onus was now on lawmakers to protect the young immigrants as part of a broader overhaul of the immigration system that would also toughen enforcement.Mr. Trump also warned lawmakers that if they do not legislate a program similar to the one Mr. Obama created through executive authority, he will \u201crevisit this issue!\u201d \u2014 a statement sure to inject more uncertainty into the ultimate fate of the young, undocumented immigrants who have been benefiting from the program since 2012.Conservatives praised Mr. Trump\u2019s move, though some expressed frustration that he had taken so long to rescind the program and that the gradual phaseout could mean that some immigrants retained protection from deportation until October 2019.The White House portrayed the decision as a matter of legal necessity, given that nine Republican state attorneys general had threatened to sue to halt the program immediately if Mr. Trump did not act.Months of internal White House debate preceded the move, as did the president\u2019s public display of his own conflicted feelings. He once referred to DACA recipients as \u201cincredible kids.\u201dThe president\u2019s wavering was reflected in a day of conflicting messages from him and his team. Hours after his statement was released, Mr. Trump told reporters that he had \u201cgreat love\u201d for the beneficiaries of the program he had just ended.\u201cI have a love for these people, and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly,\u201d he said. But he notably did not endorse bipartisan legislation to codify the program\u2019s protections, leaving it unclear whether he would back such a solution.Mr. Trump\u2019s aides were negotiating late into Monday evening with one another about precisely how the plan to wind down the program would be executed. Until Tuesday morning, some aides believed the president had settled on a plan that would be more generous, giving more of the program\u2019s recipients the option to renew their protections.In addition to the public statement from Mr. Sessions and a White House question-and-answer session, the president was ready on Tuesday with the lengthy written statement, and officials at the Justice and Homeland Security Departments provided detailed briefings and distributed information to reporters in advance.Mr. Trump sought to portray his move as a compassionate effort to head off the expected legal challenge that White House officials said would have forced an immediate and highly disruptive end to the program. But he also denounced the policy, saying it helped spark a \u201cmassive surge\u201d of immigrants from Central America, some of whom went on to become members of violent gangs like MS-13. Some immigration critics contend that programs like DACA, started under Mr. Obama, encouraged Central Americans to enter the United States, hoping to stay permanently. Tens of thousands of migrants surged across America\u2019s southern border in the summer of 2014, many of them children fleeing dangerous gangs.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, indicated that Mr. Trump would support legislation to \u201cfix\u201d the DACA program, as long as Congress passed it as part of a broader immigration overhaul to strengthen the border, protect American jobs and enhance enforcement.\u201cThe president wants to see responsible immigration reform, and he wants that to be part of it,\u201d Ms. Sanders said, referring to a permanent solution for the young immigrants. \u201cSomething needs to be done. It\u2019s Congress\u2019s job to do that. And we want to be part of that process.\u201dLater on Tuesday, Marc Short, Mr. Trump\u2019s top legislative official, told reporters on Capitol Hill that the White House would release principles for such a plan in the coming days, input that at least one key member of Congress indicated would be crucial.\u201cIt is important that the White House clearly outline what kind of legislation the president is willing to sign,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said in a statement. \u201cWe have no time to waste on ideas that do not have the votes to pass or that the president won\u2019t sign.\u201dThe announcement was an effort by Mr. Trump to honor the law-and-order message of his campaign, which included a repeated pledge to end Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration policy, while seeking to avoid the emotionally charged and politically perilous consequences of targeting a sympathetic group of immigrants.The blame-averse president told a confidante over the past few days that he realized that he had gotten himself into a politically untenable position. As late as one hour before the decision was to be announced, administration officials privately expressed concern that Mr. Trump might not fully grasp the details of the steps he was about to take, and when he discovered their full impact, would change his mind, according to a person familiar with their thinking who was not authorized to comment on it and spoke on condition of anonymity.But ultimately, the president followed through on his campaign pledge at the urging of Mr. Sessions and other hard-line members inside his White House, including Stephen Miller, his top domestic policy adviser.The announcement started the clock on revoking legal status from those protected under the program.Officials said DACA recipients whose legal status expires on or before March 5 would be able to renew their two-year period of legal status as long as they apply by Oct. 5. But the announcement means that if Congress fails to act, immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children could face deportation as early as March 6 to countries where many left at such young ages that they have no memory of them.Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security recommending an end to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era executive action that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation.Immigration officials said they did not intend to actively target the young immigrants as priorities for deportation, though without the program\u2019s protection, they would be considered subject to removal from the United States and would no longer be able to work legally.Officials said some of the young immigrants could be prevented from returning to the United States if they traveled abroad.Immigration advocates took little comfort from the administration\u2019s assurances, describing the president\u2019s decision as deeply disturbing and vowing to shift their demands for protections to Capitol Hill.Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, called Mr. Trump\u2019s decision \u201cnothing short of hypocrisy, cruelty and cowardice.\u201d Maria Praeli, a recipient of protection under the program, criticized Mr. Sessions and Mr. Trump for talking \u201cabout us as if we don\u2019t matter and as if this isn\u2019t our home.\u201dThe Mexican foreign ministry issued a statement saying the \u201cMexican government deeply regrets\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.As recently as July, Mr. Trump expressed skepticism about the prospect of a broad legislative deal.\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to do is a comprehensive immigration plan,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut our country and political forces are not ready yet.\u201dAs for DACA, he said: \u201cThere are two sides of a story. It\u2019s always tough.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Win a War on Drugs", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "OpinionPortugal treats addiction as a disease, not a crime.Supported byLISBON \u2014 On a broken-down set of steps, a 37-year-old fisherman named Mario mixed heroin and cocaine and carefully prepared a hypodermic needle. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a vein,\u201d he said, but he finally found one in his forearm and injected himself with the brown liquid. Blood trickled from his arm and pooled on the step, but he was oblivious.\u201cAre you O.K.?\u201d Rita Lopes, a psychologist working for an outreach program called Crescer, asked him. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking too much?\u201d Lopes monitors Portuguese heroin users like Mario, gently encourages them to try to quit and gives them clean hypodermics to prevent the spread of AIDS.Decades ago, the United States and Portugal both struggled with illicit drugs and took decisive action \u2014 in diametrically opposite directions. The U.S. cracked down vigorously, spending billions of dollars incarcerating drug users. In contrast, Portugal undertook a monumental experiment: It decriminalized the use of all drugs in 2001, even heroin and cocaine, and unleashed a major public health campaign to tackle addiction. Ever since in Portugal, drug addiction has been treated more as a medical challenge than as a criminal justice issue.In contrast, Portugal may be winning the war on drugs \u2014 by ending it. Today, the Health Ministry estimates that only about 25,000 Portuguese use heroin, down from 100,000 when the policy began.I came to Portugal to talk with drug dealers, users and public health experts because this nation has become a model for a drug policy that is not only compassionate but also effective.It\u2019s not a miracle or perfect solution. But if the U.S. could achieve Portugal\u2019s death rate from drugs, we would save one life every 10 minutes. We would save almost as many lives as are now lost to guns and car accidents combined.This issue is personal to me, because my hometown in rural Oregon has been devastated by methamphetamines and, more recently, by opioids. Classmates have died or had their lives destroyed; my seventh-grade crush is now homeless because of her addictions.Many people are also coming to Portugal to explore what a smarter, health-driven approach might look like. Delegations from around the world are flying to Lisbon to study what is now referred to as the \u201cPortuguese model.\u201d\u201cThis is the best thing to happen to this country,\u201d Mario Oliveira, 53, a former typesetter who became hooked on heroin 30 years ago, told me as he sipped from a paper cup of methadone supplied by a mobile van. The vans, a crucial link in Portugal\u2019s public health efforts, cruise Lisbon\u2019s streets every day of the year and supply users with free methadone, an opioid substitute, to stabilize their lives and enable them to hold jobs.Methadone and other drug treatment programs also exist in the U.S., but are often expensive or difficult to access. The result is that only 10 percent of Americans struggling with addiction get treatment; in Portugal, treatment is standard.\u201cIf I couldn\u2019t come here, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d still be alive,\u201d Oliveira told me. He said that he used to steal to support his habit but is now getting his life under control. Two weeks ago, he began reducing his dose of methadone, and he hopes to wean himself off opioids completely.Yet Portugal\u2019s approach is no magic wand.\u201cI\u2019m homeless and jobless and addicted again,\u201d Miguel Fonseca, a 39-year-old electrical mechanic, said as he held a lighter under a sheet of tin foil to turn a pinch of heroin powder into fumes that he smoked to get high. He spends about $100 a day on his habit, and in the past sometimes has turned to theft to support it.Less than 100 feet away, Mario, the fisherman I began this story with, was injecting himself with heroin and cocaine, and showing little interest in Lopes\u2019s health outreach. He assured her that he wasn\u2019t overdosing, and he scoffed at the idea of methadone as an alternative to heroin.Mario told me that he had started with heroin at age 14 (another man I met had started at age 11), and used it during the two years he worked as a fisherman in Massachusetts. \u201cPortuguese heroin isn\u2019t as high quality as American heroin,\u201d he complained. He then reached for a pipe and began to smoke cocaine.Public health workers like Lopes may never be able to get Mario to give up drugs, but she can help keep him alive. Seeing Mario, his blood spattered on the steps from his constant injections, tottering off to get more drugs, it was clear that the Portuguese model isn\u2019t as effective as we might hope \u2014 but it occurred to me that in America, Mario might well be dead.So let\u2019s be clear on what Portugal did and didn\u2019t do. First, it didn\u2019t change laws on drug trafficking: Dealers still go to prison. And it didn\u2019t quite legalize drug use, but rather made the purchase or possession of small quantities (up to a 10-day supply) not a crime but an administrative offense, like a traffic ticket.Offenders are summoned to a \u201cDissuasion Commission\u201d hearing \u2014 an informal meeting at a conference table with social workers who try to prevent a casual user from becoming addicted.\u201cHow long have you been using?\u201d Nuno Capaz, a sociologist and member of the Dissuasion Commission in Lisbon, asked a 26-year-old factory worker caught with hashish. They chatted, with Capaz trying to figure out if the young man was in danger of taking up harder drugs. The dissuasion board can fine offenders, but that\u2019s rare. Mostly the strategy is to intervene with counseling or other assistance before an offender becomes addicted.\u201cMy main concern is the health of the person,\u201d Capaz explained afterward. \u201cOur approach is much closer to that of a medical doctor than to a court of law.\u201dThe public health approach arises from an increasingly common view worldwide that addiction is a chronic disease, perhaps comparable to diabetes, and thus requires medical care rather than punishment. After all, we don\u2019t just tell diabetics, Get over it.My sense from observing the hearings and talking to users is that the Dissuasion Commission isn\u2019t terribly effective at dissuading. How successful could a 15-minute session be? Then again, criminal sanctions also seem ineffective at discouraging drug use: When scholars look at the impact of crackdowns, they find there\u2019s typically little impact.In the first year or so of decriminalization in Portugal, there did seem to be the increase in drug use that critics had predicted. But although the Portuguese model is often described simply as decriminalization, perhaps the more important part is a public health initiative to treat addiction and discourage narcotics use. My take is that decriminalization on its own might have led to a modest increase in the use of hard drugs, but that this was swamped by public health efforts that led to an overall decline.Portugal introduced targeted messaging to particular groups \u2014 prostitutes, Ukrainians, high school dropouts, and so on. The Health Ministry dispatched workers into the most drug-infested neighborhoods to pass out needles and urge users to try methadone. At big concerts or similar gatherings, the Health Ministry sometimes authorizes the testing of users\u2019 drugs to advise them if they are safe, and then the return of the stash. Decriminalization makes all this easier, because people no longer fear arrest.So how effective are the methadone vans and prevention campaigns? I thought I\u2019d ask some real experts: drug dealers.\u201cThere are fewer customers now,\u201d complained one heroin dealer in the gritty Lumiar neighborhood. Another, Joaquim Farinha, 55, was skeptical that methadone was costing him much business. \u201cBusiness is still pretty good,\u201d he said, interrupting the interview to make a sale to a middle-aged woman.(Portugal\u2019s drug market is relatively nonviolent and relaxed partly because of another factor: Handguns are tightly controlled.)Decriminalization also made it easier to fight infectious diseases and treat overdoses. In the U.S., people are sometimes reluctant to call 911 after a friend overdoses for fear of an arrest; that\u2019s not a risk in Portugal. In 1999, Portugal had the highest rate of drug-related AIDS in the European Union; since then, H.I.V. diagnoses attributed to injections have fallen by more than 90 percent and Portugal is no longer at the high end in Europe.One crucial mistake that Portugal did not make was to follow the United States in adopting prescription opioid painkillers for routine use. Adalberto Campos Fernandes, the health minister, said that Portuguese doctors resisted overprescribing and that regulators also stood in the way.Portugal initially was scolded around the world for its experiment, as a weak link in the war on drugs, but today it\u2019s hailed as a model. The World Health Organization and American Public Health Association have both praised decriminalization and a public health focus, as has the Global Commission on Drug Policy.I\u2019ve been apprehensive of decriminalizing hard drugs for fear of increasing addiction. Portugal changed my mind, and its policy seems fundamentally humane and lifesaving. Yet let\u2019s also be realistic about what is possible: Portugal\u2019s approach works better than America\u2019s, but nothing succeeds as well as we might hope.The hilly Casal Ventoso neighborhood of Lisbon was ground zero for heroin in Lisbon 15 years ago, \u201ca wall of death,\u201d remembered Paulo Brito, 55, who has been using heroin since he was 15.Brito weaned himself off drugs with the help of health workers and remained \u201cclean\u201d for 10 years \u2014 but relapsed a year ago, and I met him in today\u2019s Casal Ventoso. There are fewer overdoses now, but it is still littered with hypodermic packages and other detritus of narcotics, as well as a pall of sadness.\u201cI\u2019ve hit rock bottom,\u201d Brito told me despairingly. \u201cI\u2019m losing the person I most love in the world.\u201dHis girlfriend, Teresa, is begging him to give up heroin. He wants to choose her; he fervently wants to quit. But he doesn\u2019t know if he can, and he teared up as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s like entering a boxing ring and facing Mike Tyson.\u201dYet for all his suffering, Brito lives, because he\u2019s Portuguese. The lesson that Portugal offers the world is that while we can\u2019t eradicate heroin, it\u2019s possible to save the lives of drug users \u2014 if we\u2019re willing to treat them not as criminals but as sick, suffering human beings who need helping hands, not handcuffs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Can\u2019t Stop Trade With North Korea. But He Does Have Options.", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 President Trump said on Sunday that the United States could consider stopping all trade with countries doing business in North Korea, in a move that could spell economic catastrophe for the pugnacious country.One problem: It would mean economic disaster for the United States as well.Despite years of economic sanctions and international condemnation, North Korea still conducts modest trade with a host of United States allies, including Brazil, Germany and Mexico.The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea.That makes cutting off all United States trade with China a nonstarter, experts say. But Mr. Trump\u2019s extreme remark epitomizes the tough choices that American policy makers face. While the United States and other countries have tightened sanctions and moved to cut off North Korea from the rest of the economic and financial world, Pyongyang continues its efforts to develop nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them.The United States has limited options. It could more broadly target Chinese companies that do business in North Korea. But that could prove ineffective against a Chinese government that worries that trade limits could worsen conditions in the North, making the situation there even more unpredictable.\u201cIf it really started to send their economy into a tailspin, they could lash out in a more extreme way,\u201d said John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul.North Korea\u2019s test of a nuclear weapon on Sunday prompted White House officials to threaten new sanctions targeting businesses and countries that have continued to do business with Pyongyang. That prompted criticism from China on Monday, which called the idea of trade measures against it \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\u201cThis is neither objective nor fair,\u201d Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said at a daily news briefing.In global trade terms, North Korea is basically a rounding error. Chinese trade with the North totaled only about $3 billion in the first seven months of 2017 \u2014 roughly the same as last year \u2014 as China buys less coal, clothing and other goods. (By comparison, the United States exported $11 billion in corn in 2016.)Still, even as China buys less, it is exporting more. This year, despite new sanctions, stern warnings to China from Mr. Trump and a slew of weapons tests by the North, Chinese exports to Pyongyang grew more than 22 percent through July compared with a year earlier, in part because of rising sales of electrical equipment and machinery, according to data from IHS Markit, Global Trade Atlas, a research company.China also provides North Korea with one very important product: cash. North Korean workers go to China to earn and send back money. Chinese trade companies provide foreign currency.That helps North Korea keep its economy running \u2014 which has improved somewhat under the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, as he has embraced some more market-oriented policies. It has also provided the capital to expand a nuclear weapons and missile program increasingly capable of hitting the United States. A number of experts say those trading companies could make strong targets for sanctions.\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing roughly is a trade-based money-laundering scheme,\u201d said David Thompson, a senior analyst at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a research company based in Washington.Some analysts in the United States have called for new policies that exert pressure on a wider array of Chinese companies. Larger Chinese state-run banks and companies should be included because they are all ultimately controlled by the government, said Daniel Blumenthal, an analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\u201cThe point would be for the Chinese Communist Party itself to feel the pain of its relationship with Kim,\u201d said Mr. Blumenthal, referring to the North\u2019s leader.While obscure textile factories and border trading companies make up much of China\u2019s trade with North Korea, a number of China\u2019s largest brands have also occasionally shipped goods to the North in recent years, though the sales are quite small compared with those elsewhere. Some of the same companies also sell products in the United States.Just about every prominent Chinese appliance maker has sold goods in North Korea, including TCL and Hisense. The two companies sold a range of products, including refrigerators, air-conditioner units and television screens and other electronics.Midea, a company that took over the German robot maker Kuka last year despite some objections in Europe, has done sporadic business with North Korea. Most recently, in November, it shipped refrigeration units, air-conditioners, copper piping and other electronics.Among China\u2019s car companies, Great Wall, Chery and Geely have all shipped auto parts or vehicles to North Korea. During a parade this spring in honor of the birthday of Kim Il-sung, the country\u2019s founder, a visiting journalist took photographs of trucks made by a company called Sinotruk tugging submarine missiles. The company has shipped $1.2 million in vehicles and parts to North Korea in the past several years.The Chinese battery and electric carmaker BYD has done about $14 million in trade with North Korea since 2012 and the shipments have continued until recently. In January, the company sent rubber products to the country, and in December, it sent vehicles. BYD is traded on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange, and is backed by Warren Buffett, who owns a 10 percent stake in the company.In the summer of 2014, the Chinese beer maker Tsingtao shipped about $20,000 of beer to the country, along with outdoor umbrellas and glassware.Still, any effort by the United States to come down on China\u2019s trade with North Korea could backfire if it creates divisions among Washington, Beijing and Seoul.\u201cIt would be great for them,\u201d said Mr. Delury, of Yonsei University, referring to Pyongyang. \u201cNorth Korea would just feed that. They\u2019d have started a trade war between China and the United States. It would be colossally foolish.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai, and Ryan McMorrow from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Am in Prison Because I Want Freedom for My Country", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 I write this from my cell in the dungeons of the Venezuelan secret police. I\u2019m 32 and I\u2019ve been a democratic activist for 12 years. I have two children, 8 and 5, who are my sun and moon. I have a wife whom I love and who now has to carry the burden of being married to a political prisoner.One year ago, while I was going to speak at a news conference on behalf of the Popular Will political party, of which I am a member, I was intercepted by 10 or 15 undercover secret police vehicles. A couple of dozen armed agents tied my hands and covered my head with a black cloth. They transported me to the prison from which I now write, where I was locked in a cell without light or natural ventilation.When I stretched my arms, I could touch two opposite walls. The door was blocked with black garbage bags, leaving the room in total darkness. There was rotten, worm-infested food on the floor alongside scraps of clothing covered in feces. It felt as if I had been buried alive.I was denied any communication with the outside world and could speak with my lawyers only when I was taken to court. After 10 days, I was transferred to an administrative office inside the jail, where for the next seven months I slept on a mat on the floor. I have finally been moved to a cell with a bed, though one with no windows. I can see the sun only one hour a week.Scarcely five years ago, I was studying for a master\u2019s degree at Columbia University. Back then, I strolled with my family through the Morningside Heights neighborhood in Manhattan and hoped that one day I would use everything I had learned to rebuild my country.But for me, as for so many other Venezuelans, political imprisonment has been the punishment for daring to dream of a democratic society, free of Communism and open to the global community. We just want what so many other people around the world take for granted: free elections, good governance, free expression, judicial independence, personal security and a modicum of economic liberty \u2014 something not even the Chinese Communist Party denies its citizens anymore.Last October, a court granted me parole \u2014 but my jailers ignored that order. Three months ago, the prosecutor in my case closed the investigation, establishing that I was not guilty of any crimes (I had faced trumped-up charges of possession of explosives). This means that there are no active judicial proceedings against me \u2014 I\u2019m simply being held hostage in violation of the Constitution. The United Nations, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have all described my detention as arbitrary and called for my release.I can\u2019t imagine the despair of thousands of patients with cancer and other diseases who are in constant pain in hospitals that lack medicines. I don\u2019t want to think of a father\u2019s horror when his baby dies from a fever or diarrhea that could easily have been treated if he had access to medicine.I\u2019m in prison so that this stops happening. That conviction gives me strength.My generation has made freedom its goal. I want to ask the people of the United States and the world to stand by our side. I ask the news media to report on what is being censored in Venezuela. I ask the nongovernmental organizations and human rights groups to keep denouncing abuses. And I ask investors to understand that no profits from doing business with a bankrupt government will surpass the benefits to come when Venezuela is once again operating in world markets.We in the Venezuelan opposition have three main challenges right now. The first is overcoming the humanitarian crisis caused by shortages of food and medicine. The second is restoring democracy through peaceful means and avoiding civil war. The third is opening our economy to the world.We aren\u2019t asking anyone to solve our problems for us. We have taken responsibility for our country\u2019s future. But Washington\u2019s influence could either help us speed up the process or give some breathing room. The White House, together with the rest of the international community, has the capacity to pressure for negotiation and a peaceful transition to democracy. We are grateful for the support that the people of Europe, Latin and North America have shown; I only dare to ask for one more thing: resolve.As for me, I\u2019ll do everything in my power to keep resisting in prison. I\u2019ll keep dreaming of going home to sleep in a clean bed surrounded by my family. I\u2019ll keep dreaming of the day in which we all take to the streets to celebrate our freedom.Yon Goicoechea is a lawyer and political activist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How China Aims to Limit the West\u2019s Global Influence", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSkeptics have derided the notion that China, which has resisted dropping the many barriers that restrict the free flow of goods and capital across its borders, is suddenly all-in on globalization. But this criticism misses the bigger picture.With the United States apparently pulling back from multilateralism, China is deploying to great effect an approach that has been some years in the making but is now bearing fruit.This form of multilateralism is built on transactional principles very different from the type of global order the United States and other Western economies have championed, one built on trust and mutual cooperation. It will eschew values like democracy, human rights and freedom of expression, which the United States has long sought to promote around the world.Beijing\u2019s strategy has two main prongs. The first is to change the rules of the game from within, by expanding Chinese influence in existing international institutions.China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, committing to opening its own markets to foreign goods and investment in return for better access to markets worldwide for its exports. China did indeed benefit, kicking its manufacturing machine into high gear and boosting its exports.But the other side of the bargain \u2014 China\u2019s opening \u2014 was not fulfilled. Foreign exporters and investors still face many barriers in China. To sell goods there, foreign companies often have to sign up with local partners. Foreign businesses undertaking production in China also have to partner with local companies, requiring transfers of technological expertise and intellectual property. Foreign investment is still restricted in certain sectors, including financial services like insurance.Meanwhile, China has become the second-largest economy and one of the biggest traders in the world, allowing it to hold sway within the World Trade Organization. The country is now one of the prime users of the W.T.O. dispute-settlement process to protect its own interests and to aggressively counter trade actions brought against it by other countries.With its rising economic clout, China has also been able to raise its voting shares at international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At these organizations, the United States and other advanced Western economies together still have the dominant voting power. So, China has been subtle in its approach, creating alliances with other emerging-market countries like India and Russia to advance its priorities.The second prong of China\u2019s strategy is to set up its own international institutions. These put a multilateral sheen on projects in which Beijing controls the purse strings and also makes the rules of the game.When China wants to show off its raw economic power, it can put on quite a show. The One Belt, One Road conference held in Beijing in May drew nearly 30 national leaders from four continents, an array of former heads of state, and numerous leaders from major public and private financial organizations. The gathering will someday be remembered not for who attended or for how much money was put up, but rather as a display of the Chinese strategy to expand its geopolitical influence.The professed multilateral nature of its initiatives allows Beijing to pull other countries more tightly into its fold. It becomes harder for countries that do not share China\u2019s values to stay on the sidelines. Many countries joining with China say they must do so to influence these new institutions from the inside rather than just complain about them from the outside. This was the justification when Britain, Germany and France signed up to become founding members of the Asian infrastructure bank, leaving the United States fuming.China has also been effective at pulling its potential geopolitical rivals into its economic embrace. Countries such as India and Russia are competitors in many areas. But Beijing has corralled these and two other major emerging market economies, Brazil and South Africa, into economic alliances.In addressing concerns that the institutions it is setting up will lead to low standards of governance, transparency and efficiency, Beijing has declared that it will uphold, and even improve upon, the standards set by Western-led institutions.Consider the governance structure of the I.M.F. and World Bank. In both organizations, an 85 percent supermajority is needed to approve major policy decisions. The United States, with its voting share of about 16 percent, in effect has veto power, giving it outsize influence over decisions like what projects and countries the institutions fund as well as the conditions attached to the funding.The dominance of the Western economies and their worldview, with the United States seen as the economic hegemon and the paragon of free markets and democracy, meant that this arrangement once gave these organizations legitimacy and power. But in recent years, with the declining economic power of the West and the rising clout of China and other emerging market economies, this situation has in fact eroded the legitimacy of such institutions.By contrast, at the Asian infrastructure bank, China has a 28 percent voting share and no veto power. Unlike at the I.M.F. and the World Bank, though, approval of major policy decisions at the bank requires only majority support. It is hard to imagine the bank making any decision against China\u2019s wishes. Yet, on paper, this structure beats one in which the dominant country has unbridled veto power, a situation that now rankles other members of the I.M.F. and the World BankFor its lending through the Asian infrastructure bank, China has indicated it will choose only projects that meet the highest standards in terms of corporate governance, environmental impact and commercial integrity. But unlike financing from the United States or from Western-dominated aid and financial institutions, Chinese-led projects rarely come with obvious strings attached. With this approach, China avoids sensitive political issues that could irritate loan recipients. Beijing does not bring up uncomfortable subjects such as corruption, freedom of expression, democracy and human rights.In December 2015, President Xi attended a meeting of African leaders in Johannesburg. He came bearing nearly $60 billion in loans, loan write-offs and other forms of financing. Then, to the delight of the leaders, including the many despots in attendance, he uttered words that were music to their ears: \u201cChina supports the settlement of African issues by Africans in the African way.\u201dChina\u2019s strategy amounts to a systematic displacing of a multilateral system that was built on high ideals and trust, mainly of the United States but also of other advanced economies. Institutions like the I.M.F. and the World Bank were meant to improve national economies and global cooperation rather than propagate the power and influence of any particular country. While the United States benefited from its outsize role in these institutions, the values Washington espoused, such as free markets and democracy, were seen to benefit economic and human welfare around the world.China\u2019s vision of multilateralism will certainly serve China well, allowing it to expand its economic and geopolitical influence in a manner that will become ever harder to resist. Whether this will be good for the world remains to be seen.Eswar Prasad is a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Advertisement"}

Europe\u2019s largest and most powerful nation is still stable. But this election represents a watershed.The arrival in Parliament, for the first time in decades, of about 94 members of a party that flirts with neo-Nazism, expresses pride in the Wehrmacht soldiers of World War II, and hails once more the German Volk constitutes a shattering of the accepted political contours of the Republic. There will be a before and an after.Germany will be angrier and more turbulent. Taboos have fallen. The forces taking down mainstream parties in Western democracies are well known by now. They are fear of the future, of immigrants, of Islam and of terrorism; and anger at impunity, inequality and the arrogance of a globalized elite. Germany was not immune to them.Its lurch came at a time when a race-baiting American president, Donald Trump, has opened the way for everyone\u2019s inner bigot and shown contempt for that most carefully nurtured and prodigious postwar child: the German-American alliance.The AfD is not the creation of Trump, but when an American president can\u2019t quite find unequivocal words of condemnation for neo-Nazis, the ground shifts in the free world. Plenty of damage can be done short of nuclear winter. Gauland wants the Volk back from what he sees as immigrant pollution; Trump a white-dominated America.From 1998 to 2001, I lived in a Germany still on the zigzag path out of historical shame, confronting the Nazi past with the return of the capital to Berlin. It agonized. Debate raged over whether Germany might ever have the right to express pride. A more immodest, perhaps a more normal, certainly a more nationalist Germany has now emerged. Enough Germans are done with those dozen Nazi years to send apologists for the army of the Third Reich back to the Reichstag building.Merkel, during this campaign, went sleepwalking into the whirlwind, with scarcely a new idea. She was her reassuring, ordinary, astute, boring self, \u201cMutti\u201d with a sharp knife for rivals when needed. That was her message. It was just about enough.To win a fourth term is extraordinary. She is already a giant, along with her predecessors Adenauer, Brandt, Schmidt and Kohl. Under her, the country has been ushered to a degree of stability, prosperity and unity \u2014 and to a plausible claim of liberal democratic moral leadership \u2014 that were long unthinkable. German social democracy has performed. It has also frayed. To everything there is an ending; Merkel\u2019s has begun.Her center-right Christian Democratic party (with its Bavarian sister, the Christian Social Union) plunged to 33 percent of the vote from 41.5 percent in 2013. The center-left Social Democratic Party had just 20.8 percent, a postwar low. Even in a country with minimal unemployment, large surpluses and steady growth, anger at the mainstream consensus was evident.Germany knows what closed doors can mean to the persecuted; Merkel, raised in East Germany, knew it with a particular conviction and so brought Europe back from the brink of mayhem. Perhaps her margin of victory would have been greater if she\u2019d travel-banned the desperate. Perhaps littleness pays today. I doubt it in the German case. One lesson of its total annihilation was that a little man is capable of reducing the world to ruin.A dozen years in power is a lot. Merkel is weary; Germans too. It is a time for a last act.Forming her next coalition will take time. The Social Democrats want out; Merkel may have to turn to the left-leaning Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats, two parties with many differences. That is problematic but may stimulate change. Christian Lindner, the leader of the Free Democrats, was the bright new face of the campaign. There\u2019s plenty of business in the pursuit of the post-carbon economy. Both the Greens and the Free Democrats are generally pro-Europe.European integration was Germany\u2019s way out of the rubble of 1945.

{"Headline": "What the Far Right\u2019s Rise May Mean for Germany\u2019s Future", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterIt has become a new ritual of Western politics: hold an election, watch a far-right populist party do better than ever before, then debate the significance of its rise.Is populism surging or falling short of expectations? Are voters turning to the far right because of economic anxiety, xenophobia or something else entirely? Is the Western liberal order decaying, or showing its resilience?I have spent more than a year reporting on the AfD, along with other far-right parties and politicians across the West. I have spoken to social scientists, sifted through mountains of data and stood in snowy squares during AfD rallies until my feet went numb. Over time, that work has revealed the surprising social, institutional and political factors behind the party\u2019s success \u2014 and its potential to change German politics in the future.The most important story of last weekend\u2019s election in Germany was not so much the rise of AfD but the collapse of support for the country\u2019s mainstream political parties, which lost more than 100 seats in the Bundestag, their worst result in the postwar era.Many of these voters moved to the AfD, but other small parties gained as well. And the AfD also picked up significant support from disaffected voters who did not participate in the previous election, suggesting that many of its voters became alienated from politics first, and only later chose to support the party.These mainstream party losses fit a pattern that has played out across other countries where the far right is rising. In France and the Netherlands, for instance, the mainstream parties\u2019 losses in recent elections were far greater than the gains of far-right parties.Mr. Mudde argues that certain issues \u2014 including immigration, European Union integration, and center-right economic reforms \u2014 had become \u201cdepoliticized.\u201d Once elite consensus around those policies hardened, they were treated as foregone conclusions, not the subject of genuine debate. That has alienated voters, he believes, creating opportunities for populist parties that promise alternatives.When I asked AfD supporters what had led them to the party, no one mentioned the economy. Rather, I heard again and again that the nation and its essential Germanness were under threat from Muslim immigrants and other outsiders, and that only the AfD, among all the political parties, was willing to protect it.Those interviews, though anecdotal, fit with experts\u2019 findings about the drivers of far-right support in Germany. Anxiety over identity and social change, experts say, not economic distress, attracts voters to far-right politics. And immigration, the signature issue of the AfD and a major concern of its supporters, has emerged as a way to discuss issues of German identity that have long been taboo.Immo Fritsche, a professor at the University of Leipzig who studies group identity formation, told me in an interview last winter that \u201cthere has never been a positive definition of German identity since the Nazi era.\u201d After the war, national identity, even national pride, were seen as too close to the aggressive nationalism that had led to Naziism.Instead, Germany defined its national identity negatively, by what it was not. Not fascist. Not nationalist. Not separate from Europe.But now, decades after the end of World War II, many Germans are chafing against that taboo against identity. At a rally in Dresden, earnest young AfD supporters told me over the roar of the crowd that it was unfair that other countries were allowed to have national pride and Germany was not.The AfD has proved adept at exploiting frustration at this. It presents itself as a champion of ordinary Germans, punching up at the elite who would deny them their national identity.Recent events have made national identity feel especially important, and threatened, for many Germans.The refugee crisis has brought an influx of over a million immigrants from the Middle East and Africa, many of whom have settled in towns and cities that were once overwhelmingly white. Eric Kaufmann, a professor at Birkbeck, University of London, who studies ethnic majority politics, has found that this kind of sudden demographic change is particularly likely to set off a nativist backlash that can fuel far-right populism.Also, the perceived unresponsiveness of the European Union on matters of immigration and border security create a sense, for many Germans, that they have lost control over their country.Professor Fritsche\u2019s research shows that when people feel a loss of control, they seek a stronger connection to group identity, and experience a desire to make their group more powerful. Therefore, he says, a sense that borders are open and immigration is uncontrolled may have made many Germans seek out a stronger sense of German identity, and a stronger Germany.The AfD\u2019s message of border security and a return to national pride was perfectly placed to fulfill that need.During a January visit to Berlin, I asked politicians from the Christian Democratic Union, led by Angela Merkel, and the opposition Social Democratic Party if they were worried about the rise of the AfD. Their response tended to be breezy confidence.Yes, the party had gone from nothing to polling at 15 percent in the few short years since its founding. Yes, it was rather shocking to see the far right gaining ground in Germany. But then they would come back to the same reassuring point: 15 percent was less than 85 percent. So what would this upstart party be able to do, anyway?Research suggests they should not be so confident. Far-right parties\u2019 influence on politics is often much greater than simple numbers would suggest.Across Europe, although populist parties themselves rarely capture more than a small minority of the vote, their success has pushed mainstream parties to court far-right voters by mimicking elements of their platforms. That has amplified the influence of the right-wing populist agenda, allowing far-right parties to shape policy from the fringes.In Britain, for instance, the UK Independence Party, known as UKIP, tended to poll between 10 percent and 15 percent in 2012 and 2013. While that was far from a majority, it was enough to put pressure on the center-right Conservative party, which announced a referendum on European Union membership in order to court those voters.The result was the Brexit vote \u2014 the most significant event of British politics for a generation.But the greater influence may be on the political system itself. Professor Fritsche\u2019s research shows that the same sense of threat and chaos that can fuel the far right can also drive polarization.When leftists and liberals feel threatened, they too become more likely to close ranks with their own group and become more vehemently opposed to those who do not share their values, such as far-right parties and their supporters.That can lead to oppositional, us-vs-them tribalism that can have a profound effect on the political ecosystem.In Germany it has long been the norm for AfD rallies to be surrounded by protests that are often far larger than the rallies themselves. At the events I attended, riot-gear-clad police officers held the groups apart from each other, carving a wide, empty space between the protesters and protested.The measures were necessary to preserve safety, but reinforced the sense that each side was a threat to the other. It looked as if Professor Fritsche\u2019s research on polarization was given corporeal, very noisy form.The question now is whether the AfD\u2019s presence in the Bundestag will cause those divisions to grow, and whether the political system will be able to bear the strain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Reform Moves Into the Spotlight", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:President Trump is using the tragedies of multiple hurricanes hitting the United States as an excuse to rush through Congress his plan to reform the country\u2019s income tax code. Attempting to capitalize on the suffering of millions of people to circumvent the normal process of careful and systematic analysis of the impacts of making major changes to the tax code can only mean that his proposals would fail to stand up to the detailed scrutiny that normally accompanies such legislation.More important, unless President Trump releases all of his tax returns \u2014 which, during the campaign, he promised to do after the election \u2014 we can never know how much he and his family personally benefit from his proposals. Given that he has repeatedly used the office of the presidency for personal aggrandizement (doubling the membership fees at Mar-a-Lago, hosting foreign leaders at Trump hotels), we can only believe that his plan is less a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d plan than a \u201cMake the Trump Family Ever Richer\u201d plan.ROBERT CHECCHIO, DUNELLEN, N.J.To the Editor:Thank you, Mr. Leonhardt, for reminding us that after World War II the highest income category was taxed at 91 percent. Taxes then paid for war expenses and the Interstate highway system. Today, governments are unable to adequately fund law enforcement or education or fix those highways, among other needs, while some multimillionaires, although in the maximum 39.6 percent tax bracket, actually pay an effective tax rate lower than their secretaries do.There is a better way than that being pursued by those who do not see the corrosive effect of the values of many of today\u2019s \u201cleaders.\u201dTo the Editor:As a lifelong economic conservative, I was surprised by how much David Leonhardt\u2019s article both resonated with me and made me reconsider economic policy options for the future.His examination of how the top income tax level has decreased from George Romney\u2019s time to his son Mitt\u2019s was interesting, and his suggestion for top tax rates to be raised has merit. Nevertheless, speaking as someone whose family is mainly in the top bracket, I think the income requirement for the top bracket must be increased as well as the rate.While $250,000 sounds like a high amount, it tends to affect small-business owners and their top employees disproportionately in comparison to the executives his article targets. If that top bracket was to be changed to perhaps $2 million, the increased tax rate would be more likely to hit chief executives and established millionaires while allowing small-business owners to reinvest more capital into the economy and job market.This two-pronged change to the top tax bracket would also be more likely to achieve the goals intended by previous conservative tax cuts while still increasing government revenue for social programs and debt relief.MATTHEW DUGLIN, HENRICO, VA.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "His Home Flooded, the Port Arthur Mayor Puts His City First", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORT ARTHUR, Tex. \u2014 On a winding street of older brick homes in the center of town, only one house is without a mountain of debris on the front yard. The house, a two-story at the end of the cul-de-sac, had not been spared by the recent storm, which submerged three-quarters of this coastal industrial city.The homeowner, Derrick Ford Freeman, has just not had time to worry about his own affairs. He is the mayor of Port Arthur.Normally the job of mayor is part-time, requiring only one white button-down shirt bearing his name and the city logo. Lately, his mother has been washing that shirt every morning. Mr. Freeman has spent his days racing around the city, lobbying a visiting senator for federal aid one moment, sitting next to a woman sobbing onto his shoulder the next. He has focused on practical matters like restoring trash pickup, reopening schools and finding homes for displaced families.The mayor knows what residents have endured from Hurricane Harvey because he has gone through it himself. But he has set aside his troubles to look after his city\u2019s much larger ones.Like many of the people he has comforted, Mr. Freeman is not sure where his family will live when they return to Port Arthur. He does not have flood insurance. In the week after the storm, he, too, was rushing home before sundown in case he had to fend off looters.\u201cWe weren\u2019t ready for that,\u201d he told his viewers. \u201cNo one was.\u201dBefore long, the water had climbed high enough to reach his waist. His wife had already taken their children to Austin. But the mayor had stayed put.In Port Arthur, like many places along the Texas coast, time can be measured in storms: the surges of water during Hurricane Ike (2008), or the \u201cblue roofs,\u201d the government-provided tarpaulins that covered damaged homes, after Hurricane Rita (2005). But there was already a sense that this time, it had been battered by something much worse.Nearly a week after the flooding began, parts of the city remained inaccessible. The city\u2019s newspaper, The Port Arthur News, had waist-high water in its office, and its editor, whose home and car were flooded, was commuting from a hotel room provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that was 60 miles away in Lake Charles, La.In a church parking lot where a group from Louisiana was handing out meals, one man hugged the mayor with pained look on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing those somber hugs,\u201d Mr. Freeman told him. \u201cWe\u2019re coming back, baby!\u201dThe storm struck a city of 55,000 that already had its share of struggles. Port Arthur, like much of the region, has an economy driven by the oil industry, and it has the largest refinery in the United States within its city limits. Even so, unemployment and poverty have been stubborn problems, and the city\u2019s busiest streets are checkered with empty lots and rundown buildings.Port Arthur was once bustling, with a robust white middle class and the distinction, in 1973, of being an All-American City, a title awarded for civic innovation. But over time, the white population gravitated toward the cookie-cutter subdivisions that sprouted nearby, taking with them businesses that had been in downtown Port Arthur.The void was filled, in large measure, by a wealth of diversity: The City Council is mostly black. A Vietnamese-American community flourished after the war. In one corner of the city, there was a Dominican barber shop, a Mexican meat market and a garden outside Queen of Vietnam Catholic Church with a statue of the Virgin Mary rising above nearby houses.Before the storm, Mr. Freeman had ambitious aspirations: diversifying the economy and changing the minds of people who viewed the city as a place to avoid. As he confronts an enormous recovery, he hopes it will spark an infusion of opportunity rather than dashing hopes for change.But the mayor\u2019s concerns now are more immediate. More than 100 schoolteachers and another 100 city employees, he said, did not have homes ready for them to return to. If the city were to spring back, they would need places to stay.As a resident, he understood how difficult it could be to move forward. After all, he had made almost no progress in repairing his waterlogged home. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have a lot of work,\u201d he admitted at one point to the police officer assigned to ride around with him. \u201cIt keeps my mind off of it.\u201dAfter a visit to a school whose gym had been transformed into a Red Cross shelter, the mayor hopped back in his car, one hand holding the steering wheel, the other a hamburger. Another dignitary, this time a United States senator, had come from out of town.\u201cAll right,\u201d Mr. Freeman said, laughing, \u201clet\u2019s see what my man Ted Cruz has to say.\u201dAs he drove down streets that, days ago, he had traversed by boat, Mr. Freeman, 41, explained how deeply his roots ran in Port Arthur. He was raised here. The middle school he had just left used to be a high school, which he graduated from in 1994. He has family ties to the rapper Bun B, whose group UGK, short for Underground Kingz, started in Port Arthur.He had a winding path to politics. He performed in a Christian rap group called T.F.O., or The Forgiven Ones. He was a disc jockey for the local hip-hop and R&B station, making $11 an hour during a prime evening shift. (His name on air: D-Free.) Then, he left for a decade, living around Los Angeles, hoping to make a career in the entertainment industry.He returned when he and his wife were expecting their first child. He served on the City Council before he was elected mayor last year. His day job is in real estate, but through politics, he hoped he could make an impression on his city.\u201cTo get a blessing, I always say, you\u2019ve got to be a blessing,\u201d he said.There have been victories since the storm: the mayor announced schools would open earlier than planned. And there have been hurdles: Some residents expressed worries that the city had not done enough to prepare, and others complained about barges the mayor had hoped would house hundreds of displaced people.After a week of dealing with the recovery, Mr. Freeman\u2019s exhaustion was starting to show: He could not stop yawning.The day had a packed schedule like the others before it: A briefing at Police Headquarters and meetings at City Hall. He drove to a mall to take a photograph with the retired baseball player Curt Schilling, who had traveled here to volunteer. Then he was off to the county airport to meet Elaine C. Duke, the acting secretary of Homeland Security.He was mindful that Hurricane Irma, which struck Florida, might mean that the window of attention on Texas could be closing. He wanted to secure help before that happened. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything we can to regain or keep confidence in Port Arthur,\u201d he said, \u201cso they\u2019ll rebuild with us.\u201dHe followed Ms. Duke\u2019s motorcade back to Thomas Jefferson, the school with the gymnasium filled with cots. Some residents slept on a warm afternoon, covers pulled up to their face. Restless boys chased one another. One asked an aide following Ms. Duke in a pinstriped suit if he were the president.One woman gave the mayor a hug. It was his mother, Deborah, who has been among the regular volunteers. \u201cThey can say he\u2019s young,\u201d she said of her son, \u201cbut he\u2019s got a lot of heart and a lot of wisdom.\u201dAnother familiar person, a volunteer for his campaign, asked for $5.The mayor pulled a wad of bills from his pocket and handed him one.He climbed back into a sport utility vehicle, bound for another meeting at City Hall. He had a few stops left, but he would make it home before sunset. There, he would go upstairs and squeeze into his children\u2019s bunk bed to sleep.\u201cClose the door,\u201d he said, \u201cand the smell doesn\u2019t hit you too bad.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

Instead of blaming both sides for gridlock in Washington and extremism in American politics, as so many commentators did, they squarely held Republicans responsible.These themes segue perfectly into their new book, \u201cOne Nation After Trump: A Guide for the Perplexed, the Disillusioned, the Desperate, and the Not-Yet Deported.\u201d Today, these three wise men are influential voices of the anti-Trump resistance. If someone had hibernated through the 2016 election, woke up early this year and logged onto Twitter or turned on cable news and wondered, what the hell happened?, this would be the book to read. \u201cOne Nation After Trump\u201d devotes considerable space to tackling the unprecedented nature of Trump\u2019s election and presidency \u2014 his vulgarity, racism, authoritarianism, cronyism and reverence for America\u2019s longtime enemies. But the book is particularly useful in showing how, despite all the talk of Trump as an aberration in American politics, his rise reflects the longer-term trends that have shaped the modern Republican Party: the four-decade war on the \u201cliberal media\u201d; the delegitimatization of political opponents; the appeals to racism and xenophobia; the hostility to democratic norms. \u201cTrump is less of an outsider than he seems, and he was building on rather than resisting recent trends within the G.O.P.,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThis history helps explain why so many Republican leaders are reluctant to call out Trump\u2019s excesses and to acknowledge the risks he poses to our political system.\u201dThe book is less a rallying cry and more a sober examination of how someone so obviously unfit and unqualified to be president could be elected anyway, and the authors make skillful use of social science research to better understand the Trump phenomenon. Their observations defy easy conclusions. \u201cTrump clearly appealed to two broad, overlapping streams of discontent,\u201d they write. \u201cOne was animated by race, immigration, religion and culture. The other was inspired by economic discontent, the flight of well-paying jobs overseas and the hollowing out of many of our communities.\u201d Trump\u2019s widely mocked \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan brilliantly amalgamated these disparate elements of \u201cpopulism, nationalism, nativism and protectionism.\u201dThere\u2019s always a danger in writing a book about fast-moving current events, particularly with someone as volatile as Trump. Since I received my review copy, Trump threatened nuclear war with North Korea, blamed \u201cmany sides\u201d for the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, fired his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, ended protections for immigrant Dreamers and pardoned Sheriff Joe Arpaio.Given the quick turnaround, parts of the book feel hastily assembled, particularly the second half, where the authors offer policy prescriptions for \u201ca new economy, a new patriotism, a new civil society and a new democracy.\u201d While many of their ideas are good ones, they read like a laundry list of proposals, the very thing the authors criticize Hillary Clinton for. \u201cClinton\u2019s failure owed less to the merits (or demerits) of her particular policies than to her campaign\u2019s lack of focus on the depth of the economic difficulties so many Americans face,\u201d they write.Their desire for a big-tent opposition to Trump also leads them to play down divisions within the Democratic Party on issues like single-payer health care, foreign interventionism and free trade, saying \u201cthese differences are far smaller than those between the entire movement and Trump.\u201d True, but Democratic debates will go a long way toward shaping who runs against Trump in 2020 (assuming he runs again) and are important for a party to have when it is out of power.Given the authors\u2019 depth of knowledge about how Washington works, the best parts of their book frame the dangers of Trump\u2019s presidency in a broader political context. The greatest threat Trump poses, they say, apart from any individual policy, is to democracy itself. \u201cThe most disturbing aspect of Trumpism \u2014 beyond whatever we come to discover about his and his campaign\u2019s relationship with Putin and Russia \u2014 is its dark pessimism about liberal democracy, an open society and the achievements of the American Experiment.\u201d Trump is not an outlier here. The Republican Party has essentially become a majority party through minority rule. Accounts of the growing resistance to Trump often ignore the ways in which Republicans have shaped the rules of the game in their favor (you could almost called it \u201crigged,\u201d to use one of the president\u2019s favorite words). The authors write: \u201cOur system is now biased against the American majority because of partisan redistricting (which distorts the outcome of legislative elections), the nature of representation in the United States Senate (which vastly underrepresents residents of larger states), the growing role of money in politics (which empowers a very small economic elite), the workings of the Electoral College (which is increasingly out of sync with the distribution of our population) and the ability of legislatures to use a variety of measures, from voter ID laws to the disenfranchisement of former felons, to obstruct the path of millions of Americans to the ballot box.\u201d\u201cOne Nation After Trump\u201d is an optimistic title, maybe hopelessly so. Trump shows no sign of leaving any time soon. And the partisan divide seems more intractable than ever. Although only 39 percent of the public approved of Trump\u2019s response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, 80 percent of Republicans who voted for him in 2016 still support his presidency, according to a Morning Consult/Politico poll. Reading this important book, one gets the nagging sense that even after Trump, Trumpism will persist.Ari Berman is a senior reporter at Mother Jones and the author of \u201cGive Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Storms Moved On. The Caribbean Islands Fear the Tourists Might, Too.", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst the hurricanes came, bringing rain, winds and ruin to St. Martin, a tiny island in the Caribbean. Then, said Corby George, a 41-year-old taxi driver there, there was a rush of residents leaving the island, possibly never to return.\u201cTheir jobs are no more,\u201d he said.Two ferocious hurricanes in less than two weeks caused widespread devastation in the Caribbean this month, leaving dozens dead, millions without power or drinking water and countless homes destroyed.The storms also ripped through the tourism industry in a region unusually dependent on well-heeled visitors, where a thriving network of hotels, souvenir shops, taxis, charter fishing boats and restaurants powers local economies.In the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, cruise ports and airports throughout the Caribbean are closed, beachside bars are flooded and, on many islands, tourists are absent. And the risk of a far longer term ripple effect looms, threatening the region\u2019s ability to rebuild: Without a steady influx of cash from tourists, businesses suffer, employers cut back and local residents lose jobs; workers on especially hurricane-stricken islands could move elsewhere for opportunity, denting the local economy further.\u201cRight now, the livelihood of tourism on a whole is in a coma,\u201d said Jen Liebsack, 45, an events and sales manager at Zemi Beach House, a luxury hotel in Anguilla, a British overseas territory where about 90 percent of the electricity infrastructure was damaged and the hotel has canceled its bookings through the end of October.Hillary Bonner, 36, a bartender on St. John on the United States Virgin Islands, said that most of her friends worked in boating or hospitality, and that nearly everything else was staked on the fates of those fields, too. \u201cWithout tourism, you don\u2019t need 10 policemen, you need two,\u201d said Ms. Bonner, who has been staying in New York, waiting to be allowed to return to the heavily battered island. \u201cYou don\u2019t need three banks, you need one.\u201dIn the Caribbean region, travel and tourism account for a higher share of the gross domestic product than they do in any other region of the world, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council, and officials say it is far too soon to know when the industry will fully recover.At stake are some of the more than 2.3 million travel and tourism-related jobs in the region. According to the Caribbean Tourism Organization, almost 30 million tourists visited the area in 2016 and spent more than $35 billion. But as officials race to restore power and begin rebuilding basic services, the precise fallout to the tourism industry is uncertain.Some islands, like St. Kitts, appeared to be barely touched; others, like Barbuda, part of the two-island state of Antigua and Barbuda, were nearly destroyed.Maria Blackman, a spokeswoman for the Antigua and Barbuda Tourism Authority, said that many hotels were closed during the off-season in September anyway, a common time for annual renovations. The cruise ports and airport remain open.\u201cOn Antigua, we opened back up pretty much the next day,\u201d she said.But in the United States Virgin Islands, the damage was so widespread that visitors were told to cancel any planned trips, Beverly Nicholson-Doty, the commissioner of tourism, said.\u201cWe are encouraging travelers to postpone trips to the islands at this time and are sparing no effort to rebuild communities and restore essential services so we can welcome travelers back to our islands in the months ahead,\u201d Ms. Nicholson-Doty said in an email.For most British Virgin Islands tourism workers \u2014 many of them expatriates from the Caribbean or other parts of the world \u2014 the only certainty now is uncertainty.Trisha Paul, who works as a waitress at Treasure Isle Hotel in the capital of Road Town, said she was unsure what she would do to make a living until tourists return.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cJust waiting to get word from the boss as to what is going to happen now. But right now we don\u2019t have any work for waitresses.\u201dA native of Grenada, she said she fell into the profession largely by chance when she moved to the B.V.I. last year after studying psychology in Cuba. Now she is considering returning home.\u201cBut I\u2019m kind of confused right now between two minds, waiting and watching,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hurricane season is still on. I leave here and I go back home, the next hurricane could \u2014 bam!\u201dRobertico Croes, associate director of the Dick Pope Sr. Institute for Tourism Studies at the University of Central Florida, said he did not expect that the Caribbean, over all, would lose tourists. Visitors will simply visit those islands that were untouched by the hurricanes and steer clear of those that were damaged, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t imagine St. John for the next couple of years would be able to do anything with regard to tourism,\u201d he said, noting that the damage was particularly crippling there. \u201cFor Puerto Rico, it\u2019s less severe.\u201dAlfredo G\u00f3mez, 42, the longtime owner of El Farol, a food kiosk in the popular beachside area just east of San Juan\u2019s airport, said he had seen slumps over the last 20 years. But he had not seen the roof of his place blow off. That, he said, had left him wondering this time whether it was even worth giving it another go.\u201cI was tempted to not even come back here to make repairs,\u201d Mr. G\u00f3mez said from the rooftop of his restaurant. \u201cWhat if nobody comes?\u201dThe restaurant was open on Friday making fritters, mostly feeding the employees who had come to clean up. \u201cTell the people, the tourists, to keep supporting us like they always have,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this area \u2014 Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico \u2014 lives off tourism. We can try to survive with business from the locals, but it\u2019s with tourists that we live.\u201dClarisa Jimenez, the president and chief executive of the Puerto Rico Hotel and Tourism Association, was supposed to be preparing for her industry\u2019s biggest event beginning on Tuesday, its splashy annual convention and gala at the InterContinental San Juan, a luxury resort on a white sand beach.Instead, she was sifting through the wreckage of her office in San Juan.\u201cMy office was destroyed \u2014 I\u2019m surprised the phone rang,\u201d she said on Friday, describing the broken windows, strewn papers and soggy floors around her. The convention was hastily postponed to December. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even guess when things will get back to normal. But tourism is one of the industries that we need to help us overcome.\u201dFreeman Rogers contributed reporting from Road Town, British Virgin Islands; Frances Robles contributed from San Juan, P.R.; and Baz Dreisinger from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron Will Be Yet Another Failed French President", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorElectoral arithmetic explains only so much. Mr. Macron\u2019s popularity suffers from something more fundamental: Macronism. His entire political project has been far too focused on his personality. Much of his appeal has come from his youth, his dynamism, his good looks and his oratorical skills. This hyper-personalized approach always carried the risk that once his charm wore off, there would be nothing left for his supporters to like, which is exactly what is happening.This arrogant attitude about power has destroyed the anti-establishment, upstart image that Mr. Macron cultivated during the campaign. The post-ideological platform on which he ran is starting to reveal itself for what it really is: an emptiness at the heart of his political project.The new president says he is determined to make France a \u201cstart-up nation,\u201d borrowing the vapid parlance of Silicon Valley. This has won him the support of venture capitalists and tech billionaires but has yet to convince the wider French public. Silicon Valley\u2019s libertarian social contract, with its cavalier attitude toward inequality, sits uneasily with a population raised on France\u2019s postwar social-democratic traditions.Not since the economic boom of the 1950s and \u201960s has capitalism in Europe been dynamic enough to combine high levels of employment with long-term material gains for the masses. Today, choices involve painful trade-offs. Mr. Macron\u2019s economic policies favor employers over workers and chip away at what remains of the French welfare state.But fearful of giving his program any actual political content, the president wraps up his reforms in the European flag. He tells French voters that only if they make these sacrifices at home, the rest of the European Union \u2014 especially Germany \u2014 will take them seriously and give France a better deal.Mr. Macron\u2019s European plans include a common budget and finance minister for the eurozone. His ideas have received warm words from Berlin, and there are signs that such a deal could be possible after Germany has its federal elections on Sept. 24. But if Chancellor Angela Merkel wins, her mandate will not be for a European fiscal union where German tax revenues are placed in a common European pot. She has given her support to only a very modest version of what Mr. Macron is proposing. The payoff for all of France\u2019s sacrifice at home will be small \u2014 and the president will surely be no more popular than he is now.Mr. Macron\u2019s success in May\u2019s presidential election has shaken up the moribund political landscape in a deep and lasting way. For that, he deserves thanks. But as a political project, Macronism is little more than rhetoric and hubris, backed up with conventional neoliberal policies. For now, Mr. Macron is still the darling of the global liberal elite, but his growing unpopularity gives us a better picture of what he has to offer.A previous version of this article misstated the date for Germany\u2019s federal elections. They will be held on Sept. 24, not Sept. 25.A previous version of this article misstated the month when the second round of France\u2019s presidential election was held. It was May 2017, not June.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rouhani Lashes Back at Trump, as Iran Unveils New Missile", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEscalating a war of words with the United States, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran declared on Friday that his country would continue to develop new missiles and \u201cwould not seek anyone\u2019s permission to defend our land.\u201dAs he spoke at a military parade in Tehran, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps unveiled a ballistic missile with a range of about 1,250 miles, making it capable of reaching much of the Middle East, including Israel.Mr. Rouhani\u2019s nationally televised speech at the parade \u2014 which commemorated the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-88 \u2014 and the show of force were a direct display of defiance toward President Trump, who signed a bill in August imposing mandatory penalties on those involved in Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them.Although United Nations provisions seek to limit ballistic missile technology, the nuclear agreement negotiated in 2015 by Iran and six world powers, including the United States, does not prohibit Iran from developing such weapons.Upon his return from New York, Mr. Rouhani strongly defended Iran\u2019s right to self-defense.\u201cWe will increase our military power as a deterrent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will strengthen our missile capabilities. We will not seek anyone\u2019s permission to defend our land. Not only will we fortify our missiles, but our ground, navy and air forces will always be supported by the people.\u201dShe added: \u201cHistory and the experience of other rogue states such as North Korea has also shown the Iranian government that it is only from a position of strength that regimes such as Iran\u2019s can be protected.\u201dIn his remarks, Mr. Rouhani said that Iran was ready to \u201cdefend the innocent people of Yemen, Syria and Palestine,\u201d and would \"strengthen our defensive and military power as much as we deem necessary for deterrence.\u201dThe state-run news agency IRNA quoted the chief of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 airspace division, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, as saying that the new missile \u201ccan carry several warheads for various uses.\u201d The agency did not provide further information on the missile.Mr. Rouhani, a moderate, has staked his reputation on sealing the nuclear deal and relieving the Iranian economy of debilitating international sanctions. In a rejoinder to Mr. Trump\u2019s call to renegotiate the nuclear deal, he said that \u201call countries\u201d at the General Assembly meeting supported the nuclear deal, \u201cexcept the United States and the Zionist regime,\u201d a reference to Israel.\u201cLike North Korea, Iran is responding to Trump\u2019s bellicosity by its own display of strength, to show it is not cowed,\u201d said Mark Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Americas office of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think tank.He cautioned that Iran\u2019s claim that the new missile could carry multiple warheads \u201cneeds to be taken with a grain of salt,\u201d adding that he \u201cmay mean nothing more than multiple cluster bombs,\u201d not the kind of ballistic missile payload \u2014 multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle, or MIRV \u2014 associated with nuclear missiles.Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, has said that the Iran nuclear agreement must be changed or the United States would not stick with it. Iran has said the accord is not up for renegotiation.The possibility that Washington might renege on the deal has worried some countries, especially as the world grapples with North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile development.This week, Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China said that tensions on the Korean Peninsula highlighted the importance of the Iranian deal, and Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia said that the United States\u2019 imposition of unilateral sanctions on Iran was \u201cillegitimate and undermines the collective nature of international efforts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He films himself spinning on his head and doing push-ups at the gym. He sings about love and desperation and shouts like a military sergeant.Not long ago, Li Tianyou was a scrawny junior high school dropout struggling to make a living in China\u2019s dreary industrial northeast.Now, he is one of China\u2019s best-known internet personalities, commanding a fan base of 22 million people for his live video streams and earning more than $2 million a year in payments from his fans.With his crude jokes and rat-a-tat riffs on modern life, Mr. Li has become a hero to a generation of disaffected young people in China\u2019s smaller cities and rural areas. Many of them are spiteful toward elites, skeptical of authority and eager for an escape from menial work.\u201cI understand the hardness of their lives,\u201d Mr. Li, 23, said during a recent visit to Dalian, a seaside northeastern city. \u201cI spent my childhood watching sheep and cows and going to the river to swim.\u201dMany of his compositions center on love, inequality and the struggles facing young people searching for meaning outside of China\u2019s big cities.Critics have called his work lowbrow, offensive and sexist. But Mr. Li says he believes the strength of his fan base shows his ideas resonate.\u201cMost Chinese people come from common families, or even from poor families,\u201d he said. \u201cMy work speaks to them.\u201dRaised in Jinzhou, a northeastern city of three million, Mr. Li struggled as a child to find his footing.His parents were laid off from a state-owned pharmaceutical company in the late 1990s as the government pushed to privatize China\u2019s economy. He dropped out of school at 15 and worked odd jobs as a street dancer, car salesman and meat griller.\u201cOur parents\u2019 philosophy was, \u2018If you survive, that means you qualify to be part of society. If you starve, that means you\u2019re not trying,\u2019\u201d he said.Mr. Li said his own life mirrored the experiences of many of his fans: a bitter childhood that gave way to fierce independence and a desire to provoke.Angry and dejected, Mr. Li turned his tales of misfortune into songs on China\u2019s modern-day obsession with money and his struggles to court women. He began live-streaming them in 2014 on YY.com, a popular online platform.One of his most famous pieces is titled \u201cListen Up, Women!\u201d In it, he argues that young women place too much emphasis on wealth in choosing mates:Mr. Li\u2019s words quickly made him one of China\u2019s best-known wanghong, or internet celebrities.Conscious of his fan base, Mr. Li has taken his image as a man of the people to an extreme.He eats bananas because \u201cthey are easy to get for ordinary people, not some fancy fruit.\u201d He keeps his earnings in the bank account of his mother, a restaurant owner. And he is fond of quoting Mao, another populist figure, often saying, for example, that small villages can band together to rival the influence of big cities.Mr. Li is particularly popular among young women, who admire his humility, his devotion to his parents and his traditional views on marriage and gender.\u201cHis fans are people born after 1990 who are brave and say whatever we believe without anything to hide,\u201d said Liu Chenfan, a 19-year-old from the northeastern province of Liaoning who will start college this fall. \u201cHe\u2019s a real man, ready to protect women.\u201dZhang He, 25, a cashier who makes about $450 a month at a spa in Dalian, about half the median income in Beijing, said Mr. Li understood the plight of workers struggling to make a living outside China\u2019s big cities.\u201cEach time I watch him, I laugh so hard that I forget things that bother me in real life, like work and relationship issues,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never spends money wildly, although he is so rich now.\u201dMr. Li calls his fans the \u201cTianyou Army,\u201d and he solicits their help in vanquishing rival internet stars in nightly competitions.During the contests, Mr. Li and other stars gather in a virtual chat room, where they take turns singing and cracking jokes in front of an audience of hundreds of thousands. They implore fans to show support by sending virtual gifts, which translate into payments for the stars and help determine rankings on live-streaming sites.Mr. Li\u2019s fans, hungry for the thrill of watching him try to skewer and upstage other stars, shower him with gifts.Most fans offer small contributions of a dollar or less, in the form of virtual gifts like bottles of Chanel and teddy bears. But some well-off fans, eager to flaunt their wealth, occasionally offer gifts worth thousands of dollars or more for V.I.P. status in Mr. Li\u2019s chat room, which earns them shout-outs from Mr. Li and prominent display of their names during broadcasts.During a recent live-streaming session, Mr. Li was perched in front of a webcam in a hotel suite thick with cigarette smoke. As he sat at the keyboard, cycling through comments from fans, he implored an online audience of 150,000 people to send gifts.The broadcast quickly became a circus. Mr. Li performed his signature hanmai songs, each one faster than the previous and punctuated by his harsh northeastern accent. At one point, he cajoled a friend into performing a back stand to attract more money.\u201cConsider it poverty relief,\u201d he said, pursing his lips for effect. \u201cI need your help.\u201dBy the end of the night, fans had sent him more than $10,000 worth of gifts.Mr. Li\u2019s nightly winnings add up to about $4 million each year. Mr. Li would not say how much he keeps for himself, but the Chinese news media has reported that YY.com retains about half of Mr. Li\u2019s earnings as a fee, as it does with other prominent internet stars.As the influence of stars like Mr. Li has grown, the Chinese government has taken notice. More than 344 million people in China have tried at least one of the country\u2019s estimated 150 live-streaming apps, according to official data. Last year, officials imposed stricter controls on these apps, forbidding sexual content and original reporting during live-streams. The government has also shuttered dozens of live-streaming sites and fined some hosts for obscene language.Mr. Li understands the government\u2019s power to break stars, and said he had cleaned up his act to avoid trouble. He said he worries that live-streaming has had a negative effect on Chinese society, promoting violence and bad language.While his critics have compared him to a low-class beggar or street performer, Mr. Li says he is no different from traditional Chinese opera singers, who in ancient times competed vigorously for money and attention. He said he was hoping to bring his work to new media, including movies, and to open a school to train live-streaming stars. He said he planned to live-stream as long as it remained lucrative.\u201cI\u2019m not used to being rich yet,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, being rich sometimes only means I can have as many bananas as I want.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated when Li Tianyou was live-streaming from a hotel in Dalian, China.

{"Headline": "To Understand Rising Inequality, Consider the Janitors at Two Top Companies, Then and Now", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsROCHESTER \u2014 Gail Evans and Marta Ramos have one thing in common: They have each cleaned offices for one of the most innovative, profitable and all-around successful companies in the United States.For Ms. Evans, that meant being a janitor in Building 326 at Eastman Kodak\u2019s campus in Rochester in the early 1980s. For Ms. Ramos, that means cleaning at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., in the present day.In the 35 years between their jobs as janitors, corporations across America have flocked to a new management theory: Focus on core competence and outsource the rest. The approach has made companies more nimble and more productive, and delivered huge profits for shareholders. It has also fueled inequality and helps explain why many working-class Americans are struggling even in an ostensibly healthy economy.The $16.60 per hour Ms. Ramos earns as a janitor at Apple works out to about the same in inflation-adjusted terms as what Ms. Evans earned 35 years ago. But that\u2019s where the similarities end.Ms. Evans was a full-time employee of Kodak. She received more than four weeks of paid vacation per year, reimbursement of some tuition costs to go to college part time, and a bonus payment every March. When the facility she cleaned was shut down, the company found another job for her: cutting film.Ms. Ramos is an employee of a contractor that Apple uses to keep its facilities clean. She hasn\u2019t taken a vacation in years, because she can\u2019t afford the lost wages. Going back to school is similarly out of reach. There are certainly no bonuses, nor even a remote possibility of being transferred to some other role at Apple.Yet the biggest difference between their two experiences is in the opportunities they created. A manager learned that Ms. Evans was taking computer classes while she was working as a janitor and asked her to teach some other employees how to use spreadsheet software to track inventory. When she eventually finished her college degree in 1987, she was promoted to a professional-track job in information technology.Less than a decade later, Ms. Evans was chief technology officer of the whole company, and she has had a long career since as a senior executive at other top companies. Ms. Ramos sees the only advancement possibility as becoming a team leader keeping tabs on a few other janitors, which pays an extra 50 cents an hour.They both spent a lot of time cleaning floors. The difference is, for Ms. Ramos, that work is also a ceiling.Eastman Kodak was one of the technological giants of the 20th century, a dominant seller of film, cameras and other products. It made its founders unfathomably wealthy and created thousands of high-income jobs for executives, engineers and other white-collar professionals. The same is true of Apple today.\u201cThink about the contrast between George Eastman, who pioneered fundamental innovations in photography, and Steve Jobs,\u201d Mr. Summers wrote in 2014. \u201cWhile Eastman\u2019s innovations and their dissemination through the Eastman Kodak Co. provided a foundation for a prosperous middle class in Rochester for generations, no comparable impact has been created by Jobs\u2019s innovations\u201d at Apple.Ms. Evans\u2019s pathway was unusual: Few low-level workers, even in the heyday of postwar American industry, ever made it to the executive ranks of big companies. But when Kodak and similar companies were in their prime, tens of thousands of machine operators, warehouse workers, clerical assistants and the like could count on steady work and good benefits that are much rarer today.Part of the wild success of the Silicon Valley giants of today \u2014 and what makes their stocks so appealing to investors \u2014 has come from their ability to attain huge revenue and profits with relatively few workers.Apple, Alphabet (parent of Google) and Facebook generated $333 billion of revenue combined last year with 205,000 employees worldwide. In 1993, three of the most successful, technologically oriented companies based in the Northeast \u2014 Kodak, IBM and AT&T \u2014 needed more than three times as many employees, 675,000, to generate 27 percent less in inflation-adjusted revenue.Many of the professional jobs from those companies in the 1980s and \u201990s have close parallels today. The high-paying positions setting corporate strategy, developing experimental technologies and shaping marketing campaigns would look similar in either era.But a generation ago, big companies also more often directly employed people who installed products, moved goods around warehouses, worked as security guards and performed many of the other jobs needed to get products into the hands of consumers.In part, fewer of these kinds of workers are needed in an era when software plays such a big role. The lines of code that make an iPhone\u2019s camera work can be created once, then instantly transmitted across the globe, whereas each roll of film had to be manufactured and physically shipped. And companies face brutal global competition; if they don\u2019t keep their work force lean, they risk losing to a competitor that does.But major companies have also chosen to bifurcate their work force, contracting out much of the labor that goes into their products to other companies, which compete by lowering costs. It\u2019s not just janitors and security guards. In Silicon Valley, the people who test operating systems for bugs, review social media posts that may violate guidelines, and screen thousands of job applications are unlikely to receive a paycheck directly from the company they are ultimately working for.\u201cWe\u2019re responsible for creating over two million jobs in the U.S., across all 50 states,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, \u201cranging from construction, customer care, retail and engineering to app development, manufacturing, operations and trucking. All Apple employees, whether full time or part time, are eligible for benefits and stock grants. We\u2019re also fortunate to have skilled contractors that contribute to our products and services daily, along with over 9,000 suppliers in every state.\u201dPerhaps the biggest indictment of the more paternalistic approach taken by an earlier generation of corporate behemoths is that, Kodak, despite having been an early innovator in digital photography, is a shell of its former self. After a bankruptcy and many years of layoffs, the company now has only 2,700 employees in the United States and 6,100 worldwide.The same forces that explain the difference between 1980s Kodak and today\u2019s Apple have big implications not just for every blue-collar employee who punches a timecard, but also for white-collar professionals who swipe a badge.Phil Harnden was coming out of the Navy in 1970 when he applied for a job at Kodak, and soon was operating a forklift in a warehouse. He made $3 an hour, equivalent to $20 an hour today adjusted for inflation. That is roughly what an entry-level contracting job testing software pays.The difference between the two gigs, aside from the absence of heavy machinery in Apple\u2019s sleek offices, is the sense of permanence. Mr. Harnden put in 16 years operating forklifts before he left in 1986 to move to Florida. When he returned 10 years later, he was quickly rehired and even kept his seniority benefits.In interviews, tech industry contractors in Silicon Valley describe a culture of transience. They can end up commuting to a different office park that houses a new company every few months; in many cases 18 months is the maximum a contractor is allowed to spend at one company.\u201cI would rather have stability,\u201d said Christopher Kohl, 29, who has worked as a contractor at several Silicon Valley companies, including a stint doing quality assurance on Apple Maps. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful to find a new job every 12 to 18 months.\u201dFor Silicon Valley\u2019s contracting class, there are reminders large and small of their second-class status. Contractors generally do not receive the stock options that have made some midlevel Silicon Valley workers wealthy over the years, nor the generous paid time off for vacation, illness or the birth of a child. The health insurance plans tend to be stingier than those that the tech giants they serve provide for their direct employees.The smaller reminders can be just as telling. One former Apple contractor recalled spending months testing a new version of Apple\u2019s operating system. To celebrate the release, the Apple employees they\u2019d worked closely with on the project were invited to a splashy party in San Francisco, while the contractors had beers among themselves in a neighborhood pub.The compensation these white-collar contractors receive puts them squarely in the middle rungs of workers in the United States, and the most skilled can make six figures (though that doesn\u2019t go far in the hyper-expensive Bay Area housing market). Apple, based on its consultants\u2019 report, expected to be indirectly responsible for nearly 18,000 jobs in Santa Clara County by now at an average pay of about $56,000 a year.There are some advantages. If they work for one of the companies like Apple or Google that feature a subsidized, high-quality cafeteria, contractors can enjoy the food. They can tell their friends that they work at one of the world\u2019s most admired companies, and enjoy predictable, regular hours. Once in a while, a contractor will be hired into a staff position.\u201cIt\u2019s not evil,\u201d said Pradeep Chauhan, managing partner of OnContracting, a site to help people find tech contracting positions. \u201cThey have a job and they\u2019re getting paid. But it\u2019s not ideal. The problem with contracting is, you could walk in one day and they could say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to come in tomorrow.\u2019 There is no obligation from the companies.\u201dAnd that is the ultimate contrast with the middle-skill, middle-wage jobs of earlier generations of titans \u2014 a sense of permanence, of sharing in the long-term success of the company.\u201cThere were times I wasn\u2019t happy with the place,\u201d Mr. Harnden said of his Kodak years. \u201cBut it was a great company to work for and gave me a good living for a long time.\u201dWhen an automaker needs a supplier of transmissions for its cars, it doesn\u2019t just hold an auction and buy from the lowest bidder. It enters a long-term relationship with the supplier it believes will provide the best quality and price over time. The company\u2019s very future is at stake \u2014 nobody wants to buy a car that can\u2019t reliably shift into first gear.But when that same automaker needs some staplers for the office supply cabinet, it is more likely to seek out the lowest price it can get, pretty much indifferent to the identity of the seller.Labor exists on a similar continuum.The right product engineer or marketing executive can mean the difference between success or failure, and companies tend to hire such people as full-time employees and as part of a long-term relationship \u2014 something like the transmission supplier. What has changed in the last generation is that companies today view more and more of the labor it takes to produce their goods and services as akin to staplers: something to be procured at the time and place needed for the lowest price possible.There\u2019s no inherent reason that work done through a contractor should involve lower compensation than the same work done under direct employment. Sometimes it goes in the other direction; when a company hires a law firm, it is basically contracting out legal work, yet lawyers at a firm tend to be paid better than in-house counsel.But as more companies have outsourced more functions over more time, a strong body of evidence is emerging that it\u2019s not just about efficiency. It seems to be a way for big companies to reduce compensation costs.Firms in the United States are legally required to offer the same health insurance options and 401(k) match to all employees \u2014 meaning if those programs are made extra generous to attract top engineers, a company that doesn\u2019t outsource will have to pay them for everyone.More broadly, there are a whole set of social pressures and worries about morale that encourage companies to be more generous with pay and benefits for employees who are on the same payroll.\u201cThere was an overriding concern about equity,\u201d said Mr. Cobb, the Wharton professor. \u201cFirms would try to set pay so that the gap between the security guard or administrative assistant and senior V.P. wasn\u2019t as great as you might expect, essentially by paying lower- and middle-skill workers more than they were probably worth on the market.\u201dLinda DiStefano applied for a secretarial job at Kodak during Easter week of her senior year in high school in 1968, and was hired to start immediately after her graduation for $87.50 a week, today\u2019s equivalent of $32,000 a year. She put in four decades at the company, first as a secretary, then helped administer corporate travel and other projects.\u201cI helped put on the dinners for the board of directors, which in retrospect someone of my grade shouldn\u2019t have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I had a series of managers who trusted me.\u201dIt bought her a house off Lake Avenue, a new car every few years and occasional long-distance trips to Motown reunion concerts. When her department was abolished in 2008, the travel bookings contracted out, she was making $20 an hour. The best job she could find was as a pharmacy technician at a grocery store for $8.50 an hour.As you drive around Rochester, the role of Eastman Kodak in the city is evident everywhere, in the Kodak Tower that looms over the center of town, in the Eastman Theater on Main Street, and in the hulking buildings and empty parking lots of the manufacturing center known as Kodak Park.In reading the company\u2019s old annual reports, you get a sense that its executives thought of the jobs created and the wages paid as a source of pride and achievement. On the first page of most years\u2019 annual reports was an accounting of how many employees the company had in the United States and worldwide, and the total pay and benefits they received.Apple, with a spaceship-like campus about to open, looms large over Cupertino in its own way, accounting for something like 40 percent of the jobs in the city, and investing $70 million in local environmental and infrastructure upgrades. It is no middle-class enclave; the median home price is $1.9 million.\u201cWe definitely feel a sense of pride to be the home of Apple,\u201d said Savita Vaidhyanathan, the mayor of Cupertino. \u201cBut they consider themselves a global company, not necessarily a Cupertino company.\u201d She said she has never met Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe would have a hard time getting an audience with anybody beyond upper-middle management,\u201d she said.Ms. Ramos, the Apple janitor, lives down the road in San Jose. She pays $2,300 monthly for a two-bedroom apartment where she and her four children live. Before overtime and taxes, her $16.60 an hour works out to $34,520 a year. Her rent alone is $27,600 a year, leaving less than $600 a month once the rent is paid. Overtime, in addition to the wages from one of her teenage children who works part time at a grocery store, helps make the math work, though always tenuously.She works from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. On days when one of the other cleaners doesn\u2019t show up, she may get a few extra hours, which is great for the overtime pay, but it means even less sleep before it is time to take her children to school.A 60-cent-an-hour raise this year negotiated by her union, the SEIU United Service Workers West, helped. Kodak in its prime was not unionized, though in that era when organized labor was more powerful over all, managers deliberately kept wages high to try to prevent the company\u2019s workers from forming one.There is little chance for building connections at Apple. \u201cEveryone is doing their own thing and has their own assignment, and we don\u2019t see each other outside of work,\u201d said Ms. Ramos in Spanish.Ms. Evans, who was a Kodak janitor in the early 1980s before her rise to executive there and at other leading firms like Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, recalls a different experience.\u201cOne thing about Eastman Kodak is they believed in their people,\u201d said Ms. Evans, now chief information officer at Mercer, the human resources consulting giant. \u201cIt was like a family. You always had someone willing to help open a door if you demonstrated that you were willing to commit to growing your skills and become an asset that was valuable for the company.\u201dBut in the 21st-century economy, many millions of workers find themselves excluded from that select group. Rather than being treated as assets that companies seek to invest in, they have become costs to be minimized.Neil Irwin reported from Rochester and Cupertino, Calif.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Cost of Hurricane Harvey: Only One Recent Storm Comes Close", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nIt\u2019s far too early for a definitive estimate of the economic damage caused by Hurricane Harvey. Floodwaters still swamp large swaths of the Houston area and beyond, into far eastern Texas and Louisiana.The estimates are unofficial and changing daily as the storm continues and as the scope of the damage is better understood. But even these initial estimates stand out on a chart comparing the costs of every natural disaster costing $1 billion or more since 1980 (adjusted for inflation).\u201cThere are downstream impacts that other people might not have considered,\u201d Mr. Myers said.His prediction \u2013 nearly double the highest estimates included here \u2013 may ultimately prove to be correct. The estimates shown here have all been revised upward, though none show it to be more expensive than Katrina.The numbers for Harvey are educated guesses for now. It will be more than a month until NOAA releases its first official estimate, Mr. Smith said.The groups making the estimates shown here are:Each of the three uses a mixture of models and observed data from the storm. They update their estimates as new information is available.While no outside group can replicate the exact methodology that NOAA will use to assess the economic impact of the storm, Mr. Smith said the methods of these groups were broadly comparable to NOAA\u2019s.If anything, these numbers are likely to be conservative. Mr. Watson\u2019s estimates for the cost of the storm have more than tripled, from his estimate of $22 billion on Aug. 25, the day before the storm made landfall. And Mr. Smith said even the first official account from NOAA, expected Oct. 6, is likely to be a lower-bound estimate, updated for months to come.Regardless, it\u2019s clear this type of economic devastation from storms is becoming more common. In inflation-adjusted terms, the United States averaged fewer than three billion-dollar natural disasters per year from 1980 to 1990. Since 2010, it has averaged more than 10 per year.But the number of people and the amount of wealth in the United State are factors as well. As both population and wealth continue to concentrate along the coasts, storms have been increasingly likely to hit populated areas and development.Disasters other than Hurricane Harvey are shown through July 7.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Trump Tax Plan, a Windfall for Businesses Large and Small", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA lower tax rate for corporations. Reduced taxes for partnerships like law firms. An easy way to bring overseas profits back to the United States without being taxed.Corporate America had a long wish list when it came to tax reform, and on Wednesday, President Trump gave companies just about everything they wanted.\u201cThis is much more than I think anyone could have hoped for,\u201d said Robert Willens, an independent corporate tax expert. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen something like this. Taken together, this is the most dramatic and beneficial group of corporate tax reform suggestions we\u2019ve ever had.\u201dThere is no certainty that the main points in the White House plan will become law. Congress must now turn the nine-page proposal into a passable piece of legislation. But business leaders were nonetheless quick to applaud the broad outlines of the proposal, claiming that tax cuts they would spur new investment and grow the economy.Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and the chairman of the Business Roundtable, called the plan \u201can encouraging step forward in our shared goal of a tax system that delivers higher economic growth, job creation and wages that our country desperately needs.\u201dJohn Stephens, the AT&T chief financial officer, said it was \u201ca big step toward meaningful reform that would encourage more investment and job creation in the United States.\u201dAnd U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s chief executive, Thomas J. Donohue, said the proposed tax cuts were \u201cgood news for American families and employers.\u201dYet even as business leaders salivate at the prospect of lower taxes, skeptics are questioning whether companies would actually invest tax savings in things like factories and jobs, and whether such cuts would meaningfully help the economy, which is already expanding.\u201cThis is a very cynical document,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a tax expert at the University of Southern California law school. \u201cThe extraordinary thing about the proposal is that we know that it loses trillions of dollars in revenue, yet at the same time the only people we can identify as guaranteed winners are the most affluent.\u201dWhile the tax plan includes numerous changes to the ways individuals are taxed, some of the most far-reaching reforms would be for the companies that have long complained of an overly burdensome tax code.One of the most sweeping proposals would be to lower to 25 percent the tax rate for so-called pass-through businesses, which are currently taxed at the individual rates of their owners. Such a change would dramatically lower the taxes paid by the majority of American businesses. Some 95 percent of companies in the United States are structured as pass-through entities, generating the bulk of the government\u2019s tax revenues.\u201cA lower rate for pass-through entities is essential to ensuring small businesses are not left behind,\u201d said Jay Timmons, the chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers.Another major development, especially for big companies that have long complained about their tax rate, would be the proposed lowering of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, well below the current rate of 35 percent.\u201cA significantly lower corporate tax rate will help U.S. companies compete with companies from other industrialized countries and spur long-term economic growth,\u201d said Mr. Stephens. \u201cFor AT&T, we would step up our investments in the technology and next-generation networks that are engines of our modern economy.\u2019\u2019The White House said that a corporate tax rate of 20 percent would increase American competitiveness, bringing the rate below 22.5 percent, which is what it claimed was the average corporate tax rate in the industrialized world.But tax experts questioned the White House\u2019s accounting. \u201cTo use the 22.5 percent is simply intellectually dishonest,\u201d said Mr. Kleinbard of U.S.C. \u201cWe\u2019re including countries like Macau and Moldova in that number.\u201dRegardless of the benchmark, the White House is pushing a dramatic cut to the corporate tax rate. \u201cIt\u2019s going to increase corporate profits dramatically,\u201d said Mr. Willens, the tax expert who has advised companies for 40 years. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to contemplate after all these years of doing this.\u201dPerhaps the most dramatic suggestion in the tax plan is for a territorial tax system, which could allow multinational corporations to mostly avoid paying the United States government taxes on their overseas profits.Right now companies must pay steep taxes if they want to repatriate earnings made abroad, leading big corporations like Apple to keep billions of dollars overseas. And while details of the proposal were scarce, and may yet include some tax on foreign profits and a one-time repatriation tax on existing overseas profits, the broad outlines of the plan were good news for big business.\u201cMoving to a territorial system is unbelievable,\u201d said Mr. Willens. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to think that they are going to be able to repatriate foreign earnings without any tax at all.\u201dBusiness leaders, too, seemed to appreciate the fact that enacting a giant tax overhaul was no sure thing, especially after several failed attempts to overhaul the health care law.\u201cIt\u2019s crunchtime for Congress,\u201d said Mark A. Weinberger, chief executive of the financial services firm EY and chairman of the Business Roundtable\u2019s Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee. Claiming that the president\u2019s tax plan would \u201ccreate jobs and growth\u201d with lower tax rates, Mr. Weinberger said, \u201cCongress needs to preserve these elements and fill in the details quickly so the proposals can become law by year\u2019s end.\u201dAnd even if the broad outlines of the proposed tax overhaul do get passed, amounting to a windfall for businesses large and small, there is one way the plan could adversely impact the economy.\u201cThis isn\u2019t good for tax professionals,\u201d Mr. Willens said. \u201cThere are people who have spent their whole careers trying to figure out how to repatriate overseas profits and lower corporate taxes. If this goes through, there won\u2019t be much for them to do.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about the likely effects of President Trump\u2019s tax plan misidentified a tax expert who criticized the president\u2019s proposed tax cuts. It was Robert Willens \u2014 not Mark A. Weinberger, the chief executive of the financial services firm EY \u2014 who said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t good for tax professionals.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Return of the German Volk", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI would like to believe in the inoffensive nature of this four-letter word. I can\u2019t, not in Gauland\u2019s mouth. His statement raises the question: Take back Germany from whom? The immigrant rabble, I assume, and the half-breed hordes, and the Muslims who, for the AfD, serve as today\u2019s Jews.The clamor of Hitler was for \u201cFuhrer, Volk und Vaterland.\u201d Only membership of the Aryan Volk assured non-inclusion among the doomed masses. They, the others, were the \u201cuntermenschen,\u201d or sub-humans: the Jews destined for annihilation, the Slavs destined for slavery.In 1933, Victor Klemperer, the diarist of the Nazi era, wrote: \u201cYet again a new opportunity for celebration, a new national holiday for the people: Hitler\u2019s birthday. The term Volk (people) is now as customary in spoken and written language as salt at table, everything is spiced with a soup\u00e7on of Volk: Volksfest (festival of the people), Volksgenosse (comrade of the people), Volksgemeinschaft (community of the people.)\u201dThat would include, in a population of 82 million, more than one million recent immigrants (many of them Syrian). Last year, the Federal Statistical Office said that roughly 18.6 million people in Germany had a migrant background, or 23 percent of the population.There is a word in German for the population: \u201cBev\u00f6lkerung.\u201d It is as flat, straightforward and bland as \u201cVolk\u201d is charged, emotive and tribal. Between \u201cVolk\u201d and \u201cBev\u00f6lkerung,\u201d myth and migration, Germany has sought itself. On the whole it has done well.The something is a violent, reactionary current. It is a rightist, nativist, nationalist and, yes, \u201cv\u00f6lkisch\u201d reaction against globalization, against migration, against miscegenation, against the disappearance of borders and the blurring of genders, against the half-tones of political correctness, against Babel, against the stranger and the other, against the smug self-interested consensus of the urban, global elite.The indecipherable swirl and cacophony of the modern world feeds unease. Technology is a wonderful thing if you are putting it to use, less so if it is putting an end to your usefulness.Gauland wants Germany back but the Germany of his fantasy is gone, baby, gone. The British wanted their country back \u2014 and got the disaster of Brexit, a delusional act of irreparable self-harm.Enough Americans wanted something back \u2014 a weird, white-dominated pastiche of the 1950s utterly removed from the United States today \u2014 to elect Donald Trump, who keeps referring to the need to defend \u201cour people.\u201dAs in: \u201cWe need a travel ban for certain dangerous countries, not some politically correct term that won\u2019t help us protect our people.\u201dNow, \u201cour people,\u201d in the American case, refers to a nation of immigrants (including Trump\u2019s grandfather from Germany), but Trump\u2019s \u201cdefense,\u201d like Gauland\u2019s, targets immigrant hordes. As Marx observed, history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce.Still, the most dangerous thing would be to fail to take these rightist, xenophobic currents seriously, to assume they will go away because logically they should; after all, the world has moved on.But not all the world: wired metropolises yes, vast peripheries no. The worst form of liberal arrogance is to dismiss the forces that brought Trump to power and are feeding resurgent nationalism around the world. Nobody was ever persuaded by being made to feel stupid.The great danger is when they lose their meaning entirely, as with Trump; or are deployed to raise W. B. Yeats\u2019s \u201cblood-dimmed tide,\u201d as with Gauland. When both happen at once, beware.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Cities Wooing Amazon\u2019s New Headquarters, Nothing Is Too Strange", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Business leaders in Tucson have tried to mail Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, a 21-foot cactus. The largest conference room in the Tulsa, Okla., mayor\u2019s office has been converted to a war room, with 50 volunteers poring over videos of Mr. Bezos.In Philadelphia, hundreds of Wharton Business School students have a new fall semester assignment: Pitch the city to Amazon. And the mayor of Ottawa flew to Seattle last week to walk as close to Amazon\u2019s headquarters as is publicly accessible.\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018The Amazing Race,\u2019\u201d said Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this cast of characters running toward the Holy Grail.\u201dThat sometimes means going to extreme lengths to draw Mr. Bezos\u2019 eye. Is Mr. Bezos impressed?\u201cWe\u2019re energized by the response,\u201d said Adam Sedo, an Amazon spokesman. \u201cWe invited cities to think big, and we are starting to see their creativity.\u201dFor Jeff Cheney, the mayor of Frisco, Tex., a city of 160,000 about a half-hour drive from Dallas, the courtship includes offering to build his city around Amazon.\u201cOur city\u2019s only about 60 percent built out, so we\u2019ve got a lot of available land where we can build to suit,\u201d Mr. Cheney said. \u201cWe play to win. We\u2019re innovators. We\u2019re forward thinkers, and we\u2019re serious.\u201dCity applications are not due until Oct. 19, but Mr. Cheney has already sent a video letter to Amazon. The video opens on him holding an Amazon box and saying, \u201cAmazon, you\u2019re growing your business, and we want to grow with you.\u201d Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, is seen talking about catching the \u201cFrisco Flu,\u201d which the mayor\u2019s office said was a phrase Mr. Jones came up with. Mr. Cheney also gets a Jamba Juice (Jamba Juice is based in Frisco).Mayoral letters to Amazon are actually becoming a YouTube subgenre.In Canada, the selling point is, well, Canada.\u201cAmazon has something like 9,000 engineering jobs they can\u2019t fill. Our immigration policy is much more liberal,\u201d said Mr. Watson, Ottawa\u2019s mayor. \u201cThat\u2019s where we have an advantage.\u201dAnother city offering access to Canadian immigration as part of its deal is, surprisingly, Detroit. Working with nearby Windsor, Ontario, which is an eight-minute drive away, Detroit is portraying itself as the best of both worlds.Mr. Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans, has also built an Amazon war room, where more than 40 people are trying to analyze what the online retailer \u201clikes and doesn\u2019t like.\u201d They are also trying to read Mr. Bezos\u2019 psyche. \u201cHe\u2019s got hundreds of hours of videos on YouTube you can watch,\u201d Mr. Gilbert said.Mr. Gilbert is the largest private property owner in downtown Detroit, and he said he would move his tenants to temporary locations to make room for Amazon so the company did not have to wait for new offices to be built.Competitions for factories or stadiums are typically more private, but this one is playing out in the court of public opinion, said Lauren Hitt, who is managing the public side of the campaign for Philadelphia.\u201cThe competition started that Thursday morning when he announced it,\u201d Ms. Hitt said of Mr. Bezos. \u201cThe next weeks are basically going to be a sustained campaign.\u201dPhiladelphia\u2019s effort includes students from the Wharton School writing variations on the very same pitch: why Amazon should come to Philadelphia. This was the school\u2019s idea, said Ms. Hitt. Dozens of start-ups have also been asked to submit testimonials about the city\u2019s innovation economy and advice on how to approach Amazon.And Philadelphia, which sent a delegation to Seattle last week, is sending a larger delegation this week to \u201cget into the Jeff Bezos mind-set and ethos,\u201d Ms. Hitt said.The city would also consider overhauling its tax system for Amazon.\u201cHaving Amazon would mean global things for our tax system,\u201d Ms. Hitt said. \u201cWe do have business taxes, but that\u2019s something that could be looked at in the scope of Amazon coming here.\u201dG. T. Bynum, the mayor of Tulsa, which set up its own Amazon war room in his office, echoed Philadelphia\u2019s sentiment on taxes. He said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t worry at all\u201d about tax incentives going too far. \u201cThese are 50,000 jobs with the most innovative company in the world.\u201d\u201cWhatever it takes,\u201d he said.Tax policy experts are more skeptical of Amazon\u2019s bidding process and how much cities stand to benefit.\u201cWhy are they doing this whole dog and pony show? Amazon wants something for nothing,\u201d said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. \u201cThey would like a package of tax incentives for something they were going to do anyway.\u201dArt Rolnick, an economist at the University of Minnesota, called Amazon\u2019s bidding process \u2014 and the broader practice of cities competing for stadiums and factories \u2014 \u201cblackmail.\u201d\u201cIf you look at it from a national perspective, it\u2019s zero returns. Minnesota might win one, Wisconsin wins the next one. The company wins each time,\u201d Mr. Rolnick said. \u201cIt\u2019s corporate welfare.\u201dBut Mr. Gardner acknowledged that many cities really had no other course than to try to win Amazon. \u201cIf you ask any mayor, they\u2019ll say their first job is to bring good jobs to the city,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Amazon is promising to bring a lot of jobs.\u201dJoe Snell, a business leader with an economic development group in Tucson, was behind the recent shipment to Mr. Bezos of the local saguaro cactus, which he said was symbolic of the region\u2019s people.\u201cIt\u2019s a hardy plant. It can grow up to 40 feet. And that\u2019s Tucson,\u201d Mr. Snell said. \u201cWe\u2019re a community that\u2019s growing. We\u2019re adaptive. And we\u2019re durable.\u201dStill, Mr. Snell had achieved his goal.\u201cWe wanted to cut through the noise, and they definitely noticed it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when they choose Tucson, they can come out and experience a million saguaros.\u201dAn earlier version of an illustration with this article misspelled the name of one of the cities vying to be the home of Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.

{"Headline": "In Berlin, an Iconic Theater Gets a New Leader. Cue the Protests.", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Berlin\u2019s hulking, disused Tempelhof Airport has a long, winding history. Built by the Nazis, it was the site of the Berlin airlift and, more recently, of emergency housing for some of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who arrived in Germany in recent years. On Sunday afternoon, Berliners crowded on the tarmac outside the former terminal for a more festive occasion: a 10-hour dance event called \u201cFous de Danse\u201d organized by the city\u2019s Volksb\u00fchne theater.The event wasn\u2019t without tension, though. The performances marked the start of Chris Dercon\u2019s tenure as the director of the Volksb\u00fchne, one of the most influential theaters in the German-speaking world. The decision to appoint Mr. Dercon, the former director of Tate Modern in London, to run the institution has spurred an angry debate, one that has often conflated the issues surrounding his appointment with the larger challenges confronting Berlin, like gentrification, globalization and immigration.It has not always been a dignified debate. Along with the usual petition-signing, there have been ugly protests \u2014 some might call them a hazing \u2014 that even an avant-garde theater may find over the top.The Volksb\u00fchne, founded in 1890 as a theater for the working class and headquartered in an imposing building in the city\u2019s Mitte neighborhood, owes much of its recent international reputation to Frank Castorf, an icon of German theater who had led the Volksb\u00fchne for 25 years. During his tenure as director, Mr. Castorf established the theater as a home for ambitious, experimental productions \u2014 which could run for seven hours \u2014 often blending a punk-rock sensibility with high-minded ideas about politics and history.In early 2015, Berlin officials decided that Mr. Castorf would only be offered a shortened contract, effectively forcing him out. The appointment of Mr. Dercon, who had relatively little theater experience, was greeted with outrage.\u201cDercon definitely doesn\u2019t know anything about theater,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Kuttner, a director and performer who has been involved with the Volksb\u00fchne for 20 years.The reaction grew more intense after Mr. Dercon suggested that he would refocus the theater as an interdisciplinary space hosting international productions, which many saw as undermining the theater\u2019s ensemble tradition. In the summer of 2016, about 200 people affiliated with the Volksb\u00fchne signed an open letter warning of \u201cthe destruction of originality and obstinacy, which has gained the Volksb\u00fchne an international reputation and worldwide recognition.\u201d Another open letter in support of Mr. Dercon appeared a few weeks later, signed by many prominent figures in the art world.Since then, the ongoing conflict has become favorite fodder for Berlin newspapers. Mr. Dercon and his team\u2019s access to the Volksb\u00fchne building was restricted. At Mr. Castorf\u2019s request, the \u201crobber wheel,\u201d a statue that stood on the lawn in front of the theater and which had become an icon of Berlin as well as of the Volksb\u00fchne, was removed. (Mr. Castorf did not respond to a request for comment.) An online petition arguing that officials should reopen the debate about the future of the Volksb\u00fchne has gathered over 40,000 signatures since July. Over two weeks this summer, feces were left anonymously in front of Mr. Dercon\u2019s office.\u201cThat was the limit,\u201d said Mr. Dercon of the feces incident. The 59-year-old was sitting on a structure built by the Burkina Faso-born architect Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 inside Tempelhof\u2019s hangar space. \u201cIt is about more than me or the theater. There is the rage and the anger in this country, in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are angry about change \u2014 they are angry about what is going to change, how it is going to change.\u201dAs Mr. Dercon pointed out, the Volksb\u00fchne has become a symbol for the city\u2019s ongoing debate about its future amid rapid gentrification. After decades of gritty poverty, Berlin\u2019s economy has become one of the fastest-growing in Germany. In many parts of the city, apartment prices have soared, and the city is facing a widespread housing shortage.\u201cThe Volksb\u00fchne is a symbol of the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall,\u201d said Amelie Deuflhard, the director of Kampnagel, a performing arts venue in Hamburg, who has been closely following the debate. \u201cThere were all of these spaces that were empty, they cost almost nothing. You could open a gallery anywhere. All that has gone.\u201d Mr. Castorf\u2019s Volksb\u00fchne, she pointed out, embodied the period\u2019s scrappy aesthetic and often grappled with the ideological questions raised by the collapse of Communism.Others see the change as a threat to the German theatrical tradition in which subsidized local theaters produce new work with a core staff, while others view it as an attempt to make the theater more palatable to tourists. According to the office for statistics for the states of Berlin and Brandenburg, the number of annual visitors to Berlin has almost doubled in the past decade, to nearly 13 million. \u201cA Castorf play that lasts seven hours is a challenge and imposition, it is not the kind of thing that will entertain Czech bus tourists,\u201d said Mr. Kuttner.Supporters of Mr. Dercon have accused his opponents of conservatism and xenophobia. Unlike the Berlin-born Mr. Castorf, Mr. Dercon is Belgian and has spent much of his life in New York and London. On the Volksb\u00fchne\u2019s Facebook page, one commenter compared opponents of Mr. Dercon to the \u201cangry citizens\u201d who take part in anti-immigrant rallies in the eastern German city of Dresden.Mr. Dercon says he consciously put together a program that includes international artists, with works by the Syrian playwright Mohammad al-Attar and the British-German artist Tino Sehgal, as well as a project involving the Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul, as a way of marking the city\u2019s increasingly global culture. \u201cIf there is a city where the most and the best international artists are living, it\u2019s Berlin,\u201d he said.The event on Sunday was billed as an \u201cinvitation to a city, to perform itself,\u201d and included performances by the famed choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, who performed a looping solo as the sun set over the building. At one point, the audience formed a \u201cgiant soul train\u201d; more than a hundred people, including many children, enthusiastically shimmied their way across the tarmac to blaring funk music.The next big step will take place on Sept. 30, when Mr. Dercon\u2019s Volksb\u00fchne will present its first play, \u201cIphigenia,\u201d by Mr. Attar in the hangar at Tempelhof. For a long time it was unclear if the theater would be allowed to use the space given the needs for refugee housing. Mr. Dercon pointed to a row of abandoned signs for the residents. \u201cI feel almost like a refugee,\u201d he said. \u201cI got my permit to stay.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Type of Labor Law for a New Type of Worker", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsLabor Day was born in the late 19th century, during a time of raw fear about the path of economic development. Opportunities for decent, middle-class livelihoods seemed to be shrinking, and the \u201claboring classes\u201d confronted a grim future of what many called wage slavery. Conservatives held most of the seats of power, but reform-minded politicians, activists and policy mavens were thinking big about labor\u2019s rights and wrongs.Lately, driven by a sense that decent work is becoming a thing of the past, liberals and progressives have been thinking big about these things again: The Democratic congressional leadership has proposed a $15 minimum wage and a huge infrastructure investment, while the Center for American Progress has proposed a New Deal-style federal jobs guarantee. Those are good ideas. But good ideas about economic and social policy aren\u2019t enough.We can\u2019t hope to build a more equitable economy unless working people have strong organizations of their own. During and after the New Deal, unions were essential to forging a broad new middle class \u2014 not only because they raised wages and benefits, but also because they countered corporate and financial political power, which today is the greatest impediment to serious change. Without a rejuvenated labor movement, it\u2019s almost inconceivable that breakthrough reforms will come to pass.Democratic lawmakers know that their party was founded on the proposition that concentrated wealth seeks to convert its economic power into political power and that left to its own devices, it puts our democracy at risk. A new workers\u2019 movement would also be a bulwark against the old Jeffersonian nightmare of rule by a self-perpetuating economic oligarchy. For both reasons, progressive lawmakers and policy analysts need to promote a new generation of labor organizations.They can do that by putting labor-law reform at the top of their agenda. The National Labor Relations Act was written in the 1930s, when big factories and large industrial companies dominated our economy; its provisions are a terrible fit for today\u2019s economy in two basic ways.First, because it arose out of the struggles of factory workers with big corporate employers, our labor law encourages bargaining at the employer or work-site level. This made sense when most workers were in large factories. But today\u2019s workplaces are much smaller, even if they are owned or controlled by big corporations. Fast food workers are split among thousands of locations. Janitors labor in small groups, at night, out of the public eye. Warehouse workers in Wal-Mart and Target\u2019s supply chains are often employed by temporary agencies and hired by day or even hour to load trucks. Uber drivers and Amazon delivery drivers work alone.Second, our labor law holds businesses accountable only to the workers whom they \u201cemploy\u201d in an old-fashioned, contractual sense. That too made sense in the industrial era, when leading companies had millions of employees. But today, janitors, Amazon delivery drivers and warehouse workers are often employed by subcontractors who have little real power over their livelihoods. And Uber and Lyft drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. As a result, these workers don\u2019t have clear rights to bargain with the companies that actually set the rules. And these workers are subject to big restrictions on striking or picketing against such \u201cthird party\u201d companies.A few simple but bold legal reforms would make a world of difference. First, Congress could pass laws to promote multi-employer bargaining, or even bargaining among all companies in an industry. If all hotel brands, all fast-food brands, all grocers or all local delivery companies bargained together, none would be placed at a competitive disadvantage as a result of unionization, which is often the main reason employers resist it so fiercely. Second, Congress could ensure that organized workers can bargain with the companies that actually profit from their work by expanding the legal definition of employment to cover more categories of workers.Smart organizers are already working toward just this sort of labor relations model. Fast Food Forward, the group that has been organizing fast-food workers to demand $15 an hour and a union, is one. Rather than going store by store, they have been taking the fight to the streets and to social media, pushing major chains to take responsibility for working conditions both in their own stores and among franchisees. Strengthening bargaining rights as we\u2019ve suggested could make that vision a reality.As long as that isn\u2019t yet possible at the national level, progressive states like New York and California, or cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, could develop this sort of model within their own jurisdictions. That would require modest progressive reform out of Congress, making national labor protections a floor but not a ceiling, just as it has already done with wage, hour and anti-discrimination laws. But that way, as in the pre-New Deal era, states and even cities could experiment with how to empower new sorts of worker organizations.Ideas like these cut against the grain of mainstream debate, which assumes that rebuilding the industrial sector is the key to a broad middle-class economy. There is nothing wrong, and much right, with such efforts. Still, the reality is that a great majority of today\u2019s working class is no longer in factories, and will never be again. Organized and united under new labor laws that they had a hand in achieving, retail, hospitality, health care and other service workers could become a solid, multiracial working-class base for a progressive Democratic Party.William E.

MacEachen, Canada\u2019s first deputy prime minister and a legislator whose mastery of parliamentary politics ensured the country\u2019s adoption of national health care and other far-reaching social programs, died on Sept. 12 in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. He was 96.His estate announced his death, at a hospital there.Mr. MacEachen lived in East Ainslie Lake, Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, the area where he was born and which he represented as a member of Parliament. Over the decades he sat in the House of Commons and the Senate, where he was appointed as a member of the Liberal Party.Mr. MacEachen was a key parliamentary operative for two Liberal Party prime ministers, Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Elliot Trudeau, and held several senior cabinet positions under them.\u201cApart from prime ministers, MacEachen was probably the most significant parliamentarian of the postwar era,\u201d said Tom Axworthy, who was Mr. Trudeau\u2019s principal secretary. \u201cMr. Trudeau didn\u2019t do anything in the House without first getting the views of MacEachen.\u201dParties on the right, with the support of the private health insurance industry, rejected the plan, saying it would intrude on provincial powers, undermine doctors and cost too much. Mr. MacEachen, who was minister of health and welfare in the Pearson government, found himself fighting cabinet colleagues who thought that the plan would be financially ruinous.At the same time, the New Democratic Party, which was to the left of the Liberals, criticized the proposal for not going far enough in its medical coverage. It wanted dental care, prescription drugs and other services, like eyeglasses, to be covered as well.It is generally accepted that Mr. MacEachen was largely responsible for winning over the New Democrats, allowing the legislation to pass and then, as health minister, pushing government administrators to implement the new system swiftly.At Mr. MacEachen\u2019s funeral on Sunday in Antigonish, a small town about 35 miles west of Cape Breton Island, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a Liberal and the son of Pierre Trudeau, said Mr. MacEachen\u2019s political skills had been essential to the introduction of universal health care and other social programs, including an expanded national pension plan for low-income Canadians.\u201cCanadians are living in a country that Allan J. built, and they like it,\u201d the Canadian Press news agency quoted Mr. Trudeau as saying. \u201cSeniors are living in dignity because of the old-age supplement. We all enjoy health care according to our needs, rather than our ability to pay.\u201dIn addition to having an encyclopedic knowledge of parliamentary rules and precedents, Mr. Axworthy said, Mr. MacEachen maintained a network of contacts in all the political parties and, just as important, demonstrated a remarkable political sixth sense.\u201cAllan had an almost innate ability to go into the House like a bloodhound and sniff the atmosphere,\u201d he said.Mr. MacEachen then persuaded the Liberals to take Mr. Trudeau back as leader. After his return as prime minister, Mr. Trudeau achieved his lifelong goal of getting Parliament and the provinces, except Quebec, to approve a Canadian constitution to replace the 19th-century British legislation under which the country had been governed.Allan Joseph MacEachen was born on July 6, 1921, in Inverness, on Cape Breton Island, to Angus MacEachen, a coal miner, and the former Annie Gillies. Like many in the region, his family was impoverished.He outlived his three brothers and two sisters and left no immediate survivors.After earning his undergraduate degree, Mr. MacEachen went on to acquire a master\u2019s degree in political economy at the University of Toronto, studied economics at the University of Chicago and started doctoral studies in economics and social science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before returning to St. Francis Xavier as a professor of economics.Mr. MacEachen successfully ran for Parliament in 1953 and was re-elected eight times and defeated once. He left the Senate 1996 at the mandatory retirement age of 75.\u201cYou certainly kept bread on the table here in the north all those years,\u201d Mr. MacEachen quoted one constituent, a farmworker, as telling him.

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Will Hear Case on Mandatory Fees to Unions", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a case that could deal a crushing blow to organized labor.It was one of 11 cases the justices added to the court\u2019s docket from the roughly 2,000 petitions seeking review that had piled up during the court\u2019s summer break.In the labor case, the court will consider whether public-sector unions may require workers who are not members to help pay for collective bargaining. If the court\u2019s answer is no, unions would probably lose a substantial source of revenue.A ruling allowing workers to refuse to pay the fees would be the culmination of a decades-long campaign by conservative groups aimed at weakening unions that represent public employees.An Illinois law requires government workers who choose not to join a union to \u201cpay their proportionate share of the costs of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment.\u201d The Supreme Court has said that such laws are constitutional.But it is constitutional, the court added, to require nonmembers to help pay for the union\u2019s collective bargaining efforts to prevent freeloading and to ensure \u201clabor peace.\u201dThe challengers in the new case, Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, No. 16-1466, asked the court to overrule the Abood decision. All compulsory fees, they argued, violate the First Amendment because the subjects of labor negotiations between unions and the government are all matters of public concern.Unions reject the First Amendment arguments, saying that collective bargaining is different from political activity. They said the plaintiffs were seeking to reap the benefits of such bargaining without paying their fair share of the cost.Union leaders reacted to the court\u2019s decision to hear the case with dismay bordering on alarm. \u201cThis case is yet another example of corporate interests using their power and influence to launch a political attack on working people and rig the rules of the economy in their own favor,\u201d Lee Saunders, the president of the union in the case, said in a statement.Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which represents Mr. Janus, said he was pleased the court had agreed to step in.\u201dWe are now one step closer,\u201d he said in a statement, \u201cto freeing over five million public sector teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other employees from the injustice of being forced to subsidize a union as a condition of working for their own government.\u201dThe Supreme Court also agreed to hear a pair of cases about searches of vehicles in unusual circumstances. In one, Collins v. Virginia, No. 16-1027, the police entered the driveway of a suspect\u2019s house without permission, inspected a parked motorcycle covered by a tarp and learned that it was stolen.The exception is based on the \u201cready mobility\u201d of vehicles. The state Supreme Court ruled that the exception applies even when a vehicle is stationary and on private property. \u201cRegardless of whether it was \u2018immediately mobile\u2019 at the precise moment of the search,\u201d the court said, \u201cthe motorcycle and its rider nonetheless posed a significant flight risk.\u201dThe second case involving a vehicle search the justices agreed to hear concerned Terrence Byrd, who was driving a rental car with the renter\u2019s permission but was not listed as an authorized driver on the rental agreement when he was stopped for a traffic violation in Pennsylvania. A search of the car uncovered drugs.The Supreme Court is now poised to resolve that dispute in the case, Byrd v. United States, No. 16-1371.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says Decision on \u2018Dreamers\u2019 Program Will Come Soon", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Friday said he would announce a decision by Tuesday on whether he will end the Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, declaring, \u201cWe love the Dreamers\u201d even as his White House grappled with how to wind down their legal status.Mr. Trump has agonized publicly over the fate of immigrants who were brought to the United States without authorization as children, and who are now protected from deportation and allowed to work under the five-year-old program created by his predecessor.In recent days, White House officials have recommended that the president end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, which currently shields about 800,000 undocumented immigrants who would be subject to potential deportation to countries that many of them have not seen since birth.Several administration officials said that Mr. Trump is likely to phase out the program, but his advisers have engaged in a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate over precisely how to do so. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because no decision was final, also cautioned that the president was conflicted about the issue and could suddenly change his mind.Asked on Friday whether DACA recipients, often called Dreamers, should be worried, Mr. Trump did not respond directly, but he did express his sympathy.\u201cWe love the Dreamers \u2014 we love everybody,\u201d the president said in the Oval Office, surrounded by faith leaders after signing a proclamation of a day of prayer for those affected by Hurricane Harvey. \u201cWe think the Dreamers are terrific.\u201dLater, he told reporters he had \u201cgreat feeling for DACA,\u201d while declining to answer repeated questions about whether he believes the program is legal.But in recent days, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, have privately made it clear to Mr. Trump that they could not defend the program in court, and a group of state attorneys general led by Ken Paxton in Texas have threatened to mount a legal challenge if the president did not act to end it by Tuesday.Complicating the calculus for Mr. Trump has been the storm pummeling Texas, the state with the second-highest concentration of DACA recipients, after California. John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, has argued privately that the president can take his time on the decision, given that Mr. Paxton is unlikely to follow through on his threat in the short term, with parts of his state under water, two officials said.And it is not lost on the president that ending the program now \u2014 with many Dreamers directly impacted by Harvey \u2014 would appear particularly hardhearted.Asked Friday whether the Dreamers impacted by the storm in Texas and Louisiana were weighing on the president as he contemplated the fate of the program, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said: \u201cThe decision itself is weighing on him, certainly.\u201dThat much was evident on Friday, as Mr. Trump sent mixed messages about when the final call would come.In a midday appearance in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump first told reporters the decision was at hand, scheduled for later Friday or over the weekend. About an hour later, during another set of off-the-cuff Oval Office remarks, he said the final word would come over the weekend, or Monday at the latest. Only two hours after that, Ms. Sanders pushed the timeline still further, saying the announcement would come on Tuesday.As the White House struggled to get its rollout in place, pressure was building from a diverse coalition of supporters, including immigration advocacy groups, business executives and some elected Republican officials, for Mr. Trump to keep the program.\u201cI actually don\u2019t think he should do that,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said of ending DACA as he spoke to a radio station in his home state of Wisconsin. \u201cI believe that this is something Congress has to fix.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Republican, issued a statement saying, \u201cI\u2019ve urged the president not to rescind DACA.\u201d He called for a permanent legislative solution to address recipients\u2019 legal status.Republican Governor Rick Scott of Florida also weighed in late Friday, issuing a statement in which he said, \u201cI do not favor punishing children for the actions of their parents.\u201cThese kids must be allowed to pursue the American dream,\u201d Mr. Scott said, \u201cand Congress must act on this immediately.\u201d\u201cDreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy,\u201d wrote the executives, who included Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard and Mary Barra of General Motors, a former member of Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory council. \u201cThey are part of why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.\u201dYet even their zeal seemed to be waning as Mr. Trump continued to push off a decision on what should be done. On Friday, one of the attorneys general, Herbert H. Slatery III of Tennessee, said in a letter to Senator Bob Corker, another Republican of Tennessee, that he no longer supported moving forward with a legal challenge to DACA. \u201cThere is a human element,\u201d to the issue \u201cthat is not lost on me and should not be ignored,\u201d Mr. Slatery wrote.He also called for action by Congress to normalize the Dreamers\u2019 status, through legislation co-sponsored by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois.Pro-immigration activists argued it would be particularly callous for Mr. Trump to end the program as Texas is struggling to recover from Harvey.\u201cIf DACA were to be repealed, they\u2019re going to be going after many young immigrants and families that have been affected by Harvey, that have been trying to keep their lives together,\u201d said Efr\u00e9n C. Olivares, the racial and economic justice director at the Texas Civil Rights Project. \u201cConsidering a repeal of DACA would be just shocking for anyone who claims to care about Texas and its communities.\u201dOscar Hernandez, a DACA recipient who is an organizer at United We Dream Houston, joined a conference call on Friday arranged by supporters of the program from the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston where he was helping families displaced by the storm, vowing, \u201cWe\u2019re here to stay.\u201dIn the community of young, undocumented immigrants, that sentiment was broadly felt.\u201cI thought I was very distant from the days of life without DACA,\u201d said Marcela Zhou, a 26-year-old third-year medical student at the University of California at Los Angeles, who was born in Mexico. \u201cIt is scary to go back to that uncertainty.\u201dMiriam Jordan contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China\u2019s Economy Slows, \u2018Business Cults\u2019 Prey on Young Job Seekers", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTIANJIN, China \u2014 Some look like high-tech firms, promising young college graduates a fast track to riches. Others pose as charitable groups on a membership drive, or companies building a sales network for a new product. Tens of millions across China are signing up \u2014 and learning that all is not as advertised.Behind these groups is a looming challenge for the ruling Communist Party: A proliferation of pyramid schemes that have attracted enormous followings and huge sums of money, exploiting \u2014 and exacerbating \u2014 widespread anxiety over a slowing economy.New recruits are asked to hand over cash and persuade others to do the same. The more people they bring in, the more they and their bosses earn. But if too many people quit or the schemes run out of new members willing to pay, the pyramids collapse, bankrupting families in a chain reaction and adding to the strains on the Chinese financial system.Mr. Li had moved to Tianjin for a position as a software developer, desperate for a job his parents in rural China would deem worthy of the education they helped pay for. But when he showed up for work, the people there demanded he borrow hundreds of dollars and hand it over, according to his family and the police.Mr. Li\u2019s death and a spate of similar cases have prompted a national uproar, in part because college graduates have long enjoyed special status in Chinese society. For many Chinese, the groups preying on them are a symptom of broader problems in the country: vast inequality, a crisis of values and a freewheeling economy that can sometimes resemble the Wild West.But the government recently warned that pyramid schemes were spreading faster and getting bigger, in part through social media. The high returns they promise are all the more enticing as economic growth has slowed, especially given the dearth of reliable investment options for ordinary Chinese.While pyramid swindlers in China have traditionally focused on older people, the business cults exploit highly educated youth from poorer families, law enforcement officials say. In doing so, they are seizing on the anxieties of a generation willing to go to great lengths to avoid the shame of unemployment.Hundreds of young people across China have been caught in the schemes in recent months, according to Chinese news reports, including many in Tianjin, a cosmopolitan port city and tech hub near Beijing.The groups have grown skilled at playing into the ambitions of young Chinese eager to join start-ups. Victims are often lured to remote rural areas, where they live in closed communities and are indoctrinated with rags-to-riches tales. Some groups advertise on popular job-hunting sites and explain drab facilities and cramped conditions by saying they are cultivating a \u201cstart-up environment,\u201d former members said.Several participants have died under mysterious circumstances.Zhang Chao, 25, suffered heatstroke and died while being held by swindlers in Tianjin in July, the police said. His body was dumped alongside a road.Lin Huarong, 20, who had fought with organizers of a pyramid scheme, was found dead in a river last month in the central province of Hubei.Qu Pengxu, 24, was discovered floating in a lake in March. The police said he appeared to have been fleeing a group near Tianjin.Many young people join and stay in the groups voluntarily, excited by promises of fancy cars, overseas travel and lavish meetings where money is handed out in dramatic fashion.In reality, law enforcement officials say, many of the investment schemes are sophisticated ruses with the sole purpose of enriching the founders.Liu Jinpeng, 22, a student in the southern province of Guangdong, said he was excited when his girlfriend got him a summer internship at her company, which she described as a biotechnology firm. But he realized something was wrong when he arrived for work in early July.She suddenly told him the company actually specialized in cosmetics. The company then took his phone and asked him to pay a membership fee of more than $400.Mr. Liu said the group assigned someone to guard him round the clock for nearly three weeks and packed his schedule with activities to brainwash him.\u201cEvery single day your mind wouldn\u2019t have time to rest,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t give you any alone time.\u201dHe tried throwing a note out a window with the words \u201cSave me.\u201d Eventually, he managed to retrieve his phone and get a message to the police, who rescued him but did not make any arrests, he said.To win the trust of new members, the groups often deploy loved ones and trusted friends to offer testimonials.Li Zhengliang, a college student in eastern China, said he gladly accepted when a high school friend invited him last year to visit Tianjin. But his friend then introduced him to young men who spoke about making millions of dollars by tricking people into investing in a mysterious product. When he tried to leave, the men blocked his way and threatened him with a knife.\u201cI was so desperate and so scared,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cI thought I was doomed.\u201dMr. Li escaped three days later and reported the group to the police in Tianjin, he said, but they dropped the case after only chastising the young men.Li Wenxing, the young man found dead in a pond, was duped by a posting for an $800-a-month position as a Java programmer at the Tianjin branch of a real Beijing technology company.Mr. Li had hoped the job would allow him to repay his parents for the money they spent on his programming classes, according to a friend, Wang Xing. He was so determined to save money, Mr. Wang said, that he skipped going out to meals.The police have detained five members of a 7,000-person group known as Diebeilei in connection with Mr. Li\u2019s death, according to the state news media.The authorities have said it was unlikely Mr. Li was murdered, but they have not determined how he died, according to an uncle of his who asked not to be named.

But many companies could not avoid Irma\u2019s destruction as it battered nearly every part of the region\u2019s tightly intertwined economy.Florida\u2019s amusement parks and attractions emerged relatively unscathed from the storm \u2014 physically, at least.The real pain will come in the next few months, as Irma causes a psychological ripple effect through the state that may discourage families from planning trips, said Dennis Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services, a consulting firm in Cincinnati.\u201cOrlando lives, breathes, thrives on tourists, and the theme parks are the drivers of that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a really hard loss \u2014 hundreds of millions of dollars in aggregate for the industry down there.\u201dLast year, 68 million tourists visited Orlando, and more than 70 million were expected this year, Mr. Speigel said. But much of the supporting infrastructure of hotels and restaurants has lost power, access to transit and regular deliveries of supplies.\u201cThese trips are planned six to eight months in advance, with the average family of four spending somewhere in the $7,000 to $8,000 range,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve lost a day, you\u2019ve lost that day and you can\u2019t get it back.\u201dThe Magic Kingdom has shut down only four other times in its nearly 46-year history \u2014 each time for an incoming hurricane. Tickets start at $99 for a single day.Disney\u2019s dozens of resort hotels in the state remained open during the storm. The company canceled several events and offered guests several refund or ticket exchange options.\u2014 Tiffany HsuAir traffic in Florida ground to a halt over the weekend, with more than 9,000 flights canceled at airports in Irma\u2019s path by Monday afternoon.Major air carriers hustled to clear their equipment and employees out of affected areas before the storm hit. Delta Air Lines might have benefited from the timing of the hurricane: The airline has been operating a scaled-back schedule since Labor Day, an adjustment it makes at the end of each summer in response to declining demand \u2014 giving it more flexibility.\u201cWe were able to put larger aircraft or add additional flights into the market to allow people to travel out ahead of the storm,\u201d said Anthony Black, a spokesman for Delta.Airlines were gradually returning to their normal flight schedules, though many planes remained grounded as the storm churned north.Although industry analysts said it was too soon to pin down Irma\u2019s cost, airlines factor extreme weather into their planning.\u201cIt\u2019s the cost of doing business as a global airline and working in these kinds of environments,\u201d said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American Airlines. \u201cWe know there can be hurricanes in Florida.\u201dOperations were returning to normal as weather conditions improved and airports confirmed that equipment was functioning and that Transport Security Administration and passport control checkpoints were accessible.\u2014 Zach WichterShares of insurers with exposure in Florida bounced back Monday after Miami avoided taking a direct hit from the hurricane, which inflicted less damage than expected on the state\u2019s Atlantic coast.Universal Insurance Holdings, the parent of Universal Property & Casualty Insurance, the state\u2019s second-biggest carrier, was up more than 13 percent for the day. Its stock had dropped 15 percent on Thursday, then regained some of that ground Friday.Insurer strength could be more of an issue in Florida than it was with Hurricane Harvey in Texas, where most of the damage was from flooding, a peril covered by the federal government. Wind damage, a much bigger factor in Florida, is covered by standard homeowners\u2019 policies.AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling firm in Boston, predicted on Monday that Irma\u2019s insured damage in the United States would cost the industry $20 billion to $40 billion.\u2014 Mary Williams WalshBefore the storm arrived, rental car companies transported their vehicles elsewhere or to higher ground when possible. But once firms assess the condition of their fleets, many are expected to work with federal and state agencies and insurance adjusters to make vehicles available for rent to assist in recovery efforts.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get these folks into vehicles as soon as possible so they can come in for the recovery process,\u201d said Lisa Martini, a spokeswoman for Enterprise Holdings, which owns Enterprise, Alamo and National.Those companies and others, including Hertz and Avis Budget Group, are waiving certain fees, such as charges for late returns, one-way drop-offs and cancellations, to ease travel in affected areas.Christopher Agnew, a senior research analyst at MKM Partners, said he expected the rental car industry to lose profits early on, but to rebound eventually.\u2014 Zach WichterSeveral cruise companies canceled or cut short trips in the Caribbean and redeployed some of the hulking ocean liners to aid in hurricane relief efforts as ports in Miami, the Everglades, Canaveral and Tampa remained closed Monday.Royal Caribbean canceled two cruises to Cuba and the Bahamas, rerouting the ships to help areas ravaged by the storm, and rescheduled four other trips. Before transporting stranded travelers to Puerto Rico, the company\u2019s Majesty of the Seas ship delivered ice, water, garbage bags, medical supplies and other provisions to St. Thomas and St. John.Royal Caribbean said it would refund all fares and fees for the two canceled cruises and offer a 25 percent credit for new cruises booked in the near future.Norwegian Cruise Lines sent two ships, the Norwegian Sky and the Norwegian Escape, to Miami on Thursday to allow more than 6,000 passengers to disembark ahead of the storm. The company chartered flights to Atlanta for some passengers and booked hotel rooms for others.The Sky then traveled to St. Thomas to pick up 2,000 stranded tourists, said Vanessa Picariello, a spokeswoman for the company.\u2014 Vivian WangAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Does Not Need Boots on Afghan Ground", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW DELHI \u2014 President Trump has pivoted toward India and away from Pakistan. Calling upon India to help in Afghanistan, \u201cespecially in the area of economic assistance and development,\u201d Mr. Trump was holding up the prospect of a major Indian presence to goad Pakistan to crack down on the Taliban and deny them sanctuary.Indian policy makers were pleased with Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt warning to Pakistan to stop \u201chousing the very terrorists that we are fighting,\u201d but Indian officials know the American president is neither measured nor consistent.It is because Pakistan insists that if the Taliban are to be persuaded to join peace talks over Afghanistan and the supply lines through Pakistan to the United States forces are not disrupted or stopped, the United States must not allow an Indian security presence in Afghanistan.In the early years after the fall of the Taliban, Indian policy makers were miffed at being prevented from putting a security presence on the ground. In 2011, India signed a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Afghanistan, which enabled India to provide direct military support \u2014 initially trainers but potentially combat troops if the need arose.Indians are conscious of the limited leverage the United States has over Pakistan. Mr. Trump, like his predecessors, is likely to ease the squeeze after Pakistan sacrifices some jihadi pawns to save the king and queen.But the Indian presence in Afghanistan rests on deeper cultural foundations than United States support. Any evaluation of India\u2019s options requires an understanding of the close, even inexplicable, friendship between the two peoples who seldom meet. The irrational friendship toward India among Afghans of every stripe \u2014 Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Ubeks, Communists, Islamists, everyone \u2014 stems from the soft power that India projects in Afghanistan.Afghans avidly consume Hindi language soap operas and Bollywood films, which create a perception of India as a utopian idyll of noble friendships and relatively chaste romances where the good folks always win. Paradoxically, the physical distance between India and Afghanistan brings their people even closer in their common dislike of Pakistan, which separates them geographically.On several occasions, on learning that I am Indian, Afghan airport security officers insisted that I pull my bags off the scanning machine since checking them would be insulting a friend. Over years of travel in Afghanistan, I encountered surliness just once, while interviewing an Afghan currency dealer for a television network. After the interview, it emerged he had mistaken me for a Pakistani. The Afghan apologized profusely and insisted on a retake.The Taliban field commanders and fighters I have met, who many assume would be hostile to India owing to the support they receive from Pakistan, display the same disdain for Pakistan and affection for India as the average Afghan. One senior Taliban official reproached me for India\u2019s failure in 1979 to condemn the Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan. But he returned quickly to criticizing the domineering control of \u201cPunjabis,\u201d as Afghans disparagingly call Pakistanis.Sustaining this priceless Afghan affection for India is the fact that Indian troops have never spilled Afghan blood \u2014 not in the anti-Soviet jihad in the 1980s, nor the civil war in the 1990s, nor through the insurgency after 2002.The combat-weary Afghans associate India\u2019s presence with Kabul\u2019s biggest children\u2019s hospital and medical missions in their major cities that treated hundreds of thousands until some Indian doctors who manned them were killed in Kabul in 2010.Each project allocates up to a million dollars for a health, education or rural development project \u2014 such as building an irrigation channel for a village to bring water from a mountain stream to its fields.India merely selects and finances the project and provides technical oversight; the local community takes ownership of the project and executes the work on the ground. The wave of good will for India generated by the S.D.P.s has encouraged New Delhi to allocate a larger share of Indian development aid to these projects.Mr. Trump\u2019s call for a greater Indian developmental role in Afghanistan hardly constitutes a dilemma for New Delhi. India could oblige Mr. Trump, while simultaneously furthering its own interests, by doubling down on an aid-based strategy in Afghanistan.Ajai Shukla, a retired Indian Army colonel, is a consulting editor for Business Standard newspaper in New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bridgewater\u2019s Ray Dalio Spreads His Gospel of \u2018Radical Transparency\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "Mr. Dalio has created an unusual and confrontational workplace at Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund firm. With a new book, he hopes to inject his ideas into the mainstream.Supported byAs thousands of Egyptians took to the streets during the Arab Spring protests of 2011, Ray Dalio, a hedge fund billionaire, decided to sail the Nile River with some friends, including some other financiers.It was a risky place to be, with the Middle East convulsed, and Mr. Dalio\u2019s trip raised concerns at the Connecticut headquarters of his company, Bridgewater Associates. But his security team couldn\u2019t get him to change his plans, so they set up a special team to track him and his group by GPS, hoping to keep him out of trouble.You could say that Mr. Dalio was applying one of his very own rules, known internally as Principle 188: \u201cIf you make a plan, follow through!\u201dOver four decades, Mr. Dalio, 68, has built Bridgewater, which has $160 billion in assets, into the largest hedge fund firm in the world \u2014 bigger than the next two largest hedge funds combined. He manages money for some of the largest companies, big public pensions, sovereign wealth funds and even some central banks. He has become a financier-statesman, of sorts, consulting with political leaders in China, the Middle East and elsewhere.He has also built an unusual and confrontational workplace at Bridgewater, where employees hold each other to account by following a strict set of rules that he created, \u201cPrinciples.\u201d He began developing the rules, which number more than 200, two decades ago based on his life experiences.Some, like advising employees not to \u201ctolerate badness,\u201d are self-evident. Others \u2014 \u201clook for people who sparkle\u201d; \u201cbe willing to \u2018shoot the people you love\u2019\u201d \u2014 are more unconventional.All of the rules celebrate what Mr. Dalio calls \u201cradical transparency\u201d in the workplace, and the search for the ideal employee. Those ideals stand in stark contrast to Bridgewater\u2019s reputation as particularly secretive when it come to its trading, even for an industry where secrecy about investing is the norm.Now, Mr. Dalio hopes that others will embrace his ideas about the future of work as he embarks on a big public push to promote his Principles. But is corporate America ready for his sometimes contradictory vision of radical transparency?The effort to establish Mr. Dalio as a business icon in the vein of Steve Jobs or Warren E. Buffett comes even as questions persist about Bridgewater\u2019s unusual culture. The firm videotapes nearly everything that goes on there for future case studies, and employees are given homework and graded on their understanding of Principles.In interviews with nearly 50 current and former Bridgewater employees, including several chosen by Mr. Dalio, The New York Times found that he is driven to enforce his rules to ensure that they survive at the firm. Some senior executives have been taken to task in \u201cpublic hangings\u201d \u2014 one of the Principles meant to \u201cdeter bad behavior\u201d \u2014 when they break the rules. Other employees have been pushed to tears.The Times also found that Bridgewater\u2019s investment process is largely a secret not only to investors but to most of the firm\u2019s 1,500 employees. No more than a dozen people have a full sense of how the firm trades.Even employees who left with a positive experience describe a workplace that is rigid and sometimes oppressive.\u201cIs it a hedge fund, or a social experiment?\u201d said Tim Bradley, a technology consultant who worked at Bridgewater for a year in 2010.Bridgewater, in a statement, said that people either thrived in the firm\u2019s \u201cunique culture\u201d or \u201cthey dislike it and decide to move on.\u201dNestled amid pine trees and hidden from the main road, the serene setting of Bridgewater\u2019s headquarters in Westport, Conn., is beloved by employees. Many also find the work intellectually stimulating.Plucked from top schools, most of those hired by the firm arrive with little or no expertise in the world of finance. They work hard, and party equally hard at off-site retreats sometimes held at the Lookout, a firm-owned guesthouse where meals are cooked by Bridgewater chefs, or at Mr. Dalio\u2019s house in Vermont.\u201cBridgewater definitely changed me and I would say for the better,\u201d says Owen B. Jennings, who was hired as an investment associate in 2011 after graduating from Dartmouth College.Others describe a darker side of the firm\u2019s culture. Turnover is high \u2014 a third of employees are said to leave within the first two years, a figure the firm does not dispute. Some who have left said they became disenchanted with the constant blunt feedback, questioning of their actions, lack of privacy and need to adhere to Mr. Dalio's rules.Nearly all of the current and former employees interviewed declined to speak on the record for fear of retribution because of the firm\u2019s strict nondisclosure agreements. The Times reviewed documents from a dozen lawsuits and complaints filed against the firm by former employees, and documents obtained from public agencies through Freedom of Information Act requests.The picture that emerges is that life at Bridgewater is demanding, with a heavy focus on maintaining Mr. Dalio\u2019s rules.Each day, employees are tested and graded on their knowledge of the Principles. They walk around with iPads loaded with the rules and an interactive rating system called \u201cdots\u201d to evaluate peers and supervisors. The ratings feed into each employee\u2019s permanent record, called the \u201cbaseball card.\u201dTwo dozen Principles \u201ccaptains\u201d are responsible for enforcing the rules. Another group, \u201coverseers,\u201d some of whom report to Mr. Dalio, monitor department heads.The video cameras that record daily interactions for future case studies are so ubiquitous that employees joke about \u201cthe men in the walls.\u201dMeetings occasionally last for hours, sometimes simply because of a debate over why certain subjects are on the agenda or the quality of an employee\u2019s presentation. Workers described being publicly berated for not completing homework assignments related to the firm\u2019s culture or, sometimes, for \u201cbelow-the-bar thinking.\u201dIn one of the firm\u2019s more memorable case studies \u2014 videotaped episodes of events at Bridgewater that employees review and analyze \u2014 a female employee burst into tears during a group interrogation. \u201cI have never seen so many smart people in a room who never get anything done,\u201d Mr. Bradley said.Bridgewater said \u201cit would be misleading to characterize\u201d the firm as a place where employees are publicly berated.The app that Mr. Dalio is developing will include some videotaped Bridgewater case studies but only ones that employees have agreed can be shared with the outside world.Mr. Dalio, a devotee of Transcendental Meditation, considers confrontation part of a quest for getting to the truth and determining an employee\u2019s \u201cbelievability.\u201d Because, as Mr. Dalio once explained in a Principle known in-house as No. 194, only \u201cbelievable\u201d people \u201chave the right to have opinions.\u201dJames Cordes, who was hired several years ago as an internal adviser to the Bridgewater management committee, said Mr. Dalio, \u201cwas a purist; you had to go all in.\u201dMr. Dalio has talked about the firm as a place devoid of office politics, where employees don\u2019t talk behind each other\u2019s backs. But some former employees contend Mr. Dalio has simply created a different kind of office politics, one that rewards those who play by his rules.The firm\u2019s top executives, like Mr. Dalio, see things differently. \u201cThis is a deeply analytical place,\u201d said Brian Kreiter, a member of Bridgewater\u2019s management committee. \u201cWhen something goes wrong in any part of our business it gets debated vigorously with reference to our shared understanding, systems, and principles.\u201d\u201cWe want this place to be an idea meritocracy,\u201d he said.But in Mr. Dalio\u2019s quest to create an environment that values data, emotional intelligence can be stripped out of business decisions, said Robin Levine, a former employee who now runs a job-matching platform she and another Bridgewater alumna founded. \u201cIf you read through the Principles, there is more emphasis on the individual.\u201d Ms. Levine added that working at Bridgewater did foster good interpersonal relationships.Yet some incidents of raucous behavior at off-site retreats have led employees to complain.In one 2012 episode, at Mohonk Mountain House in upstate New York, several dozen junior associates watched a fireside chat that started in humor, and then took a turn when Greg Jensen, one of Mr. Dalio\u2019s lieutenants and a co-chief investment officer, was asked by another employee to describe the time that he and Mr. Dalio sat naked together in a sauna during a trip to Japan.After the retreat, several employees said they were made uncomfortable by some of what had gone on that weekend, including skinny dipping and heavy drinking by some who were there.Three years ago, another top executive took a group of young interns to a strip club. Again, some employees complained about the outing later and the episode became a case study to be discussed internally.These incidents have spilled into public view over the past year, leading to concern about the firm\u2019s image. The impact on recruiting has become a topic of discussion within the firm, according to an internal document reviewed by The Times. One manager wrote in the document that Bridgewater had become \u201ca place that is difficult to hire for and lukewarm to join.\u201dMark Carey, an employment lawyer who has represented five Bridgewater employees in disputes over the past two years, said that Mr. Dalio had created an environment that could deter employees from speaking up about workplace problems.\u201cThis whole transparency and truth-seeking thing is juxtaposed with the fact that they intentionally secretize all interactions with employees from public view,\u201d Mr. Carey said.Mr. Dalio has acknowledged that the firm\u2019s culture is not for everyone. Of his rules, he writes in his book, \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to follow them blindly.\u201d The firm said, \u201cWhile there could be some concern that media distortions might impact recruiting, the firm just had one of its best recruiting classes ever.\u201dBridgewater also notes that business leaders like Bill Gates and Jamie Dimon have praised Mr. Dalio\u2019s book.Robert Kegan, a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education who spent a week at Bridgewater doing research, likened Mr. Dalio to a great inventor. \u201cEvery critical thing you\u2019ve heard about Bridgewater could be true and it still doesn\u2019t take away from the basic project itself,\u201d Professor Kegan said,Mr. Dalio was contributing to \u201c as dramatic a transformation as the industrial revolution,\u201d he added, referring to the Bridgewater founder\u2019s vision of the future of work.His beginnings were more humble.He grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens, the son of a jazz musician. He earned an undergraduate degree in accounting from Long Island University before heading off to Harvard Business School. After graduating, he landed at a small brokerage firm that was led at the time by Sanford I. Weill, who would later forge Citigroup.Mr. Dalio didn\u2019t last long. He punched his boss in the face and brought a stripper to a corporate event. He was fired and then formed Bridgewater in 1975, working out of his two-bedroom Manhattan apartment.He married Barbara Gabaldoni, a descendant of the Whitneys and the Vanderbilts, and the couple moved to Wilton, Conn. For a time, Bridgewater was so small that it was run out of their home.Early clients included the pension funds for the World Bank and Eastman Kodak. The firm gained a dedicated following on Wall Street because of its deeply researched daily economic note, Daily Observations.After profiting on the stock market crash of 1987, Mr. Dalio started to become known beyond Wall Street. The next year, he appeared in an episode of \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d called \u201cDo foreigners own America?\u201dIn 1991, Bridgewater started one of its flagship funds, Pure Alpha, which makes bets based on the direction of global economic trends. Five years later, it started All Weather, a fund that pioneered a steady, low-risk strategy called risk parity.As for Principles, the concept flowed from Mr. Dalio\u2019s early practice of jotting down his observations about how markets worked. He moved on to writing down his thoughts on how employees should interact in the workplace.In the mid-2000s, he had just a few dozen Principles, but the number quickly grew along with Bridgewater\u2019s head count. Ultimately, Mr. Dalio compiled his rules into a little white book. All employees carried hard copies before Principles became available on the firm\u2019s iPads.It wasn\u2019t until the financial crisis of a decade ago that Bridgewater made the big leagues. The firm saw before most in the industry that trouble was brewing in the mortgage market and at investment firms like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. So when the stock market tumbled in 2008 and most hedge funds recorded big losses, Bridgewater\u2019s Pure Alpha fund made for its investors. Its success led more money to pour in.Since it began, Pure Alpha has made investors an annual average return after fees of 11.9 percent, slightly better than the 9.5 percent average yearly return for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500. The All Weather fund has given investors an annual return of 7.9 percent return since it began.\u201cIt is a culture that is not for everyone but not one that would dissuade me from investing,\u201d said John Longo, a finance professor at Rutgers University School of Business.Yet much of the firm\u2019s vaunted investing machine remains shrouded in mystery, even to those working at Bridgewater. On Wall Street, how the firm makes its money long has been a source of envy and debate because it goes to great lengths to conceal its trades from competitors.As one of the first hedge funds to embrace quantitative analysis, Bridgewater bases almost all of its trades on algorithms derived from decades of market observations. The firm trades in many diverse markets, including the Japanese yen, Treasury securities and gold.There is little room at Bridgewater for intuition and fast-paced trading. Unlike their counterparts at other big hedge funds who are responsible for trade ideas, many Bridgewater traders simply press buttons that execute trades. Many of those positions are held for several months at a time.Only a small number of top executives who occupy Mr. Dalio\u2019s \u201ccircle of trust\u201d have a complete picture of the firm\u2019s trading strategy from start to finish. Another half-dozen employees on what is called Signals team, which decides how the firm should adjust its trading, sign long-term noncompete agreements.To avoid any inadvertent leaking of trading information, Bridgewater has a general policy that discourages the 450 employees who work on the investment side of the firm from socializing with those employed at Wall Street firms it trades with.At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Mr. Dalio appeared on a panel with two senior Russian officials: Kirill Dmitriev, the executive officer of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and Igor Shuvalov, the first deputy prime minister of Russia. The panel came as a political firestorm was spreading in the United States over intelligence reports that Russia had meddled in the presidential elections.\u201cIt would be better if the sanctions were lifted,\u201d for Russia\u2019s economic and financial development, Mr. Dalio told the audience, while adding that Russia had already made adjustments to be less dependent on foreign investment.The message appeared to please his panelists. Mr. Dmitriev said he hoped to organize a delegation to Russia later in the year, \u201ccontaining the largest funds and companies from the U.S.,\u201d adding, \u201cwe would love to have Ray and other people there as dialogue partners.\u201dIn his book, Mr. Dalio writes a good deal about his world travels, particularly his meetings with foreign leaders and economic thinkers. The meetings have not only informed Bridgewater\u2019s trading style, but also have shaped Mr. Dalio\u2019s views about how to manage his people and the firm.But no foreign country and its leadership is as important to Mr. Dalio than China, which he first visited in 1984 and where his son Matthew lived for several years. Mr. Dalio has often met with the country\u2019s senior leaders during his frequent visits there. In 2015, he was one of a few business leaders to attend a state dinner at the White House in honor of president Xi Jinping.Over the years, Mr. Dalio has geared up for the day when China opens itself up more fully to foreign investment firms, securing hard-to-get licenses in order to expand its investment business.Last year, Bridgewater became the third global investment firm to receive a license for a wholly owned foreign owned enterprise, allowing it to set up an entity to manage money for Chinese institutional investors and, potentially, to engage in foreign currency trading. The firm received the approval just weeks before China stopped issuing licenses to foreign investors.Months later, Mr. Dalio met with Pan Gongsheng, the deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China who is also an administrator of China\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, which is responsible for managing China\u2019s foreign exchange currency reserves.Bridgewater has a relationship with SAFE and the China Investment Corporation, China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, and has advised both government entities.And, Mr. Dalio writes in his book, one of his close counselors, not only on China, but on big ideas about the wider world, is Wang Qishan, one of the most powerful men in China and the nation\u2019s anti-corruption czar.Every time Mr. Dalio goes to China, he meets with Mr. Wang. The two men, Mr. Dalio writes, discuss subjects as varied as artificial intelligence and the implications of Julius Caesar\u2019s rise to power. Mr. Dalio, who refers to Mr. Wang as one of his heroes, said that his advice had helped in the planning for Bridgewater\u2019s future.\u201cEvery time I speak with Mr. Wang, I feel I get closer to cracking the unifying code that unlocks the laws of the universe,\u201d Mr. Dalio writes. Such interactions, were \u201cthrilling to me.\u201dSusan Beachy and Cao Li contributed to researchAdvertisement"}

Welcome back to our show, our pop-culture confession booth.WM: Hi.JW: So, Mr. Morris, what is on your mind this week?WM: Walter Becker died about two weeks ago. He was half of Steely Dan, a group that I thought was two old black dudes my whole life \u2014 or not my whole life, sorry, my entire adolescence. My father had to have a very comical but what for him was an annoyingly, unnecessarily difficult conversation with me.JW: This was pre-Google.WM: They weren\u2019t an MTV act either, but my dad had Steely Dan records. So, I\u2019m still listening to women and the albums they\u2019ve made, and so I was sort of torn about whether to interrupt what I was pleasurably doing to listen to some Steely Dan, and I did that. I listened to \u201cAja,\u201d which was one of their bigger albums. And one of the most famous songs from that record and one of their most famous songs if you\u2019re a hip-hop fan is, of course, \u201cPeg,\u201d which we should play a little bit of right now.

I wish that somebody would find a way to put her out of business and give her something else to write about, but racism and education seems to persist, nonetheless. So, she had this story about the resegregation of this county in Alabama. It\u2019s really just devastating, mostly because just reading it, you understand just how much states can have been trying through racism to not integrate the schools, and to keep black people and Latinos from having an equal and fair education.JW: Right.

It\u2019s tragic.WM: More bad news is on my brain, because how can it not be? The weather ... the hurricane.JW: It\u2019s so distressing.WM: Destroying islands in the Caribbean, wrecking havoc on the South. ...JW: I know. I was like, name a city in the South. Name a coastal state.WM: It\u2019s just really terrible, and I feel \u2014 my heart goes out to everyone who has known someone who has lost a life, who has lost a home, who can\u2019t find people. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s really sad. We\u2019re thinking about you, everybody. Like we said last week, it\u2019s still true this week. Anyway. What\u2019s going on with you? You have any happy news?JW: Oh, yeah. I have a really good piece of news. Want to hear it?WM: Yes, please.JW: So, I finally got prescription sunglasses. I don\u2019t know why it took me so long. I have been waiting my whole life for this miracle. You know I love the sun.WM: I know.JW: You know I love the beach. And normally, what happens is I don\u2019t have my proper eyes on, I just have like a pair of Forever 21 glasses on. And, you know, people get miffed because they\u2019re waving at me, I can\u2019t even see the motion of their hands. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. There have been so many times I\u2019ve been out in the park and I don\u2019t realize someone\u2019s trying to talk to me until they\u2019re right up on top of me, and then I\u2019m like, Oh, I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s really a problem. It\u2019s a problem. So, I finally invested. I got a cool pair of shades. I wore them all weekend. I was so happy to not bump into things. I could recognize people on the street when I saw them. Quality of life is now at 100, so. You\u2019ve been telling me to watch this television show called \u201cClaws\u201d for many moons now. I finally binge-watched all of it the last couple of days and ... I loved it. It\u2019s like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d meets \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d meets \u201cSteel Magnolias.\u201d It\u2019s about a bunch of women \u2014 I mean, they make that joke themselves about something else on the show \u2014 but it\u2019s about a bunch of women who work in a nail salon in South Florida, and they get caught up in some petty crime. Niecy Nash is in it, she\u2019s incredible. Dee Norris, who was actually on \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d is like a bisexual crime lord. The only thing that\u2019s weird about the show is that there\u2019s a character on the show named Virginia, who is Vietnamese, and her ethnicity is a running punch line. She\u2019s played by Karrueche Tran, who is a makeup artist and kind of became an insta-celebrity after that for different reasons. I don\u2019t like those jokes, and I don\u2019t know. ... We need to talk about it at some point.WM: This is like, what? Our fourth week of talking about Asian racism, or racism against Asians. There\u2019s always a fight over what the last acceptable form of racism is, and in this race to the bottom \u2014 I mean \u201cacceptable\u201d meaning what shows can get away with without huge protests. For whatever reason, there\u2019s a lot of racism against Asian people that is just in our culture that we don\u2019t really examine. Often because, I think, it comes from nonwhite people and is therefore less \u2014 what? Contested?JW: Right. But the show, overall, if you can get past that, is excellent. Maybe they\u2019ll do better for Season 2, because it was renewed. O.K. A little birdie told me about Rihanna\u2019s beauty launch last week.WM: Tweet, tweet, tweet, right here!JW: I\u2019m not too proud to admit that the invitation didn\u2019t come directly to me, but it came through one Mr. Wesley Robert Morris. Thank you very much for making my birthday dreams true early. We saw, we experienced, we smelled even Rihanna, because she was that close to me that I could tell you precisely from head to toe what she smells like. Cotton candy and hormones. She was everything. Everything. Capital E, capital T. So, I\u2019m not someone who gets very starstruck. I mean, partially because I\u2019m a journalist, but also, I\u2019m just not a hype beast. Like, I don\u2019t like to be the one who can\u2019t keep their [expletive] together when, you know what I mean? Like, some celebrity swans through the room. I don\u2019t like that anyway, and I did keep my composure at this event, but I was shocked to learn that even I was not immune to the privilege and the access and the exclusivity of being at that event. I tweeted it, I Instagrammed it, I storied it, I told everybody in my life about it. And watching myself transform into that monster instantaneously was a little distressing.WM: You weren\u2019t quite monstrous.JW: Um ... but I did transform into a gremlin, and I, you know, I\u2019m still thinking about that. Still thinking about that, what happened. How the water got on my fur.WM: Fenty Beauty is not the only thing we did last week.JW: Very true. Very, very true.WM: We didn\u2019t go to the U.S. Open together, but we were there the same night, and we watched some tennis not together. But together, because you kept texting me about how stressed out you were. Venus Williams played that night, she beat Petra Kvitov\u00e1, and we were talking about how much this woman means to both of us, and to many, many other people, and she just had the best year of her professional tennis life in almost a decade. It\u2019d be great to talk about what you learned and what you have learned watching her play \u2014 and lose. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to talk about today.JW: Yes.WM: These two women.JW: Venus and Rihanna.WM: Rihanna\u2019s win, her Fenty Beauty win. Her win over like, a whole aspect of consumer culture. And Venus\u2019s many, many wins, and her ultimate loss and what we take away from that, what the experience of watching her win and lose is like, especially at this point in her career.JW: Alright, stay tuned. Last week, we arrived \u2014 I arrived by car, you arrived by foot. I had to go in separate from you, because I was like, I cannot be late to this event. Anyway, so we arrive at a warehouse \u2014\u2014WM: You were so steamed.JW: Honey. I was like, if you make me miss Robin Fenty because you decide to walk from your house to Brooklyn Navy Yard, uh-uh. I knew, I was just like, We will not be friends anymore, so let me just go ahead. But basically, we arrive at this warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, it\u2019s the middle of Fashion Week, which means empty lots, empty warehouses, random parks or whatever get transformed into runway shows of different kinds. And it\u2019s all very exciting, it\u2019s all very fun. You never know who is going to show up. People come dressed up. It\u2019s very fun. We arrive, Rihanna\u2019s launching her new beauty line called Fenty Beauty. Everybody\u2019s excited because it\u2019s supposed to have like, the most number of complexion, like, different foundations and products for the largest number of complexions on the market. Whatever. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. But people were very excited for this event. People get excited for anything Rihanna does in general, so.WM: Well, she\u2019s one of the few people, one of the few pop stars to manage to somewhat instantly have a successful fashion imprint.JW: Well, she feels like she has a vision.WM: Right.JW: What\u2019s remarkable about the space is not how it has been transformed, which is, like, into a spaceship, more or less, for this product launch, but it\u2019s that everyone in the room is done up head to toe, but they\u2019re also starring in their own \u201cLive From Fenty Beauty\u201d show that\u2019s ongoing. So, you have all these people with selfie sticks, they\u2019re doing a long-armed selfie hold. People are shooting each other, they\u2019re shooting the napkins that say Fenty Beauty \u2014 which I took a stack of, which I\u2019m not embarrassed to admit, because I don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know what came over me! I couldn\u2019t help myself.WM: You were ... you had no shame.JW: Listen.WM: It was so adorable.JW: I was freaking out. But anyway, the point is, I have not seen ... I know how the beauty world works. I know that there are beauty bloggers. I know that people cover beauty events. I know that people write up product launches. They review them, and I get it. Makeup Instagram is like a whole world unto itself. But I did not realize the degree to which the launch of a makeup line by someone like Rihanna really also rests on the amplification of \u2014 dozens, hundreds? How many people were there? Of those people, you know, Snapchatting and Instragramming and uploading to Facebook and tweeting about this event, also. But it makes total sense. I mean, everything that I buy pretty much is couched within the context of social media. If I see a cute pair of pants on Instagram, I\u2019m probably going to ask that person where they got them. I don\u2019t go to stores to shop. I don\u2019t like stores.WM: This is why brick-and-mortar retail is in the toilet, by the way.JW: It is, though. But it is. But I mean, pretty much all the things I\u2019m interested in buying or wearing or doing \u2014 and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m copycatting looks, but it\u2019ll be like, a particular shade of a blue. And I\u2019m like, Oh, I like that color blue on that skin tone. I should maybe think about wearing baby blue, too. I get all my fashion pretty much through social media, on people that I know of or trust.WM: So, you now have these video mannequins basically who you can also kind of call your friend.JW: I mean, at the thing itself, so we\u2019re looking at all these video screens, a woman comes out, makes a speech, then Rihanna comes out, makes a speech, and then Rihanna proceeds to swan around the whole event.WM: The minute she was done speaking and the screens had gone up, everybody flipped their phone around and began to say, you know, things like, \u201cI\u2019m going to go try on this base.\u201dJW: Highlighter, I\u2019ve got to try the primer. I\u2019ve got to try the gloss. And at the stations themselves where you could go try on these products and they had the vanity setups, but they actually had cell phone stands in them. So you could put your phone in the stand \u2014WM: Shut up.JW: Did you not see this?WM: I did not notice that.JW: Oh, yeah. They had directly next to the vanity \u2014 I was turning into a Tasmanian devil \u2014 but they had the little stands so you could put your phone in the thing, press with one finger to record and do your makeup, and talk into the camera. It was unbelievable. But I was doing some research last night, and there was a business and fashion article that said according to a recent report from Google, 64 percent of women shop this way today. Via influencers! Like, people who talk about the clothing, accessories that they want and wear them online in their social media. So, you have this entire climate. It\u2019s Fashion Week. You have this entire climate where people who are popular online, who have built these kinds of followings online all the sudden are getting priority seating at fashion shows. All of the sudden, they\u2019re getting priority access to new items of clothing or makeup products, like Fenty Beauty. And I have to say too, you know, I did watch all the outtakes and footage from Rihanna\u2019s Puma fashion show via social media. I wasn\u2019t interested in what Vogue thought of her show. No, I wanted to see what my friends, who were sitting front row at the show, had to say. What looks they zoomed in on. I\u2019m way more interested in what they think versus what an anonymous person at Vogue thinks.WM: I wonder if this is partially a technological-innovation milestone, right? Where you have the ability now to whip out your phone, create content that is qualitative, evaluative of a particular product. Or whether it\u2019s the result \u2014 whether the development is the result of the way fashion media and the fashion industry has tended to fetishize and dollarize and romanticize and favor particular looks, to exclude lots and lots of body types and people from its pages, from its worldview.JW: And this is the upside of social media, right, like it allows anyone to become an entrepreneur, in theory. It allows anyone to build a following. And this is something I spend a ton of time writing about and a ton of time thinking about, because I love new economies that aren\u2019t beholden to the old gatekeepers. I love new types of jobs that exist. I think it\u2019s ... phenomenal that if you are a young person \u2014 or not even that young, but you\u2019re just someone who has an aesthetic for how you want to present yourself online, and you can get thousands, millions of people to follow you, and then in turn, you get paid just because you\u2019re such a dynamic presence, people want to follow you and they want to find out what you\u2019re into ... that\u2019s amazing. I mean, it sounds exhausting, but it\u2019s also amazing, because it\u2019s the same \u2014 it\u2019s a way around these same barriers of access and barriers of entry that you\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s why there hasn\u2019t been beauty products that complement my skin tone, or shaving products that work with your skin type.WM: But what do the Anna Wintours take from this disruption? Do they see Rihanna and roll their eyes, or do they see Rihanna and try to get on board? Not just with her celebrity but now, her power as a businesswoman.JW: Yeah, well, I think the Vogues of the world still love the Rihannas of the world, but I think the Vogues of the world\u2014\u2014WM: But do they love the women Rihanna love?JW: I mean, if you\u2019re talking about in terms of coverage, I think we have started to see mainstream fashion sites and beauty sites start to be more inclusive to women of color, because they have to. They know they have to, if not only because of maybe the advertising dollars or digital traffic or ad revenue, IDK, because it\u2019s not a good look to be like, We only speak to white women. You\u2019re just going to get called out on social media. So, I think that\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s been a shift towards more inclusiveness. But I also think the traditional sites across the board are feeling frustrated by the lack of exclusivity that they have. I mean, Rihanna\u2019s always going to do a Vogue cover. But you know, if you\u2019re some really hot collection designer, you might give your pieces to a really young, hot Instagrammer instead, and not an editor at a fashion site. You might bring that person, because you\u2019re like, Well, they\u2019re actually reaching more of the people that I want to reach, and people that are going to be more inclined to buy my products, the people that are directly tapped into them.WM: But I have to ask this, this all sounds great in some ways, but what\u2019s the human downside to this?JW: Yo, like everything else about the internet, human cost can be real expensive. I mean, I think anecdotally speaking, some of the influencers I\u2019ve talked to, this rules their entire lives, and I think also, they ... they work all the time, because they always have to make content. And if you think about how quickly we scroll through our social media feeds, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s not a commercial that takes weeks to produce and then you watch it for 30 seconds. This is something that takes hours to produce and then you look at it and digest it and move on in a second. I mean, the beast is always hungry, and it\u2019s always asking for more. And you know, there was a woman at the Rihanna show we spoke with who was like, It\u2019s really difficult, especially during Fashion Week because, I\u2019ve got two children, and they\u2019re part of this, too. But also, I never get to spend time with them, and I don\u2019t want them to remember that Mommy always had her phone in front of her face, because you\u2019re always checking to see what\u2019s going on or what are the new offers.WM: But at the same time, the same person, like her child was part of her thing.JW: She made her child part of thing too, which is, I mean, I don\u2019t know. I follow her now, and I\u2019m kind of into it. But I think the cost is high, and I think when you yourself become the thing that people are consuming, I think it\u2019s hard to anticipate how draining that is. And also what it does to your sense of self and your sense of privacy. I mean, people do make money, though. You can get paid like \u2014 I\u2019ve heard numbers as high as tens of thousands of dollars for a single post depending on who you are.WM: It\u2019s like a Gary Shteyngart novel. It is. It\u2019s \u201cSuper Sad True Love Story.\u201dJW: But here\u2019s my question for you. Like, I feel my brain being rewired.WM: It\u2019s a world in which everything is quantified by your interaction with it and people\u2019s approval of X, Y, or Z interaction.JW: Right. You\u2019re only as valuable as the content you create.WM: So all your behavior is motivated by technology.JW: The feedback loop.WM: He is a visionary, Gary Shteyngart. And it\u2019s funny, because that book, you just sort of felt like that\u2019s the future. And it was so strange to be at \u2014\u2014JW: Literally that narration of it.WM: Yeah, yeah.JW: But the difference between that book and reality, I would say, is that in the book, the protagonist has the wherewithal to be like, This is not normal. And no one else \u2014\u2014WM: But he\u2019s the only person who knows.JW: He\u2019s the only person in that world who knows. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true of this age that we\u2019re in. I think there\u2019s very much a tacit awareness and understanding of the economy that you\u2019re participating in. And what you\u2019re getting out of it, what you\u2019re extracting out of it. And this is the thing that I think people like about Rihanna a lot is that she\u2019s also very aware of her role in all of this too. Like she\u2019s not going to be Justin Bieber who is like, Please, please don\u2019t. Rihanna just won\u2019t show up. She won\u2019t show up in public if she doesn\u2019t want you to take her picture. but I think when she\u2019s there in that role, she really understands like, I\u2019m not a person. I\u2019m an avatar. I don\u2019t know. We could be more skeptical. I should be more skeptical about it. For me, it\u2019s mostly exciting until proven otherwise.WM: I think we have been plenty skeptical. I mean, my other question is like, what happens if all this stuff falls apart, you know? Like, you know about me and my great internet apocalypse. And I don\u2019t even know what that looks like, but I\u2019m always thinking about what happens when the equivalent of a Hurricane Irma or a Hurricane Harvey comes to the internet. And like who survives, who lives, who dies, and what models are viable enough to survive that? I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s a fair analogy, but I do wonder \u2014 I don\u2019t quite get the built on a house of cards feeling about quite this, but there\u2019s a lot that goes on in the way that we consume and create culture now that does feel to me, from a business model standpoint, to have a house of cards dimension to it.JW: Yeah. There\u2019s a degree of ephemerality and frailty that we\u2019re not looking at because we\u2019re too busy utilizing it. We\u2019re too busy maximizing it right now. I think that\u2019s real.WM: And the difference between now and before is there\u2019s so much more money to be made from that ephemeral relationship between a consumer or an allegedly critical consumer or a reviewer consumer and the corporate making the products themselves too. There\u2019s just, everything is bigger now.JW: Big social! One of our favorite phrases.WM: Big social!JW: Coming for ya.WM: It\u2019s back.JW: Well, we\u2019ll keep thinking about this, because it\u2019s clearly not going away, and I found it all to be tremendously exciting. I was mostly curious to observe myself get caught up in it, and what that said about me, and also what that says about how social media is ... you know those ants that get infected by spores in the rainforest and then climb up the trees? They go as far as they can and while they\u2019re climbing, the fungus is like, eating their brain, it\u2019s like telling them to go higher and higher, and they get to top, and they explode full of the spores that drift down to the bottom of the rainforest and infect everything else? And then those ants climb back up? You\u2019ve never heard about this?WM: No!JW: Oh, it\u2019s like a cool thing. You should google it. Like zombie ants and mushrooms should bring it up. But I was literally like that ant.WM: You were a zombie ant.JW: I got infected. The virus, you know, I touched infected blood supply, I guess.WM: Well, I guess we should talk about my zombie ant experience now. I have one, and her name is Venus Williams.JW: It sounds so grim. This is so exciting.WM: Well, it is until you think about what you\u2019re really doing. I\u2019m really climbing up a tree waiting to explode.JW: Well, on that cheerful note ... we\u2019ll take a break. We\u2019ll be right back.WM: We\u2019ll be right back.JW: I want to talk to you about the U.S. Open because I like tennis, but you love tennis. You told me that you think Venus Williams is your Billie Jean King. Yeah. The most important \u2014\u2014WM: Yeah. She\u2019s very important, and she\u2019s just about as important as Billie Jean King.JW: And I just want to talk to you about watching her at this point in her career, and you know, she lost the Open, eventually, ultimately, to Sloane. And in the press conference after, I was really moved by what she said when they were like, What\u2019s going to happen next with your career?VW: What do you mean?Reporter: What do you see in your near future?VW: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll continue to play tennis. It\u2019s nothing complicated.JW: She\u2019s amazing.WM: You know, the thing that has been very stressful \u2014 I should say first of all, that in addition to Venus Williams\u2019s being an incredibly important tennis player socially and politically, she fought to get equal prize money for the women at these major tournaments \u2014\u2014JW: Snaps to her.WM: And has been very quietly \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t even, outspoken? To know Venus Williams is to know that a word like \u201coutspoken\u201d is not the right word. She has been judicious in her attempt to keep equality between the genders at these tournaments and to make sure that as much attention is paid to the women as to the men. We should say the crucial thing about why we\u2019re talking about her additionally is she\u2019s 37 years old.JW: Which was explained to me is ancient for tennis years. I don\u2019t know how this sport works.WM: She\u2019s the Mummy in tennis. I mean, there\u2019s only been one woman who has played, I mean, I mean, her sister now is close behind her. Serena is almost, I think she\u2019s 35 still. And she\u2019s going to come back to tennis next year after having had this baby a couple weeks ago.JW: And dominate. Completely dominate post \u2014WM: We\u2019ll see. But the exciting thing about Venus Williams now is she has this disease called Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome, which seemed like it was going to derail her career. She might never play again. And she decided to keep playing, and it\u2019s an autoimmune disease that has the power to sap your energy. And so it seemed very much like she would never play again, and if she was going to play, she would just be playing because that\u2019s what she\u2019s always done. And she wouldn\u2019t amount to much in these tournaments, and she would be there just rolling the dice. And for several years, that seemed to be the case. She was losing in the first round, in the second round, in the third round. Wasn\u2019t going very far. And this went on for a long time, and at some point, I think these sports writers were just like, Venus, girl, when are you going to give it up? You\u2019re not winning anything. And then about three years ago, something started to change, and she stopped expiring halfway through a match. You know, the disease, I think she just got control over it. She changed her diet, and she\u2019s figured out how to play great tennis with this disease. And then all of the sudden, she has, she had a really good 2016. She doesn\u2019t play enough tournaments to be at the top of the game just because of the way they factor the points. But basically, she plays enough tennis and if she wins a lot, she\u2019ll be well inside the Top 10. And 2017, she gets to the final of the Australian Open and loses to her sister. Loses somewhat inexplicably in the fourth round of the French Open. She gets to the final of Wimbledon, loses to, to ... Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza. And she almost gets to the final of the U.S. Open. For any other player, this an amazing year. For Venus Williams, who is 37 years old and battling this autoimmune disease, it\u2019s extraordinary. And so, you said to me the words that I never want to hear when talking about Venus Williams, which is, I want to talk about the things I\u2019ve learned in watching her lose. And like, I don\u2019t want to talk about her losing at all because it just depresses me. My mood just went south. Yours is up, mine is down. What do you got? What have you learned?JW: The night I saw Venus play at the Open against \u2014\u2014WM: Ugh, the Czech Republic\u2019s Petra Kvitov\u00e1, who \u2014 she and Venus have played some great matches together.JW: I\u2019m going to gesture to you a lot because I don\u2019t know any of the tennis terminology. But you know, she played the first set and she did very well. The second set comes around, Venus is clearly fatigued. You\u2019ve mentioned she has this autoimmune disease, I looked up some of the symptoms. Causes joint pain, it goes extreme feelings of being tired. Um, she was lagging. She was run down. I got so stressed out. She was the lead server or whatever and wasn\u2019t able to get the points?WM: They traded breaks a couple times in that third set.JW: The point was, she wasn\u2019t making contact with the ball as much as she should have been considering her advantage on the court. So, I took the opportunity to relieve myself of that encounter, and I just went out to get my commemorative cup because I was like, I cannot take this tension. I was extraordinarily stressed out. But you know, I was watching from the TVs while I was getting my commemorative cup and then I came back, and you know, she seemed so deliberate. And I watched Kvitov\u00e1 work really hard to beat Venus Williams, and Venus looked unbothered. She looked unflapped, you know.WM: But she always, and she always looks that way. You have no idea whether she\u2019s up or down in a match based on her body language and facial expression.JW: But there was something about the way she came back on the third set. She had a lot more confidence. She had a lot more ... pep in her step, and she just looked like she knew she was going to win. So just, so basically like, as a black woman in America, I am very attuned to how other black women in America move in spaces where they are and have been the only one for the majority of their lives and their careers. I love watching how Venus chooses to operate. I love watching how she tries to be in press conferences, which she doesn\u2019t really take the bait. She answers what she wants to say. You know, she says what she wants to say, she doesn\u2019t respond to the things they try to get out of her about other people. I love watching how Serena moves \u2014 she has so little cares. You know, the cares, I would use another word, but it\u2019ll get bleeped, so I won\u2019t, but she has so few cares about what other people think about her. They\u2019re on back order. We don\u2019t know when the store is going to be back in supply. Serena just lives for herself, and they both take two very different approaches to being these public figures, and I take notes from both of them. And I think what I learned from Venus was that, you know, she was very willing to bide her time. She was very willing to make concessions so that she could ultimately come to victory. I mean, she couldn\u2019t get there in the end, but conservation of energy, conservation of resources. Strategic losing is never, it\u2019s not something that I\u2019ve ever thought about doing in my life, but watching her do it, I was like, yo, she really knows some things.WM: So you think that \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re not saying she tanked that second set, but \u2014JW: No, I think she was making a decision about what her body could do and what it would mean for the third portion of that.WM: This is fascinating. I never considered this.JW: I mean, I\u2019m speculating. I\u2019m not a mind reader. I don\u2019t have any insight into Venus Williams\u2019s game plan.WM: She has lost a lot of second sets, and I\u2019m not saying \u2014 I mean, we\u2019re not arguing that she\u2019s throwing the second set, because ultimately, she wins a lot of those three set matches. But there is something interesting about like, when she \u2014 we used to call it, like a lot of tennis people call it when a player does this going on a walk. You just go on a walk for part of the match, and the match takes a little longer than you need it to. All great players do it, lesser players do it and lose and never become great because they\u2019re always on a walk. But you know, she is a walker. She can just disappear for a little while during a match. But since she got diagnosed with this disease, I have found that it\u2019s really crucial, and I think she knows it\u2019s crucial, but what was exciting to me is she played a lot of three set matches in this tournament, and \u2014JW: Are they always three sets? I\u2019m sorry, go on.WM: Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s the best of three. So, you know, obviously you want to get two sets so you can get off the court. But she played a lot of three sets. It didn\u2019t seem like what happened against Sloane Stephens in that semifinal was the result of being tired. It was the result of Sloane Stephens playing the four best games of tennis she\u2019s ever played in her life.JW: Yeah. She came with a mission.WM: With anybody else, Venus Williams would have won that match. When it was five all, she would have broken, served for the match, she\u2019d be in the final against Madison Keys. I have never seen a player do that to Venus Williams \u2014 get every ball Venus hit, no matter where Venus hit it, in like the most remote back of the court, in the corners, Sloane was there with an amazing shot. It wasn\u2019t just getting a racket on the ball. She was making shots on the dead run, and I\u2019ve never seen anybody play, maybe Serena\u2019s the only other person I\u2019ve seen play Venus quite that way. What happened to Venus in that match was, it wasn\u2019t physical fatigue, it was mental. Like, where on this court can I put this ball so this woman can\u2019t get it? And there was no place she could put it. And I think her will just...Sloane broke her will, like as much as she broke her serve.JW: Fascinating.WM: It was a fascinating match. But I\u2019m curious for you what the difference is between a Venus and a Serena and \u2014 I mean, obviously they\u2019re very different people, but there\u2019s something about the way Venus chooses to kind of be introverted versus Serena\u2019s...obvious extroversion. I mean, Venus isn\u2019t a hermit or anything. She\u2019s more mysterious to me than a lot of other women tennis players, a lot of tennis players in general. It\u2019s like she\u2019s holding onto something and she\u2019s not going to give it to us because it\u2019s hers. And I really respect that.JW: I respect that too. I learn a lot by watching how she moves. I mean, I think I\u2019m more aligned with Serena\u2019s style of approach in terms of how she wants to be in the world, which is you know, she doesn\u2019t want to have to adhere to someone else\u2019s ideas of how she should behave. And I mean, I\u2019ve seen Serena play a few times live, and when people boo her, oh my gosh. Like, I cry. It feels so personal. It feels so personal, because it feels like what they don\u2019t like about her is her unwillingness to be small. And Serena is never going to be small, and Venus isn\u2019t either, I should say \u2014WM: But it\u2019s just a different thing. It\u2019s a different energy.JW: Yeah, she\u2019s just a lot more inward. But at the same time, this is a woman who played, I think, in an outfit that she designed that looked fabulous. She was wearing enormous gold hoops that didn\u2019t slow her down. She did a little twirl at the end when she won. I mean, the look on her face when she won, oh my God. I mean, it\u2019s hard not to feel uplifted by that. It\u2019s hard not to watch her, the extreme physicality of the struggle to win and the struggle of Venus to just be on that court, and you know it means so much to her to arrive on that court every time they do it. I\u2019m not trying to say that I can relate to what they do in life, but on a much different scale, I can. I know what it feels like to arrive in a room where people aren\u2019t really rooting for you or you aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re rooting for you, and there\u2019s no one else that looks like you at that table. And if you are arrogant or cocky or you know, you\u2019re not in your place the way people think you should be in your place, you get down voted. I mean, I am intimate with those feelings. So, I love them and I adore them and I love watching them because of what they represent to me. And I think, it was just really um, I just feel like I got a free business seminar from Venus. Like I want to Venmo her five bucks \u2014 I don\u2019t know if she needs it, but you know what I mean. I feel like I just got a free course, like a free business lesson.WM: What I learned watching her play in this tournament was that there\u2019s no limit to how long she can do it. As long as she\u2019s getting to finals and losing only to like her sister and to players who are inspired in a slightly different way than she is, I think the thing, the amazing thing about her is she is redefining what \u201cold\u201d is.JW: Yes!WM: She\u2019s old, she\u2019s not old in real life. She\u2019s trying to prove that she\u2019s not even old in her sport. Like, there are so many players in tennis right now who are doing well over the age of 30, including Roger Federer. So, I think that she sits down and spends the next couple of months thinking about how she can have an even better 2018 than she had in 2017.JW: I love it. Me too.WM: I mean, I think she thinks she...she was crushed by losing to Sloane Stephens because she could have won the whole tournament. And she was two points away from getting to the final.JW: She\u2019s not done.WM: I feel bad for Serena, because I think when Serena comes back...JW: 2018! It\u2019s going to be a good year.WM: Venus is going to want to beat everybody.JW: Oh my God. Well, we need these lighthouses. These are dark times, so you know, if these are the things, these are the ports that get me through the storm, like I\u2019m here for it, so.WM: Well, what was interesting to me about this particular U.S. Open is that the four semifinalists were American, and three of those four women were black.JW: I didn\u2019t realize that.WM: Yeah. Madison Keys, Sloane Stephens, and Venus Williams, all black women. And I think that Venus and Serena faced a lot of skepticism when they started playing because nobody...I mean, Althea Gibson is pretty much, Althea Gibson, Gloria McNeil, Zina Garrison. There weren\u2019t a lot of black women playing this sport, and nobody had ever played it the way these two would. And Venus and Serena...they changed the sport, and a lot of people wanted to hold onto the old ways of thinking about how tennis was played.JW: And the types of people that played tennis.WM: Yeah. And Martina Hingis was one of those people. I mean, she was their chief rival for a long time, and she played a tactical game. And what Venus and Serena did was put an emphasis on power before tactics. And it sort of got into this, what for me was a really racist mentality in terms of how they talk about Venus and Serena. They were physical. They were tough. They were...they were dominating.JW: They talked a lot about their body shape and their body size.WM: Yeah. And Martina Hingis was always smart.JW: These very coded words that signify threatening.WM: She knows how to construct a point and Venus just hits the ball like a crazy person. That\u2019s how people used to talk about them, anyway.JW: Well, they still do though, because Maria Sharapova put out a new memoir called Unstoppable \u2014WM: Wait. Excuse me. First of all, Unstoppable, Maria Sharapova?JW: She\u2019s been stopped.WM: Uh, what\u2019s your, what\u2019s your win/loss record with Serena Williams? Can I find that for you? Because uh, Unstoppable? You have been stopped.JW: She writes in the book, you know, Serena\u2019s physical presence is much stronger and bigger than you realize watching on TV. She has thick arms and thick legs and is so intimidating and strong. This is via a Buzzfeed article. But yeah. So she\u2019s still talking about her like she\u2019s a...you know, not human, like a super human human. It\u2019s creepy. It\u2019s crazy.WM: Come on. Really? I mean, it\u2019s bad enough being a woman athlete who doesn\u2019t look like what you think an athlete should look like, or looking too much like \u2014JW: Just a woman in the spotlight, people feel like they can...WM: But to have a Maria Sharapova say this about...I mean, look. She and Serena have their issues with each other, but that\u2019s disappointing. And unsurprising at the same time. That\u2019s why she beat you 16 times in a row. Anyway, go on.JW: From your perspective, looking at where both the Williams sisters are at in their careers, I am really curious to hear what you think tennis would look like without either of the Williams sisters and if they\u2019ve dominated it for so long...as long as I can remember being conscious and aware and thinking about tennis as a sport, it\u2019s only been since they\u2019ve been involved.WM: Well, somebody would have figured a way to play this way, maybe. Somebody would have figured out that serving hard and fast and unreturnably is really important. I mean, it wasn\u2019t like Martina Navratilova had a weak serve. She had the hardest \u2014 Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati had like enormous serves. But there was something about, for instance, Serena\u2019s ability to disguise her toss. You never know where she\u2019s going to hit it. I mean, they just changed a lot of the way tennis should be played by women, and now there\u2019s another conversation happening in their wake about how bad serving is in the women\u2019s game and how it could just be better than it is. And it should be a priority. But sexism \u2014 once again, women get taught how to return, not how to serve. Whereas men get taught to serve and not return. Men, I mean, historically have been pretty great returners, but women are, the reason so many serves get broken in women\u2019s tennis is not just because the serve is weak, but they\u2019re really great returners by and large, statistically. I definitely know that if the Williams sisters don\u2019t show up, you know, your Martina Hingises and Lindsay Davenports are going to a lot more finals and winning more than three and five majors, five and three majors a piece.JW: See you at the Open next year, Wes. I\u2019ll see you. Maybe we can actually go together.WM: Maybe. That\u2019s our show, everybody.Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

{"Headline": "Bruce Chatwin: One of the Last Great Explorers", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "Forty years after the publication of his groundbreaking travelogue, \u2018\u2018In Patagonia,\u2019\u2019 the author\u2019s writing \u2014 and style \u2014 have lost none of their power to bewitch and inspire.Supported byIn 1972, Bruce Chatwin left England and began to travel. This was not so long ago, and yet the world back then was still so unmapped: A traveler could and did wander through it like Pausanias, like Ibn Battuta, like the explorers who wrote the first drafts of the romance of movement, of the twinned danger and delight of finding oneself in a place where one was at the mercy of unfriendly but intriguing strangers. A traveler, back then, was far less likely to find in the foreign traces of the familiar. Depending on where he ventured, he had significantly fewer guarantees of safety, and equally thrillingly, only limited ways of communicating with those he knew and had left behind. And it wasn\u2019t only that you could (and, indeed, would) travel as Ibn Battuta had, but, crucially, you could travel where Ibn Battuta had, as well: Sanaa and Baghdad and Damascus, all of which are now treacherous or off-\u00adlimits, cities in countries forced by war or disaster or bad governance to deny their cultures\u2019 extravagant senses of hospitality.Chatwin was 32 when he began this, the latest of his reinventions \u2014 from an Englishman of England to an Englishman of elsewhere \u2014 and for the rest of his life, he would remain (more or less) in that elsewhere. Great travelers are recessive personalities; the best are unmemorable. This ability to shape-shift, to adapt oneself to one\u2019s context instead of imposing oneself upon it, is a necessary skill; the gift of self-\u00aderasure ensures one will see and hear things one ought not to. One\u2019s goal as a traveler is to be forgettable, to leave no footsteps in the sand.Chatwin also possessed another quality that all great travelers have: the ability to remain completely who he was even as he proved himself ceaselessly malleable. Writers who deliberately seek out the company of those foreign to them need to be armed with an unshakable sense of self-possession and a certain sense of arrogance; you need to be able to walk into a place (be it a city or a souk or a tundra) without wondering whether who you are is actually where you\u2019re from, because you already know that where you\u2019re from doesn\u2019t matter. This kind of writer is certain that his identity has resulted not from where he was raised, but in spite of it. We think of travelers as people who have no attachment to things, but true travelers are people who really have no attachment to place. Home is not a beloved memory or something to yearn for and fetishize, but merely a matter of circumstance: a piece of land (sometimes large, but usually small) on which one eats and sleeps, sometimes for a lifetime, and sometimes for a day. Home, therefore, is anywhere, and yet nowhere as well. Chatwin was powerfully attracted to nomadism, and you might view his collective writings as a struggle to discard this idea of home as a kind of heaven, and to replace it with the radical notion that the person who found himself adrift, in perpetual motion, might already be at home \u2014 that movement itself might be the ideal human state.This sense of certainty, the feeling the reader has that a place is being used as a mirror to reflect the author\u2019s own image, is also what made Chatwin\u2019s travelogues so controversial. His critics called them self-absorbed confabulations, fiction presented as fact. This isn\u2019t untrue, but it is also incidental to the works\u2019 resonance and beauty. Writings about place are almost always about the writer: The most rigorous are a series of self-exposures, revelations of their chroniclers\u2019 prejudices and ignorances. The genius of \u2018\u2018The Songlines\u2019\u2019 is not in its veracity, but in its artificiality \u2014 of plot, of character and of storytelling. It is a book that feels like what it is, a performative diary, a person trying to prove a thesis about the human condition to himself. Chatwin doesn\u2019t claim to be an expert on Australia, or on nomadism or on Aboriginal culture \u2014 he doesn\u2019t even claim to be an expert on himself. But the reader allows herself to be guided by him anyway, because what is being revealed is not a physical terrain so much as the twisty, dead-endy pathways of the author\u2019s own subconscious, and it is a glorious maze to be in, sparky and colorful and punctuated with unexpected roundabouts.The novels are a reminder too that fiction provides a kind of safety; it allows the writer to create outlandish stories and characters without fear (not reasonable fear, anyway) that they might be taken as representatives of an entire culture or ethnicity or race \u2014 indeed, in these books, Chatwin says more about colonialism, and tin-can monarchies and failed systems of government, than you find in either \u2018\u2018The Songlines\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018In Patagonia.\u2019\u2019 They are also more relaxed, more revealing of obsessions from Chatwin\u2019s own life, than his nonfiction: Behind the scrim of fiction, the writer is able to stop performing as an author and devote his energies to being a storyteller instead. Chatwin had a keen appreciation for objects, and all three novels are decorated with lovingly, precisely described material goods, evidence of his ability to conjure an entire history by noting the stuff of people\u2019s lives. \u2018\u2018Utz,\u2019\u2019 for example, is a sad, sweetly funny elegy for Mitteleuropa told through the story of a maniacally \u00adsingle-minded collector of Meissen porcelain, a collection that imprisons him in both Prague and, by extension, socialism itself. In \u2018\u2018Ouidah,\u2019\u2019 the titular viceroy\u2019s daughter hoards some of her father\u2019s possessions \u2014 \u2018\u2018.\u2009.\u2009. his silver-mounted cigar case; his pink opaline chamber pot; his ivory-handled slave-brand with the initials F.S.; his rosary of carnauba nuts; some scraps of paper covered with his handwriting; a lithograph of the Emperor Dom Pedro II; a picture of a Brazilian house, and a particularly bloodthirsty canvas of Judith hacking off the head of Holophernes\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a catalog that forms its own miniature portrait, a biography of a man found not in the people he sired or the land he conquered, but in the things he cherished.But of all his books, it is perhaps \u2018\u2018On the Black Hill\u2019\u2019 that displays Chatwin at his finest and most surprising. Certainly it is the most disciplined of his novels, the least dazzling in setting or circumstance, but told with an economy and elegance of language and, most strikingly, a deep tenderness. Here, the location is not some impossible land, but a farm in rural Wales. Here, the people are not eccentric collectors or sadistic potentates, but twin brothers, farmers and sons of a farmer, who, through first the Great War and then the next, never leave home for any significant period of time. The world moves into modernity but Lewis and Benjamin largely remain behind, sometimes scrabbling forward to catch it, but mostly just clinging to its tail, being dragged reluctantly forward. Though they too are Chatwinesque oddities, their lives are not sources of irony, but instead of wonder.The book is also a reminder of how lovely Chatwin\u2019s language could be, how years of seeing had given him the power to describe in terms both startling and true: a \u2018\u2018pewter sun\u2019\u2019 hangs low over the cold Black Hill, the rooks\u2019 \u2018\u2018wingtips glinting like flakes of ice.\u2019\u2019 An \u00adAfro-Brazilian boy in \u2018\u2018Ouidah\u2019\u2019 is notable for his \u2018\u2018wad of blond hair\u2019\u2019; and in \u2018\u2018The Songlines,\u2019\u2019 a prized possession of childhood, a conch shell from the West Indies that Chatwin named Mona, is rendered as a \u2018\u2018sheeny pink vulva\u2019\u2019 in which he heard the sea\u2019s shushing slush. Such instances are testament to how Chatwin could isolate the most revealing detail from the people and places and situations he observed: He may have been writing about himself, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t watching everything around him. A writer, like a traveler, is a thief. He waits and waits, and at the moment of divulgence \u2014 which inevitably arrives, should he be able to wait long enough \u2014 he seizes the secret or confession he came for, magpie-like, and flits away, a glossy black shadow. Someone else\u2019s story becomes his own, and his to tell and share. And when there were no appropriate words for a tale, when English provided no exact match? Well, then, Chatwin simply invented the language he needed, sometimes so evocatively, with such charm and precision \u2014 the flies on a hot day in June \u2018\u2018zooming and zizzing\u2019\u2019 around the twins\u2019 barn \u2014 that one forgets that one is encountering them for the first time here, that they are Chatwin\u2019s own creations or resurrections. (Resourcefulness: another of the traveler\u2019s necessary qualities. When something doesn\u2019t exist, be it shelter or friends or words, one learns to make them with whatever\u2019s available.)13 PhotosIt is never quite a satisfying exercise \u2014 and at any rate, a rather insulting one \u2014 to try to excavate from a work of fiction evidence of the \u00adauthor\u2019s regrets and misgivings about his own life. But \u2018\u2018On the Black Hill\u2019\u2019 makes it nearly \u00adimpossible not to indulge. By the time the novel was published, Chatwin had been a professional peripatetic for a decade; seven years later, at the age of 48, he would be dead of an AIDS-related illness. One cannot help but wonder if in Lewis, an armchair traveler and geography lover who is never quite able to venture far from home, Chatwin was writing himself an alternative narrative. For this is a book about the difficult work of standing still; it is a book that suggests that although (maybe?) the ideal human state may in fact be movement, the more challenging one is remaining exactly where you were born, that accepting that the earth may not be yours to occupy is its own kind of nobility. \u2018\u2018The planet was now full of bickering little countries with unpronounceable names,\u2019\u2019 Lewis comforts himself. \u2018\u2018Real journeys only existed in the imagination.\u2019\u2019 But for Chatwin, the journeys were both real and imaginary: Fact became fiction, and fiction fact, and the terra incognita he traveled between them was where the true adventure lay.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Folly", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerica faces two serious national security threats today that look wildly different but have one core feature in common \u2014 they both have a low probability of happening, but, if they did happen, they could have devastating consequences for our whole country and the world.One of these threats is called North Korea. If the reckless leader of North Korea is able to launch an arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles that strike the U.S. mainland, the impact on America will be incalculable.And even though the odds of that happening are low \u2014 it would be an act of suicide by the North Korean dynasty \u2014 President Trump is ready to spend billions on antimissile systems, warships, cyberdefenses, air power and war games to defuse and deter this North Korean threat.And if we prepare for a North Korean nuclear attack and it never happens, we will be left with some improved weaponry that we might be able to use in other theaters, like fighter jets, ships and missiles \u2014 but nothing particularly productive for our economy or job creation.The other low-probability, high-impact threat is climate change fueled by increased human-caused carbon emissions. The truth is, if you simply trace the steady increase in costly extreme weather events \u2014 wildfires, floods, droughts and climate-related human migrations \u2014 the odds of human-driven global warming having a devastating impact on our planet are not low probability but high probability.But let\u2019s assume for a minute that because climate change is a complex process \u2014 which we do not fully understand \u2014 climate change is a low-probability, high-impact event just like a North Korean nuclear strike. What is the Trump team doing when confronted with this similar threat?It\u2019s taking a spike and poking out its own eyes. In possibly the most intellectually corrupt declaration of the Trump era \u2014 a high bar \u2014 Scott Pruitt, a longtime shill for oil and gas companies now masquerading as the head of the E.P.A., actually declared that even discussing possible links between human-driven climate disruptions and the recent monster storms was \u201cinsensitive.\u201d He said that after our country got hit by two Atlantic Category 4 hurricanes in the same year for the first time since records have been kept \u2014 storms made more destructive by rising ocean levels and warmer ocean waters.Makes me wonder \u2026 if Pruitt were afflicted with cancer, would he not want scientists discussing with him, let alone researching, the possible causes and solutions? Wouldn\u2019t want to upset him.That is why I prefer the term \u201cglobal weirding\u201d over \u201cglobal warming.\u201d The weather does get warmer in some places, but it gets weird in others. Look at the past few months: Not only were several big U.S. cities slammed by monster hurricanes, but San Francisco set a heat record \u2014 106 degrees on Sept. 1, a day when the average high there is 70 degrees; the West was choked by record-breaking forest fires exacerbated by drought; and South Asia was slammed by extraordinarily harsh monsoons, killing some 1,400 people.But what if we prepare for disruptive climate change and it doesn\u2019t get as bad as feared? Where will we be? Well, we will have cleaner air to breathe, less childhood asthma, more innovative building materials and designs, and cleaner, more efficient power generation and transportation systems \u2014 all of which will be huge export industries and create tens of thousands of good, repeat jobs. Because with world population steadily rising, we all will need greener cars and power if we just want to breathe clean air, no matter what happens with the climate. We will also be less dependent on petro-dictators.Indeed, it is safe to say, that if we overprepare for climate change and nothing much happens, it will be exactly like training for the Olympic marathon and the Olympics get canceled. You\u2019re left with a body that is stronger, fitter and healthier.Trump has recently fired various knuckle-headed aides whose behavior was causing him short-term embarrassment. The person he needs to fire is Scott Pruitt. Pruitt is going to cause Trump long-term embarrassment. But instead, together they are authoring a new national security doctrine \u2014 one that says when faced with a low-probability, high-impact event like North Korea, the U.S. should spend any amount of money, and if the threat doesn\u2019t materialize, well, we\u2019ll have a lot of Army surplus and scrap metal.But when faced with an actually high-probability, high-impact threat called climate change, we should do nothing and poke both our eyes out, even though if the impact is less severe \u2014 and we prepare for it anyway \u2014 we will be left healthier, stronger, more productive, more resilient and more respected around the world.That is the Pruitt-Trump Doctrine \u2014 soon to be known as \u201cTrump\u2019s Folly.\u201dFrank Bruni is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Proposal: Who Wins, Who Loses?", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:The vast majority of those Canadian corporate tax windfalls went not into job creation or investment in Canada but rather to share buybacks, bonuses and investments internationally. A corporate tax rate drop in America from 35 percent to 20 percent is sure to end in many of the same results. The Trump administration would, in effect, be borrowing money, adding debt and deepening yearly deficits to pay for that corporate tax cut.As the government\u2019s yearly revenues diminish, less and less money will be available to address the expanding social, environmental, education and economic needs of an America looking to make itself great once again.EDWARD CARSON, TORONTOTo the Editor:The proposed tax plan removes most itemized deductions except mortgage interest and charitable donations. In return, it almost doubles the standard deduction for all filing categories. I assume the motive for retaining these two deductions is to placate various interest groups such as the real estate industry and religious institutions. However, this appears to be an additional benefit only for the wealthy.A married couple would have to give very large donations and/or have a sizable mortgage to cross the threshold of the standard deduction. For the average home buyer, the tax deduction for interest will be a thing of the past. The same reasoning holds true for charitable donations. For these deductions to remain and benefit everyone, they should be separate line item deductions in addition to the standard deduction. As proposed they remain a benefit only to the wealthy.To the Editor:In a press briefing on Thursday about the outlines of the tax plan, Gary Cohn, President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, said that average Americans are only interested in their own taxes and not how the tax plan would affect the wealthy. Not true. I am an average American and would like to know if the proposal benefits not only Mr. Trump and his family but other wealthy citizens as well.Mr. Cohn also stated that tax cuts to the middle class would result in an average savings of $1,000. \u201cWhat does that mean? They can renovate their kitchen, they can buy a new car, they can take a family vacation,\u201d he said. How could my whopping $83 a month tax savings begin to do this? I guess I could pick up a new faucet, buy a used Yugo or stay one night at a Trump hotel.LAWRENCE ABBOTT, BELMONT, ME.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Tillerson\u2019s China Stop, Questions on North Korea but Slim Chance of Clarity", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson is scheduled to arrive in Beijing early Saturday for a brief visit, amid confusing signals about President Trump\u2019s position on two questions looming over the confrontation with North Korea: Is America\u2019s long-term goal to overthrow its leader, Kim Jong-un, or just try to change his behavior? And what would it take to get negotiations with Pyongyang started?Similarly, Chinese officials are likely to scrutinize Mr. Tillerson to see if he is willing \u2014 or able \u2014 to provide clarity about the contradictory statements issued by top national security officials over the conditions under which American officials would actually talk with the North Koreans. Mr. Tillerson himself has been inconsistent, insisting months ago that Mr. Kim must first give up all his weapons, then arguing in August that he must simply pause their nuclear and missile testing.But last week Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, insisted that the North would have to agree to highly intrusive inspections to determine the whereabouts of its nuclear weapons, and agree to ultimately plan to surrender its arsenal. The North has never allowed inspectors far beyond its Yongbyon reactor facility, and its arsenal is now enshrined in its Constitution as something no official could ever trade away.\u201cXi doesn\u2019t want any distractions,\u201d Michael J. Green, a former senior American diplomat who now teaches about East Asia at Georgetown University, said at a forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Tuesday. \u201cParticularly from the North Koreans.\u201dSo in recent days the Chinese have done just enough to hold Mr. Tillerson off for a number of months. They have announced a series of new financial rules that, after the letter of the latest round of United Nations sanctions, should make it all but impossible for Chinese financial institutions to do business with North Korea, at least in any visible way.North Korean officials recently set up a committee to investigate the impact of the sanctions on the country\u2019s economy and the well-being of the population. The committee\u2019s work was designed to draw international sympathy by highlighting the suffering of North Korean children, women and elderly people, analysts said.The sanctions are \u201ca brutal criminal act that indiscriminately infringes upon the right to existence of the peaceful civilians,\u201d said a spokesman of the Sanctions Damages Investigation Committee in a statement carried by the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency on Friday. \u201cThe colossal amount of damage caused by these sanctions to the development of our state and the people\u2019s livelihood is beyond anyone\u2019s calculation.\u201dOn Thursday, the Chinese commerce ministry said North Korean ventures and joint ventures in China had to close within 120 days of the Sept. 11 approval of the latest Security Council sanctions. Some energy supplies have been cut, though the Chinese managed to kill a much tougher American proposal at the United Nations to cut off all crude oil to the North, and allow shipping in and out of the country to be inspected by force, if necessary.\u201cChina has taken some great strides in recent weeks, and we look forward to China adhering to the U.N. Security Council resolutions and fully implementing all those resolutions,\u201d Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI think the secretary will be thanking them for the steps that they\u2019ve taken in that direction.\u201dBut when not speaking for attribution, virtually no American officials \u2014 including Trump administration appointees and diplomats who have dealt with North Korea in the past \u2014 believe that any escalation of sanctions will do more than temporarily slow the nuclear program.\u201cThey have no intention of giving it up,\u201d Sue Mi Terry, a former North Korea analyst for the C.I.A. and now a consultant on Korea issues for BowerGroupAsia, said earlier this week in Washington. But it is an exercise both the United States and China must go through, she said, until the United States decides whether it is simply going to live with North Korea\u2019s status as a nuclear state whose weapons can reach American shores.Mr. Trump insists he will never live with that threat, and says that is what separates him from the past four American presidents. He promises to \u201csolve\u201d the North Korean problem once and for all, after being left \u201ca mess\u201d by his predecessors.But, apart from his martial sounding tweets and his assurances that the military is prepared to destroy North Korea at his command, he is staying vague about what a solution looks like. One senior aide said recently that in internal debates, there is an assumption that the problem cannot be solved with Mr. Kim still in power, but acknowledged that the United States has no understanding of whether a successor would be better or worse.For his part, Mr. Tillerson, though hired for his ability to strike deals, has never talked about what the United States would give North Korea in return. There is speculation about a quiet agreement with the North to scale back military exercises. It is doubtful that alone would impress Mr. Kim as he nears the completion of his national mission, a weapon that can reach the United States.But doing so would require some channel of communication, overt or covert. Asked earlier this week about whether there were any contacts with the North, General McMaster said no, then quickly left the door open to doing exactly that.\u201cWhen we do,\u201d he said, \u201chopefully it will not make it into The New York Times.\u201dChinese officials keep discussing a so-called freeze for freeze, in which Mr. Kim gives up nuclear and missile tests and the United States gives up its exercises. But both Mr. Tillerson and General McMaster have rejected that step, arguing that to do it now, with the North\u2019s weapons and delivery systems so advanced, would be to acknowledge the North as a nuclear power, even if there was vague talk of eventually reaching an accord over the ultimate status of the North\u2019s weapons.Lurking beneath that conversation is another that the United States has consistently tried, and failed, to engage in with the Chinese: a secret discussion over how to plan for a collapse of the North Korean government, when there may be only hours, or days, to scramble for control of the country\u2019s well-hidden nuclear arsenal.It is a topic the Chinese do not want to discuss and have always avoided, for fear news of the discussion would leak, and it would look as if Beijing were plotting either to abandon or take over the North. Now, some senior American officials say, the subject can no longer be avoided, because if a conflict breaks out, there will be no time to discuss it later.Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}

He was peering through the subterranean gloom of a former Nazi telecommunications bunker where a 10th-century Khmer statue of Vishnu was juxtaposed with an Anish Kapoor mirror sculpture embedded in wartime concrete.Mr. Feuerle likes surprise juxtapositions. On the lower floor, entered through pitch darkness to a John Cage soundtrack, medieval Cambodian sculpture was combined with contemporary works by Mr. Kapoor and the erotica photographer Nobuyoshi Araki. Upstairs, Chinese furniture from the Qing dynasty stood next to conceptual art by Cristina Iglesias and James Lee Byars.\u201cMy collection is very refined and elegant; Berlin is the opposite\u201d said Mr. Feuerle, a former Cologne gallerist who spends much of his year in Asia.\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that people will come to a fair in Berlin but they won\u2019t buy,\u201d said London-based Pippy Houldsworth, one of just five exhibitors with galleries in Britain or the United States. \u201cIn the current global climate, some dealers were nervous about trying a new fair.\u201dMs. Houldsworth said that Art Berlin\u2019s owners had managed to bring in collectors from Germany\u2019s more affluent Rhineland region as well as from Belgium and the Netherlands. The fair attracted 33,000 visitors, according to the organizers.The organizers made a deliberate effort to keep the costs relatively low, enabling younger galleries to show works by emerging names at approachable prices.\u201cIt was so much better compared to last year,\u201d a local collector, Gudrun Wurlitzer, said of Art Berlin. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know if ABC was an exhibition or a fair.\u201dMrs. Wurlitzer and her husband, Bernd, were also part of the Berlin Art Week program, showing works by younger artists at their \u201cPied-\u00e0-Terre Collection\u201d in a communist-era apartment block featured in the 2006 movie \u201cThe Lives of Others.\u201d A silk-and-wool carpet, \u201cThe Empty Space,\u201d designed by the Berlin artist Sultan Acar, attracted admirers. Woven in Nepal in 2016, the carpet lyrically evokes a vacant rectangle of pavement in Berlin on which an equestrian statue of Kaiser Friedrich III once stood.\u201cThere are two art scenes in Berlin,\u201d Mrs. Wurlitzer said. \u201cThere is an official one, and there is another scene in which artists hold pop-up shows, share exhibitions and self-market themselves. We\u2019re trying to create an online forum which brings both scenes closer.\u201dWhat can yet another contemporary art fair do for them?Not much, said Marta Gnyp, an art writer and adviser who lives in the city. \u201cI wonder whether Berlin needs an international fair,\u201d she said. She pointed out that Gallery Weekend was already very successful at attracting foreign collectors. \u201cWith the busy international art calendar, they won\u2019t visit Berlin twice a year,\u201d she said, adding that she thought Art Berlin could work well as a more modestly focused \u201cregional\u201d fair.\u201cIn all the internationally oriented fairs like Art Basel and Frieze, you see the big names you find everywhere,\u201d said Mr. Feuerle, the globe-trotting Berlin museum owner. \u201cI don\u2019t see too much local art from the country, which to me is boring, as I come to see and explore something different and new.\u201dBerlin is a city with plenty of artists trying to say something new.

{"Headline": "The China Puzzle", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThis much is true: For the foreseeable future, no relationship is more crucial than that between these two nations. Together, they have a combined population of more than 1.7 billion people. Their economies dwarf all others, they both have nuclear weapons, they both have veto power in the United Nations Security Council. Their appetites and ambitions shape the globe: Together they can make for a more peaceful world; as adversaries, they can make a mess of things.Additionally, the administration has been slow to get China experts into senior posts at the White House and State Department; for good or ill, Mr. Bannon was one person with Mr. Trump\u2019s ear who took a big interest in China. Now there is no senior person with close ties to the president to oversee China policy, which does little to foster a consistent policy or reflect well on American leadership.Against Mr. Trump\u2019s impulsiveness and his espousal of an America First agenda of isolationism and protectionism, Mr. Xi projects a steady hand as he tries to remake the global economic and political order and entice nations into Beijing\u2019s orbit.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump, unlike his predecessor, Barack Obama, who worked to expand American influence in Asia, has ceded significant ground to China, especially by withdrawing from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and thus allowing Beijing an opening to set trade rules in the region. The American president will share the world stage with Mr. Xi for the first time this week when both men address the annual United Nations General Assembly.Can there be robust cooperation? In 2005, when President George W. Bush was in office, Robert Zoellick, then a deputy secretary of state, encouraged China to become a \u201cresponsible stakeholder\u201d and help strengthen the Western-designed postwar international system from which it benefited. Yet today more officials and experts are putting China in the adversary category, or leaning toward doing so, not least because of Beijing\u2019s decision to expand its military capability and project it further into the South China Sea.Still, to anyone who steps back from the immediate conflicts over territory and trade, there is no alternative to cooperation on major challenges, even if interests aren\u2019t always aligned. Mr. Trump is supposed to make his first presidential trip to Beijing in November, and Mr. Xi will certainly want to demonstrate that he can work with and manage the mercurial American president. The meeting is a natural forcing mechanism for getting some things done.Here\u2019s one thing that is not much talked about: counterterrorism. Mr. Trump worries about the Islamic State, Mr. Xi about Muslim Uighurs in China\u2019s northwestern region of Xinjiang. Beijing could benefit from American intelligence about militants returning from the Middle East to Xinjiang; Washington would be interested in China\u2019s help in persuading Pakistan to crack down on the Taliban.On trade, there may be an opportunity for progress on a bilateral investment treaty, with American investment offered in exchange for broader access to the Chinese market for American companies. On intellectual property, now that China is putting energy into developing its own technology instead of just stealing America\u2019s, the two could work together on stronger protections.There is a template for cooperation, and while it involves an issue in which Mr. Trump has no interest, it provides a glimpse of a way forward. The issue is climate change. A combination of arduous negotiation by Secretary of State John Kerry and the Obama White House, plus China\u2019s own horrible air pollution problems, brought Beijing around to signing the Paris accord and making a major commitment to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions. Self-interest and patient diplomacy: a combination that could work to the benefit of the entire world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Trump, Job Market Has Improved More for Clinton Supporters", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic WinnersDemocrats, meanwhile, have grown far less confident about the economy. But the job market has improved at least as much for those likelier to be Hillary Clinton supporters as for Trump supporters. In fact, the drop in unemployment and the rise in wages have been stronger for them by some measures.These estimates are based on data that the Labor Department uses for the monthly jobs reports, combined with a model of voting based on demographics.Contrary to popular perception, likelier Trump supporters were doing better over all in the labor market than likelier Clinton supporters both before and after the election. Throughout 2016 and in 2017, both the unemployment rate and a broader measure, U-6, which captures people who are working part-time but want a full-time job and those who would like a job but have given up looking out of frustration, were lower for likelier Trump supporters than for likelier Clinton supporters. Median full-time wages were higher for likelier Trump supporters, too. These results reflect the fact that Trump voters were older and whiter than Clinton voters.What has happened since Inauguration Day? The unemployment rate has fallen by equal amounts for both groups: to 3.6 percent in July from 4 percent in January for likelier Trump supporters, and to 4.5 percent from 4.9 percent for likelier Clinton supporters. The prime-age employment-population ratio has risen by 0.4 percentage points for both groups. This measure, unlike the unemployment rate, accounts for whether people have dropped out of the labor force entirely. The prime-age labor force participation rate has also increased similarly for both groups.On other measures, likelier Clinton supporters have seen more improvement than likelier Trump supporters since January. The broader U-6 rate has fallen by 0.8 points for likelier Clinton supporters and by 0.6 points for likelier Trump supporters. And median usual weekly earnings are up 2.9 percent for likelier Clinton supporters versus 1.8 percent for likelier Trump supporters. The story is similar if we look at eight months of data after Election Day instead of six months after Inauguration Day.Only seven months into the new administration, it\u2019s far too soon to say whether the Trump years will eventually bring more jobs and higher wages to his base than to his detractors. But so far, the difference in labor market success has, if anything, gone in the opposite direction of the partisan swing in economic confidence.MethodologyAdvertisement"}

The workampers\u2019 RVs look like \u201cmobile apothecaries,\u201d Bruder writes. Amazon\u2019s warehouses feature wall-mounted dispensers of free painkillers. America runs on ibuprofen; it\u2019s the performance drug of the new economy.Bruder is a poised and graceful writer. But her book is plagued by odd evasions. Take race, the major one.

Not to mention that in the light of the death of Philando Castile, among others, and the beating of Sureshbhai Patel, the open road seems romantic only to some.

{"Headline": "Who Will Save These Dying Italian Towns?", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "Near-empty villages try to hold on to an endangered way of life \u2014 and some of the country\u2019s most important artisanal traditions.Supported byTHE FIRST THING that must be said about the ancient town of Civita di Bagnoregio, just two hours away from Rome and Florence, is that it is beautiful. From a distance, it looks literally otherworldly: The town sits so high atop a perilously steep pinnacle of eroding volcanic rock that it seems as if it\u2019s perched upon clouds rather than tethered to the earth. Its very sediment is strafed with 2,500 years of architectural history: Etruscan caves, ancient remains, medieval dwellings and Renaissance villas.Originally a center along ancient trade routes, Civita di Bagnoregio was prosperous from Roman times through the late Middle Ages. But after a devastating earthquake in 1695, most residents fled for lower ground, and so began the city\u2019s long decline. By the end of World War II, nearly all of its inhabitants had left in search of work in cities or abroad. For the last half century, its population has hovered around 10 or so full-time residents.Because the erosion of the hill is so severe (houses have been tumbling off its sides since the 1700s), Civita di Bagnoregio will eventually be reclaimed by the landscape. Residents and visitors alike must park at the base and ascend a steep footbridge to enter through a huge Gothic archway. Past the backless facade of a Renaissance house, with several of its windows open to the sky like a stage set, lies a small, dusty piazza with a church, a fine seventh-century medieval tower, a small bar and not much else. There is no pharmacy or school, no hospital, none of the necessities that somehow serve to make a place a place. There are only a couple of inns, and a few restaurants. Civita is real without being actual, if that makes any sense.FOR ALL THE ANCIENT Italian hill towns and villages that delight the traveler \u2014 the San Gimignanos, Montepulcianos and Fiesoles \u2014 there are scores of others (many equally or more beautiful) where few venture and in which very few reside today. According to a 2016 Italian environmental association report, there are nearly 2,500 rural Italian villages that are perilously depopulated, some semi-abandoned and others virtual ghost towns. A primary narrative of Italy in the 20th century has been what followed the collision of poverty, urbanization, mass emigration and natural disaster, a confluence of events that has devastated many towns that had otherwise managed to thrive, or at least get by, for centuries. These towns, most of which are in the historically impoverished south, had already lost tens of millions of inhabitants in the great waves of migration from the late 19th century to the mid 1970s; in the last 25 years, they lost another 15 percent. Now, houses and schools sit empty and fields fallow; shops are unattended.These rural places were once intricately tied to the countryside around them, their inhabitants working as farmers and merchants, craftsmen and shepherds. But when these towns die, it\u2019s not just the population that suffers: so too do the unique traditions and skills associated with each place, as well as the landscape that supported them. This phenomenon is, of course, not unique to Italy: Small towns across the developed world, including in the United States, are left behind as technologies and economies change, rendering the industries and the know-how that once sustained them obsolete, forcing their populations to relocate to urban centers. What is particular to Italy, however, is the exquisite architectural character of its hill towns, as well as the quality of the handiwork and traditions that were born, cultivated and perfected here. These towns and their craftsmanship are what we think of when we think of Italy \u2014 as fundamental to the country\u2019s identity as its important cities and grand artistic legacies. It isn\u2019t far-fetched to say that what\u2019s at risk of being lost with their obsolescence is nothing less than Italy\u2019s rural soul.But though these towns may represent the essence of Italian history and the country\u2019s artisanal tradition, the government has done little to help preserve them, aside from declaring 2017 \u2018\u2018The Year of the Villages\u2019\u2019 in hopes of boosting tourism. It has therefore fallen to locals \u2014 citizens and mayors \u2014 to try to change their fates, often through inventive, sometimes ingenious, methods that mingle humor with a deep sorrow and desperation. One picturesque medieval hamlet in Tuscany, Pratariccia, sold itself on eBay for $3.1 million several years ago. Another, Calsazio, tried to follow, offering itself for only $333,000, listing the item\u2019s condition as \u2018\u2018used.\u2019\u2019 In Calabria, the mayor of Sellia (population 530) signed a decree banning death and illness in his town, and recently opened an adventure park with a giant zip line he thought would lure visitors. Most recently, the mayor of Bormida in Liguria floated a provisional offer on his Facebook page: $2,100 to anyone who moved there in order to keep it populated. (There was so much interest that he had to delete the post.)And then there are towns like Civita di Bagnoregio. Like so many of the others, it has been preserved by the very forces that doomed it: poverty and abandonment. Unlike the others, however, Civita was saved by having been \u2018\u2018discovered\u2019\u2019 by fashionable Romans (including Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele) and expats over the last 20 or so years, who have made summer houses or weekend places of its exceptionally fine, deserted buildings, drawn by the romance of Civita\u2019s remarkable situation \u2014 and its proximity to Rome. The restoration of the entire town is eerily pristine; there\u2019s nary a yellowing leaf on the potted geraniums and colorful hydrangeas that grace the exterior of every perfectly renovated house.These days, Civita has become a tourist destination for day trippers, who arrive by the busload and pay a small fee to enter. Sometimes up to 5,000 people a day wander the town, which at its seasonal height sleeps only about 100. The effect of all these people \u2014 selfie sticks moving through the air like antennae \u2014 gives the place the unfortunate air of a Disney set: a hyper-clean, historically accurate medieval town as realized on a Universal Studios back lot. There is nothing to mar the scene \u2014 no pizzerias or Starbucks or even cars. And just as one starts to wonder what kind of town is one in which there are no children or families, no banks or offices, dusk starts to fall, and the tourists and the white heat of the day retreat. Things go quiet, the light glows pink and the \u2018\u2018locals,\u2019\u2019 many from Rome and the U.S., start to appear \u2014 there are drinks on terraces and quiet dinners in the side streets, conversations in private gardens among neighbors and friends who know one another, and who all love and care for this enchanted, imperiled piece of history.BUT THE FARTHER ONE gets from major cities like Florence or Rome, the more difficult it is to attract weekend tourists. Deep in Sicily, off a terrible road whose signs resignedly warn of potholes, lies the isolated town of Sutera, built around the base of a steep mountain. In 2013, at the behest of its mayor, the town opened its doors \u2014 and its empty houses \u2014 to survivors of the catastrophic Lampedusa shipwreck, which killed more than 360 refugees. Sutera\u2019s population had dwindled from 5,000 in 1970 to just 1,500, and the mayor recognized the humanitarian and economic opportunity the migrants could provide for his moribund town. To help the refugees, most of whom are from sub-Saharan Africa, integrate into the community, they are paired with local families, and required to take Italian lessons, given to them by the town\u2019s citizens. (The European Union provides funding for food, clothing and housing, which can spur the creation of jobs for both migrants and locals.) Initially, there was some resistance, but that has disappeared with the energy these newcomers have brought to the area. Today, one can find young Nigerians taking their morning espresso alongside the old men, and local children kicking soccer balls in the street with their new playmates. And each summer the town hosts a daylong festival featuring the traditional food, music and dance of the immigrants.One of the first towns to invite migrants into its walls was Riace, in Calabria, whose mayor, Domenico Lucano, was named one of Fortune\u2019s \u2018\u2018World\u2019s 50 Greatest Leaders\u2019\u2019 last year. By 1998, when it took in a group of Kurdish refugees, Riace\u2019s population had fallen to around 800 from 2,500 after World War II. Today, its population is 1,500, with migrants from over 20 countries. Some of these are apprenticing artisans, learning old skills like embroidery, glass mosaic and pottery that were themselves dying out, and so helping keep Italian culture alive. Lucano told the BBC, \u2018\u2018The multiculturalism, the variety of skills and personal stories which people have brought to Riace, have revolutionized what was becoming a ghost town.\u2019\u2019 Other towns have taken Riace\u2019s lead, too: an act of humanity that has become an act of self-preservation as well.UNLIKE URBAN CENTERS, hill towns were built to be connected to the countryside, which provided each its particular raison d\u2019\u00eatre, from its subsistence to its commerce. Even physically, the towns appear like natural outcroppings, terraced along the sides of hills, as if sprouting from the earth beneath them.In the region of Abruzzo, surrounded by the high peaks of the Apennines, the stunning fortified medieval hilltop village of Santo Stefano di Sessanio sits atop a ridge overlooking a dramatic and lush plateau. Once a bustling center of agriculture and wool production, it began to shrink when the Italian wool industry went into decline, crippled by competition from abroad. By the 1990s, the town had only about 100 full-time residents. Santo Stefano is just two hours from Rome and is surrounded by countryside that resembles the Austrian hills of \u2018\u2018The Sound of Music\u2019\u2019: expansive fields of wildflowers backed by majestic snowcapped mountains. It is a sublime place for hiking or bicycling in summer and skiing or snowshoeing in winter. And yet, Abruzzo, long considered poor and backward, has never been particularly beloved by Italians, and consequently, not much considered or well known.The ancient hill town came as a shock, a revelation really, to Daniele Kihlgren, the renegade scion of an Italian concrete fortune, when he came upon it while on a motorcycle ride in the late 1990s. Although semi-abandoned, its medieval character and architecture were completely intact \u2014 unruined, ironically, by concrete, the material Kihlgren is the first to acknowledge has disgraced so much of Italy. How, he wondered, might places of such distinct and exquisite beauty be revitalized without wrecking their historic identity? And how might their local traditions, from food to domestic handicrafts, be organically preserved? \u2018\u2018We can\u2019t compete with China in mass production, and we can\u2019t compete in technology,\u2019\u2019 Kihlgren says, \u2018\u2018but we have what no one else in the world has,\u2019\u2019 which is the beauty of these villages and the cultural history of its people, the stuff he calls Italy\u2019s minor patrimony. \u2018\u2018And if we don\u2019t ruin it, it can be what saves southern Italy.\u2019\u2019It is also what has helped revive it. Thanks largely to Sextantio, there are now new jobs, thousands of tourists annually, nearly two dozen new bed-and-breakfasts and several restaurants, galleries and shops. But Kihlgren has sunk his fortune into this project \u2014 as well as into other villages that he has bought, either outright or partially, with the intention of resurrecting them using the same model. While his is primarily a cultural project, he is keenly aware that unless it can make money and be replicated, it is just a folly in his grand quest to resuscitate southern Italy. And indeed, there have been many difficulties and setbacks \u2014 from his own high standards to the devastating earthquake that rocked the region in 2009. This past July marked the first month since the project\u2019s inception in which he made a profit.Still, Kihlgren remains optimistic \u2014 and how can anyone who loves Italy not root for his success? \u2018\u2018If I, someone with no business skills at all, can make this work,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018then there is hope \u2014 hope that the values contained in these small historical places can be the engine to revitalize them.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This German Village Is a Town Based on Time", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGLASH\u00dcTTE, Germany \u2014 Globally the luxury watch industry is in crisis. But somehow this village in an isolated corner of eastern Germany, with an economy totally dependent on watchmaking for the last 170 years, is thriving.Unemployment is less than 5 percent. Mayor Markus Dressler reluctantly turns away companies that want to move to Glash\u00fctte. The village, with 1,800 residents, is squeezed into a bucolic but narrow valley and there is no room for new buildings. Glash\u00fctte has no hotel because no one has been able to find a place to put one.One big reason for Glash\u00fctte\u2019s prosperity is found in a renovated train station where Uwe Ahrendt first kissed a girl. Mr. Ahrendt, a Glash\u00fctte native and fifth-generation watchmaker, is chief executive of Nomos, whose minimalist, relatively affordable designs have helped Glash\u00fctte to float above the crisis afflicting its Swiss competitors.Nomos has turned Glash\u00fctte\u2019s former train station into a headquarters and manufacturing center. \u201cThis used to be the ladies\u2019 rest room,\u201d Mr. Ahrendt said as he led a visitor through a narrow space now filled with machinery.Nomos is emblematic of the renaissance in fine watchmaking that has taken place in Glash\u00fctte since the fall of Communism in 1989. Today the valley is lined with nearly a dozen high-end makers of mechanical watches and chronometers, each with its own renaissance story.The town\u2019s focus on watchmaking is impossible to overlook. Glash\u00fctte is at the confluence of two fast-moving rivers, the M\u00fcglitz and Priessnitz, which pass through two steep valleys before they converge just below Nomos\u2019s headquarters. The narrow corridors between the valleys are lined with watchmakers, their logos prominent on the factory facades.On a recent day the streets were mostly quiet and deserted except for a few tourists. Though it is a factory town, almost no sound emanates from the Glash\u00fctte factories. Most of the work is done by master watchmakers hunched over tables of miniature components, wearing magnifying eyepieces or peering through microscopes as they finish and assemble the mechanical movements by hand.The watchmaking industry in Glash\u00fctte employs about 1,800 people, more than it did during communist times. That is a rarity. East German factories often were overstaffed and inefficient, and survived the transition to a market economy only by making draconian job cuts \u2014 if they survived at all.Measured by numbers of watches produced, Nomos is the largest of the companies responsible for reviving Glash\u00fctte\u2019s luster as a center of fine watchmaking. A. Lange & S\u00f6hne, located just across the street, has the longest tradition in Glash\u00fctte, and the largest revenue in monetary terms because of the high prices its watches command.Glash\u00fctte\u2019s limited space \u2014 in much of the town the sloped terrain allows room for only one street \u2014 has a clear benefit for the watchmaking companies already established there, which include Moritz Grossmann, Tutima, Wempe Glash\u00fctte and Bruno S\u00f6hnle. It helps to preserve their products\u2019 exclusivity as, by law, watches cannot label themselves as made in Glash\u00fctte unless at least 50 percent of their components, measured in terms of their value, are produced locally.The town\u2019s watchmaking tradition goes back to the mid-1800s when Ferdinand Adolph Lange began manufacturing watches there with financial support from local nobility anxious to create work for impoverished local people, who had little means of support after silver mines in the area were tapped out.Other watchmakers followed and by the beginning of the 20th century, the town had acquired a worldwide reputation for its quality and precision work.But after World War II the watch companies were expropriated by the Soviet-supported regime. The town continued to produce watches, but they were cheaper quartz models exported to West Germany to earn hard currency.After the fall of the Iron Curtain, A. Lange and other fine watchmakers began to return, and found a market among aficionados of fine watches for whom the name Glash\u00fctte still had mystique.Nomos was one of the pioneers of the renaissance. The company was founded in 1990 by Roland Schwertner, a fashion photographer and computer expert with no previous experience in watchmaking. As a boy, Mr. Schwertner had spent summers with an aunt and uncle who lived near Glash\u00fctte and they often took him there to buy ice cream.Only months after the demise of the East German regime, Mr. Schwertner bought the moribund Nomos brand name from a government agency, known as the Treuhand, which administered assets that had belonged to the state.Mr. Schwertner discovered that there were still some master artisans around who possessed traditional mechanical watchmaking skills, and could teach young people. Nomos\u2019 first model, the Tangente, introduced in 1992, sold for a relatively inexpensive 980 deutsche marks, or what would have been about $575 at the time.The Glash\u00fctte watchmakers have been buffeted by some of the same forces as their Swiss rivals, including competition from the Apple Watch and a slump in demand from Asia.But they say they have fared better because they were less dependent on the Asian market and suffered less when the Chinese government\u2019s anti-corruption drive dampened sales of luxury goods. Germany is the biggest market for most of the Glash\u00fctte brands, followed by the United States.\u201cBecause the Asian customers hadn\u2019t discovered us yet, we were not so affected,\u201d said Alexander Philipp, director of sales and marketing at Tutima, a watchmaker next door to Nomos that specializes in timepieces based on those used by pilots in the German air force.Tutima\u2019s top watch, a platinum version of its Hommage model, sells for 179,000 euros ($210,825). Master watchmakers, sitting at varnished wooden desks in Tutima\u2019s workshop, take four months to build just one watch, which has 550 parts.Nomos has done particularly well during the crisis because its products are inexpensive compared with others. Entry-level Nomos models start at about \u20ac1,300. The priciest, made of gold and assembled by a single watchmaker, sell for about \u20ac16,000. (Tutima also has models starting at less than \u20ac2,000.)While watchmaking has brought prosperity to Glash\u00fctte, it also has made the town vulnerable to the whims of the luxury goods market. That worries some people. \u201cIf I could dream,\u201d said Mr. Dressler, the mayor, \u201cI would wish for another industry with a different economic cycle.\u201dThough the watchmakers have greatly expanded the town\u2019s tax revenue, some citizens resent their monopoly of the economy and the real estate shortage that they have created.Mr. Dressler won re-election in 2016 but only by a narrow margin. A local political movement calling itself Zeitlos, or Timeless, which complained that the watchmakers have crowded out the village\u2019s community life, challenged him. One of the group\u2019s demands was that a flood-damaged swimming pool should be rebuilt in the village center. Mr. Dressler argued that there was not enough space at the original site for a pool that met modern standards, and favored a location further up the valley. The issue still has not been resolved.To the watchmakers, Glash\u00fctte\u2019s total focus on the craft of watchmaking is part of what makes people willing to spend thousands of euros, even tens of thousands of euros, on a device that does nothing but tell the time.\u201cIn Glash\u00fctte,\u201d Mr. Philipp said of Tutima, \u201cyou\u2019re in the cradle of watchmaking.\u201dAn earlier version of a map with this article misidentified the location of the watchmaking town of Glash\u00fctte, Germany. As noted correctly in the article, it is in eastern Germany, not western Germany.Advertisement"}

Here, they have only 12 percent.\u201dSunday\u2019s national elections in Germany prompted a fresh round of questions about populist election gains across the West. But for many Israelis, thousands of whom have flocked to Berlin in recent years for its socially liberal politics, thriving arts scene and economy, both the campaign and the result were especially problematic.Were the very things that have made Germany seem so safe to so many Israelis \u2014 the national preoccupation with contrition, aversion to raw nationalism, and determination never to repeat the sins of the past \u2014 now in danger of being shunted aside by a new generation unburdened by collective guilt and determined to assert its national identity?Was Israel\u2019s special relationship with Germany, too, now in danger?Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hastened to say that it was not, announcing Tuesday that he had spoken with Chancellor Angela Merkel. He congratulated her on winning and expressed confidence that Israel and Germany would only deepen their ties.But Mr. Netanyahu added that Israel was \u201cconcerned about the rise of anti-Semitism\u201d on both the political right and left, and noted that \u201cthere are two different things: denying the Holocaust and denying responsibility.\u201d He called on Ms. Merkel\u2019s new government to \u201cact to strengthen the forces in Germany that take on the historical responsibility.\u201dAmong the opposition, Amir Peretz, a Knesset member from the left-of-center Zionist Union, wrote on Twitter in German that the election was \u201ca bad day for Germany democracy, with the entry of xenophobes and open anti-Semites into the Bundestag.\u201dYet like so much else dividing Israeli society today, the advances by the Alternative for Germany, or the AfD, as it is known, seems to provide more of an excuse for political recriminations and partisan bile than a source of common Jewish ground.On the right, there was newfound scorn, and worse, for Israeli expatriates in Germany.Aryeh Eldad, a former Knesset member and medical professor, wrote in Maariv of his revulsion at the \u201c20,000 Israelis who moved from Israel to Germany of their own free will,\u201d whether for \u201ccheaper housing and cheaper cottage cheese\u201d or to live under \u201cthe wonderful German democracy\u201d out of a \u201cdistorted\u201d leftism. Both groups, he said, were \u201cemotional cripples.\u201d\u201cThese Israelis,\u201d Mr. Eldad wrote, \u201care not like the dog that comes back to eat his own vomit, but rather like the vomit that returns to the dog that spewed it.\u201dOn the left, there was renewed criticism for the Israeli government that so many left behind when they moved to Germany.Michael Sappir, a 29-year-old in Tel Aviv who earned a degree in linguistics at the University of Leipzig, in Saxony, and now works in high tech, said the election \u201cmakes me think twice about the idea of moving there again, both as a Jew and a leftist.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cthe situation in Germany is much, much better than here, where the governing coalition is composed mostly of parties that are intellectually akin to the AfD.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat\u2019s considered the terrifying right wing there is on many policy points just mainstream here.\u201dEven after Sunday\u2019s election, Mr. Sappir said, he still believes he would be safer in Germany than in Israel. \u201cThe norms of governance, the rule of law, there is much stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cHere I feel like an embattled minority. There I know that we\u2019re a much bigger minority, and there\u2019s at least a pretty broad anti-fascist consensus.\u201dEldad Beck, an Israeli journalist and author of a book on German-Jewish relations, said left-wing Israelis in Germany who were surprised by Sunday\u2019s vote were \u201csuffering from blindness.\u201d But he also said that he knew some Israelis in Germany who had voted for the AfD \u201cbecause they consider the arrival of so many Muslims and the violence, terror and criminality a big problem that has to be stopped.\u201dIndeed, feelings about the subject do not fall into neat categories, even among left-leaning Israelis.Mr. Weinberger, the marketing executive in Berlin, said he believed that, aside from anti-Merkel sentiment, what had driven Germans to the AfD was an understandable emotion: \u201cThere are strong feelings of fear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of human nature at some point. And some of them I\u2019m sure are really concerned about this open-door policy. It affects their lives.\u201dShai Levy, 44, a Jerusalem-born filmmaker in Berlin, said he was saddened to see Israel and the Jewish people fueling the resurgent right wing \u201cbecause they have a common enemy; being anti-Muslim is considered to be good for the Jews.\u201dHe sees many Israelis newly arrived in Berlin tensing up at the sight of people in Muslim head scarves, a \u201creflex of phobia for Muslims,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI know it because I had it. I needed to get rid of it.\u201d\u201cAs long as Merkel is chancellor, the special relationship is O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Israelis will have to make a special effort, otherwise things are going to fall apart.\u201dHe said that the millions of Muslims who have arrived in Germany in recent years would inevitably influence the country\u2019s politics.\u201cI\u2019m not so sure the young generations of German politicians feel as connected to Israel and to the past,\u201d he warned. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see yet that Israel is really making an effort to convince them why it is doing certain things and why it\u2019s important to do those things.\u201dYounger Israelis, too, can be frustrating to their elders.To Miki Goldman, 92, a survivor of Auschwitz and other concentration camps who later helped collect evidence against Adolf Eichmann, diplomacy is one thing, but emigrating to Germany another.\u201cUndoubtedly Germany of today is a democracy, but it still has a kernel of something else that could become dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can be in good relations with Germany, but why do young Israelis have to forget the fate of their fathers and go back there?\u201dBut some Israelis in Germany insisted they were neither forgetful nor na\u00efve.Ruthi Grossman, 24, a student who moved to Berlin last year, said she still planned to stay there.\u201cI think it\u2019s just part of the world moving toward dark times,\u201d she said of the rightward drift. \u201cBut I do trust Germany more than I trust any other country in the world to deal with it morally, because of that history.\u201dIrit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Whether his start-up approach is effective is unclear.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn and a billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist, has made a half-dozen or so investments in recent months with a specific aim: to counteract the influence of President Trump.The venture-style investments include starting a new group, Win the Future, whose self-described goal is to make the Democratic Party relevant again. He also invested $1 million in Cortico, a start-up that encourages online discourse between people with opposing political views. And he invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into Vote.org, which has a goal of getting all eligible Americans to vote; Higher Ground Labs, a start-up for progressive politicians; and the Center on Rural Innovation, which is working for economic improvements in rural areas.\u201cMy approach to political investing is the Silicon Valley approach,\u201d Mr. Hoffman, 50, said in an interview. \u201cFind and back powerful entrepreneurs.\u201dBut how effective a Silicon Valley approach to political change can be is a question \u2014 and Mr. Hoffman has experienced stumbling blocks before.In the spring, Mr. Hoffman pumped almost $30 million in new financing into Change.org and installed new board members, to try again.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic about where we can get to,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a bumpy road.\u201dDebra Cleaver, a former Change.org employee who now runs Vote.org, said it was important to pursue innovative ways for achieving change. But, she added, politically driven investments can be more successful when they are \u201ctreated with the same level of accountability\u201d as traditional venture capital investments.\u201cI would describe Reid as left of center, with a very strong sense of empathy for those who are less fortunate,\u201d Mr. Thiel wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a character trait than an ideological position.\u201dIn 2000, he joined Mr. Thiel as an executive at PayPal, a stint that made Mr. Hoffman a millionaire. He founded LinkedIn, the career-oriented social network, in 2003, spurred by trying to connect people and the openness of online communities.By then, he had become involved in policy. During President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, Mr. Hoffman nurtured ties with the White House and Democratic politicians like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.\u201cReid was among the top leaders in Silicon Valley to whom we looked for good counsel\u201d on issues like immigration, said Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama.Last year, Mr. Hoffman joined the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Innovation Advisory Board, a group helping to modernize the military. Mr. Hoffman offered ideas about the impact that artificial intelligence would have on combat, and suggested ways to improve the military\u2019s personnel retention, according to a person who works with the board but was not authorized to speak publicly about it.Mr. Hoffman decided the tech industry had to confront the challenges created by social networks, including their potential to undermine democracy. He said the industry would at some point need to regulate itself with a standards body like the Motion Picture Association of America.Mr. Trump also embodied a specific cause of anxiety for Mr. Hoffman.\u201cWe\u2019re in turbulent times, when concerns about the future tend to lead us to try and enshrine the past,\u201d he said. He began hosting discussions to generate policies for creating economic opportunity and how the government can serve broader swathes of people.Mr. Hoffman has since used his cash and connections to shape the organizations and start-ups that support the issues where he wants to exert the most influence. He has also tried to convince the tech industry to take responsibility for how its products are built and used.In the spring, Mr. Hoffman convened a small group of tech leaders to dine with Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, at the Rosewood Hotel in Menlo Park, Calif. The group discussed the prospect of governments trying to regulate tech companies and, in particular, the unemployment problems being created by automation and artificial intelligence.\u201cAt the end of the day, most people don\u2019t want a handout,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven a chance, they\u2019ll work hard.\u201dMr. Altman said he agreed with Mr. Hoffman\u2019s concerns and that he appreciated \u201chis willingness to debate issues.\u201dMr. Hoffman has also given money to organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Union of Concerned Scientists, which are explicitly resisting Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. He increased his venture-style investments in new civic and political start-ups, as well as continuing to fund some he had previously invested in, like Change.org and political fund-raising start-up Crowdpac.Win the Future has already drawn criticism for floating the possibility of billboards with crowdsourced ideas to shape the Democratic agenda. Mr. Pincus said most things in the start-up ecosystem took time to evolve and that early criticism of the new group was helpful.Mr. Hoffman\u2019s colleagues said his start-up method to politics was the right one. \u201cIt\u2019s a different approach, so naturally there will be skeptics,\u201d said John Lilly, one of Mr. Hoffman\u2019s partners at Greylock. \u201cBut entrepreneurship has been the driver of the economy. It will work.\u201dMr. Hoffman said he would judge his investments in civic-change start-ups by their ability to affect society, not by any financial return.\u201cOne of the things that I get most frustrated with is this kind of American business psychology, this view that I\u2019m only responsible to my customers and employees and shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be part of the political process. We can\u2019t just invent the future without some kind of connectivity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After the Vote, Does the Kurdish Dream of Independence Have a Chance?", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWith its troubled economy and dearth of democratic institutions, its prospects were already tenuous. Its best hopes lay in its oil reserves and American support, but Turkey has threatened to cut off its oil pipeline, and the relationship with the United States soured after the Kurds rebuffed its entreaties to cancel the vote.Rather than negotiate and then seek international recognition, as the United States and others had asked, the Kurds forged ahead with the referendum.But if anything, the vote, while satisfying the Kurds emotionally, may have set back their national aspirations.For the Kurds, the vote was a potent and historic touchstone, a declaration to the world that they this is their moment and they are not turning back.\u201cThis is an irreversible step toward independence,\u201d said Peter W. Galbraith, a former American diplomat with close ties to the Kurdish leadership.But the Kurds may have underestimated the depth of international opposition.Before they had even stopped celebrating, Iraq and its two powerful neighbors, Turkey and Iran, immediately went to work to negate the vote. Iraq fears losing a third of its country, as well as oil and natural gas reserves. Turkey and Iran fear that independence for Iraq\u2019s Kurds would embolden separatist ambitions among their own Kurdish minorities.The fierce reaction has exposed Kurdistan\u2019s distinct vulnerabilities and shortcomings. The region\u2019s first days after the vote were spent not laying the groundwork for statehood, but struggling to escape a tightening noose.On Saturday, Iraq moved to take control of the international border crossing leading into the region from Turkey, officials said in Baghdad.Iraq has forced the suspension of international flights to Kurdistan\u2019s two international airports, and threatened to close land crossings linking Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq.Iraq\u2019s Parliament has asked Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to bring charges against Kurdish leaders who participated in the referendum and to send troops into disputed areas claimed by both the Kurds and Baghdad.Turkey and Iraq are conducting military maneuvers on Iraq\u2019s borders near Kurdistan. Turkey has threatened to close its border crossing into Kurdistan, which relies on imported goods and food from Turkey and, to a lesser extent, Iran.Iraq and Iran plan joint military maneuvers along their border next week, aimed at securing Iraqi control of three border crossings from areas controlled by the Kurdish Regional Government, Iran\u2019s military said Saturday.A healthy democratic government might weather the storm. But the Kurdistan Regional Government lacks the foundations of a democratic state \u2014 rule of law, free and fair elections, civil society and a legislature with real power to challenge a dynastic executive leadership.\u201cWe don\u2019t have rule of law \u2014 we have a monarchy,\u201d said Rabbon Marof, a member of the Kurdish Parliament and a leader of the \u201cNo for Now\u201d movement that opposed the vote.The region\u2019s president, Massoud Barzani, remains in power two years after his term expired. The Kurdish Parliament was paralyzed for two years until it met two weeks ago to rubber-stamp the referendum Mr. Barzani had already set in motion.The government is a Barzani family enterprise. Mr. Barzani is the son of the former Kurdish leader Mustafa Barzani. Massoud Barzani\u2019s son Masrour Barzani heads the security council in his father\u2019s government.Massoud Barzani\u2019s nephew, Nechirvan Barzani, is prime minister. The president\u2019s uncle is Hoshyar Zebari, Iraqi\u2019s former foreign minister and Mr. Barzani\u2019s top adviser on the referendum.Denise Natali, an expert on Kurdistan at National Defense University in Washington, says the issue for the Kurds may not be whether the region can transform itself into a state but the kind of state it would become: \u201cpoor, failed, and unstable.\u201dMr. Zebari acknowledged in an interview on Friday that the regional government had \u201cshortcomings,\u201d but he said it was more democratic and secure than the rest of Iraq. He said the independence vote would force more accountability.The region is an economic weakling dependent on oil. It earns roughly $8 billion a year from oil shipped through Turkey via a pipeline that Ankara now threatens to shut down.Shutting down the pipeline would also cost Turkey, which earns between $500 million and $1 billion a year from it, according to regional experts. But the Turks could absorb a shutdown far easier than the Kurds.Even with the pipeline flowing, the Kurdish economy is in dire straits. Oil revenues have plunged as the price of petroleum has fallen worldwide, depriving the government of its main source of revenue. The Kurdish government is $20 billion in debt, analysts say, and has not been able to pay all its soldiers and pays public employees only about 40 percent of their salaries.\u201cKurdistan is not ready because economically, it is a mess,\u201d said Joost Hiltermann, a Middle East specialist at the International Crisis Group. \u201cI don\u2019t see independence happening,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s all about capability, not desire.\u201dMoreover, more than half of Kurdish oil revenue comes from the oil fields of Kirkuk, a city that lies at the heart of the standoff with Baghdad.Kurdish troops seized the multiethnic city after Iraqi troops fled an Islamic State assault in 2014.Kurds consider Kirkuk a spiritual homeland. \u201cTo Kurds, Kirkuk is their Jerusalem,\u201d said David L. Phillips, a former State Department adviser who has worked on Iraq for 30 years.But Baghdad considers the Kurdish claim illegitimate, and Iraq\u2019s Parliament has asked Mr. Abadi to dispatch troops to seize Kirkuk\u2019s oil fields.Nor can the Kurds expect a lifeline from the United States, which protected them from Saddam Hussein\u2019s executioners with a no-fly zone in 1991 that provided breathing space to carve out the autonomous enclave.Washington feared the referendum would fracture Iraq and undermine the American-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said Friday that the United States did not recognize the referendum, which he said \u201clacks legitimacy,\u201d and urged the Iraqis and Kurds to \u201cremain focused on defeating ISIS.\u201dThe Kurds believe they have a trump card in pesh merga fighters, who have played a pivotal role in the coalition. They held the referendum now, in part, because they feared losing their leverage if the coalition drives the militants out of Iraq.But for the Kurdish leadership, there is no going back. Mr. Zebari said the Kurds\u2019 relationship with Iraq was irrevocably broken, and the Kurds worry that Iran\u2019s influence on Iraq\u2019s Shiite-led government \u2014 and on Shiite militias incorporated into the Iraqi Army \u2014 will only strengthen.\u201cInstead of partnership, they are advocating majority rule by the Shiia, which will make us always a minority and always a loser,\u201d Mr. Zebari said.Mr. Barzani bet that a broad public mandate for independence would provide leverage against Baghdad in negotiating a separation. But there are no negotiations, at least not yet.Mr. Phillips said Iraq would ultimately negotiate on \u201ca friendly divorce,\u201d with the United States as a likely intermediary.\u201cNegotiations are in Baghdad\u2019s interests,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cPicking a fight with the Kurds would merely exacerbate conflict and instability.\u201dOne possible way out, analysts said, could be a Kurdish confederation with Iraq, with constitutional power-sharing. Another, Mr. Phillips said, may involve shared governance of Kirkuk, with power distributed among ethnic groups.If Kirkuk were somehow resolved or set aside, Iraq might well be willing to negotiate independence for the three governorates the Kurds have run virtually on their own for a quarter century. But even then, Mr. Hiltermann said, Iran and Turkey would not go along.But Mr. Galbraith said that if Baghdad refuses to bargain in good faith, the Kurds may unilaterally declare independence at some point.\u201cIt\u2019s not an open-ended process,\u201d he said, reflecting the Kurdish view. \u201cYou have to have an outcome which ultimately ends in independence.\u201dMr. Zebari said the Kurds were willing to take the long view and patiently negotiate day-to-day obstacles on the path to eventual independence.\u201cWe have said from the start that this is not a risk-free project,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Alissa Rubin and Muhammad N.

{"Headline": "Congress Goes for Its Guns", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe gridlock in Congress has been so bad that there\u2019s even been a shortage of insane gun bills.Really, there\u2019s nothing we anticipated from the Trump era more than a flood of totally irrational legislation on behalf of the gun lobby. And right at the start, Congress came through with a new law expanding Americans\u2019 ability to purchase weapons despite severe mental impairment. Exactly the kind of thing we were expecting! But since then, there\u2019s been kind of a lull.Until this week, when a House committee approved a bill making it much easier to buy gun silencers. The measure is now on the way to the floor for a vote, and about time. This is obviously one of the nation\u2019s great unmet needs. Seldom does a day go by when you don\u2019t hear people bitterly complaining about how much trouble it is to muffle the sound of their shooting.We\u2019re talking about the Sportsmen\u2019s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, adorably nicknamed Share. It has a bunch of hair-raising provisions, one of which would make it easier to buy armor-piercing bullets. (We will stop for a moment to contemplate the fact that it is not currently impossible to buy armor-piercing bullets.)There\u2019s also a section that would really, really discourage police officers in states with serious gun safety regulations from questioning people about whether they\u2019re carrying a weapon.And we haven\u2019t gotten yet to the provision that\u2019s causing the most outcry. That\u2019s the one about improving access to gun silencers. This is a cause long championed by Donald Trump Jr. We have not really seen much of Junior lately, what with all those controversies over meetings with Russians during the presidential election campaign, and we sort of miss him. Pretty soon there are going to be so many members of the family testifying before congressional investigations that all we\u2019ll have left is Eric.The big argument by Junior and the other advocates is that the sound of a gun firing is so loud it endangers the hearing of hunters. \u201cRight now we are in a situation where it seems \u2026 that sportsmen have to choose between damaging their hearing and being able to hunt, shoot, target practice,\u201d said Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming. (Hey, somebody else we have not heard from for ages. And it is impossible to resist saying that Liz will do for gun safety what her dad, Dick, did for Iraq.)Think about the Giffords\u2019 story for a minute. When you get down to the basics, Congress is now considering a bill to make mass shootings less noisy.You can still get a silencer if you want one and you\u2019re not, say, a criminal. It just takes a while, since there\u2019s a fee, fingerprinting and a background check. And you can\u2019t do an end-run around the rules by buying one at a gun show or on the internet. The silencer law, in fact, is exactly what the gun purchase law would be in a rational system.So what we have here is a problem about having to wear ear protectors while you wait for the silencer paperwork to go through. You\u2019re probably wondering how this got to be a congressional priority.Now we\u2019re in the Trump era. \u201cSales are declining, and the industry needs a new source of profit,\u201d said Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the Senate\u2019s top gun safety advocates. Silencers can cost as much as $1,000, and given the fact that there are about 300 million guns in the country available for silencing, we\u2019re talking about quite a potential boom.Who says Washington isn\u2019t doing anything for the economy?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill de Blasio, the Best Democratic Choice for Mayor", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "\nSo we firmly endorse Mr. de Blasio in this primary as he seeks a second, and final, term and urge Democratic voters to support him next Tuesday over four lesser-known opponents. His able stewardship of the country\u2019s largest and most cantankerous city deserves to be rewarded.All told, though, Mr. de Blasio has been an effective mayor. He has taken care of essential municipal business while pursuing the progressive agenda that is dear to him. Arrests, for instance, are down on his watch. So are police stop-and-frisks that focused on young African-American and Latino men, most of them guilty of nothing. Yet none of that has translated into a rise in crime. On the contrary, New York is on track to end 2017 with fewer than 300 murders, an achievement once unimaginable.As a sign of how well this mayor has performed, major politicians who\u2019d love to replace him decided he wasn\u2019t vulnerable and took a pass on this election, preferring to wait until term limits force him to leave office at the end of 2021. His challengers for the Democratic nomination are four men who earnestly offer their own visions for the city but who are hardly well recognized and have been unable to break through as serious contenders.They are Sal Albanese, a centrist former councilman running for mayor a third time; Robert Gangi, a forceful advocate for criminal justice reform; Michael Tolkin, a technology entrepreneur who says he would apply his business skills to municipal governance; and Richard Bashner, a Brooklyn community board member who describes himself as \u201cthe thinking man\u2019s candidate.\u201d No incumbent should have a free ride, and all of these men should be commended for ensuring that Mr. de Blasio doesn\u2019t have one. Indeed, all should have been included in a debate held two weeks ago and another one scheduled for Wednesday night. Only Mr. Albanese has made it to the stage because the others did not meet money-raising requirements.At some point, the New York economy is likely to stop chugging along as robustly as it has. The pendulum always swings. So the mayor \u2014 any mayor \u2014 must be ready to pare the municipal payroll, which has grown substantially in the last four years. If, as feared, federal aid shrivels under a Trump administration hostile to city needs, those reductions could be substantial. We don\u2019t expect Mr. de Blasio to announce at this point precisely what he would cut, but we hope he has begun thinking about what to do if the good times end.There is some merit to his wanting to help form a national urban agenda, especially in the Trump era. But if re-elected, Mr. de Blasio would be well advised not to roam too far too often. He might also bear in mind, in case he has lofty aspirations, that no New York mayor has won election to higher office since the 1860s. The city that put him in office must come first, always, and it expects him to remember that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Business, Big-Hearted Personality", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarly this year, The Times brought together a group of national correspondents to write in-depth stories about regions and people who might have received short shrift in the run-up to last November\u2019s election.\u201cWhat we desperately want is for our stories to shed light, to tell our readers things about America they do not already understand, with fairness, clear eyes and empathy in abundance,\u201d David Halbfinger, who was the deputy national editor, wrote to us in an email.Ms. Quillen, 35, is one of those people we perhaps don\u2019t know as well as we ought to. A small-business owner in the manufacturing sector, she is integral to the American economy. Difficult choices she makes to contain costs and remain afloat in a cutthroat global industry exact a high personal cost. On her computer monitor she has posted a sticky note to remind her to show empathy: \u201cIt\u2019s about feelings.\u201dThe mother of two small boys, Ms. Quillen \u2014 whose husband works for her overseeing the factory floor \u2014 voted for Mr. Trump (and admires his daughter Ivanka). But her daily personal and business obsessions have nothing to do with national politics. When a consultant visited her plant in May and asked what she hoped for in the future, she told him, \u201cThe goal for the company as a whole is to provide a better life for the employees that choose to be part of our family here.\u201dDuring my repeated visits in May and June, Ms. Quillen allowed me open access to her meetings and phone calls, her staff of 78 and the production floor.A former pre-med student, she had fallen in love with manufacturing after working for a summer in the plant\u2019s front office. (The company at the time was owned by her parents, and when it fell into bankruptcy Ms. Quillen cashed out her 401(k) and mortgaged her home to help rescue it.) As someone whose work product appears in pixels or evanescent newsprint, I could see how an infatuation with factories might be possible. There was something gloriously concrete about the injection-molding machines on the plant floor. One of them, Press 26, closes and opens like a slow-motion clap, producing 150,000 pucklike pieces a week. The pieces go into shock absorbers in Fords, Chevrolets and other vehicles.The press operator, a man named Dorman Crews, 49, had been at the company for two and a half years. \u201cI spent half my life playing hard,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe other half it\u2019s time to get real.\u201d He had moved to Jackson to be \u201ca phone call away\u201d from a brother with health problems.The time I spent at the factory was largely a period of setbacks for Ms. Quillen: She had lost $3 million in orders earlier in the year, and efforts to replace that work were fizzling. The bottom line was solid thanks to cost-cutting, but Ms. Quillen was not bringing new business in the door. The company was forced into a weeklong shutdown in July.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 New Designers to Watch This Season", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFashion month, which kicks off this week, will feature shows from the likes of Gucci and Tom Ford. But amid it all, a handful of new designers are debuting collections. Here are five, who are showing their spring/summer 2018 collections this month in New York, London and Paris. New YorkDesigner: Snow Xue GaoBorn in Beijing and based in New York City, the designer Snow Xue Gao blends Asian heritage and Western culture in her designs. With a B.A. from Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology, Gao moved to New York to attend the M.A. program at Parsons \u2014 and landed an internship with Jason Wu while still in school. Her graduate collection, which blended Italian and English wool suiting inlaid with Chinese floral printed silks, was chosen to showcase at the 2016 Parsons graduate show. She attracted the attention of VFiles and held a spot in its fall 2017 show. For spring/summer \u201918, Gao will present solo for the first time. \u201cBalancing tradition through the use of color and prints that are inspired by the Beijing Opera, I will expand upon signature tailoring and deconstruction draping techniques,\u201d she tells T of her upcoming collection. Gao will be presenting at the Garis & Hahn Gallery downtown, where she is planning to set up a kind of performance \u2014 a play on opera, which was an inspiration for the collection. Showing Friday, Sept 8 at 12:30 p.m.New YorkDesigner: Prisca Vera FranchettiShowing Friday, Sept. 8 at 7:30 p.m.LondonDesigner: Richard QuinnThe London-based designer Richard Quinn will be making his Fashion Week debut this season. Despite this being his first year, Quinn has managed to rack up an impressive resume: the 27-year-old attended Central Saint Martins for both his Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s, and has had work placements at Richard James on Savile Row and Christian Dior Couture in Paris. He went on to win the H&M Design Award, which gave him the support to open his own studio after graduation. (His Master\u2019s collection \u2014 which featured a mix of head-to-toe prints on a classic \u201950s silhouettes \u2014 gained a lot of attention). \u201cI like fabrics with good body and can create volume. A good fabric surface that can be screen printed always excites me,\u201d Quinn told T. This year, he was awarded the \u201cone to watch\u201d support from NewGen, a program by the British Fashion Council that elects young talents to support and nurture, such as Wales Bonner and Molly Goddard. \u201cI think the platform and support for young designers in London is like no other,\u201d Quinn said about starting out in London. \u201cIt embraces so many different points of view.\u201d Showing Saturday, Sept. 16.ParisDesigner: Andra DumitrascuBorn in Craiova, Romania, Andra Dumitrascu moved to Vienna to study and pursue fashion design. \u201cGrowing up in one of the most rigid and poor communist countries might have led to a natural obsession with clothes, products, concepts and consumption in general,\u201d she told T. Dumitrascu enrolled at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, but before graduating, she moved to Berlin to start a then-unlabeled concept shop as a platform for brands, designers and artists. (It is now Salbazaar, a popular boutique known to have introduced international designers to Berlin). This season, Dumitrascu will be showing her spring/summer \u201918 collection, titled \u201cKebaby,\u201d during Paris Fashion Week. \u201cI don\u2019t really go anywhere in particular to find inspiration, it just comes along the way,\u201d she told T. She cites influences as disparate as the design of a \u201cTurkish food stand that had gone out of business\u201d and \u201csome crappy but beautiful looking Thai rings.\u201d A liquid-like high-tech jersey in saturated colors, ultra lightweight running fabrics and heavy denims are some of the main materials being used for her collection.ParisDesigners: Cosima Gadient and Christa B\u00f6schCosima Gadient and Christa B\u00f6sch met while studying at The Institute of Fashion Design in Basel, Switzerland. After graduation, the duo moved to Berlin to start their label, Ottolinger. They showcased their first collection in London in September 2015 \u2014 the next season, they were selected to be a part of the VFiles runway show in New York, where they showed pieces that included denim chaps and white-button downs with all over burn marks. This season, the young designers will be presenting their spring/summer 2018 collection in Paris. \u201cThese days, Paris Fashion Week is the most important fashion week in terms of showing, presenting yourself, and meeting people,\u201d B\u00f6sch told T. \u201cBerlin is a great city for a young label, with a lot of young artists and designers, and it\u2019s a place where we can focus on work.\u201d For inspiration for their upcoming collection, the designers went back to their roots, and visited several fabric factories in Switzerland to observe and experiment with traditional Swiss fabrics and production methods that date back hundreds of years.Showing, Sunday Oct. 1 at 4:30 p.m.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron, in Greece, Calls for \u2018Rebuilding\u2019 E.U.", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI want to talk to you about a new Europe,\u201d Mr. Macron he said, proposing a \u201croad map\u201d for the \u201crebuilding of the European Union.\u201dIn an impassioned speech beneath the Acropolis, on Pnyx Hill, a meeting place for popular assemblies in antiquity, Mr. Macron elaborated on his vision for a stronger union. \u201cToday in Europe, sovereignty and democracy are under threat,\u201d he said, calling for national conventions to debate \u201cwhat kind of Europe we want.\u201d\u201cWe must not be scared,\u201d he said, \u201cof this extreme ambition.\u201dEurope\u2019s challenges, Mr. Macron added, include \u201chow to become a power that can face the U.S. and China.\u201dThis raises the specter of the kind of anti-austerity protests common in Greece at the peak of its crisis.Mr. Macron has also been leading an effort to toughen screening of major Chinese investments in Europe. He was rebuffed recently in Brussels by a group of countries dependent on China\u2019s investments, including Greece.Widely regarded as a counterweight to German leaders who have championed austerity in Greece and other southern European countries, the French leader expressed solidarity with Greece, which is still struggling with the fallout of a crippling financial crisis that struck in 2010. The Greek crisis was \u201ca failure of Europe,\u201d Mr. Macron said.But while he repeated his calls for a common budget and a eurozone Parliament \u2014 ideas opposed by Germany \u2014 his speech was otherwise short on specifics.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece, who spoke before Mr. Macron did, underlined the need for additional support for weaker European Union states, and for a \u201cnew democratic contract in Europe.\u201d He also called for an end to policies that \u201cfuel cycles of crisis,\u201d a reference to the barrage of spending cuts and tax increase.In a news conference with Mr. Tsipras earlier on Thursday, Mr. Macron said that Europe must protect growth and investments, and that it \u201cmust turn a page.\u201d As for Greece, he said \u201cgrowth and recovery are returning.\u201d Mr. Macron said Europe should help in talks on Greek debt relief next year, and he called on the International Monetary Fund, one of Greece\u2019s foreign creditors, to make no further demands on the country. The organization, he said, \u201cshould not intervene in European programs.\u201dMr. Macron said the French wanted to invest in Greece\u2019s recovery. But while dozens of French entrepreneurs were accompanying Mr. Macron on his visit, it was unclear whether any actual deals would be clinched.The Greek government had been hoping for something concrete before a scheduled speech by Mr. Tsipras at an international trade fair in Thessaloniki this weekend where Greek leaders traditionally outline their economic policy for the coming year.Mr. Tsipras did take the opportunity to hail French involvement in the privatization of the port of Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second city. \u201cInvestors are realizing that, after many years of recession, trust is returning,\u201d he said.Echoing his predecessors, Mr. Macron has repeatedly called for Greece to be relieved of some of its huge debt load \u2014 which stands at some 180 percent of gross domestic product, the highest rate in the eurozone. In his comments on Thursday, however, he acknowledged that debt talks would not begin until next year, when Greece\u2019s third international bailout is set to officially end.The French leader\u2019s declarations about growth and improved prospects came as the European Union\u2019s statistics service indicated that the bloc is indeed experiencing a robust economic upturn. According to Eurostat figures released on Thursday, the eurozone\u2019s gross domestic product expanded by 2.3 percent in the second quarter. The Greek economy, too, has seen some recovery, its economy growing 0.8 percent in the second quarter, figures showed last week.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the leader who said Europe should help in talks on Greek debt relief. It was Mr. Macron, not Mr. Tsipras.Aurelien Breeden and Liz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stanley Fischer, Fed\u2019s No. 2 Official, Is Stepping Down", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said Wednesday that he would resign in mid-October, an unexpected decision that gives President Trump greater leverage over central bank policy.Mr. Fischer, 73, cited \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d in a brief letter addressed to Mr. Trump. His four-year term was to have ended next June.The resignation puts immediate pressure on the Trump administration to replenish the Fed\u2019s depleted board. Mr. Fischer\u2019s departure would leave only three people in the seven board seats, the smallest number of governors in the Fed\u2019s history.It also means that Mr. Trump can appoint a majority of the Fed\u2019s board, bending the direction of its policy. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that he wants the Fed to loosen some of the regulatory strictures it has imposed in response to the 2008 financial crisis.Mr. Fischer joined the Fed\u2019s board in May 2014 after a distinguished career as an academic economist and an international policy maker. He sometimes argued that the Fed should be raising interest rates more quickly, sparring with Ms. Yellen. But he provided reliable support for measures strengthening financial regulation.Ms. Yellen thanked Mr. Fischer for leading the Fed\u2019s work to increase financial stability.Administration officials earlier this year settled on Marvin Goodfriend, a Carnegie Mellon economist, for a second seat, but Mr. Trump has not made the nomination.The Fed\u2019s board had at least five members from 1936 until 2009. The head count was reduced to four during brief stretches in 2009, 2010, and 2014. But by far the longest stretch in Fed history with only four board members began in March of this year.Mr. Fischer spent two decades as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where his students included Mario Draghi, now president of the European Central Bank, and Ben S. Bernanke, Ms. Yellen\u2019s predecessor as Fed chief.Then, in the late 1980s, he embarked on a second career in public service, first as chief economist at the World Bank, then as a senior official at the International Monetary Fund and as governor of the Bank of Israel. By the time he arrived at the Fed, he was widely regarded as leading expert on both the theory and the practice of central banking.Analysts said Mr. Fischer\u2019s departure was unlikely to shift monetary policy in the near term. The Fed is widely expected to announce after its next meeting in mid-September that it will begin to reduce its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.The Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate twice this year, to a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent. Most officials predicted in June that the Fed would raise rates one more time this year, but sluggish inflation could cause the Fed to hesitate.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Agriculture and Farmers Decimated by Maria", "Date": "2017-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYABUCOA, P.R. \u2014 Jos\u00e9 A. Rivera, a farmer on the southeast coast of Puerto Rico, stood in the middle of his flattened plantain farm on Sunday and tried to tally how much Hurricane Maria had cost him.\u201cHow do you calculate everything?\u201d Mr. Rivera said.For as far as he could see, every one of his 14,000 trees was down. Same for the yam and sweet pepper crops. His neighbor, Luis A. Pinto Cruz, known to everyone here as \u201cPi\u00f1a,\u201d figures he is out about $300,000 worth of crops. The foreman down the street, F\u00e9lix Ortiz Delgado, spent the afternoon scrounging up the scraps that were left of the farm he manages. He found about a dozen dried ears of corn that he could feed the chickens. The wind had claimed the rest.\u201cThere will be no food in Puerto Rico,\u201d Mr. Rivera predicted. \u201cThere is no more agriculture in Puerto Rico. And there won\u2019t be any for a year or longer.\u201dHurricane Maria made landfall here Wednesday as a Category 4 storm. Its force and fury stripped every tree of not just the leaves, but also the bark, leaving a rich agricultural region looking like the result of a postapocalyptic drought. Rows and rows of fields were denuded. Plants simply blew away.In a matter of hours, Hurricane Maria wiped out about 80 percent of the crop value in Puerto Rico \u2014 making it one of the costliest storms to hit the island\u2019s agriculture industry, said Carlos Flores Ortega, Puerto Rico\u2019s secretary of the Department of Agriculture.Across the island, Maria\u2019s prolonged barrage took out entire plantations and destroyed dairy barns and industrial chicken coops. Plantain, banana and coffee crops were the hardest hit, Mr. Flores said. Landslides in the mountainous interior of the island took out many roads, a major part of the agriculture infrastructure there.The island suffered a loss of $780 million in agriculture yields, according to the department\u2019s preliminary figures. Hurricane Georges in 1998 wiped out about 65 percent of crops and Hurricane Irma, which only grazed the island, took out about $45 million in agriculture production.For over 400 years, Puerto Rico\u2019s economy was based on agriculture, historically focused on sugar cane, tobacco and citrus fruits. The island\u2019s economy rapidly industrialized after World War II, leading to the downfall of agriculture production. In recent years, in part because of the island\u2019s economic recession, people went back to the fields, and the industry is going through a small renaissance, growing at 3 to 5 percent every year over the past six years, Mr. Flores said. A growing farm-to-table movement has generated optimism in recent years about an agricultural rebirth.Puerto Rico already imports about 85 percent of its food, and now its food imports are certain to rise drastically as local products like coffee and plantains are added to the list of Maria\u2019s staggering losses. Local staples that stocked supermarkets, school lunchrooms and even Walmart are gone.\u201cSometimes when there are shortages, the price of plantain goes up from $1 to $1.25. This time, there won\u2019t be any price increase; there won\u2019t be any product,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. \u201cWhen I heard the meteorologist say that the two had turned into a three and then a four, I thought, \u2018Agriculture in Puerto Rico is over.\u2019 This really is a catastrophe.\u201dHe noted that other islands that export food to Puerto Rico, such as the Dominican Republic, Dominica and St. Martin, were also hit, and that the food supply could be even more precarious if the island\u2019s other suppliers were also affected.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any gandules at Christmas this year,\u201d Mr. Ortiz said, referring to a local favorite usually served as a combination of rice, pigeon peas and pork called arroz con gandules. \u201cEven if we planted now, they won\u2019t be ready.\u201dMr. Ortiz, 80, said he had been working these fields for seven decades. He has lived through his share of hurricanes, including Georges, which wiped out the local sugar refinery in 1998.\u201cI have never seen losses like these in any of my 80 years,\u201d he said as he stood on a riverbank, counting the number of coconut trees that fell. He could earn $100 a month from each one of them. A dozen cracked in half, beside a nursery where the winds swept away all the seedlings and left behind broken glass and ruin.\u201cThose palms take about 10 years to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be dead by then.\u201dHe is not the owner, but he said it hurt all the same. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like to see the place where you earn your daily bread destroyed?\u201dEfrain M. Robles Menendez, a dairy farmer, said cattle ranchers had been hit hard, because not only was there major damage to the infrastructure needed to maintain the business, but the supply chain was also cut off. With stores closed and the power out, the dairy trucks have not come.\u201cSince Wednesday, I have thrown out 4,000 liters of milk a day,\u201d he said. \u201cCome back later, and watch me pour it all down the drain.\u201dSome see the potential for something positive to come out of a disaster. Agricultural officials are hoping this will be the island\u2019s chance to modernize its outmoded agriculture industry.\u201cAgriculture is the most vulnerable sector to natural disasters,\u201d Mr. Flores said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the one that can have the speediest recovery, and it\u2019ll be the great surprise in the Puerto Rican economy, because we\u2019re going to come back stronger.\u201dMr. Flores said much of the traditional agriculture in the island had depended on energy-inefficient practices that waste too much water and produce large amounts of waste. Federal funds that will help farmers rebuild infrastructure damaged by the hurricane will present an opportunity to improve the industry, he said.\u201cWe had an antiquated agricultural infrastructure that maybe now is the opportunity to make it more efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the moment because we\u2019re starting from zero. Maybe it hadn\u2019t been done before because there was no way of financing it. We\u2019re going to rebuild better this time.\u201dEduardo Bhatia Gautier, a local senator, said, \u201cWe can start developing an agriculture industry that is more profitable and start exporting Puerto Rican products, something this island hasn\u2019t done in decades.\u201dPuerto Rico currently imports about 85 percent of the food it consumes and exports only 15 percent of what it produces, according to the government.

{"Headline": "Crisis in Catalonia: The Independence Vote and Its Fallout", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 Separatist lawmakers declared Catalonia\u2019s independence from Spain on Oct. 27, prompting the central government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to take administrative control of the region, oust Catalan leaders and schedule elections on Dec. 21.Mr. Rajoy has fought off Catalan pressure before, including five years ago, when Spain\u2019s economic crisis, and Catalonia\u2019s tax contributions to poorer regions, bolstered the secessionist movement. But the current standoff with Catalan separatists is the most serious challenge he has faced to date.It\u2019s one of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions, situated in the northeast and home to 7.5 million people. Catalonia accounts for almost one-fifth of Spain\u2019s output, the equivalent of Portugal\u2019s economy, and has spearheaded Spain\u2019s economic development since the Industrial Revolution.The resulting administrative structure of Spain gave Catalans a significant degree of political autonomy \u2014 but not enough, according to the region\u2019s current political leadership.As the case moves through the Belgian courts, Mr. Puigdemont could find himself still in Brussels when Catalonia holds regional elections in December. Other prominent Catalan politicians could run for office from a Madrid jail, pending trial.The latest opinion polls suggest that the results are too close to call. Catalonia\u2019s three main separatist parties are expected to win 66 of the 135 seats in the regional Parliament \u2014 which would a loss of six seats, and deprive them of the majority they have held since 2015 \u2014 according to a survey by GAD3 published by the newspaper La Vanguardia.Until the recent political turmoil, economists had generally agreed that Catalonia would be viable as an independent country, but they differed on the impact on jobs, barriers to trade and the spending needs of a new state.An independent Catalonia would be a midsize European nation, with Barcelona as its capital. Economists disagree over whether withdrawal would hurt the region significantly, or instead weaken the rest of Spain. But they agree that there would be short-term economic costs as the two sides adjusted, even if the split took place on friendly terms.Much would depend on the financial and political terms under which Catalonia left, including how Spain\u2019s debt burden would be apportioned and whether Madrid would impose economic sanctions on Catalonia.The constitutional crisis is sowing jitters. Investors have been withdrawing funds and significantly raising the risk premium they demand for holding Spanish and Catalan debt. . In October, the government reduced its forecast for national economic growth in 2018 to 2.3 percent from 2.6 percent. Since the referendum, more than 2000 companies, including CaixaBank and Sabadell, have moved their legal headquarters outside Catalonia.The corporate concerns also stem from the big question of whether Catalonia would be allowed to become a member state of the European Union and use the euro. That issue is complicated by the fact that the most radical Catalan separatist party wants nothing to do with the currency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New in Memoir: Looking for Fulfilling Work in the Gig Economy", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEgosWhen Schuster\u2019s adorably na\u00efve announcement that she wishes only to be a foreign correspondent gets her dispatched to the bureau in Dallas, she sulks until she crosses paths with a seasoned foreign correspondent for The Los Angeles Times named Dial Torgerson. \u201cA small, wiry middle-aged\u201d divorced father with minimal hair and \u201ca peculiar, slightly rolling gait,\u201d Torgerson is more than twice Schuster\u2019s age and distinguished enough that she read about him in her coursework at journalism school, an aphrodisiac if there ever was one. The two begin an exhilarating affair and marry within a year. During this time, Schuster\u2019s career, which now has her covering Central America, gains unprecedented momentum. On her wedding day, she sneaks in an interview with representatives of the Nicaraguan contras before racing with Torgerson to City Hall in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. It\u2019s an adrenaline junkie\u2019s best day ever.Schuster and Torgerson set up household in Mexico City, but ten months later Torgerson is killed while on assignment in Honduras. Amid her grief, Schuster is sent to Beirut to fill in for The Journal\u2019s Middle East correspondent. Though she welcomes the change of scenery (despite Lebanon\u2019s war-ravaged \u201cDresden-like destruction\u201d) she also begins to question her career choice.\u201cWhatever the reason, all I can see, stretching before me, are years and years of reporting in places like this,\u201d she writes. \u201cProblem is, I have no Plan B, nothing to fall back on such as masonry or midwifery.\u201dSchuster would find new ballast the next year in the form of Dennis Jett, an American diplomat who would eventually become the United States ambassador to Mozambique and then Peru. It is this phase that marks the polished silver part of \u201cDirty Wars and Polished Silver,\u201d and while Schuster\u2019s storytelling is no less lively, the stories themselves can\u2019t quite keep up with the pace and drama of the author\u2019s earlier incarnation. There is a sense in the second half of the book that Schuster is recounting scenes from her life as though they\u2019re from a movie \u2014 and glamorized for effect \u2014 rather than imprinted on her emotional memory card. We see Jett fend off a tarantula, narrowly avoid being thrown from his sailboat by a pod of hippos and make terrible puns about Christmas that somehow elicit adoration rather than cringes from Schuster. The contrast between Schuster\u2019s old life and new one is never sharper than on the day of her second wedding in Monrovia, Liberia. Instead of sneaking in an interview before racing to City Hall, she yells at a hairdresser for making her wait. Days before the big event, under sudden threat of a rebel incursion, she fusses over the number of chicken breasts ordered for the dinner.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how the rest of the world ceases to be important when you\u2019re getting married,\u201d Schuster writes with what is surely irony but doesn\u2019t quite accomplish the necessary self-effacement. \u201cHow willing you are to gloss over events that might otherwise trigger alarms . . . just so you can get back to focusing on what truly matters. Like whether to wear nylons in the sweltering tropical heat.\u201dG., whose journalism career led to a regular McSweeney\u2019s column called The Conflicted Existence of the Female Porn Writer, positions her book in part as cultural analysis of pornography\u2019s complicated but inextricable relationship to social movements like feminism and queer (not to be confused with gay) visibility. We learn about her cofounding of Whack!, an alternative porn magazine that managed to satirize and critique the industry even as it remained affectionately aligned with it. We get an apologia for mislabeling nonbinary performers in a 2010 review. We also get marvelous bits of erotic trivia, for instance the news that sex toys date back at least to the Paleolithic era and that 3D printing technology has \u201cvaulted the sex toy design field forward\u201d by allowing quick, inexpensive production of extremely niche products.But as much as \u201cWatching Porn\u201d is about bodies and sex, its core subject is work and money, specifically in the gig economy. Most adult film performers operate as independent contractors and few, if any, get royalties. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to support yourself in porn unless you\u2019re willing to take almost every job that comes along,\u201d a performer named Mandy Morbid tells the author. She\u2019s talking about having sex on camera, but she may as well be talking about any profession \u2014 from providing tax services to reporting on wars \u2014 that\u2019s found itself splintered by what\u2019s known in the business world as disruptive innovation.It\u2019s all engaging enough, but it never gets to the heart of the more urgent questions that, for me, were looming over all three of these books; namely how do we measure \u201cfulfillment\u201d in work, and where do we find it when the traditional channels have given way to a round-the-clock hustle? Are we to find inspiration in the porn actors whose only common trait, as G. observes, is \u201ca genius for finding a way forward \u2014 toward the money \u2014 through technology, media and the marriage of the two\u201d? Or should we wait for some version of a dashing diplomat, like an old-style corporation, to come along and offer us a pair of golden handcuffs for the sake of our own solvency?That\u2019s a romantic notion in a sort of soothing, paralytic way, but I wouldn\u2019t advise waiting around all day.

{"Headline": "We Lived Through a Flood. Now We Have a Very Long To-Do List.", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDispatchBELLAIRE, Tex. \u2014 All I could do was reach for the towels.With the deluge of Hurricane Harvey approaching my house in persistent waves, rising through our bushes and up our brick walls, there was nothing else to do. My wife, Paola, laughed at me, knowing all too well that rolling towels against windows as the water breached our refuge was like grabbing Band-Aids to care for a gushing bullet wound. Within an hour, there was a foot of contaminated water across the first floor of our house, making it smell like a swamp.Now, two weeks later, we are safe, eating well and enjoying the company of close friends who have taken us in. The two of us and our 12-year-old daughter, Emilie, are among the lucky ones, as many continue searching for a decent meal and a place to sleep in peace. Our house is drying, the walls peeled back to their wooden skeleton and the hardwood floors ripped up and strewed across our dying lawn. We are about to move into a short-term apartment. Recovery is in sight, even if I need a pair of binoculars to see it.The damage to our home is considerable, and will be expensive to fix. New windows, appliances, curtains \u2014 it will all add up. Multiply our losses thousands of times, and you can begin to understand the blow to the Houston area, the country\u2019s fourth-largest metropolis. Lost home values, lost tax receipts, damaged schools, countless stores shut for repairs, half-empty restaurants, looting. And now Floridians have taken flight in the face of another monster storm, wondering if a similar fate awaits them.Houston has declared that it is open for business, but road travel can last hours longer than usual, complicated by closed roads and displaced commuters. Some refineries remain shut or are running at reduced capacity, and gasoline prices have soared. On the other side of the ledger, the money I am going to spend, multiplied by thousands, will be a stimulus package for the regional and national economy.Of course, my story is a grain of sand compared with the constellation of wrecked neighborhoods, broken hearts and even deaths. But perhaps my family\u2019s relative comfort has given me time to think about what this all means, beyond the economics. I hope that I come out of this experience stronger as an individual, and that together we come out stronger as a family. I am fairly confident that will happen, although I could be na\u00efve.Apart from financial losses, the storm has brought something else: It has exposed the skeletons of our lives, just as surely as the wooden bones of our stripped walls. It has exposed us to the limitations of our patience, not to mention our insurance, along with our dependency on a contractor and his workers, and the challenging task of juggling our jobs and family needs.It is probably hardest on Emilie, who awaits the opening of school on Monday after a two-week delay. With no room of her own, and mostly separated from her friends, she is bored and moody. Paola, ordinarily sociable, is turning down dinner invitations. The two of them share a bed with our cockapoo, Sweetie, while I sleep on the living-room couch, waking up frantic each day about the tasks that await.Decisions come fast and furiously; they have since the first days. As the waters devoured our house\u2019s first floor, Paola and I had to choose what to save and what to discard. We rolled up our Persian rug and took it upstairs, along with books, CDs and two light tables. Our couches were too heavy to save, but I managed to haul a leather chair onto a couch and saved it from the waters. Paola insisted we should pull up the curtains or take them down. I said let them go. That was a mistake.Once the floodwaters receded, which happened with amazing speed, we went into action to find someone to rip out the walls and floors. It was almost like a race among our neighbors to get the stuff out, to avoid mold, even while we all commiserated, compared notes, shared stories and drinks. I asked a trusted local real estate agent to recommend a contractor, whom we hired on the spot, since there seemed no time to lose. Was he the best? Maybe. I had to go with my gut.Then came calls to the insurance companies. The auto insurer provided a quick, fair payment for my wife\u2019s car (mine was a company car), but our homeowner\u2019s policy doesn\u2019t take care of flood damage to the house. Fortunately we have flood insurance, but it doesn\u2019t cover lodging while the house is repaired, however long that might be. One neighbor said he expected to be out eight months.That leaves FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. I registered for assistance, and was quickly offered several weeks in a hotel room \u2014 but told that the room would probably be on the outskirts of Houston or beyond, so my daughter and my wife would probably have to spend hours getting to school and work. We decided to seek temporary housing on our own and see if FEMA would defray some of the costs.I spend part of each day at our waterlogged house, where I have been able to resume working from an upstairs office as well as organize the rebuilding effort. I worried about the adjusters\u2019 visit, having heard that adjusters can be stingy. Scavengers are picking through everything, with trucks to haul it away.But when the adjusters \u2014 a married couple from Mobile, Ala. \u2014 arrived to inspect our house and belongings, they could not help being impressed by the piles of debris on nearly every lawn on our block. They seemed sympathetic, but we will need to see their paperwork before we know what we can spend on repairs.The bad news was what they said would not be covered \u2014 our garage, for instance, because, the adjusters said, it includes a home office above. (They later changed their minds.) The gate to our driveway may or may not be covered because it is only partly attached to the house.I am not particularly religious, but on the first Friday night after the flooding I went to my synagogue to find some solace. Congregants embraced, and I went over to hug a woman I know casually because she was crying. I asked if she had lost her house; no, her mother had just died days before. It dawned on me that hers was a real loss, compared with the material things.Rabbi David Lyon, in his own eloquent way, beseeched those in need to reach out for help and for everyone to assist one another. \u201cHate is not the opposite of love,\u201d he said, citing the Holocaust survivor and writer Elie Wiesel. \u201cIndifference is the opposite of love.\u201dThe pastor, Keenan Smith, like my rabbi, appealed for mutual aid. \u201cIt\u2019s times like this, God, that people really see you,\u201d he said. Being an essentially secular person, I probably took that slightly differently from the way he intended. In all the turmoil, what is really important comes into sharp relief: True feelings are shown; the agonies and the brightness of life are displayed.Perhaps my neighbor Todd Lewis put it best. \u201cThere is a realignment of priorities,\u201d he said.Todd and his wife, Amanda, suffered little damage aside from the foot of water that flooded their garage. With a little time on his hands, Todd went door to door in our town and an adjoining neighborhood offering to rip out people\u2019s drywall, while Amanda did people\u2019s laundry and served neighbors dinner. When I told her that I was moved by their generosity, she responded, \u201cWe did nothing.\u201dI have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of emails, phone calls and Twitter messages from relatives and friends asking how we are doing. It is almost embarrassing, but it sure feels good. I even heard from our house\u2019s former owner, who wrote an emotional note to say he was sorry that the home he once loved had been damaged.Neighbors have invited me into their homes, and shared details of their childhoods and other things I would never have known if not for the flood, conversations that have drawn us closer. Strangers have knocked on our door to ask if we need help, or food, or even an embrace. An elderly woman came by to hand me an envelope from our synagogue. There was an assistance check inside, and gift cards to replace towels and other household goods. \u201cI may be back,\u201d she said, smiling.The search for housing, meanwhile, became a priority. I stopped at various buildings to see if anything was available. Most places wanted me to sign leases for six or seven months. Paola scanned Google for apartments near Texas Medical Center, realizing that doctors and patients regularly come and go. Smart move. We found a furnished two-bedroom apartment, and the management agreed to find a desk for Emilie to do her homework.I know that a company-leased car is on the way for me. But we still needed to find a new one for Paola. We decided to lease, and keep more of the insurance money from her destroyed car. Right now I am still on a list to rent a car even temporarily, and dependent on a rickety old Volvo station wagon with a less-than-perfect muffler lent by a good friend. If it breaks down, we are in trouble.I need cataract surgery, since the cataract in my right eye is worsening after my retina detachment surgery a few months ago. (Yes, it\u2019s been a bad year!) Do I go with the expensive surgery that is not completely covered by insurance, or do I do it on the cheap? Time to plan for Emilie\u2019s bat mitzvah. Move ahead, or do something modest? Our finances are up in the air.And beyond those decisions is the uncertainty about how long it will take to get our house together, and replace things it took years to collect.As a reporter who has worked in Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa and made four trips above the Arctic Circle, I have had ample opportunities to meet people from all walks of life. The storm has given me another chance, perhaps the most intimate.The other day we got a call that a tow company was coming for one of our cars. We assumed it was the Subaru parked in the driveway, which was blocking my company Malibu in the garage. But when Jon of Jon\u2019s Wrecker Service came by, he had been contracted to pick up the wrong car. He thought he might be able to move the Subaru and get the Malibu out, and managed to start both cars. When the Malibu started, water began to gush out of the exhaust pipe. He couldn\u2019t move the Subaru because of the electronic parking brake, which was immobilized by the flood damage.Not only was his trip a waste of time, but now I also had a spill of water in the garage, with furniture in renewed danger of damage. Even though Jon had many more cars to pick up, he stayed to help me clean up, and he tried to work with me to get the damaged garage door working again. We began talking about our families, and how we had been affected by the storm. He is of Mexican descent, and his wife is from El Salvador. One of his children goes to a local school, and is missing classes. He told me about his career, beginning as an aviation mechanic, how his family loved to go to El Salvador every summer to swim at the beach.\u201cI\u2019m getting a lot of work,\u201d he said, but without a glimmer of glee. He was clearly tired. He said he wanted his children to go to college, something he now wishes he had done. When we parted, we said we hoped to see each other again.One neighbor asked me if becoming a victim had made me a more empathetic interviewer. I have to think about that. But I do know that many people are in far more dire need than I am, and I feel for them.While reporting in Crosby, I went to the high school, where employees from the Arkema plant were passing out checks from the company to needy families. I met two Mexican women who spoke broken English at best, so we spoke in Spanish. They had been forced to evacuate their homes because they were so close to the plant.Both had families of five and had to wait in line for $100 checks, which weren\u2019t going to take them very far. Araceli Reynosa, who works with her husband in a Mexican restaurant in Houston over 30 miles away, found the check insultingly inadequate considering her car was flooded and inoperable. \u201cWe have no car to go to work,\u201d she said with a sigh.The other woman, Leticia Sanchez, was no happier. \u201cMy house was totally flooded, and my animals \u2014 my dogs, my chickens, my goats \u2014 are all lost,\u201d she said. With a sad but steady voice, she added, \u201cThey must be dead.\u201dAll I could say was that my house was flooded, too.\u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said. I thanked her for her concern.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Germany, Blue-Collar Jobs Provide Bulwark to Populism", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDORTMUND, Germany \u2014 This city in the heart of what was once German coal and steel country could easily be a breeding ground for populism.The last blast furnace went cold almost two decades ago. Unemployment, at 11 percent, is nearly double the national average. A third of the 600,000 residents are immigrants, including thousands of recently arrived refugees from Syria.Instead, Dortmund may help explain why there is no German counterpart to France\u2019s Marine Le Pen, Britain\u2019s Nigel Farage or America\u2019s Donald J. Trump \u2014 at least not yet.But blue-collar strongholds, which helped fuel the backlash in the United States, are providing a bulwark for Chancellor Angela Merkel. Dortmund and other onetime factory towns in Germany have largely avoided the working-class alienation that nourished populist sentiment elsewhere.Through a combination of public policy and entrepreneurial ingenuity, the city has attracted new jobs in sectors like semiconductors and logistics to replace the ones lost in heavy industry, while retaining a core of manufacturing jobs. Unemployment has fallen drastically in the last decade and continues to decline.More than any other wealthy nation, Germany still offers blue-collar jobs that provide a middle-class income for people without college degrees. Although the country has suffered a steep decline in factory jobs since the 1970s, 19 percent of Germans work in manufacturing, nearly double the percentage in the United States or Britain, and higher than in Japan or South Korea.Growth by midsize companies has helped compensate for job losses at the big steel conglomerates. These so-called Mittelstand companies, which account for half of German economic output, turned globalization to their advantage. They pushed into foreign markets with products that exploit Germany\u2019s long tradition in precision engineering.Wilo, a maker of specialized water pumps, is typical of the midsize companies that made Germany the third-largest exporter in the world last year, after China and the United States.Wilo is based practically in the shadow of one of the enormous, abandoned steel mills that stand as monuments to Dortmund\u2019s past. The company is constructing a new corporate campus across the street from its existing headquarters on land that is still being cleared of unexploded bombs from World War II. About 1,800 people will work at the complex, half of them in manufacturing.Wilo has factories in China, India and the United States, including one in Thomasville, Ga. It and other midsize companies also continue to create jobs in Germany, believing that it\u2019s important to retain manufacturing expertise close to home.\u201cWe had the coal crisis. We had the steel crisis,\u201d said Oliver Hermes, the chief executive of Wilo, referring to the resilience of Dortmund. \u201cThat\u2019s the big advantage of this area. It knows how to handle change, and the people here are very flexible.\u201dThings could easily have turned out differently for Dortmund. It lies in the Ruhr Valley, which played a central role in Germany\u2019s emergence as an industrial power in the 1800s because of its abundant coal and iron ore.But the region began a steep decline in the 1970s. Dortmund\u2019s last coal mine closed in 1987, and the last blast furnace used in steel making shut down in 1998. In some cases, the plants were dismantled and shipped to China for use by the same companies that put the Dortmund mills out of business. Even the city\u2019s breweries, once among Europe\u2019s largest, fell on hard times.Local political leaders took action well before the mines closed. The government built a technology park, which offered office space to fledgling companies, and provided entrepreneurs with start-up capital.An early tenant of the tech park was Elmos, a maker of specialized semiconductors for the car industry that was founded in 1984. Back then, surrounding fields were still used to graze sheep. Elmos, now the world leader in chips used in parking-assistance devices for automobiles, employs 750 people in Dortmund.\u201cThere was early investment in the right industries,\u201d said Anton Mindl, the company\u2019s chief executive.To ensure a supply of highly skilled workers, the State of North Rhine-Westphalia expanded the Technical University of Dortmund, which is now among Germany\u2019s largest universities, with 34,000 students.It has spawned start-ups like RapidMiner, a maker of so-called machine learning software \u2014 software capable of teaching itself to do things. Founded in 2007 by alumni of the university, RapidMiner employs 30 people in a local office, where the conference rooms are named after closed coal mines.\u201cThere is a good start-up culture,\u201d Ralf Klinkenberg, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, said of Dortmund.State and local officials also sought to improve the quality of life, which they see as key to attracting employers. After an enormous ThyssenKrupp steel-making complex closed in 2001, the local government cleared the property and created an artificial lake big enough to accommodate a small fleet of sailboats. Today the lake is ringed by modern low-rise buildings containing offices, pricey apartments and cafes.All of this comes at a price conservatives in America would find unacceptable. The government safety net here is more comprehensive, with taxes to match, including a 19 percent national sales tax. Germany has universal health insurance, relatively generous unemployment benefits, and free university tuition. The government plays a role in the economy that many Americans would consider heavy handed.In Dortmund, worker representatives have successfully pressured companies to finance retraining or early retirement for laid-off workers. Sabine Birkenfeld, chairwoman of the workers\u2019 council at a ThyssenKrupp steel galvanizing factory in Dortmund, has lived through serial mergers and layoffs over the years that reduced the work force by 90 percent to 1,300 people.Still, she said, \u201cno one had to go to the unemployment office.\u201dMs. Birkenfeld said workers would push hard for the best possible terms. \u201cIf no one lands on the street,\u201d she said, \u201cthen there won\u2019t be any fodder for the right-wing parties.\u201dIt won\u2019t be clear until the vote on Sunday whether Germany has succeeded in containing right-wing sentiment. Some analysts say the rise of populist parties stems not from economic factors, but rather from a feeling by some voters that mainstream politicians are not listening to them. In that case, Dortmund\u2019s revival would provide no insurance against a right-wing surge.A wild card is whether AfD\u2019s anti-foreigner policies, including calls for armed guards at the borders, will resonate with some voters here.Emad Abdelmalak, a 30-year-old Egyptian studying in Dortmund, said he did not think so. Mr. Abdelmalak has sensed hostility in Germany once or twice since arriving three years ago, he said.

{"Headline": "Tech Firms Add $300 Million to Trump Administration\u2019s Computer Science Push", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe companies have said that donating money, technology and volunteers to schools is often the only way to fill gaps in American school systems\u2019 STEM offerings. Half of all schools in the country with students in kindergarten through 12th grade, where the money announced on Tuesday is to go, offer computer science education. In rural areas, the percentage is even smaller.\u201cIt\u2019s essential that the public and private sectors work together to ensure all American students have the opportunity to learn computer science and take part in the fastest growing sector of our economy,\u201d Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a trade group that announced the new donations, said in a statement.The money will be disbursed over a five-year period, with Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce contributing $50 million each. Lockheed Martin said it would donate $25 million and Accenture, General Motors and Pluralsight, an online education company, said they would give $10 million apiece.Some companies will also donate software and other technology as part of the initiative. Salesforce.org, Salesforce\u2019s philanthropy arm, said it would give 10 software subscriptions to every school in the country.Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest daughter and one of his senior advisers, began organizing the effort about two months ago. She said the $500 million in combined federal and corporate money would be directed to all schools with the goal of trying to bridge a skills divide that she said was hurting the American economy.Ms. Trump said that six million jobs in the United States were going unfilled largely because not enough students were being educated in computer science and other STEM-related skills. And nine out of every 10 software-related jobs in the country are outside Silicon Valley, according to Code.org, an organization working on the initiative with the Trump administration, and two-thirds of the companies that employ computer science professionals are banks, hospitals and other firms not strictly considered part of the tech industry.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to classify computer science as tech to enable getting a job in Silicon Valley or New York,\u201d Ms. Trump said in an interview, \u201cbut the reality is that computer skills and coding is relevant and foundational for every sector and every industry across the economy and tech is increasingly the way we work.\u201dMs. Trump said the Education Department would focus its attention on grant applications related to computer science and to proposals that catered to computer science education for girls and students from minority backgrounds.Mr. Trump\u2019s memorandum on the financing did not guarantee that $200 million in annual grants would go entirely toward computer science education. In a news release, the Education Department said it had a \u201cgoal of devoting\u201d that sum each year toward STEM and computer science education. On Monday, Ms. Trump called 20 state governors and dozens of school superintendents to encourage them to submit grant applications.Advertisement"}

He has supporters and by some estimates could reach 30 percent of the vote \u2014 roughly the number of Democrats who have told pollsters in the past that they do not believe Mr. de Blasio deserves to be re-elected.Turnout will be a big question as well. A low number will dampen claims to a mandate for Mr. de Blasio, as would a better-than-expected showing by Mr. Albanese.Should Mr. de Blasio win, he would face Nicole Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman from Staten Island whom he has already attacked for holding views similar to those of Mr. Trump.With no other Republican in the race, Ms. Malliotakis did not face a primary on Tuesday.Among the City Council races to watch is the contest in central Queens between Francisco Moya, a state assemblyman, and Hiram Monserrate, a former councilman and state senator convicted in 2009 of assaulting his then-girlfriend, and in 2012 of committing felony fraud while on the Council.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where the Wild Things Are: China\u2019s Art Dreamers at the Guggenheim", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring the three-month exhibition some creatures will be devoured; others may die of fatigue. The big ones will survive. From time to time, a New York City pet shop will replenish the menagerie with new bugs.In its strange way, the piece, called \u201cTheater of the World,\u201d created in 1993 by the conceptual artist Huang Yong Ping, perfectly captures the theme of the exhibition: China as a universe unto itself, forever evolving and changing into a new order. It also sums up a sense of oppression the artists felt from 1989 to 2008, as they were making these works.Many of the more than 70 creators were born in China, yet like Mr. Huang \u2014 who fled the country in dismay after the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters on Tiananmen Square \u2014 they reject the label \u201cChinese.\u201d One paradox: The artists appreciate the big splash on Fifth Avenue but express mixed feelings about a nation-themed show. Most consider themselves international artists who have contributed mightily to the global avant-garde art movement.\u201cWhether artists are Chinese or French is not important,\u201d said Mr. Huang, who lives and works outside Paris. \u201cI think the duty of the artist is to deconstruct the concept of nationality. There is going to be a day when there is no concept of nationality.\u201dThe emphasis at the Guggenheim is on conceptual art. There are few oil paintings, and none of the flashy visages of big faces of the political pop school of the 1990s and early 2000s that fetched skyhigh prices at auction.The chronology covers two distinct periods: the political repression after Tiananmen and the economic boom in the 2000s. In the aftermath of the protests, the government banned installation art. That provoked conceptual artists to stage furtive shows in anonymous apartments. Artists struggled. Many escaped abroad, came back, went out again. There were almost no galleries and little money to be made.The 2008 Beijing Olympic Games were staged as China\u2019s coming out party. Many artists dismissed the celebration, preferring to concentrate on government corruption and the demolition of charming old Beijing. But the Games did help to open the eyes of outsiders to China and its art scene.The few works by women is a reflection of the male-dominated government-run art academies of the period, Ms. Munroe said. The teachers were mostly men who wielded disproportionate influence with their power to dole out studio spaces, video equipment and paints. Most of the students were men. Now some classes are evenly split between men and women.\u201cThat source of livelihood was closed to a privileged few, and the few were men exclusively,\u201d Ms. Munroe said. \u201cThe good news is that it has changed.\u201dSome of the artists in Beijing and Hangzhou looked back at their work in the show, the atmosphere during those two decades and how they and the country have changed.They are known as the bad couple of China\u2019s art. Peng Yu, 43, and Sun Yuan, 45, her husband, work in adjacent studios in Beijing\u2019s thriving 798 Art District. Three heavy-duty motorcycles are parked outside Mr. Sun\u2019s door. Inside, skeletons of a lion, a boar, a griffin and a few other animals decorate the shelves. Ms. Peng\u2019s space is smaller, more spartan and contains a bare-bones kitchen.Ms. Peng revels in her brazen politically incorrect attitudes. The fuss about too few female artists in the Guggenheim show was unjustified. \u201cPersonally I think female artists in China are not as hard-working as male artists and their art is not as good as male artists,\u201d she said.The couple\u2019s work at the Guggenheim is one of their less radical pieces. The seven-minute video shows four pairs of American pit bulls tethered to eight wooden treadmills. The camera closes in on the animals as they face each other, running at high speed. The dogs are prevented from touching one another, a frustrating experience for animals trained to fight. The dogs get wearier and wearier, their muscles more and more prominent, and their mouths increasingly salivate.The piece was first shown with the actual dogs appearing before an audience at the Today Museum in Beijing in 2003.\u201cThe piece was so special, it stood out,\u201d Ms. Peng said. \u201cThe art critics didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201dXu Bing, 62, a small wiry figure with long black tangled hair and rimless glasses, is a veteran of China\u2019s conceptual art movement. Early on, he showed that Chinese artists could be at least as provocative as their Western compatriots.His work, \u201cA Case Study of Transference,\u201d from 1994 illustrates his fascination with the ugly and the primitive versus the beautiful and the classical.The original version of the work featured two live pigs \u2014 a boar and a sow \u2014 having sex in front of audiences at one of the early informal art spaces in Beijing. The backs of the pigs were stamped with gibberish composed from the Roman alphabet and invented Chinese characters.Mr. Xu, who has lived in New York for nearly 20 years, spent time on pig farms during the Cultural Revolution. Why pigs and calligraphy? \u201cAnimals are completely uncivilized and Chinese characters are the expression of supreme civilization,\u201d he said.His second work in the show deals with 9/11. Mr. Xu lives in a townhouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and when the planes hit the World Trade Center, he watched from across the river. A few days later, he went to City Hall and scooped up dust and packed it into a plastic bag.On the eve of the Guggenheim show he plans to blow the dust from a leaf-catching machine into a small sealed room. The dust will fall on a stencil of a Zen Buddhist stanza.\u201cThe relationship between China and the world has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter 1989, artists stepped out into the world and they worshiped Western culture. Now younger artists want to stay more in China. They get more inspiration from China, there are more problems to explore.\u201dMs. Yu, now one of China\u2019s most esteemed realist painters, was an instant star. One of the first assignments for her class was to draw Michelangelo\u2019s David. Ms. Yu\u2019s rendition won first prize. It is still shown to students more than 20 years later.Her oil painting in the Guggenheim show is entirely different. A self-portrait, the canvas shows Ms. Yu, a few years out of art school in the early 1990s, scissors in hand, snipping her own hair.The curators could have chosen a more dramatic work from Ms. Yu. A black and white self-portrait on the wall of her studio in Beijing shows Ms. Yu among the protesters near Tiananmen Square before the tanks rolled in. Adjacent to the canvas is a photograph of the crackdown\u2019s aftermath. Dark smoke hangs over the square. The demonstrators\u2019 tent city is demolished. Soldiers are on watch.But such photographs are banned in China. A display of the photo overseas would almost certainly draw protests from the Chinese government.Mr. Zhang, 60, was shattered, he said, by the end of the democratic movement at Tiananmen Square. \u201cThat left a heavy influence on every Chinese person, and it lasts until today,\u201d he said in his small apartment in Hangzhou.He wanted to find a way to depict the absurdity of the state broadcaster never reporting the monumental event on the square.A friend of the artist contacted Ms. Xing and suggested that she read the definition of water many times over.\u201cI lied and let my friend pass on the message that I was doing an education project about water,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t know if she knew that this video of her was actually used for a contemporary art piece.\u201dMr. Zhang is one of the most influential art teachers in China. He detects less political restlessness among the new generation of students, who are impressed by the new consumer-driven economy.Still, the huge gap between the rich and the not-so-rich in China is a recipe for future unrest, he said. But for the moment, he went on: \u201cI procrastinate. Society is procrastinating. There is a lot to be done to change society but mostly we just skip it and wait.\u201dVisitors climb six flights of stairs to reach Kan Xuan\u2019s studio overlooking the red tiled roof of Beijing\u2019s ancient Confucius Temple. On a wooden table rests her laptop and a monitor. There is little art on the walls and no signs of her video works. \u201cI like video because it disappears,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hang around.\u201dIn the second piece, \u201cPost-Sense Sensibility,\u201d Ms. Kan surveys an underground art exhibition held in a basement on the outskirts of Beijing. The show was an exuberant, anything-goes outburst of installation art that surfaced after the sullen post-Tiananmen period.Ms. Kan\u2019s hand-held camera captures the outrageous art \u2014 pig intestines strung from the ceiling, a stillborn fetus lying next to a human face poking through a bed of ice. Art lovers crowd around the installations, hungry for a new era of unfettered expression.The documentary is important for the sake of history, Ms. Kan, 45, said. But she long ago moved on.Her more recent video work focuses on the tombs of Chinese emperors and their courtiers. She has traveled to the far reaches of China, often trekking up mountains to capture the emperors\u2019 remains. \u201cWhen I was traveling I told myself: \u2018See what you see and feel what you feel.\u2019 I have used simple techniques.\u201dMs. Kan was one of four female artists for the 2007 Venice Biennale but she doesn\u2019t care, she said, about gender politics. What\u2019s more important, she pointed out, was to remain independent of the commercial galleries. Unable to survive on her creative videos, she has often taken jobs in high-end commercial film production, including filming luxury sports cars on treks from Beijing to northern Italy.Even though her themes dwell on China, she considers herself an international artist and lives between Beijing and Amsterdam. \u201cI only choose to be in shows where the curators and the artists work hard,\u201d she said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s Chinese artists or not.\u201dOver the years, Mr. Qiu has drawn outsized maps that combine fantasy with politics. The Guggenheim commissioned a map that juxtaposed Chinese and global events with the unfolding contemporary art scene in Beijing and Shanghai.A figure who straddles the establishment and the fringes, Mr. Qiu works in a cavernous studio outside Beijing. He was still putting finishing touches to the map just weeks before the show\u2019s opening. \u201cCoca-Cola back to China, Star Wars, Ronald Reagan,\u201d he said, reading out some of the early references.The map seems politically safe: The Tiananmen Square crackdown is referred to as an \u201cincident,\u201d buried in small print. One milestone seems unintentionally pointed in its misspelling. \u201cReunifiction of HK\u201d reads a phrase, a reference to the Chinese government\u2019s plans for reunification of Hong Kong with the mainland. The banner \u201cSocialism with Chinese Characteristics\u201d is strung across the top of the map, a motif that should please the government.Mr. Qiu has been criticized in China\u2019s social media for leading a government-run academy. \u201cA lot of infuriated netizens say I am bribed by the government,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we didn\u2019t teach in the art institutions how are the younger artists going to be trained?\u201dThe variety and rebelliousness of the works from the \u201990s and the early 2000s were long overdue for exposure at a mainstream Western museum, he said.\u201cThe art I see here in Beijing is totally different to what I see in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big face school of painting gave a fake image of what Chinese art is. The Guggenheim will correct the image.\u201dZoe Mou contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Median U.S. Household Income Up for 2nd Straight Year", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Despite eight years of economic growth since a brutal recession, some politicians and economists have worried that many Americans have not felt the benefits of the expansion.On Tuesday, the Census Bureau painted a brighter picture, suggesting that the recovery had shifted into a new phase in recent years and is now distributing its benefits more broadly.The bureau also reported that the percentage of Americans living in poverty continued to fall last year, while the share with health insurance continued to increase.The data may sharpen the political confrontation between President Trump, who is pressing to overhaul the nation\u2019s economic policies, and Democrats, who now have more ammunition to argue that the changes Mr. Trump seeks would mess with success.Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to lift the nation\u2019s fortunes and to repair what he described in his inaugural address as \u201cthis American carnage.\u201d He has called for cuts to federal taxes and spending, broad reductions in regulation and limits on foreign trade.But some Democrats said the Census Bureau\u2019s new figures reinforced their determination to resist.\u201cWe need to be building on the success of the past eight years, not abandoning the progress we have made as a country and the American people who worked so hard to get us there,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Budget Committee.The Federal Reserve is also closely watching the health of the economy as it debates how soon to resume hiking its benchmark interest rate.Household incomes are outpacing wage growth because millions of Americans have returned to the work force, a vivid illustration of the old maxim that a job is the best antipoverty program. The economy added roughly 2.2 million jobs last year and an additional 1.4 million in the first eight months of this year.But Census Bureau officials cautioned that those figures were not directly comparable because of a change in its methodology in 2013 that has tended to increase measured incomes.The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization based in Washington, estimated that without the change in methodology, median household income in 2016 was still 2.4 percent lower than in 1999 \u2014 and 1.6 percent below the level reached in 2007, before the recession began.Racial disparities also have increased. The bureau reported that the median income for African-American households has fallen by 1.6 percent since 1999. The adjusted numbers provided by the Economic Policy Institute pegged the drop at 7.5 percent.The annual report is based on a survey of 95,000 households.\u201cJust as in 2015, 2016 is going on record as another year of massive income inequality,\u201d said Mary Coleman, senior vice president at Economic Mobility Pathways, a Boston nonprofit group that focuses on female and family poverty. \u201cThere was no meaningful reduction in income inequality.\u201dThe good news is that income inequality, by some measures, is no longer increasing.The details of the report help to explain the reasons. Household incomes increased because more people were working, and the gains in employment have been concentrated among workers with less education, driving income gains on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.\u201cHouseholds are doing better because more people are working and more people are working full time,\u201d said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com.But the increases in household income also reflected investment gains. The share of income that came from sources other than wages increased markedly last year, to 21.8 percent, from 21.1 percent in 2015. That kind of income flows mostly to households on the upper rungs of the ladder.Income inequality is at a very high level by historical standards. Some economists see evidence that the uneven distribution of income and wealth is an impediment to economic growth.The Fed has curtailed its efforts to stimulate economic growth, concluding that monetary policy has done what it can. The Fed is expected to announce next week, after a meeting of its policy-making committee, that it will begin to reduce its bond holdings, a final legacy of its stimulus campaign.\u201cThe challenge for policy makers now is to build on the last few years\u2019 progress and not worsen poverty and inequality,\u201d said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.The data also showed that the ranks of those with health insurance coverage continued to grow last year. Only 8.8 percent of the population lacked insurance for the full year, down from 9.1 percent in 2015.Montana and Louisiana expanded their Medicaid programs in 2016, joining 29 other states in accepting increased federal financing under the Affordable Care Act. Private coverage also increased as companies hired more workers and offered better benefits.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Battle Begins: Mr. Macron vs. the Labor Code", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe overhaul came in the form of five decrees, a constitutional device the Macron-dominated Parliament empowered the president to use to streamline the process. And that is just the beginning. The government\u2019s plan to reform the French social and economic system is expected to encompass reduced spending and changes to pension and unemployment programs, which could be even more contentious.But the labor code has a special place in France. Its roots go back to efforts in the Napoleonic era to restore order after the French Revolution, and at its heart is the notion of the worker in permanent need of protection against rapacious capitalists. Every effort at fundamental reform for at least a quarter of a century has foundered on giant and sometimes violent union demonstrations.To the code\u2019s critics, its elaborate protections of workers\u2019 rights, including the high cost of hiring and the even higher cost of firing, have been major obstacles to growth and foreign investment, and a primary reason for an unemployment rate that hovers stubbornly around 10 percent. The reforms would, among other things, make it easier for employers to hire and fire workers, and allow employers in some instances to negotiate with workers at the company level instead of following industrywide agreements.Public opinion polls \u2014 and Mr. Macron\u2019s election \u2014 show that the French broadly recognize the need for change. The government has wisely paved the way with talks held over the summer with labor unions, and the more moderate unions have said they will not oppose the reforms. Others, like the General Confederation of Labor (C.G.T.), the second-largest national union, have declared their opposition. Philippe Martinez, the head of the C.G.T., calls the reforms \u201cold recipes\u201d that do not work and has said, \u201cAll studies show that there is no relationship between collective rights and the fight against unemployment.\u201d The C.G.T. has called a one-day strike for Sept. 12.The knocks Mr. Macron has taken in his first months may have taught him the value of being more accessible and less concerned with his appearance, but his woes should not be exaggerated. He was elected on a platform of rescuing France from years of anemic growth, high unemployment and budget deficits. His success is critical for the French and for the European Union, in which France plays a leading role alongside Germany. Mr. Macron and his government have set off on the right track with the labor reform, and they must stay the course.Advertisement"}

The war would go on for nearly six more years.\u201cLet us not delude ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cFailure to cooperate on oil and food and inflation could spell disaster for every nation represented in this room.\u201dBut the president also used his speech to project American strength, scolding the Arab nations and using an ad-libbed portion of his remarks to compliment his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger. \u201cSome Arab delegates said they sensed a new \u2018tough line\u2019 in President Ford\u2019s remarks,\u201d The Times reported.President Jimmy Carter, perhaps the American leader most visibly dedicated to international human rights, visited the United Nations earlier than most presidents, and he first addressed the General Assembly at an unofficial meeting in March 1977.\u201cI have come here to express my own support, and the continuing support of my country, for the ideals of the United Nations,\u201d he said.In his speech, he asked that the United Nations \u201cstrengthen\u201d its focus on human rights and, in an unusual rhetorical gesture, placed American strength in the service of the world.\u201cThe United States, my own country, has a reservoir of strength: economic force, which we are willing to share; military strength, which we hope never to use again; and the strength of ideals, which are determined fully to maintain the backbone of our own foreign policy.\u201dPresident Ronald Reagan first addressed the General Assembly unusually late: in June 1982 before a special session on disarmament. He used the address to excoriate the Soviet Union, saying that the superpower had built up its military forces and had violated international arms agreements.He said he yearned to follow the directions of Pope Paul VI, who had asked the members of the United Nations to lay down their arms.\u201cBut we need more than mere words, more than empty promises before we can proceed,\u201d the president said.\u201cSome in the chamber said later that they disapproved of Mr. Reagan's harsh anti-Soviet tone,\u201d The Times reported. But Menachem Begin, Israel\u2019s prime minister, as well as many European representatives, \u201capplauded the president vigorously.\u201dIn December 1988, President Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union had appeared before the United Nations pledging drastic cuts to his country\u2019s armed forces. Maureen Dowd, covering the address for The Times, reported that Mr. Bush\u2019s advisers had hoped for his speech to \u201cmatch and perhaps outshine\u201d Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s. Mr. Bush promised his own cuts to weapons programs, pledging, with certain conditions, that the United States would destroy more than 98 percent of its chemical weapons stockpile within eight years.But apparently, his speech could not measure up: A section of Ms. Dowd\u2019s article was labeled, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Outshine Gorbachev.\u201dWith the Soviet Union no longer a concern, President Bill Clinton\u2019s first address to the United Nations was optimistic as he reveled in the birth of \u201cdozens of new democracies.\u201dBut he recognized that the economic and technological forces of globalization, as well as resurgent ethnic and religious forces, stood as threats. He asserted the United States\u2019 control over the United Nations, asking that its peacekeeping forces more clearly define their mission, and cautioned that American support for intervention in countries like Bosnia would not always be a guarantee.\u201cThe United Nations simply cannot become engaged in every one of the world\u2019s conflicts,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the American people are to say yes to U.N. peacekeeping, the United Nations must know when to say no.\u201dHe encouraged the nations of the world to join the United States in its fight against terrorism and warned that no country was safe from such attacks\u201cA few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble,\u201d he said. He added later: \u201cEvery nation has a stake in this cause. As we meet, the terrorists are planning more murder \u2014 perhaps in my country, or perhaps in yours.\u201dHe emphasized his promises to end the use of torture and to close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. He also said that the United States was committed to \u201cresponsibly ending\u201d the war in Iraq.\u201cThose who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world\u2019s problems alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have sought \u2014 in word and deed \u2014 a new era of engagement with the world.\u201dOf course, Mr. Obama was unable to make good on several of those pledges, even as he used the meeting to make progress on foreign policy objectives regarding Iran and nuclear disarmament. As The Times noted in its coverage, \u201cWhile much of his language was different and more conciliatory, the backbone of American policy on some issues remained similar to the Bush administration\u2019s.\u201dAdvertisement"}

President Trump has vowed to bolster American manufacturing \u2014 and domestic steel production in particular.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump is expected to announce his plan for the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. While he may decide to give Congress time to come up with a permanent resolution, immigration advocates and economists warned that the possible demise of DACA could lead to the deportation of as many as 800,000 people, many of whom are working legally in industries across the United States.\u201cWhy would you take people out of the work force, who are part of the system and paying taxes?\u201d asked Mr. Zalesne, president of Owen Steel in Columbia, S.C.Key Republicans have signaled that they want to find a way to preserve some part of the program, which President Barack Obama put in place in 2012. But finding a permanent fix has eluded Congress.Last week and over the weekend, American business leaders, including Mr. Zalesne, stepped into the political fray and urged Mr. Trump to extend DACA. More than 400 of them signed a letter to the president and congressional leaders, warning that such immigrants \u2014 brought to the United States as children and known as \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 are vital to the economy.But executives at big companies outside of the tech sector spoke up, too. The chairman and chief executive of Best Buy, Hubert Joly, wrote on the company\u2019s blog on Friday, \u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of young men and women whose futures are at stake.\u201dOn DACA, the executives are taking a pragmatic approach. While many immigration advocates have focused on humanitarian issues, the executives focused on the economic toll.According the letter from the executives, 65 percent of Dreamers have bought a car and 16 percent have purchased their own home. This economic activity, they argue, would be eliminated if the Dreamers were deported.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, estimates that five years after a repeal of DACA, the nation\u2019s gross domestic product would be $105 billion less than it would be if the program stays in place.\u201cThe Dreamers are on track to be a highly educated group, and losing them will be a significant blow to businesses already struggling to find educated and skilled young workers,\u201d Mr. Zandi wrote in an email on Monday.Mr. Zalesne said he was not sure how many, if any, of the 295 workers at his company\u2019s facilities, which fabricate steel for projects like the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site, are protected by DACA.He decided to take a stand, he said, not only because of the economic implications, but also because he could not ignore the human toll that deportation would take on people who have been working and going to school legally and have mostly known only one country \u2014 the United States.\u201cThey have been trying to do the right thing,\u201d he said.Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economic Case for Letting Teenagers Sleep a Little Later", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "Supported byThe New Health CareMany high-school-age children across the United States now find themselves waking up much earlier than they\u2019d prefer as they return to school. They set their alarms, and their parents force them out of bed in the morning, convinced that this is a necessary part of youth and good preparation for the rest of their lives.It\u2019s not. It\u2019s arbitrary, forced on them against their nature, and a poor economic decision as well.My oldest child, Jacob, is in 10th grade. He plays on the junior varsity tennis team, but his life isn\u2019t consumed by too many extracurricular activities. He\u2019s a hard worker, and he spends a fair amount of time each evening doing homework. I think most nights he\u2019s probably asleep by 10 or 10:30.His school bus picks him up at 6:40 a.m. To catch it, he needs to wake up not long after 6. Nine hours of sleep is a pipe dream, let alone 10.Marco Hafner, Martin Stepanek and Wendy Troxel conducted analyses to determine the economic implication of a universal shift of middle and high school start times to 8:30 a.m. at the earliest. This study was stronger than the Brookings one in a number of ways. It examined each state individually, because moving to 8:30 would be a bigger change for some than for others. It also looked at changes year by year to see how costs and benefits accrued over time. It examined downstream effects, like car accidents, which can affect lifetime productivity. And it considered multiplier effects, as changes to the lives of individual students might affect others over time.They found that delaying school start times to 8:30 or later would contribute $83 billion to the economy within a decade. The gains were seen through decreased car crash mortality and increased student lifetime earnings.Since it would take at least a year for any students affected by changes in start times to enter the labor market, there would be no gains in the first year. Costs, however, would accrue immediately. These included about $150 per student per year in transportation costs and $110,000 per school costs in upfront infrastructure upgrades. Even so, by the second year, the benefits outweighed the costs. By 10 years, the benefits were almost double the costs; by 15 years, they were almost triple.We\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t acknowledge other potential costs not included in this calculation, including parental difficulty in adapting to later school start times. But even in a model where the per-student, per-year cost was increased to $500, which would compensate most parents for delays, and where the upfront per school cost was increased to $330,000, the economic benefits to society would still outweigh the costs in the long run.Further, it\u2019s important to understand that these benefits may actually be underestimates. The researchers were careful to model only outcomes for which they had empirical data from sleep duration, such as car crashes and academic performance. They didn\u2019t model other real, but quantifiably unknown, benefits, like improvements in rates of depression, suicide and obesity, or the overall effects on health.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The August Jobs Numbers Are Weak. Don\u2019t Blame Trump.", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJobs ReportThe United States economy added fewer jobs than analysts expected (156,000, not 180,000); previous months\u2019 job growth was revised down (by 41,000 positions); the unemployment rate ticked up a bit (to 4.4 percent from 4.3 percent); and wages continued growing at only a glacial pace (0.1 percent).That may be a result of some weirdness that has crept into August numbers in recent years because of the challenges of measuring seasonal variation, or it could reflect a job market that is less vibrant than it had seemed a few months ago. Time will tell, and either way it\u2019s still a fairly strong economy.In that sense, these numbers highlight a widely made mistake in how we have been talking about the economy since Inauguration Day, and really for long before Donald J. Trump took office.There\u2019s an inevitable tendency to view economic data as a continuing presidential scorecard. On the first Friday of the month, a White House economic adviser goes on cable networks to either boast about or explain away the latest numbers.There are two things wrong with this \u201cpresidential scorecard\u201d framework for thinking about economic data. First, the overall trajectory of the economy looks very much the way it did this time a year ago; if you assume some amount of statistical noise, in broad brush strokes the 2017 economy looks pretty much identical to the 2016 economy. Second, this early in an administration, things the president does have had little impact on job growth, G.D.P. or unemployment.The numbers are straightforward. Job growth has averaged 170,000 positions a month since February, the first full month of the Trump administration. That is below the 208,000 average of the last six months of 2016, but the slower pace of job creation shouldn\u2019t be surprising. With the economy closer to full employment now \u2014 the unemployment rate is at 4.4 percent instead of the 4.9 percent in the middle of last year \u2014 employers looking to add jobs are working against a harder constraint on the number of workers.Meanwhile, most other indicators suggest \u201csteady as she goes.\u201d The wage growth number, 2.5 percent over the last year, is right at the level at which it has bounced around for years. There was a bit of a stir, earlier in the week, when second-quarter G.D.P. growth hit 3 percent. But there have been individual quarters like that now and again since this expansion. The 2.1 percent average growth rate in the first half of the year reflects the same basic trend for the last eight years.You can view that from a glass-half-full or half-empty perspective depending on your temperament. The good news is that a slow and steady expansion means that most Americans who want a job can now get one, and wages are growing faster than (low) inflation.President Trump campaigned on reviving the kinds of jobs done in factories, coal mines and oil fields. Since he took office, hiring has indeed ticked upward in these sectors, but is there any connection?The bad news is that wages and incomes are rising more slowly than what has been normal in recent decades, and millions of prime-age Americans remain on the sidelines of the labor market. (The single worst piece of news in the August numbers is that the proportion of those 25 to 54 working actually fell by 0.3 of a percentage point, to 78.4 percent.)Once you view the 2016 economic data as indicating stability, the question is how much credit or blame the Trump administration deserves.There are of course many ways presidents affect the economy, including tax and spending policies they enact, their approach to regulating major industries and appointments to the Federal Reserve.But on all of these frontiers, there hasn\u2019t been enough change since January to account for any change in hiring behavior by businesses. The tax code remains the same as it was on Jan. 20, and there have been no changes to federal spending in the fiscal year about to end. No Trump appointees have been confirmed to serve on the Fed.The picture on regulatory policy is more complicated, and certainly agencies have leeway in interpreting and enforcing existing regulations that Trump appointees are using in more pro-business ways. In regulated industries like banking and energy production, companies may make investment decisions based on expectations of what is coming out of Washington. But the actual repeal of regulations or the writing of new ones is a lengthy, arduous process that is only getting underway.Presidents in general have less control over the economy than headlines tend to suggest. But a year from now \u2014 when there may be Trump-signed tax legislation, a Trump-appointed Federal Reserve chair, and a bunch of regulations devised by Trump appointees \u2014 it will make more sense to ask what the current administration means for the economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Motives of North Korea\u2019s Leader Baffle Americans and Allies", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisTOKYO \u2014 What does Kim Jong-un want?That remains far harder to answer than the technical questions about Mr. Kim\u2019s bombs and the reach of his missiles that have preoccupied American, Japanese and South Korean intelligence officials for years.After North Korea\u2019s underground test on Sunday, more is now known about the power of his nuclear arsenal, even if mystery remains about the veracity of the North\u2019s claim that it detonated a hydrogen bomb.Yet six years after Mr. Kim took power and began executing those who challenged his rule \u2014 sometimes with an antiaircraft gun \u2014 there is no issue that confounds analysts more than the motives of a 33-year-old dictator whose every move seems one part canny strategy, one part self-preservation, and one part nuclear narcissism.The conventional wisdom has always been that Mr. Kim, like his father and grandfather before him, is mostly motivated by a deep desire to preserve the family business \u2014 a small country that is an improbable, walled-off survivor of Cold War.But inside the Trump administration, many have begun to question the long-held assumption that his nuclear buildup is essentially defensive, an effort to keep the United States and its allies from finding the right moment to try to overthrow him.Mr. Kim\u2019s real goal may be blackmail, they argue \u2014 the sort that would be possible as soon as North Korea can put Los Angeles or Chicago or New York at risk.It may be splitting the United States away from two allies \u2014 Japan and South Korea \u2014 who wonder whether the United States would really protect them, and half-expect Mr. Trump to make good on his campaign threat that he might pull American troops from the Pacific.Or it may be about making Mr. Kim a power broker, a man Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping \u2014 leaders of the two superpowers Mr. Kim is fixated on \u2014 must treat as an equal.Maybe it is about all three.Very few people outside of North Korea have met Mr. Kim, including his supposed protectors, the Chinese.In public statements, the country has made clear that it wants to be accepted as a full member of the international community and that it wants to develop its economy alongside its nuclear program. It has also maintained as a longtime goal the desire to reunify with South Korea \u2014 on the North\u2019s terms. Although Mr. Kim makes repeated bellicose threats against the United States and South Korea, such statements are always conditioned on the Americans or South Koreans continuing their \u201chostile policy\u2019\u2019 against the North.But none of that explains the pace at which Mr. Kim \u2014 more technically savvy and more brutal than his father \u2014 has raced in the past year to develop an arsenal of nuclear weapons that can hit multiple targets in the continental United States.\u201cHe wants to demonstrate his ability to put a U.S. city at risk of nuclear attack,\u2019\u2019 Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A., said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS on Sunday. \u201cThat is where he is driving.\u2019\u2019He has nearly achieved that goal.The most commonly heard explanation is that Mr. Kim believes that once he can hit Los Angeles, or maybe New York and Washington, the United States would never risk doing to him what it helped do to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the now-deceased Libyan leader.Mr. Qaddafi gave up all the elements of his nascent nuclear weapons program in 2003, in return for promises of economic integration with the West. That never fully materialized. And as soon as there was an uprising against him, the United States, European allies and some Arab states bombed him. He was found by rebel forces and executed.Where analysts diverge is what he might do if the United States really did withdraw some or all of its forces, as Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, suggested that Washington consider doing. One fear is that it could use its nuclear arsenal as a shield for a military invasion of South Korea in an attempt to reunify the peninsula by force.The worry, say those who fear the North is considering that option, is that its ability to strike the United States with nuclear missiles could undermine Americans\u2019 ability to guarantee that it would protect South Korea, as well as Japan, from attack.\u201cIf the Americans face a choice between San Francisco and Seoul, they will choose San Francisco,\u201d said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul.Based on that calculation, Mr. Lankov said, North Korea \u201ccan provoke a conflict in South Korea and then they can just basically put an ultimatum to the United States telling the Americans that if they get involved, they are going to basically get a North Korean retaliation strike.\u201dSuch a conflict would be catastrophic for Asia, and could lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives. But it would also undercut every assurance the United States has made to other allies, from NATO to New Zealand, about coming to their defense.The probability that the North intends to use force to reunify the peninsula, Mr. Lankov said, is \u201clow, but real.\u201dIt is also one of the regime\u2019s stated goals, though one that \u2014 in the absence of nuclear weapons \u2014 it has never had a realistic hope of achieving. Many believe it is a fantasy, with or without a nuclear arsenal.\u201cNorth Korea does not have the power to carry out an all-out war that could last a long time for unification by force,\u201d said Cho Han-bum, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a South Korean government-funded think tank. \u201cThere is no way North Korea, while suffering from food shortages, can liberate South Koreans by force.\u201dMr. Kim, Mr. Cho said, \u201chas no intention of putting his words into action.\u201dHe may well be right, but given the miserable track record of anticipating Mr. Kim\u2019s intentions, neither American nor South Korean leaders seem eager to make that assumption. (One senior Trump administration official noted that in 1950, everyone assumed the North was too weak to invade the South, and were wrong.)\u201cIt is important to take Pyongyang\u2019s threat seriously,\u201d said Mo Jongryn, dean of the graduate school of international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul.There is another, less dramatic interpretation of Mr. Kim\u2019s intentions. The combination of his developing nuclear program and his increasingly impressive cyberprogram may allow the North to effectively get away with smaller provocations without fear of military retaliation.Another possibility is that the regime will use its nuclear weapons to gain the upper hand in any future negotiations with the United States and its allies.In the past, negotiators assumed North Korea might be prepared to trade away its nuclear program in exchange for economic support or a peace treaty with the United States, which would mean a final settlement of the seven-decade old conflict on the peninsula. (Under the United Nations armistice that suspended the Korean War in 1953, North Korea is still technically at war with South Korea, and its allies.)But now the hope that sanctions will lead North Korea to give up an arsenal in which it has invested so heavily seems almost a fantasy. Instead, there is talk of whether, as an interim step, Mr. Kim might consider a freeze of its programs at their current level.If so, the huge buildup of the past few years may have an easy explanation: Before negotiating a freeze, Mr. Kim may want a nuclear capability too big to dismantle. In short, he wants to be treated like Pakistan, or India, which have made clear they will never trade away their nuclear arsenals. By and large, the world has stopped demanding that they do so.Domestic politics are also at work. Keeping nuclear weapons is also how the Kim regime can best engender fear and loyalty in the country\u2019s populace.That is not to say that the North Koreans don\u2019t have a list of wants if and when they are offered a seat at the negotiating table.Some analysts say that what North Korea most wants is respect.But granting that wish can be difficult for politicians who do not want to appear to be bowing to a dictator. The farthest President Trump went recently was to say at a rally in Phoenix last month that he respected the fact that Kim Jong-un \u201cis starting to respect us.\u201dIf that was ever true, it didn\u2019t last long.A news analysis article on Monday about the motives of Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s leader, who oversaw the detonation of the country\u2019s sixth nuclear bomb over the weekend, misspelled the given name of the Chinese president. He is Xi Jinping, not Jingping.Su-hyun Lee contributed reporting from Seoul.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Incoherent Strategy on North Korea", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMr. Trump\u2019s approach has so far consisted of sanctions, pressure on China \u2014 North Korea\u2019s chief ally \u2014 and taunts against the government in Pyongyang. These messages have not only produced zero positive results but they have also sowed confusion about his intentions. The president and his team seem unable or unwilling to put together a realistic and coherent strategy that goes beyond pressure tactics and harsh rhetoric to include a serious effort to engage the North Koreans.Containing the North is not a simple task. President Bill Clinton worked out a deal that froze the North\u2019s plutonium program for eight years, only to see the agreement collapse under George W. Bush. The North\u2019s nuclear program is now far more advanced, making getting rid of it, or even containing it, a lot harder.He has reason to worry: Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, gave up his nascent nuclear program in 2003 in return for promises of economic integration with the West. But when rebels rose up against him, he was bombed by the United States and its allies, then executed by rebels.Ms. Haley pressed the Security Council this week to impose an oil ban on North Korea. That\u2019s a likely nonstarter, since it would mostly affect China, which is the North\u2019s primary oil supplier and has long resisted such a ban because it fears it could set off a collapse of the Kim regime, a flood of refugees into China and the reunification of the Korean Peninsula under South Korea. Many experts also doubt the usefulness of sanctions as a tool to force the North to abandon its nuclear weapons, which Pyongyang sees as the only real leverage it has on the global stage.Ms. Haley\u2019s boss seems no less enamored of the China card, threatening to end trade with China if it does not curtail trade with the North \u2014 a completely empty threat given the powerful economic ties between China and the United States and China\u2019s pivotal role in the global economy. Mr. Trump would be better advised to work with China on a diplomatic initiative that could include the threat of tougher sanctions but would offer the North a deal in which Pyongyang would freeze its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for some American concessions, like a reduction in military exercises.It is not at all clear that Mr. Kim is interested in talking. But Mr. Trump needs to test the possibility before design or miscalculation leads to war.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Health Care Cul-de-Sac", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut sometimes, when a party has spent most of a year producing health care bills that excite almost nobody and that even the senators voting for them can\u2019t effectively defend, it\u2019s worth stepping back and thinking about our national priorities.This goes for both parties: not only the stepping-on-rakes Republicans, but the suddenly single-payer-dreaming Democrats. If Obamacare repeal is really dead for the year 2017, both left and right have a chance to shake their minds free of the health care debate and ask themselves: What are the biggest threats to the American Dream right now, to our unity and prosperity, our happiness and civic health?I would suggest that there are two big answers, both of which played crucial roles in getting a carnival showman who promised to Make America Great Again elected president. First, an economic stagnation that we are only just now, eight years into an economic recovery, beginning to escape \u2014 a stagnation that has left median incomes roughly flat for almost a generation, encouraged populism on the left and right, and made every kind of polarization that much worse.Second, a social crisis that the opioid epidemic has thrown into horrifying relief, but that was apparent in other indicators for a while \u2014 in the decline of marriage, rising suicide rates, an upward lurch in mortality for poorer whites, a historically low birthrate, a large-scale male abandonment of the work force, a dissolving trend in religious and civic life, a crisis of patriotism, belonging, trust.Now a follow-up question: Is the best way to address either of these crises to spend the next five years constantly uprooting and replanting health insurance systems, and letting health care consume every hour of debate?That appears to be what some on both sides want to happen. The latest Republican plan would push most of Obamacare\u2019s funding down to the state level, theoretically limiting the issue\u2019s role in national debates. Except that it wouldn\u2019t. Every state-by-state fiasco (and there would be many) would bring calls to recentralize, every federal regulatory decision would be litigated furiously, and the issue would dominate the 2020 campaign at the state and federal levels both.And if the Democrats, having blown up the insurance system once to implement Obamacare, really rallied around a Bernie Sanders-style proposal to do it all over again but on a bigger scale? Then not only would 2020 be a health care election, but if the Democrat won, the next two years would be consumed by outlandish single-payer expectations.But when your main challenges involve men who aren\u2019t working, wages that aren\u2019t rising, families that aren\u2019t forming and communities that are collapsing, constantly overhauling health insurance is at best an indirect response, at worst a non sequitur. Especially since right now health care inflation is relatively low, the deficit has temporarily stabilized and Obamacare is less disruptive than both optimistic and pessimistic accounts suggested.Health care reform was the Barack Obama presidency\u2019s main achievement, but it crippled his administration politically once it passed. Obamacare repeal has devoured the first year of the Trump presidency, with nothing to show for it. The country has bigger problems than its insurance system. It\u2019s time for both parties to act like it.Advertisement"}

In 2005, the year Ms. Merkel became chancellor, it served about 1,500 people. Today it serves 10,885. An additional 120 families are on a waiting list.\u201cI think it is tragic that the Tafel even exists, that it needs to exist,\u201d said Mr. Richter, a volunteer who survives on government assistance and his own weekly food ration. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the politicians think is happening here and what they are doing.\u201dGerman poverty may sound like an oxymoron. But the disparity between the rich and poor has widened during Ms. Merkel\u2019s 12 years in power, leaving nearly 16 percent of the population at risk of poverty, according to government figures. This incongruity has ushered in greater insecurity in a country that prides itself on its equitable social market system.The country, no doubt, remains one of the world\u2019s wealthiest, home to four of the globe\u2019s largest companies by revenue, according to Forbes, with one of the highest average incomes in the European Union and one of the lowest unemployment rates, at 5.7 percent.But the negative impacts of those same policies \u2014 put in place by Ms. Merkel\u2019s Social Democratic predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der \u2014 have intensified, analysts say.Christoph Butterwegge, a political scientist who focuses on poverty at the University of Cologne, rejects the chancellor\u2019s claim of a uniformly prosperous Germany as \u201csuperficial and undifferentiated.\u201dHe blames her successive governments for allowing the families and individuals who run German companies to amass wealth through advantageous taxes and persistently low wages.\u201cThat is her mantra, and it is true for a large majority of the people in Germany,\u201d Mr. Butterwegge said of the chancellor\u2019s line about German affluence. \u201cBut the growing prosperity of the majority has come at the expense of many others.\u201dEven as the number of working people has increased, so has the number of people relying on government benefits. Since 2012, an additional 2.1 million people have turned to government assistance. In all, 7.2 percent of the population relies on it.Many are the working poor whose incomes are not enough to sustain them. More than seven million people hold so-called mini-jobs, part-time positions without any contributions to health insurance.That is the darker side of the changes, known as Agenda 2010. Although widely credited with increasing competitiveness and getting millions into jobs, many of those jobs have not provided a living wage.They have led to a casting out of workers unable to keep pace with a fast-moving, flexible job market \u2014 something critics of Mr. Macron\u2019s proposed overhaul of the French labor code are warning against.\u201cPoverty and wealth are structurally connected in this country, as they are in the United States, and Angela Merkel only sees that part of society that has benefited from the changes of the Agenda 2010 that she refers to repeatedly and increasingly positively,\u201d Mr. Butterwegge said.\u201cBut if I look at other developments, such as the precarious job situation, 1.2 million people who hold down jobs but still live below the poverty level \u2014 the food banks have more than 1.5 million people whom they are helping \u2014 how an average family has never had it so difficult to find affordable housing in Germany\u2019s large cities \u2014 these are developments that Angela Merkel likes to block out,\u201d he said.Earlier this year, the center-left Social Democrats flocked to Martin Schulz as a man who could return the party to roots that many saw as betrayed by Chancellor Schr\u00f6der\u2019s program.Support for the Social Democrats \u2014 traditionally the party of workers and the champion of a strong system of social benefits \u2014 soared to around 30 percent in March.\u201cTime for equality. Time for Martin Schulz,\u201d the party\u2019s slogan went.\u201cIn the beginning, he tried very hard to just sell the left-wing positions, and I think he was very successful. People believed him, and they like the idea of turning left,\u201d Mr. Schlipphak said. \u201cThen came the Saarland elections, and he just did a flip-flop move.\u201dWith the election just days away, on Sunday, support for the Social Democrats has slumped to historic lows, around 23 percent or less.Even Mr. Richter at the food bank sees no option for himself at the polls and says he is undecided.Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives can only offer more of the same, he said. The more libertarian Free Democrats would only help the rich. The Social Democrats seem powerless. Other parties on the left are too radical.For him, that left only the far-right Alternative for Germany, with its nationalist populist platform, which appears poised to emerge as the third-strongest party, with around 10 percent support.\u201cThey make some good points, but considering what I do, they are out of the question,\u201d Mr. Richter said, pointing out that his organization is helping integrate the roughly one million refugees the far right opposes.Manfred Jabs, the director of the Bremerhaven Tafel, looks like a cross between a sea captain and Santa Claus, with a thick white beard and a high forehead and ruddy cheeks.He himself quit the Social Democratic party years ago in protest over the labor programs. He bemoans the loss of a more social-market-oriented party, one that would still have a place for someone like Mr. Richter and himself.Instead, Mr. Jabs said the employment office sends people who cannot get jobs elsewhere to help at the food bank, where, in addition to their food rations, they are given just 1 euro \u2014 of symbolic pay.The government then subsidizes the rest of their income, counting them as employed.Many of these people lack the desire to work, Mr. Jabs said, and he sees the money spent on trying to train them as wasted.\u201cSending them to six seminars on how to apply for a job will not increase their chances of getting a job,\u201d he said.Mr. Jabs said he was unconvinced that anyone on Germany\u2019s political stage had a solution for the poor he serves.\u201cWe have the impression that the numbers are increasing,\u201d Mr. Jabs said. \u201cRegardless of who builds the next government, we are preparing for that.\u201dThey especially include rising numbers of elderly, one of the fastest-growing groups facing poverty.Over the past 12 years, their numbers have doubled at the food bank, Mr. Jabs said, and he knows many more who are too proud to seek assistance.Many of them are women, who stayed home to raise their families instead of working and saving for retirement.Heidi, 76, is one of them. Her monthly pension, plus a welfare supplement, amounts to \u20ac705, or about $840, which has to cover rent, utilities, food and clothing.\u201cWhat has been forgotten is our generation of women, those of us between 70 to 80, who made it through the war and started our families with little or nothing,\u201d she said, asking that her last name not be used because she was ashamed.\u201cWe were taught to make do with what we had and raise our children,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now we find ourselves with nothing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a political scientist at the University of M\u00fcnster.

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Puerto Rico Fall Into an Economic Abyss", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsAlmost nothing on the planet, short of nuclear weaponry, destroys economic value as rapidly as a mega-hurricane. In Puerto Rico, decades of economic progress were undone in 12 hours by Hurricane Maria.With millions lacking electricity or potable water, avoiding a humanitarian disaster should be President Trump\u2019s top priority. But these immediate needs are just the beginning of Puerto Rico\u2019s long road to recovery. As Congress considers an aid package in the days and weeks ahead, it\u2019s important to grasp the truly extraordinary scale of the storm\u2019s economic devastation.In all five cases, those strikes were on much smaller islands (Guam, Hong Kong and the Northern Marianas) making it easier to achieve high-intensity scores per area of land affected. More notably, all five were in the Pacific Ocean, whose wide, warm expanse gives cyclones a long runway to intensify. In more than 60 years of data, no Atlantic hurricane was a disaster as epic as Maria slamming into Puerto Rico.But sadly, the largest costs are yet to come. Research with Professor Jina shows hurricanes can have a strong effect on economic growth over the following decades. Historically, a 1-in-10 cyclone event slows per capita income growth in the affected country to the point that it is 7 percent poorer two decades after the storm. This is on par with losses from an average financial or banking crisis.Maria\u2019s impact may be much worse. To determine how much worse, we used an econometric model of the costs of cyclones over the past 60 years and applied it to the characteristics of Hurricane Maria and the pre-storm economic conditions in Puerto Rico. We calculated that Maria could lower Puerto Rican incomes by 21 percent over the next 15 years \u2014 a cumulative $180 billion in lost economic output. Supposing that Puerto Rico had been on track to sustain its 0.8 percent real per capita annual growth between 2009 and 2015, then we would expect to see Maria undo all those gains and then some. It could now take 26 years for the next generation to get back to where we are today, assuming that per capita growth rate would have continued.In percentage terms, the loss to the Puerto Rican economy is on par with the most heavily hit states during the Great Recession. For Puerto Rico, Maria could be as economically costly as the 1997 Asian financial crisis was to Indonesia and Thailand and more than twice as damaging as the 1994 Peso Crisis was to Mexico \u2014 but this time on American soil.But this doesn\u2019t need to become Puerto Rico\u2019s destiny. Sufficient, timely, sustained and well-designed disaster relief from Washington can help mitigate Maria\u2019s impact. The island\u2019s electrical grid needs to be rebuilt from scratch, and fast, to deliver lifesaving services now and to enable broader recovery and reinvestment in the months ahead. Thousands of buildings need to be repaired or replaced.Timely assistance can help ensure that this construction can happen without bankrupting families and small businesses, which would deprive Puerto Rico of private investment and household spending at the very moment it\u2019s most needed. Research has shown that people tend to leave storm-battered areas if there\u2019s not prompt outside support to rebuild and reinvest. If there is that support, people are more likely to remain.The Puerto Rican government has little ability to finance reconstruction of roads, power communications and other infrastructure, and these will need to be built differently, because Maria is certainly not the last storm we will see. Smart investments now can reduce the economic damage the next time.Attempting to grasp the true scale of devastation in the wake of Maria is mind-bending and heartbreaking. As Congress considers a Hurricane Maria aid package, it should not ignore these numbers. It is in everyone\u2019s interest to try to keep Puerto Rico\u2019s economy from falling into the abyss. And most important, we have a mutual duty to one another as Americans.Advertisement"}

And as much as some try to denigrate my management approach, you don\u2019t achieve all those things without managing the hell out of the situation.\u201dThe mayor was asked about the comments during a news conference in the Bronx to discuss continued reductions in crime, where a reporter for The New York Post \u2014 a frequent target of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s ire \u2014 asked where he would like the parade in his honor to be held.\u201cMisinterpretation, which is the watchword of your publication,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said curtly, and then called on another reporter.When The Post reporter, Yoav Gonen, asked Mr. de Blasio to explain himself, the mayor said that good news gets little attention, including improvements in crime-fighting, schools and the economy. \u201cAs a city, unfortunately we don\u2019t take a lot of time to celebrate that, and I think that\u2019s a lost opportunity,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.He also said that he wished he had never promised to provide examples, but did so using an unfortunate turn of phrase for a mayor who, especially early on during his administration, was accused of sleeping in and therefore running late to events.\u201cI said it in a moment of frustration,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know the old phrase, \u2018I shoulda stood in bed\u2019? I should have just let it be, but I\u2019m fine with it. I would have been better off saying nothing.\u201dIn the New York interview, Mr. de Blasio initially denied that his long-running feud with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was motivated by a personal animus, and he accused the interviewer, Chris Smith, of evincing bias by asking whether there was something personal at play. But after being pressed repeatedly, the mayor said, \u201cWe do have a long personal relationship, and that\u2019s a component.\u201dMr. de Blasio also said that he would like greater power to create affordable housing.\u201cPeople all over this city, of every background, would like to have the city government be able to determine which building goes where, how high it will be, who gets to live in it, what the rent will be,\u201d he said, saying that an excessive regard for private property stood in the way. \u201cI think there\u2019s a socialistic impulse, which I hear every day, in every kind of community, that they would like things to be planned in accordance to their needs. And I would, too.\u201dHe added: \u201cIf I had my druthers, the city government would determine every single plot of land, how development would proceed.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Electric Car Push Lures Global Auto Giants, Despite Risks", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal automakers see the future of electric cars, and it looks Chinese. The biggest players are shifting crucial scientific and design work to China as the country invests heavily in car-charging stations and research and pushes automakers to embrace battery-powered vehicles.China underscored that ambition over the weekend, when it said it would eventually ban the sale of gasoline- and diesel-powered cars at an unspecified date.But the auto industry\u2019s response \u2014 moving electric car design and production to China \u2014 represents a big risk.China wants the big players to share their electric car knowledge, too. The foreign automakers face new Chinese regulations that put heavy legal pressure on them to transfer electric-car technology to their local partners. Chinese officials are also set to impose stringent regulations that would force automakers like Volkswagen and G.M. to sell new-energy cars in the country if they want to continue selling the old-fashioned gasoline-powered types as well.Still, Western companies say that they know the risks of transferring technology \u2014 and that the opportunities could help them reach their own electric car ambitions faster.\u201cWe are in a learning process with them together,\u201d said Jochem Heizmann, the chief executive of Volkswagen\u2019s China operations. \u201cThat process is much faster than we are used to doing these things. In our normal processes, it would not be possible to come to the market next year.\u201d\u201cMultinational firms are already starting to cave in to China\u2019s policies, putting in jeopardy the future of this sector and countless jobs and economic benefits,\u201d said Michael Wessel, a commissioner of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which was set up by Congress to monitor the bilateral relationship.Auto executives insist that they are using good judgment. Rules that China issued in January requiring them to share technology are vaguely worded and could allow at least some components to be made abroad and imported. Chinese officials said here this weekend at China\u2019s main annual automotive technology conference that they would introduce policies that would help attract more foreign investment in its new-energy vehicles, giving some hope to foreign auto executives.\u201cWe have no concerns relative to the amount of I.P. that has to be shared,\u201d said Matt Tsien, the president of G.M.\u2019s China operations, referring to intellectual property.General Motors has been collaborating with its partner, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, on advanced hybrid cars like the Chevrolet Volt, which G.M. brought to China last spring as the Buick Velite. Hybrids like the Volt run on both battery power and gasoline.\u201cWe have a philosophy, from an overall perspective, that we build where we sell,\u201d Mr. Tsien said.Ford said only that it would comply with all Chinese rules on joint ventures and that its new pact with China\u2019s Zotye Auto is preliminary. Renault-Nissan said that its new joint venture with China\u2019s Dongfeng Motor, called eGT, will design a new electric car that will be produced at a Dongfeng factory in the Chinese city of Shiyan. Honda Motor is planning to make an electric car in China next year, while Toyota plans to make a plug-in hybrid car in the country.Still, China has a number of ways it can stay ahead in the electric car race.Gao Feng Advisory, a Beijing-based consulting firm, estimates that China will have spent about $15 billion by 2020 installing charging stations for electric cars. China spent more than $1 billion subsidizing research and development by 2015, with more still coming.Generous subsidies for car buyers that can reach $9,000 have also helped pique interest, though China plans to phase them out by 2020. Sales of battery-powered cars in China could top 400,000 by 2019, according to LMC Automotive, a global consulting company, adding up to about two-fifths of the world\u2019s sales of such cars.Wang Panpan, a migrant worker in Shanghai from central China, said that he rented a locally built electric JAC iEV5 in Shanghai because electricity was cheaper than gasoline. The only nuisance: running a long extension cord from his Shanghai apartment to wherever he managed to park his car.Now he wants to replace his gasoline-powered Nissan Cedric in his hometown. \u201cIf I have the money, I will change to an electric one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt saves money, and it is environmentally friendly.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t the automakers call this out?\u201d said Michael Dunne, a former president of G.M.\u2019s Indonesia operations and longtime consultant on the Chinese auto market. \u201cWell, the guys on the line are reluctant.\u201dAuto executives say that they have no choice but to keep doubling down on their big bets on electric cars in China. At the Shanghai auto show last spring, more than 190 different models of electric cars were on display, although many of them were concept cars that would need refinements before they could go into mass production.\u201cWe will increase it even further \u2014 we\u2019re honestly not very concerned about the tech transfer,\u201d said Hubertus Troska, the chairman and chief executive of greater China at Daimler, which makes Mercedes and Smart cars. \u201cThis is the coolest, most attractive car market in the world right now.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Texas Is No Longer Feeling Miraculous", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Call it the season of Texas\u2019 discontent. Of course there was Hurricane Harvey, which blasted the coastline, leaving cities flooded and an estimated $180 billion in damage. But Harvey is just the headline.There\u2019s also the dysfunctional, ideologically driven State Legislature, which spent the last weeks of this year\u2019s session debating, of all things, who gets to use which bathroom. Then there\u2019s the oil and gas sector, which, as it has so many times before, expanded into a bubble and then, as global energy prices sank, popped, taking thousands of jobs with it.Texas\u2019 woes are interconnected. Rising energy prices allow politicians to take their hands off the legislative wheel. Less attention to smart, controlled growth at the state and local level allowed unchecked sprawl along the coast. And now declining revenues will make it harder for the state to address its very real needs, assuming the Legislature can get its act together. The silver lining to this tale? It finally seems to be dawning on people that low taxes, less regulation and more oil are no substitute for actually governing.If this doesn\u2019t sound like the Tall Tale of the Texas Miracle of just a few years ago, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not. Way, way back \u2014 in early 2015 \u2014 Gov. Rick Perry rode out of office with his head held high: The boom years had created over 1.4 million jobs since the end of 2007. We had escaped the housing bust, oil and gas prices were rising and the state\u2019s economy had diversified and profited mightily from free trade. Texas was the promised land, reminiscent of Davy Crockett\u2019s observation that our state \u201cis the garden spot of the world.\u201d At the height of this latest Texas miracle, the cost of living was so low and there were so many jobs that 1,000 people flocked here every single day.Times, however, have changed. Two years ago Texas had one of the nation\u2019s lowest unemployment rates; today it is in 28th place. Though it is now at 4.4 percent, it was as high as 5 percent a few months ago, and there\u2019s a good bet it will bounce back up, and likely higher, soon.The reason: the oil patch. When oil fetched $100 per barrel, we fracked away, even in our own suburbs. Roughnecks rented trailer spots in front yards and showered towns from Odessa to Victoria with money. A drive across West Texas\u2019s vast, oil-rich Permian Basin in late 2015 revealed equipment crowding roads. Now much of that equipment is idle, and energy companies are planning on $40 a barrel as far as they can forecast.The Lone Star State also slipped in the business rankings. For the first time in years, Texas tumbled out of the top two most desirable states for business in CNBC\u2019s annual survey of executives. No. 1? Washington State. The reason, executives said, was a stalled state economy \u2014 because of the oil slump. Governing magazine ranked the Texas economy 21st; in 2013, it was third. WalletHub has Texas in 20th place.It\u2019s not just the oil slump. Even though we don\u2019t have a state income tax, we have high sales and property taxes. WalletHub ranks our effective tax burden 30th in the country, basically tied with Massachusetts. And the state isn\u2019t about to help: The Legislature can\u2019t even figure out how to fund public schools.Will business turn up its nose at Texas? It already has. Yes, Toyota\u2019s new North American headquarters is in Plano, outside Dallas. But General Electric was looking to move its headquarters from Connecticut to North Texas, too. Instead, 800 G.E. employees are going to Boston. The reason? Massachusetts may be home to high taxes and high regulations, but it\u2019s also a pro-trade and pro-smart growth. Texas, meanwhile, is home to Representative Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and an ardent opponent of the Export-Import Bank, on which G.E. and many other companies depend for export assistance.And what are the chances that Amazon, now in the hunt for a second headquarters site, will choose Dallas, which has thrown its 10-gallon hat in the ring? Whatever the city can offer, the state taketh away in the form of do-nothing legislators and governor who sport, as their recent crowning achievement, an Arizona-style law that allows the police to question people\u2019s citizenship and immigration status. The law immediately stalled in the courts.The governor, Greg Abbott, also called the legislature back into a special session in part to pass a North Carolina-style bill regulating which public bathroom transgender people could use. It lost, but not before it had pitted Republicans against AT&T, American Airlines, Dell, Google, the major oil companies, Southwest Airlines and the Texas Association of Business.Texas Republicans, somehow, have become the anti-business party. \u201cMost of the threats to the future of Texas are self-imposed: Inadequate education and infrastructure funding can stifle growth,\u201d said M. Ray Perryman, an economist who describes himself as a fiscal conservative. \u201cDiscriminatory social legislation can irreparably damage the business climate, and hard-line immigration posturing is counterproductive.\u201dMr. Abbott hasn\u2019t shown much interest in toiling in the garden of economics, anyway; where Mr. Perry doled out some $500 million in incentives to companies to move, stay or grow in the state, Mr. Abbott has parsimoniously offered enticements often measured in the several hundred thousand dollars (except for Toyota, which got $40 million in incentives from the state to move to Plano).And then came Harvey. In addition to the immense human suffering, applications for unemployment benefits have spiked to Great Recession levels. If the federal government comes through with all the money, then those costs would eventually be zeroed out as money pours into rebuilding. But that\u2019s a huge if, given the politics of Washington, the highly politicized history of recent hurricane relief and the fact that only $15 billion has been approved. Of that, only $1 billion has been disbursed; almost a third of that will be needed just to clean up trash.The tale of the Texas Miracle was a big fat lie: Plentiful oil, low regulation and even lower taxes are not a panacea. Sure, they don\u2019t hurt. But they don\u2019t help, not without consistent, well-considered state policy to attract and build businesses.Still, there is hope. Harvey is forcing Texans to rethink our political dogma of small government at any cost. Harris County, which surrounds Democratic Houston and includes bedrock Republican suburbs, has placed everything on the table to prevent disasters in the future: from radical rezoning to land conservation and a giant Dutch-style engineering project to protect the region from another direct hit. That will take at least tens of billions of taxpayer dollars.Even the state\u2019s right-wing lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, has found religion, singing the praises of expensive engineering. Mr. Abbott is being too clever by half so far, refusing to tap the state\u2019s $10 billion rainy day fund while asking for the federal government to pick up the entire tab for the hurricane. Though as a politician he has done nothing but oppose the federal government, his re-election may end up hinging on how effective he is at bringing home the federal bacon. The same is true of the state\u2019s junior senator, Ted Cruz, notorious for opposing aid to areas hit by Superstorm Sandy.Yes, Harvey has flooded the garden of the Texas economy. But the garden was already unkempt. And fall, in Texas, is a good time to start over with honest perspiration. To quote that most famous Texas gardener, Lady Bird Johnson, \u201cWhere flowers bloom, so does hope.\u201dRichard Parker is the author of \u201cLone Star Nation: How Texas Will Transform America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Feel That Post-Recession Bounce? The Rich Feel It the Most", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEight years after the Great Recession officially ended, the fruits of economic growth are finally spreading to low-wage workers, racial and ethnic minorities and other groups that were largely left out of the early stages of the recovery.But in a pattern that has become familiar in recent decades, the biggest gains continued to flow to the richest Americans.But despite the gains, wealth also become more concentrated:\u2022 The richest 1 percent of households controlled 38.6 percent of total wealth in 2016, up from 36.3 percent in 2013.\u2022 The bottom 90 percent of households controlled 22.8 percent of all wealth.Wednesday\u2019s data, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, shows the strength of the economic rebound in recent years, but also just how large a hole the recession left in many households\u2019 finances.The survey is notable for providing information not just on Americans\u2019 yearly income but also on their assets, debts and overall net worth \u2014 measures that are in many ways more important to families\u2019 financial security. In terms of income, the typical American has made significant progress in recent years, with median household income nearly back to its prerecession peak.The broader measures of household finances provided by the survey paint a less rosy picture. The recession sliced nearly 40 percent off the typical household\u2019s net worth, and even after the recent rebound, median net worth remains more than 30 percent below its 2007 level.For many groups, the recovery is even more incomplete.Younger, less-educated and lower-income workers have experienced relatively strong income gains in recent years, but remain far short of their prerecession level in both income and wealth. Only for the richest 10 percent of Americans does net worth surpass the 2007 level.Racial and ethnic minorities experienced the strongest gains in wealth in the 2016 survey, a stark reversal from three years earlier, when the survey showed minority families losing ground even as white families experienced modest gains.Black families\u2019 net worth rose 29 percent between 2013 and 2016, and Hispanic families had a 46 percent gain; white families saw a more modest 17 percent increase.Americans, and higher-income whites in particular, vastly overestimate progress toward economic equality between blacks and whites.Just over half of American families \u2014 52 percent \u2014 owned stock in 2016, the first time stockholders represented a majority of Americans since before the financial crisis. But only a relative handful of families own stock outside of retirement accounts, and even counting those accounts, their holdings are often small.The typical stock owner held $40,000 in stock in 2016; among those in the top 10 percent of earners, that figure was nearly $365,000.Households have made significant progress in one area: debt.Americans are significantly less indebted than before the recession and, significantly, they are better able to afford the debts they have. The median borrower had debts equal to 95.1 percent of income in 2016; the figure was 111.1 percent before the recession and rose to 118.8 percent in the immediate aftermath. Moreover, fewer Americans report being late on debt payments, filing for bankruptcy or taking out high-interest payday loans.One type of debt is still rising, however: student loans. More than 22 percent of families reported having education debt in 2016, up from 15 percent before the recession. The median borrower owed $19,000.The oldest Americans have seen a significant rebound in their wealth in recent years; the typical household headed by someone 75 or older is now worth modestly more than before the recession, after adjusting for inflation. But younger retirees and those on the verge of retirement haven\u2019t come close to making up what they lost in the recession.That\u2019s not surprising: Older workers were especially exposed to the stock-market plunge and didn\u2019t have much time to recover before retirement.The median household headed by someone between the ages of 55 and 74 had less than $60,000 in financial assets in 2016, down from roughly $80,000 in 2007. Adding to the challenge, older Americans\u2019 homes \u2014 the principal nonfinancial asset for many families \u2014 are still worth less than before the recession.\u201cThis is not good news for retirement security,\u201d said Monique Morrissey, an economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Heard the One About Jamestown? State Bets Comedy Can Spark a Revival", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAMESTOWN, N.Y. \u2014 This is not really a funny place.Now, in a multimillion-dollar gamble that will test the power of giggles versus geography, the State of New York has invested nearly $10 million in the hopes that it can turn Jamestown \u2014 which has no comedy clubs, no velvet ropes and no two-drink minimum \u2014 into an A-list tourist destination and a prime example of civic pluck triumphing over chronic malaise.The draw? A $50 million museum and yuk-yuk Hall of Fame known as the National Comedy Center, featuring an array of artifacts and high-tech exhibits, including \u2014 no kidding \u2014 holograms of comedians, both dead and alive.That may be a wee exaggeration at this point: With opening night still almost a year away, the comedy center has thus far been all setup, no payoff. Ground was first broken here, next to a rehabilitated railroad station along the Chadakoin River, in August 2015. At that point, the state \u2014 through the Empire State Development Corporation, its development arm \u2014 had already invested $1.5 million in the center.Likewise, the comedy center\u2019s backers are bullish about its chances, both as an economic spark and a way to honor the likes of George Carlin, Richard Pryor and, yes, Lucy.\u201cThe driving force behind the National Comedy Center is that comedy, as an art form, deserves it,\u201d said Journey Gunderson, the center\u2019s executive director. \u201cBut for the residents of western New York and the people who live, work and play here, it offers hope of a revitalized community.\u201dIn order to succeed, however, the center will have to overcome its proximity to, well, nowhere. The nearest large city is Buffalo, some 75 minutes to the north by car. Cleveland is two hours to the west. Pittsburgh, to the south, is a little farther than that. And New York City? A little more than six hours by car, or about five days by foot.All told, Ms. Gunderson said that the center will need to attract 114,000 people a year, paying $18 to $20 admission, to break even; the current Lucy museum, a modest and somewhat musty institution, draws about 20,000.And the center will not focus on only one comedian: The plans are much more ambitious, including 37,000 square feet of interactive exhibits devoted to everything from late-night comedy to comedy as a means for social activism. Visitors will be given an electronic survey at the front door and be outfitted with devices that will tailor the experience of the museum to their individual comedic tastes, whether that be sitcoms, stand-up or sketch. There will be touch screens, a cash bar, and a so-called Blue Room \u2014 where exhibits will feature naughty and off-color comedy \u2014 as well as a virtual writers\u2019 room where visitors can pitch ideas, and, of course, have them shot down by virtual television executives.\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of studies showing that they are not moneymakers and do not return the government investment,\u201d Mr. McMahon said, likening such outlays of state funds to cities building stadiums or convention centers. He conceded that the comedy center would likely \u201clook nice, and have a gala opening,\u201d complete with celebrities and the governor. \u201cBut it\u2019s still unlikely to be something that turns around Jamestown,\u201d he added.City leaders beg to differ, saying that the impact on the city has already been felt, including the renovation of the train station and the opening of a new riverfront park. More than 200 construction jobs have been created \u2014 work on the site began in earnest last year \u2014 with some $17.5 million in wages generated.Mr. Teresi said that his city was actually the perfect location for a comedy Hall of Fame. \u201cAnthropologists have determined that the first human laugh occurred on these coordinates,\u201d he joked.And then, the mayor got serious.\u201cThe opportunity is here because the mother and queen of modern comedy took her first breaths here,\u201d Mr. Teresi said. \u201cShe\u2019s here in spirit, she was here in birth, she was here growing up. She\u2019s part of Jamestown and Jamestown is part of her. So what better place to have a tribute to comedy?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel Makes History in German Vote, but So Does Far Right", "Date": "2017-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Merkel and her center-right Christian Democrats won, the center held, but it was weakened. The results made clear that far-right populism \u2014 and anxieties over security and national identity \u2014 were far from dead in Europe.They also showed that Germany\u2019s mainstream parties were not immune to the same troubles that have afflicted mainstream parties across the Continent, from Italy to France to Britain.\u201cWe expected a better result, that is clear,\u201d Ms. Merkel said Sunday night. \u201cThe good thing is that we will definitely lead the next government.\u201dShe said that she would listen to those who voted for the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, and work to win them back \u201cby solving problems, by taking up their worries, partly also their fears, but above all by good politics.\u201dBut her comments seemed to augur a shift to the right and more of an emphasis on controls over borders, migration and security.Despite her victory, Ms. Merkel and her conservatives cannot lead alone, making it probable that the chancellor\u2019s political life in her fourth term will be substantially more complicated.The shape and policies of a new governing coalition will involve weeks of painstaking negotiations. Smiling, Ms. Merkel said Sunday night that she hoped to have a new government \u201cby Christmas.\u201dThe center-left Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel\u2019s coalition partners for the last four years, ran a poor second to her center-right grouping, and the Social Democrats announced Sunday evening that the party would go into opposition, hoping to rebuild their political profile.But the step would also make sure that the AfD stays on the political sidelines and does not become the country\u2019s official opposition.The Alternative for Germany nonetheless vowed to shake the consensus politics of Germany, and in breaking a postwar taboo by entering Parliament, it already had.Angela Merkel won a fourth term on Sunday as German chancellor. Her longevity in power has helped her cement her formidable position in Europe.Alexander Gauland, one of AfD\u2019s leaders, told party supporters after the results that in Parliament: \u201cWe will go after them. We will claim back our country.\u201dTo cheers, he said: \u201cWe did it. We are in the German Parliament and we will change Germany.\u201dBurkhard Schr\u00f6der, an AfD member since 2014 from D\u00fcsseldorf, was ecstatic. \u201cWe are absolutely euphoric here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a strong victory for us that has weakened Angela Merkel.\u201dUp to 700 protesters gathered outside the AfD\u2019s election night party, chanting slogans like \u201cAll of Berlin, hate the AfD.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important to show that it\u2019s not normal that a neofascist party got into the German Parliament,\u201d said Dirk Schuck, 41, a political scientist at the University of Leipzig.The election is a remarkable capstone for Ms. Merkel, 63, the first East German and the first woman to become chancellor.It also represents a vindication of her pragmatic leadership and confidence in her stewardship of Europe\u2019s largest economy and of the European Union itself in the face of populism, challenges from Russia and China and uncertainty created by the unpredictable policies of President Trump.Even so, the advance of the far right was a cold slap for her and the Christian Democratic Union, or CDU. The AfD made particular inroads in the former East Germany but also in Bavaria, where Ms. Merkel\u2019s sister party, the Christian Social Union, or CSU, has long led but lost some 10 percent of its vote over 2013.Horst Seehofer, the CSU leader, said, \u201cWe made the mistake of having the right flank open.\u201dA critic of Ms. Merkel\u2019s immigration policies, he added, \u201cWe have a vacuum on the right, we will close it with politics that ensure Germany remains Germany.\u201dMr. Seehofer echoed that insight Sunday night. But others cautioned calm.\u201cWe will remember today in history,\u201d said Thomas Heilmann, a member of Parliament from the CDU, in an email interview. \u201cAs in the U.S., hate became part of politics. The CDU cannot and must not match this attitude.\u201dGoverning Germany \u201cwill become more difficult,\u201d Mr. Heilmann added. \u201cIt is definitely not a good day for Germany and most likely not good for Europe either.\u201dClemens Fuest, the director of IFO, the Institute for Economic Research in Munich, said that the results showed wide concern about \u201csecurity, immigration and possible challenges to the German economic model, like globalization.\u201dThese mattered more than the Social Democrats\u2019 concentration on injustice and inequality, he said.The other parties should make less of the AfD showing \u201cand instead ask themselves what questions they have not answered\u201d \u2014 questions of borders, migration and the pressures on Germany to do more to prop up other countries of the European Union.Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc won some 32.9 percent of the vote, sharply down from 41.5 percent in 2013, the early results showed.The Social Democrats slumped to 20.8 percent, a new postwar low, down from 25.7 percent four years ago.If the Social Democrats hold to their intention to go into opposition, Ms. Merkel will be faced with an unusually difficult task to form a working coalition. Given the numbers, it would seem that she will have to cobble together her own Christian Democrat-Christian Social Union bloc together with two other parties.The potential new partners inhabit virtually opposite poles on the political spectrum \u2014 the pro-business Free Democrats, who won some 10.4 percent of the vote, and the left-leaning pro-environment Greens, who won about 9 percent.At the Christian Democrat headquarters, Frank Wexler, a Berliner, called the results \u201ca bit depressing.\u201dGrand coalitions had allowed the small parties to gain ground, he said. \u201cThe main parties are getting smaller,\u201d Mr. Wexler said. To counteract the AfD, he said, \u201cWe need to address the issue of strengthening the borders.\u201dBut Mr. Wexler said he was most disturbed by the AfD\u2019s hostility to the European Union. \u201cThis is what Germany needs to do \u2014 be a strong leader in Europe.\u201dBut Hans Kundnani, an expert on Germany with the German Marshall Fund, said that Ms. Merkel might fail to create the three-party coalition, putting the Social Democrats under great pressure to join another coalition rather than forcing new elections.To Mr. Kundnani, \u201cthe big shock is not the AfD,\u201d but the loss of support for Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the increasing fragmentation of German political life.Germany has a complicated system of proportional representation, in which each voter casts one ballot for a local representative and one ballot for a political party. Those elected locally get their seats.But the parties\u2019 overall share of seats in parliament is determined by the percentage of votes they win. Turnout was 75.9 percent, up from 71.5 percent in 2013, but a long way from the 90 percent turnout figures of the 1980s.Though initially reluctant to run for a fourth term, Ms. Merkel threw herself into the campaign, especially as the government has brought some order to the chaos engendered in 2015 when she threw the country\u2019s borders open to refugees and migrants.But the backlash over the migrant crisis, coupled with her long period in office and the wishy-washy nature of grand coalition politics, has led to more support for the more extreme, anti-European parties like the AfD and The Left, the heir of the East German Communist Party, which came in third in 2013 and won about 9 percent of the vote on Sunday.In Dresden, Gert Fr\u00fclling, 75, a retiree, declined to divulge his party preference, but made it clear that he was sympathetic to some of the Alternative for Germany\u2019s proposals.\u201cIt all happened too fast,\u201d he said, referring to the time after Germany\u2019s reunification. \u201cDresden is a city of bureaucrats and soldiers, and they dumped all this multiculturalism on us at once. I know we had to change, but it should have happened more gradually.\u201dHe said it would be wrong for other parties to refuse to work with the AfD in Parliament. \u201cIf they present good ideas,\u201d he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s not fair to boycott them.\u201dIn Neustadt, a gentrifying area of Dresden, Rebecca Klingenburg, 20, was clearly excited to be one of an estimated three million first-time voters.\u201cOne gets to decide on what country one wants to live,\u201d she said. A mechanical-engineering student, Ms. Klingenburg said she was voting to maintain Germany\u2019s orientation toward Europe, at a time of rising nationalism.\u201cI learned four languages in school,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to make sure that we stay internationally oriented.\u201dAn earlier version of a capsule summary for this article misstated the number of postwar chancellors who have won four national elections in Germany. Angela Merkel is the third to do so, not the fourth.Reporting was contributed by Jack Ewing, Edmund Heaphy and Victor Homola from Berlin and Christopher F. Schuetze from Dresden.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Could We Lose if a NASA Climate Mission Goes Dark?", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "FeatureResearchers are racing to replace the pioneering Grace satellites, which are threatened by both dying batteries and Trump-era budget cuts.Supported byThis array of American satellites, comprising dozens of NOAA and NASA missions, is the product of some 40 years of experimentation and investment on the part of the federal government. They\u2019re joined in their orbit by weather and climate satellites from scientific agencies in Europe and Asia, along with a host of satellite-borne sensors from both the private sector and the military, that measure everything from air pollution to land development to agriculture. Without question, we\u2019re living at the start of a dark era of warming climates. But we\u2019re also living in a golden age of environmental data, in which our technology in space can deliver surprising measurements with profound implications. After a big hurricane like Harvey or Irma dumps extraordinary amounts of water on a region, for instance, a pair of NASA satellites known as Grace, which is short for Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, is able to assess how much water floods in and how it dissipates as the storm recedes. This has been merely one of their functions. Grace\u2019s two spacecraft have been circling Earth every 90 minutes for the past 15 years at an altitude of 300 miles or so. On a dark, clear night, you can sometimes look up and see them for a brief moment: two bright, blurry dots, rushing by at a velocity of about 17,200 miles per hour. They chase each other around the sky, one pursuing the other like cat and mouse (hence their nicknames, Tom and Jerry). By monitoring how their positions in space are affected by gravity, the scientists at NASA can draw a number of conclusions about what\u2019s happening on Earth, especially to our freshwater resources.Yet Grace also illustrates how tenuous the golden age of data really is. The two craft, which were launched in 2002, were originally expected to orbit the planet for five years. They are now dying, and in fact the batteries on one of the satellites are so depleted that it periodically goes to sleep. Since 2010, NASA has been planning and building replacements, and if all goes well, they will be in orbit early next year. But if Grace goes dark or perishes before then, there will be a break in NASA\u2019s continuous observation of Earth\u2019s gravity field and water dynamics. Climate researchers will be confronted with what\u2019s known as a \u201cdata gap,\u201d which can leave them at a loss for drawing scientific conclusions about environmental trends.This sort of gap has threatened to become a more common problem in recent months. The federal government\u2019s entire climate-science enterprise, much of it linked to NASA\u2019s satellite research, is under duress. The most prominent of the Trump administration\u2019s related proposals was a request to cut 31 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget; later, pages featuring global-warming data were removed from E.P.A. websites. But the proposed reductions for NOAA and NASA were similarly drastic. The White House asked that NASA drop four climate-related missions in its Earth-sciences division, which accounts for about 10 percent of NASA\u2019s $19 billion annual budget. It also unveiled a plan to cut 18 percent from NOAA\u2019s annual spending on satellites, which would force a huge reduction in the agency\u2019s climate work.At this point, an ax has been sharpened but not yet swung. In the coming weeks, as the 2018 budget is debated in Congress, the two chambers will try to work out a deal. If the House gets its way \u2014 it has mostly endorsed the White House plan and calls for reducing NASA\u2019s Earth-sciences budget by $217 million, while the Senate has proposed restoring the cuts \u2014 missions will most likely be scuttled and holes will open in the data-collection records. Even if our science agencies avoid the worst, however, the Trump administration\u2019s intent to slash funding on technology that helps make planetary surveys possible \u2014 much of it obscure to the public \u2014 signals an embattled future for this type of research.The effects are hard to predict. Most of our climatic and meteorological information shares a common origin, even when it seems to come from the Weather Channel or CNN. \u201cThe monitoring of the atmosphere, of the surface of the Earth, of what\u2019s going on in the ocean and under the ice \u2014 all of that is overwhelmingly funded by the federal government,\u201d John Holdren, President Obama\u2019s chief science adviser and a Harvard professor of environmental science and policy, told me recently. While some of this information is made familiar to us \u2014 the unending stream of satellite images on TV as Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston \u2014 some of it is experimental and unknown outside scientific circles. That sort of data comes from missions like Grace, funded in the belief that a risky idea might turn up something valuable for human understanding or even, in the case of climate change, for human survival.The reason for wanting precise gravity measurements was practical as well as scientific. The gravitational pull on an object can be greater where Earth\u2019s mass is denser \u2014 above mountain ranges like the Rockies or Alps, say, or over vast ice sheets like Antarctica\u2019s. The resulting variations in gravity have subtle but important effects on the paths of ballistic missiles, for example, which the Defense Department cares deeply about. \u201cYou want to be able to predict where they\u2019re going to fly and exactly where they\u2019re going,\u201d Mike Watkins, the director of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the original project scientist on Grace, told me. Starting in the 1970s, Watkins said, oceanographers were also trying to map the surface of the ocean, an effort complicated by the fact that the gravitational effects of features far beneath the surface \u2014 like deep trenches, submerged mountain ranges and lost continents that slid under Earth\u2019s crust billions of years ago \u2014 are constantly distorting the sea level above.By the time of the Williamstown conference, satellite observations of Earth, which were beginning to be referred to as \u201cremote sensing,\u201d seemed enormously promising. Researchers and mapmakers had been collecting aerial images since the 1840s, usually from balloons, but remote sensing advanced drastically using cameras on aircraft during World Wars I and II, and then later still on U-2 planes that began conducting detailed military surveys in the late 1950s. In the 1960s, NASA and other government agencies started launching Earth-orbiting satellites to study weather patterns, ocean circulation and agriculture. By the late 1970s, some of them, with names like Landsat and Seasat, carried sophisticated microwave and laser instruments and imaging equipment.A few of these satellites fulfilled the recommendations laid out at Williamstown. Subsequent missions took their cue from an expanded vision for Earth observations put forward by NASA administrators in the 1980s. One of their reports presciently urged that scientists focus on how human activity was warming the planet, noting that \u201cthe burning of oil and coal is injecting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at unprecedented and accelerating rates.\u201d Eventually, the NASA directives of the 1980s led to a number of satellites that were deployed in the 1990s and early 2000s, like Aqua, Terra, Aura and ICESat. Some of these missions are still orbiting and considered vital to Earth observations. Byron Tapley, the director of the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas at Austin, told me that during this era he worked on various NASA satellite efforts that would have measured Earth\u2019s gravity field, but none of them made it to launch. That changed with the proposal for Grace, which was written in large part by Tapley\u2019s former student from Austin, Mike Watkins, who had gone to work at J.P.L. NASA gave the go-ahead in 1997. \u201cThat was the last piece of the puzzle from Williamstown,\u201d said Tapley, who was named the principal investigator \u2014 in effect, the research leader \u2014 of the project.The goal for Grace was to produce an unprecedentedly accurate reading of Earth\u2019s gravity field. But early on, Watkins began to think that its two craft could also register details on what\u2019s known as variable gravity, which mostly depends on the way water moves around the world under the influence of seasonal changes, droughts and other climate factors. Where there\u2019s more water in one place, there\u2019s more gravitational pull; where there\u2019s less water, there\u2019s less pull. A good illustration of the satellite\u2019s promise had to do with the problem of measuring variation in the world\u2019s great ice caps. When the first Grace satellite approached, say, the Greenland ice sheet, which weighs about three quadrillion tons, the craft would presumably respond to the subtle gravitational tug and be pulled slightly forward and away from its trailing partner. The distance between them \u2014 137 miles or so \u2014 might increase by less than a human hair. But because the twin spacecraft were in constant contact with each other through a microwave communication link, that change could still be measured precisely. And it could be measured over and over again, month after month, year after year. If the ice on Greenland kept pouring into the ocean, scientists could convert that remote measurement into a calculation of ice loss. In this respect, Grace would be unlike so many other satellites: It wouldn\u2019t render beautiful images of our planet from space. Its movement \u2014 or more exactly, its change in movement from one month to the next \u2014 would itself create the measurement.In the mid-1990s, Watkins and his colleagues started to do detailed simulations. \u201cWe wondered: How much can we measure changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets? How well can we measure aquifer changes in groundwater? And we started to realize that this was the thing that was really going to break the mission wide open.\u201d The proposal he wrote expressed confidence that they could get a measurement for the planet\u2019s gravity field, but as Watkins recalled, it also hinted, \u201cHere\u2019s this other supercool thing we can do.\u201dGrace was authorized during an era at NASA, the late 1990s, when some science missions were approved on the condition that they satisfy an agency directive to be \u201cfaster, better, cheaper.\u201d The joke at NASA at the time was that you get only two out of the three. What ultimately made Grace possible was a cost-sharing partnership struck between American scientists and the German Research Center for Geosciences and the German space agency. The German contribution was to pay for a launch vehicle and conduct the mission operations. \u201cWe worked with a German company that\u2019s now part of Airbus on the design of the satellite, and J.P.L. did most of the instrumentation,\u201d Watkins explained. By the time of the launch, the cost amounted to $97 million for NASA and about $30 million for Germany.The German team secured a Russian rocket, and Grace was sent into space from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, a launchpad about 500 miles north of Moscow, on March 17, 2002. The two spacecraft \u2014 looking like oversize gold bars, each about the size of a small automobile \u2014 moved into orbit and, using onboard tanks of nitrogen for acceleration and positioning, eventually achieved the necessary 137 miles of separation. The satellites travel in a circumpolar orbit, meaning that instead of tracing the Equator they fly on a path that we might consider northerly, cruising over the poles. They soon began transmitting measurements several times per day, often to a ground station in Svalbard, in the Arctic Ocean north of Norway. From there, the information was routed to the German science team, near Munich, and to the engineers at J.P.L. In those early days, as the raw data about gravity fields began coming back \u2014 data no one had ever really seen before \u2014 scientists didn\u2019t immediately gape in wonder. Mostly they scratched their heads and tried to figure out what to make of it.The \u201cE\u201d in Grace may stand for \u201cexperiment,\u201d but the project produced useful data fairly quickly. Measuring the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets was a case in point. For most of the 20th century, one of the essential questions bedeviling glaciologists was how sea levels and coastlines could be affected by the fluctuations in the size of these ice caps. As a 1985 NASA report put it, \u201cDespite 25 years of intensive fieldwork in Greenland and Antarctica, and the expenditure of billions of dollars, we are still unable to answer the most fundamental glaciological question: Are the polar ice sheets growing or shrinking?\u201d In the 1990s, researchers tried various methods on the ground to record the height of the Greenland ice sheet from year to year to determine its loss or gain. But Grace promised a different, and previously impossible, kind of calculation.In 2006, Isabella Velicogna and John Wahr, both at the University of Colorado at Boulder, published two studies that interpreted the first few years of Grace data; their initial paper was about Antarctica\u2019s loss of ice, while the second was about Greenland\u2019s, which appeared to be losing at least 100 billion tons per year. Some scientists were awe-struck. \u201cI remember reading their first paper, and I literally couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Berrien Moore, a dean at the University of Oklahoma who has worked on NASA missions on and off for several decades. \u201cA quantitative measure of a mass change from year to year? It was just unheard-of.\u201d Velicogna, now a professor at the University of California at Irvine and a J.P.L. scientist, told me that the Grace measurements didn\u2019t suddenly make field studies of individual glaciers less important \u2014 her data couldn\u2019t tell scientists why the ice sheet was losing mass. But they allowed her to systematically account for drastic losses in places so far-flung that they were almost impossible for human beings to reach, like parts of Greenland and West Antarctica. What\u2019s more, the measurements enabled glaciologists to look at the decline of massive mountain glaciers, like those in Central Asia, which are a critical resource for regional water supplies. As Velicogna noted, those glaciers \u201ccould mean the difference between life and death in those places.\u201d They can also lead to profound geopolitical conflicts. Grace soon indicated that many were shrinking.Similar changes began to be revealed in the world\u2019s hidden aquifers. Jay Famiglietti, a hydrologist at J.P.L. who focuses on tracking changes in groundwater \u2014 water stored in underground aquifers around the world \u2014 worked as a professor at the University of Texas at Austin in the late 1990s. Back then, a typical way to study aquifers was to monitor wells in the field. When Famiglietti was invited to meetings in Austin to hear about what Watkins and Tapley were planning, he told me: \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it would work. They were all talking about how we\u2019re going to be able to see groundwater. I thought, these guys are nuts.\u201d As the data began coming in, however, Famiglietti found that Grace could measure groundwater with astounding effectiveness. He came up with a nickname for Grace \u2014 \u201cthe scale in the sky\u201d \u2014 and began tracking California\u2019s water supplies during what eventually became a decade of unrelenting drought.One of Grace\u2019s shortcomings is its limited resolution: It can map increases and losses in only large aquifers. Still, Famiglietti told me that from 2011 to 2015, California lost so much water every year \u2014 trillions of gallons \u2014 that it showed up clearly in the Grace measurements. About two-thirds of the losses appeared to be groundwater. He also noted that the satellites were able to capture a freshwater predicament bigger than California\u2019s. Before Grace, Famiglietti said, most of our knowledge about underground water reserves was a hodgepodge. \u201cWhat Grace added was a regional, global understanding \u2014 like, holy crap, this is happening all over the world.\u201d In 2015, Famiglietti\u2019s team used Grace to determine that more than half of the world\u2019s largest aquifers were \u201cpast sustainability tipping points.\u201d They were being depleted significantly faster than they were being replenished. The Arabian Aquifer System, on which 60 million people rely, appeared severely overstressed; so did water reserves in northwestern India and northern Africa.Beyond showing declines in the world\u2019s ice sheets and aquifers, Grace clarified the factors influencing the rise in sea levels. In the early 1990s, NASA began putting a succession of Earth satellites into orbit, the most recent being NOAA\u2019s Jason-3, that use a tool called a radar altimeter to measure the ocean\u2019s surface, which has been rising by an eighth of an inch per year since 1993. But in a warming world, sea levels increase for two distinct reasons. The first is that the ocean expands as it gains heat: It just gets bigger. The second is that ice sheets and glaciers melt and break into the ocean. \u201cWith an altimetric measure like Jason,\u201d Felix Landerer, a J.P.L. Earth scientist, told me, \u201cyou know the height change of the ocean, but you don\u2019t know really what\u2019s causing it.\u201d How much is from heat expansion, in other words, and how much is because of the displacement caused by more ice? Grace, however, constantly weighs the oceans, which makes it possible to determine how much water is pouring into them from melting ice and other sources.Landerer showed me a video he had just made from Grace data. It showed losses on the Greenland ice sheet from 2002 to 2016. A map of Greenland was white, and the areas with the biggest declines grew yellow and then dark brown and then black with each passing year. Since about 2008, the ice loss has totaled nearly 300 billion tons annually. To watch the progression was to see the entire southeast and southwest coasts of Greenland become increasingly dark over the course of a decade. The ice sheet looked like a piece of paper burning from the edges.The goal of remote sensing, as Landerer\u2019s map demonstrates, is not merely to measure unmeasured aspects of the planet. It\u2019s to measure them nonstop, ideally for decades on end, so that long-term trends can be identified in a notoriously chaotic and variable natural world. This is why recent calls in Washington to defund some satellite missions rattled so many of the NASA scientists I spoke with. The end of a mission means the data stream will stop or pause, and a gap in the data makes it more difficult to infer whether the melting of an ice sheet or the loss of water from an aquifer is accelerating. Just as crucially, a gap can interrupt a long series of observations that allow researchers to understand future events. \u201cFrom the perspective of Earth scientists,\u201d Watkins told me, \u201cyou need to understand the system so that you can then model that system physically and make forecasts with some skill.\u201d In the case of Grace, such observations could help predict the future of Greenland\u2019s ice, as well as California\u2019s water.In the event of a drastic scaling back of our Earth-sciences efforts, is it possible that other countries \u2014 China, Japan, India, the nations of Europe \u2014 would step up their satellite investments? \u201cThey\u2019re a valuable complement,\u201d Waleed Abdalati, a professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder and former chief scientist at NASA, told me. \u201cBut to really understand these processes requires more than any one nation can do, and the U.S. has really been the leader. And to say that other nations can pick up the slack is not really accurate.\u201d Stopgap solutions don\u2019t look so promising, either. While Gov. Jerry Brown of California has vowed that his state would send up its own climate-research satellites, the logistics and financial costs \u2014 climate satellites now usually require half a billion dollars and a decade to plan, build and launch \u2014 would prove formidable, even if backed by California voters. Private-sector satellite companies have in recent years been expanding the business of collecting and selling Earth observational data, but it\u2019s very unlikely that such firms (or a group of tech philanthropists) could adequately replace NASA\u2019s work. \u201cThese are projects that are too expensive or require a large and diverse group of collaborators that can only be assembled as an international project,\u201d said Rush Holt, a former Democratic congressman who is now the head of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. \u201cOr this is work that has to be sustained for a longer period of time than any board of directors from a private company would consider, because it\u2019s not clear enough that it would produce a return on investment in anyone\u2019s lifetime.\u201d That explains why the government\u2019s involvement in basic research, going back at least to the late 1940s, was premised on the idea that it fills a role that would not be filled otherwise. As one scientist put it to me, If the government thinks a project is too long-term to make it worth funding, no other organization is going to pay for it either.Grace, as one of those long missions, has enjoyed some good fortune: Its durability has exceeded expectations, and thanks to international partnerships it has almost certainly dodged contemporary political disruptions. What\u2019s less fortunate, though, is Grace\u2019s current death spiral. Over the past year, a soft-spoken engineer at J.P.L. named Rob Gaston has been focused on extending Grace\u2019s life as long as possible. When I visited him at his office in the spring, he explained that the batteries were already failing and that the fuel, which made adjustments in orientation possible, was nearly exhausted. Another problem was its distance from Earth. \u201cYou don\u2019t think about it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s actually atmosphere at that altitude, and even though it\u2019s very thin, it does create some friction on a satellite. And it does cause the orbit to degrade.\u201d Even if Grace\u2019s depleted batteries allow it to function for the next few months, its physical demise is approaching; it will begin when the satellites fall to 186 miles in altitude. At the beginning of September, Gaston updated me: Grace was at 201 miles and dropping about 250 feet per day.For almost a decade, the fear has been that Grace will die before a replacement mission could sustain its data stream. Tapley, the lead investigator, recalled that in 2010 his team settled on replicating Grace precisely rather than building a more sophisticated and expensive improvement. \u201cWe decided we want to get the follow-on as quick as we can,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to break the timeline. We\u2019ll use a cookie-cutter approach. And let\u2019s see if we can get the Germans to partner with us again.\u201d In fact, the proposed model wasn\u2019t called Grace-2 \u2014 that was the souped-up version \u2014 but Grace-FO, for Grace Follow-On. The team received a green light from NASA, and after striking a deal with several German science agencies, the design and contracting began in 2012. This time, though, the process would not be \u201cbetter, faster cheaper\u201d \u2014 not when it would require about $450 million from NASA and roughly $100 million from Germany.It\u2019s possible that some policy edict could curtail the planned satellite mission \u2014 the recent Trump budget proposal, for instance, made the unusual request of turning off the Earth sensors on an orbiting spacecraft, Dscovr, to save $1.2 million. To Tapley\u2019s great relief, though, German engineers will maintain Grace\u2019s operations (and the European Space Agency is now contributing financial support). He pointed out to me that his goal going back to the 1960s has been to create an instrument to measure Earth\u2019s gravity as precisely, and for as long, as it could be measured; for him today, this means thinking beyond Grace-FO and ahead to the more advanced Grace-2, a project now being discussed. He did not think he would see it through, because he is 84, but he thought he could help it begin. \u201cI am worried,\u201d he told me. \u201cNot so much worried about Grace-FO, because the satellites are built, and it isn\u2019t NASA dollars that are launching it \u2014 it\u2019s German.\u201d And it would be a surprising thing if it failed to proceed, he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m very worried about the future, both for NASA as a whole and the Earth sciences in particular.\u201dI asked Tapley what we wouldn\u2019t know if Grace had never existed. \u201cAn awful lot,\u201d he said. We wouldn\u2019t have the same sense of how steadily the ice sheets are melting \u2014 \u201cand we would have no clue how much of the sea-level rise is temperature-related and how much is coming from land ice.\u201d We wouldn\u2019t be able to interpret the losses of various mountain glaciers and the changes to aquifers in Texas and California. Above all, we would lack an enhanced sense of how Earth works, how its masses of water flow from land to ocean in ways never witnessed or understood before. All this has taken money, but also time. Indeed, it has taken Tapley\u2019s entire life.You might think it would be easy to recreate a satellite you\u2019ve already made before. But an engineering team tasked with designing and building a new spacecraft can\u2019t easily replicate something that was constructed in a different technological era. Mike Gross, now the deputy project manager for Grace-FO, suggested it would be akin to building an iPhone 1 \u2014 but doing so in 2017. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to take parts for an iPhone 6 or 7 and try to rebuild an iPhone 1,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d want all the parts from an iPhone 1 to build it.\u201d But the exact parts that went into making the iPhone 1 no longer exist. Nor do the parts that made up the original Grace. Old contractors are gone; old materials have been altered and improved.The J.P.L. and German teams both began their work by consulting old blueprints. The new satellite models were to be assembled at an Airbus factory in Germany, with the manufacturing of parts and instruments contracted out to as many of the original suppliers as possible, in Denmark, France, Italy, Spain and the United States. The \u201ccookie-cutter approach\u201d that Tapley described made sense from a science perspective, because the most important thing about Grace-FO is to get the kind of data that Grace is now collecting. If you build a different spacecraft \u2014 one that\u2019s bigger, or shaped a hairbreadth differently, or made from different materials \u2014 it could introduce all sorts of errors and complications. In short, the new spacecraft must function precisely as Grace does and look just like Grace. \u201cBut that\u2019s where the rub came in,\u201d explained Phil Morton, the project manager. The new satellite could not actually be Grace.At the time of my visit, the satellites were essentially finished. Over the course of several months, they would be exposed to vacuum tests that simulated the airlessness and low temperatures of space and to vibration and acoustic tests that mimic the shaking and caterwaul of an actual launch. If all went according to plan, before the end of the year they would return to California and be installed within a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that would take off from Vandenberg Air Force Base, northwest of Los Angeles. The launch date, Webb said, would most likely be in early 2018.Listening to Webb walk me through the interior, part by part, the complexity and engineering seemed considerable. Communication links so the twins can talk with each other and with Earth. Accelerometers to measure forces felt by the satellites. Star cameras to point at the sky for orientation. There were computers, horn antennas and tanks for the nitrogen thrusters that would enable the spacecraft to swap places every few years to minimize wear and tear. There were heating pads to ensure that the interior would stay at a comfortable 68 degrees, even as the satellite\u2019s outside panels chill in Earth\u2019s shadow (to minus 75 degrees) and heat up in the sun\u2019s glare (to 250 degrees). The list went on. \u201cThe original Grace satellites are not nearly as dense in electronics as these are,\u201d Webb remarked, almost apologetically, adding that each craft had gained a few hundred pounds since the last version, largely because they now included a new, experimental laser system. The weight of each original satellite was about 1,000 pounds. \u201cNow we\u2019re at roughly 600 kilos,\u201d Gath added, or just over 1,300 pounds.The extra weight would not be a problem, he assured me, because the engineers had found ways to accommodate it. And before we left the room in Munich, Gath also let me know that while the satellites had been built separately, \u201cthey will stay together from now on.\u201d I found this reassuring. It was as though the two spacecraft were the kind of close companions that would need each other\u2019s support to endure a difficult set of circumstances, which in a sense they will. Whatever the larger fate of our climate research, if you assume a safe deployment for Grace-FO, the twins might circle Earth together for two billion miles or so, measuring the subtle gravitational tug of our water much as their predecessors have, until their orbits drop and drop and then drop so much that both burn up and vanish. And at that far-off point \u2014 assuming that there is still the will to spend the money and keep taking the measure of the planet \u2014 the whole process would begin again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Does the Hamptons Garden Grow? With a Lot of Paid Help", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEAST HAMPTON, N.Y. \u2014 The rigors of vegetable gardening, for most people, are humble and gritty: planting, weeding, dirtying knees, working up a sweat and maybe straining a back muscle or two.But here on the gilded acres of Long Island\u2019s East End, a different skill set often applies: hiring a landscape architect to design the garden, a gardener and crew to plant and pamper the beds, and sometimes even a chef to figure out what to do with the bushels of fresh produce. All that\u2019s left is to pick the vegetables \u2014 though employees frequently do that, too.\u201cAnd it is not the plants that are driving the cost,\u201d Mr. Gunn said. One 2015 project of his in Southampton with a six-figure price tag includes an underground irrigation system, a potting shed, an orchard and a meadow for a cutting garden. Many gardens require expensive hedges or other barriers to protect them from ocean winds and the ubiquitous deer.The bespoke vegetable garden, these days almost always organic, has become a particular object of desire in the Hamptons. More clients have commissioned elaborate gardens this summer than ever before, say members of the support staffs who toil on them.\u201cI put in 10 by July,\u201d said Charles R. Dayton, the owner of an East Hampton landscaping company whose ancestors have owned and worked land here since 1640. \u201cI get a kick out of it.\u201dAbout 500 farms remain on the fertile East End, even as more mansions crop up each summer on former potato fields. And the kitchen garden has been a tradition on Long Island estates since the 19th century. But today, growing your own produce is a much different enterprise on what has become some of the world\u2019s most expensive real estate.Two landscape architects said clients this summer had asked that their vegetables be picked, packaged and put on the Hampton Jitney for use in city kitchens. (The cost, $25 to $50 a parcel, is often more than for a passenger.) One gardener, Charlene Babinski, said she had installed a \u201cjuicing garden\u201d for her client\u2019s favorite liquid diets.Then there are the hostess gifts and holiday honey for guests. \u201cOne client asked me to make 27 baskets of vegetables to give to her friends,\u201d said Paul Hamilton, a Montauk farmer who plants and maintains seven luxe gardens.What\u2019s driving the gardening bug among the affluent, gardeners say, is their clients\u2019 focus on \u201cself-care\u201d \u2014 a curious phrase for a pursuit that requires so much help. Mr. Gunn said the impulse includes a \u201cmoral component.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s so much wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Let\u2019s take something I\u2019ve been fortunate to have and put it back into the environment. I want to do something to reduce what I\u2019m taking.\u2019 \u201dBut others liken the professionally tended garden to a vintage car or a Hinckley yacht \u2014 yet another means of flaunting wealth.\u201cGod has given you too much money when you have someone else tend your vegetable garden,\u201d he said.\u201cWe feast here,\u201d Ms. Munroe said, gesturing toward the flower-fringed vegetable garden nestled on a rise overlooking Georgica Jetty, on West End Road in East Hampton. In addition to a pool and tennis court, the property includes a billiards terrace and croquet green; a hedge of Rosa rugosa protects the garden from winds.Mr. Hamilton plants, weeds, hand-waters and harvests the vegetable garden, while four other gardeners work on the remainder of the five-acre property, which has perennial beds, a meadow and woodland gardens designed by Ms. Munroe, who hosts self-guided tours.She is known to get her hands dirty. But when she arrives at the house for the weekend, there is often a basket brimming with the garden\u2019s harvest, arranged by Mr. Hamilton or the estate manager, Robert Deets.\u201cThere is no greater thing than eating produce that\u2019s still warm from the sun that has never seen a refrigerator,\u201d Ms. Munroe said.\u201cMy friends and I come here to play,\u201d Ms. Keitel said, standing next to a patch of blooming cardoons that resembled a Dr. Seuss creation. Ms. Keitel, who had a bat house and a bee pollinator installed near the former center court, cooks recipes like cucumber gazpacho, rainbow radishes with butter, and zucchini fritters with those friends.At the ivy-draped Further Lane home of Carole Olshan and her husband, Morton, Ms. Olshan said friends like to tour the vegetable garden designed and maintained by Mr. Hamilton and set off by a picket fence on meticulously landscaped grounds.She said Mr. Hamilton had expanded her botanical knowledge. \u201cWe can\u2019t call them weeds,\u201d she said with a chuckle. \u201cThey\u2019re native plants.\u201dThe family chef, John Hamilton (no relation to Paul), creates meals around the seasonal offerings that Paul Hamilton brings in from the garden. A recent lunch included golden and Chioggia beets, sliced cucumbers and wasabi caviar. \u201cI told Paul to cut the kale \u2014 so sick of it,\u201d Ms. Olshan said.\u201cI have control over the quality of the product with this garden,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get lots of heirloom products, but, if you put it on a rail car the week before you get it, it\u2019s not the same.\u201dAt his waterfront estate on Oregon Road in Cutchogue, on the North Fork, a hedge fund manager stocks a cold cellar and freezer with fingerling potatoes or sauces of Brandywine tomatoes from a large vegetable garden.\u201cI came out this morning, grabbed some shishito peppers and an onion for an omelet,\u201d the manager said. \u201cSo convenient.\u201dCooking the vegetables for her daughters and sharing the bounty with friends, she said, is \u201ca real treat for me.\u201d\u201cSometimes I bring produce to friends because I hate the idea of it not being used,\u201d she said, adding with a laugh, \u201cbut I don\u2019t do canning \u2014 that\u2019s not my jam.\u201dIf there is a gardener with star quality here, it may well be Paul Hamilton. The seven vegetable gardens he plants and maintains help supplement his other pursuits: playing guitar in a gypsy jazz band, surfing, and farming two acres that supply his clients and a stand in the Springs section of East Hampton, not far from Jackson Pollock\u2019s former home.Mr. Hamilton, 57, who looks a little like James Taylor, is something of a guru for his wealthy clients, but he has a low-key style. He works barefoot, sometimes in an unbuttoned, well-worn shirt, sometimes with the help of his two sons and stepdaughter. There\u2019s a palpable difference between his bohemian bearing and his bejeweled clients. But he accepts it pragmatically.\u201cLook, this is the economy out here,\u201d he said. \u201cThese projects, these houses, are how most of us make a living.\u201d With the blessing of those who hire him, he delivers surplus produce from their gardens to the East Hampton Senior Center.Teaching the next generation to appreciate growing one\u2019s own food is important for Ms. Babinski, a professional gardener whose family began operating a farm stand in Water Mill in the early 1970s.\u201cWhen a child pulls up a carrot from under the ground for the first time, you can\u2019t beat that smile,\u201d she said.But Ms. Babinski said she had seen the initial excitement of a vegetable garden fade for some clients.\u201cThey lose interest, though, after they\u2019re planted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing with the chickens. They say, \u2018I have to have chickens, so I can tell my friends,\u2019 but they end up giving the eggs to the help.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Tax Cut Would Benefit Wealthy and Corporations Most, Report Finds", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican tax plan promoted by President Trump this week as a middle-class tax cut would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans and businesses, according to an analysis released on Friday by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.The report, which is the first detailed assessment of the plan\u2019s financial impact, found that the average tax bill for all income groups would decline by $1,600, or 2.1 percent, in 2018. The biggest decrease would go to those with incomes above $730,000, who would see their after-tax incomes rise by an average of 8.5 percent, or about $129,000.Those in the middle quintile \u2014 with incomes averaging $66,960 \u2014 would see their after-tax income rise by 1.2 percent or about $660.The breakdown is based on the framework released by the \u201cBig Six\u201d group of Republican lawmakers and administration officials this week, which did not include many details that could change the distributional impact. For instance, the plan called for an increase in the child tax credit but did not specify how much it would rise and whether it would be across income groups. The plan also opened the door for adding a fourth, higher tax bracket for the richest Americans, which would also change the distributional impact if enacted.Still, even with those changes, the report makes clear that the plan may not be the salve for the middle class that Mr. Trump has been pitching.The plan would provide enormous benefits to corporate America, with a $2.6 trillion cut in business taxes. Individual income tax revenue would actually increase by $470 billion, largely as a result of changes in personal deductions and exemptions as well as an increase in the bottom tax rate to 12 percent from 10 percent.The major findings in a preliminary analysis of the House Republican tax plan.\u201cTax collections would shift dramatically from businesses to individuals,\u201d said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center.The loss of deductions would hit the upper middle class the most, and more than a third of the taxpayers who earn $150,000 to $300,000 could see their taxes go up next year, the report found. They would be hit particularly hard by the repeal of the state and local tax deduction.Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, said on Thursday that the typical American family making $100,000 per year would probably get a $1,000 tax cut next year. He suggested this would stimulate the economy as people put their additional money toward expenditures like kitchen renovations and buying new cars.The Tax Policy Center estimates the plan will cost $2.4 trillion over a decade. Republicans are counting on a surge of economic growth to pay for their tax plan and the Tax Policy Center analysis does not account for those \u201cdynamic\u201d effects. However, the group\u2019s analysts said that its previous studies of recent Republican tax plans showed little impact from growth on revenues, largely because of the likelihood that deficits would lead to higher interest rates.Many aspects of the Republican plan are being left to Congress to decide. Thus far the proposal would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and create a new 25 percent tax rate for \u201cpass through\u201d businesses such as partnerships, sole proprietorships and family farms.It would also lower the top individual tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, while raising the bottom rate to 12 percent from 10 percent as it also doubles the standard deduction. The plan would eliminate many corporate \u201cloopholes\u201d and deductions, such as the state and local tax deduction. But it would also get rid of many provisions that are currently costly to the rich, like the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see if you continue to have those provisions in a tax proposal that it doesn\u2019t benefit high income individuals and households disproportionately,\u201d said Mark J. Mazur, director of the Tax Policy Center and a former assistant secretary for tax policy at the Treasury Department.Eliminating some of the more costly tax measures would make it impossible for Republicans to enact the deep cuts to tax rates that they are trying to achieve. Repealing personal exemptions, which diminishes the impact of doubling the standard deduction, for example, raises $1.5 trillion. Getting rid of the state and local deduction raises $1.3 trillion in revenue over 10 years.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of cuts in business taxes under the plan. The figure is $2.6 trillion, not $2.6 billion.Advertisement"}

And because 12 other states now follow California\u2019s standards, the state finds itself in an extraordinary position to stage a regulatory mutiny of sorts \u2014 with much of the country\u2019s car market in tow.\u201cWe\u2019re standing firm. We\u2019re prepared to sue. We\u2019re prepared to do what we need to do,\u201d Ms. Nichols said in a recent interview. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201dStill, the auto industry has hardly conceded defeat, several industry officials said. The car companies are urging California to negotiate a loosening of the current standards.To understand why California has long blazed the trail for the rest of the country in air quality, gaze down from the hills above Turnbull Canyon at the Los Angeles haze.But California\u2019s smog was once much worse.The state moved quickly to regulate the obvious sources, like factory smoke stacks, steel mills and coal power plants. Yet the acrid smog persisted.When Congress established the E.P.A. in 1970 and passed the Clean Air Act later that year, California was granted a waiver to follow air pollution rules it had already established.In facing off with the auto industry, Ms. Nichols has harnessed a similar passion.No matter that Ms. Nichols, a former environmental lawyer and Wall Street Journal reporter who is known to keep a grueling schedule shuttling between CARB\u2019s Sacramento headquarters and her Los Angeles home, was nursing a cold and \u201ccould barely croak.\u201d\u201cWhat were you thinking when you threw yourselves upon the mercy of the Trump administration to try to solve your problems?\u201d she scolded. \u201cLet\u2019s take action today, and let\u2019s move on.\u201dA clean-car evangelist, she is often seen driving around Los Angeles, where she lives, in her zero-emissions Honda Fit in \u201celectric violet blue.\u201d (She recently leased a second vehicle, a Toyota Mirai, a zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cell car, also in blue.)In a compromise, the automakers agreed to the program, provided that the standards for the later years \u2014 2022-25 \u2014 would be subject to a midterm review.For a meaningful reprieve, however, automakers need Ms. Nichols on board. If CARB does not sign onto the reopened review, the automakers face the prospect of separate rules for California and its follower states \u2014 a coalition that covers more than 130 million residents and more than a third of the vehicle market in the United States.Ms. Nichols is not budging. At the first public hearing on the reopened midterm review last week, CARB\u2019s emissions compliance chief, Annette Hebert, threatened to abandon the review if the E.P.A. took steps to weaken the emissions standards.\u201cPulling that waiver would be like declaring an all-out war on California,\u201d he said.Over the years, CARB has expanded its reach, regulating products as diverse as lawn mowers and bulldozers, air fresheners, paint thinners and even hair and bug spray. It has sent inspectors to Tokyo and Stuttgart, Germany, to monitor the testing of cars manufactured overseas. And it oversees a system of air-quality management districts across California that issue and enforce their own local regulations.Accusations of overreach exploded in 2015, when Mr. Brown made a push to require a 50 percent reduction in petroleum use in motor vehicles by 2030, with CARB managing the reduction. Republicans and even some Democrats balked at the plan, and an oil industry campaign warned that the law would vastly expand CARB\u2019s authority and could even lead to gas rationing.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.The governor eventually abandoned his push. He also signed legislation allowing the state Senate and Assembly to appoint one member each to the CARB board, enhancing lawmakers\u2019 control over the agency.CARB\u2019s Arie Jan Haagen-Smit Laboratory in El Monte, Calif., is a reminder of the resources at the agency\u2019s command.At the lab, 120 technicians measure emissions on new engines before they can be used in cars sold in California. They also pull cars from the road to make sure older models stay compliant. A failed test can delay certification, or in the case of an older model, an expensive recall.Even as CARB remains steadfast, however, Ms. Nichols is eager to persuade automakers that they ultimately stand to benefit from stricter fuel economy rules.Without an aggressive shift toward zero- and low-emissions cars, the American auto industry risks becoming a global laggard, Ms. Nichols said. It is no time, she said, to be meddling with standards already in place.\u201cWe want to start conversations about post-2025,\u201d Ms. Nichols said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re getting ready for.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

Thousands of workers have lost their jobs and moved on \u2014 leaving idled mines, abandoned homes and shuttered stores downtown.Now, though, new businesses are emerging. They are as varied as the layers of rock that surround a coal seam, but in a twist, a considerable number involve renewable energy. And past jobs in fossil fuels are proving to make for good training.Taken together, along with programs aimed at teaching computer coding or beekeeping, they show ways to ease the transition from fossil fuels to a more diverse energy mix \u2014 as well as the challenges.GILLETTE, Wyo. \u2014 John Davila, 61, worked for 20 years at Arch Coal\u2019s Black Thunder Mine in Eastern Wyoming, a battered titan from an industry whose importance to the region is easy to see \u2014 whether in the sign in the visitors\u2019 center window proclaiming, \u201cWyoming Coal: Proud to Provide America\u2019s Energy,\u201d or in the brimming train cars that rumble out of the Eagle Butte mine on the outskirts of town.But in April last year, at a regular crew meeting in the break room, he was among those whose envelope held a termination notice rather than a work assignment. \u201cThey called it a \u2018work force reduction,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Davila, whose straight, dark ponytail hangs down his back. \u201cNice way to put it, but it still means you\u2019re out of a job.\u201dSo a summertime Thursday morning found him, along with a couple of dozen other men and women, in a nondescript lecture room at a community college, learning how a different source of energy, wind, might make them proud, too.The program, which is to teach the basics of wind farm operation, maintenance and safety over two weeks in October, would cost the participants nothing but their time, organizers said. Those who wanted to test their potential would have a chance to climb a 250-foot tower that Saturday at a farm Goldwind owns in Montana. And if they completed the full program, they would have certifications that could open the door with any employer they chose.\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no catch \u2013 you don\u2019t like me, you don\u2019t like Goldwind, that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d David Halligan, the company\u2019s chief executive, told an even larger crowd in Casper the day before. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be opportunity across the country.\u201dIt is a message of hope that has been in short supply, especially after the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in the region and the bankruptcies last year of three major producers. But while coal\u2019s prospects have been dying down, wind development is poised to explode in the state, which has some of the world\u2019s strongest and most consistent winds. And while coal mining jobs have fallen to historic lows nationally in recent years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that wind-energy technician will be the fastest-growing occupation, more than doubling over the next seven years.Though most of the coal jobs lost last year have since returned as companies have emerged from bankruptcy, the insecurity surrounding the industry remains. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little scary when you\u2019ve got people all around you getting laid off,\u201d Brandon Sims, 37, an Air Force veteran who works for an explosives company that serves the mines, said outside the lecture room. \u201cYou never really know when your day to get the pink slip is.\u201dHUNTINGTON, W.Va. \u2014 Coal mining was already dead in Crum, a town of less than 200 just this side of the Kentucky border, by the time Ethan Spaulding, 26, graduated from high school, he said. That dashed his hopes of becoming a roof bolter, helping stabilize the ceilings of mine tunnels. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to have a high school diploma to go to the coal industry,\u201d he said, \u201cand you can start making $150,000 a year.\u201d Or perhaps you once could.Mr. Spaulding was standing near the railroad tracks at the edge of town where trains move coal out of the region, behind a dilapidated brick building that once housed a high-end suit factory. It is becoming a hub for the family of social enterprises that Coalfield Development leads, which include rehabilitating buildings, installing solar panels, and an agriculture program that grows produce and is turning an old mine site into a solar-powered fish farm.Wanting to stay in Crum, Mr. Spaulding went through the solar program Coalfield runs with Solar Holler, which offers its participants a two-and-a-half-year apprenticeship. He is now a crew chief at the training center, overseeing the renovation of a larger classroom inside the building. Though he is optimistic that he can eventually reach his target income in the solar industry, the installation jobs for which the trainees will ultimately qualify generally pay far less \u2014 $26 an hour, on average, nationally.And yet there is keen interest. For David Ward, 40, managing installations at Solar Holler helps repay the student loans he ran up pursuing a degree in counseling \u2014 a growth industry in a state reeling from opioid addiction. An electrician, he said he was \u201cinterested in the idea of making your own power and the environmental impact.\u201dThe program is the brainchild of Brandon Dennison and Dan Conant, two West Virginians who wanted to help develop a sustainable economy in the state. Mr. Dennison, 31, started Coalfield Development in 2010; it grew out of a volunteer effort to build low-income green housing. Mr. Conant, 32, had worked on political campaigns, including Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential contest. After becoming involved in the solar industry, he concluded that rooftop solar development, with its individual, decentralized nature, could combine the door-to-door approach of political campaigning with a technology to fight climate change.He completed the first Solar Holler project \u2014 putting panels on the Presbyterian church in his hometown, Shepherdstown, on the Potomac River \u2014 and, quickly overwhelmed with demand for similar installations, realized the state didn\u2019t have a work force to handle it. So he formed a partnership with Mr. Dennison\u2019s organization to develop one. At Coalfield\u2019s facility here, participants learn how the arrays create electricity and connect to the power system, but they also get practice installing panels on a shed behind the main building. That helps them clear one of the basic industry hurdles: becoming comfortable working on a roof.SHAWMUT, Mont. \u2014 If a big worry for would-be solar installers is staying balanced while ferrying heavy glass-sheathed panels around a roof, for potential wind energy technicians it is whether they can climb more than 200 feet in broiling heat or icy cold and emerge into the gusts to fix machinery. Still, the Goldwind technicians say working so high up is one of the job\u2019s best features.\u201cYou get a view that most people will never see,\u201d as Lukas Nelson, 27, a site manager in Ohio, put it in one of the company\u2019s promotional videos. Only a few towers have elevators, and at Goldwind\u2019s power plant here, the access is by a series of 90-degree aluminum ladders and steel mesh platforms, straight to the top.It was Saturday morning after the three seminars, and Goldwind safety managers had delivered a brief lecture in a trailer that served as the farm office, warning of perils like rattlesnakes in the tall grasses outside and electrocution from throwing switches in the towers.The organizers separated the crowd of about 20 into two groups. One would take a tour of the wind farm and substation while the other climbed towers whose blades sat idle. After lunch, they would switch.In front of the trailer, Chancey Coffelt, 33, Goldwind\u2019s regional safety manager, was showing the climbing group how to put on harnesses \u2014 a network of heavy metal clips and rings attached to straps that thread over the shoulders, across the chest and around each thigh. They would latch onto a rope pulley system as they climbed each of four ladders and then hook into a bracket as they reached each platform before freeing themselves from the pulley.Mr. Davila, the 20-year mine veteran, was standing with members of the second group, chatting about Wyoming\u2019s wobbly energy economy and how wind might \u2014 and might not \u2014 steady it. \u201cA lot of coal miners don\u2019t like wind or solar, but you need them all,\u201d Mr. Davila said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a puzzle you have to solve: just think about how many things we plug in.\u201dStill, many of the men expressed concern over what the jobs would pay, saying the salaries paled in comparison to what they could earn on an oil rig, for instance.\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to get a six-figure job in the oil industry,\u201d Jesse Morgan, a baby-faced 31-year-old city councilman and back-office worker at a drilling services company, had said over beers at a bar in Casper where he was asked to show ID. \u201cYou get addicted to that money.\u201dBut it could be worth taking a pay cut to get out from under the stress of constantly planning for the next layoff, and being able to return home at night rather than working 30- to 40-day stints offshore. The oil field never stops, Mr. Morgan said of his time on the rigs. \u201cIt\u2019s 24/7 \u2014 you miss birthdays, every holiday.\u201dAs with the other men, Mr. Morgan\u2019s work experience made him an attractive candidate for Goldwind. Accustomed to the industrial behemoths of fossil fuel production, he is familiar with the environment, equipment and procedures of working safely while surrounded by danger \u2014 like remembering to fasten the chin strap on a hard hat so it won\u2019t slip off and injure a colleague laboring hundreds of feet below.Chelsae Clemons, 26, a technician at a Goldwind plant in Findlay, Ohio, said the emphasis on safety and training was part of the program\u2019s value. Among the few staff members at the seminars with a bachelor\u2019s degree, she had worked in a lab at a hospital and had little relevant experience when she decided to pursue a career in renewable energy. In Gillette, she told the crowd, \u201cThey\u2019re giving certifications I had to pay for.\u201dHINTON, W.Va. \u2014 \u201cSolar\u2019s not going to be everything, and one of the big challenges for the state is how do we diversify and get lots of cool stuff going,\u201d Mr. Conant, the Solar Holler founder, was saying as he drove from a solar installation at a hilltop farmhouse toward a 1940s summer camp that the local coal company provided for the children of its employees until 1984. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been a one-industry town for a really long time, that\u2019s an issue. The last thing we would want to do is pin our hopes on doing that again, just with some other technology.\u201dDeborah Delaney, an assistant professor of entomology and wildlife ecology who oversees the apiary and bee program at the University of Delaware, said the area was well suited for a honey enterprise. It is largely forest, unsullied by the pesticides that threaten the insects in industrial farm areas, and it has plant species like black locust and sourwood whose honey can fetch a high price.\u201cThis is bee paradise,\u201d she said, sitting on the porch of the cafeteria building where a Patriot Coal banner hung askew on one wall. For now, Ms. Delaney and the program\u2019s staff are getting the colony established on a hillside in 86 hives that buzz away behind electrified wire fencing to protect them from bears. Next spring, they plan to distribute about 150 hives to 35 beekeepers either free or through a low- or no-interest loan. Come harvest time, the beekeepers would bring their honey-laden frames to the camp for extraction and processing; organizers would pay them for their yield and then sell the honey to support the program.\u201cFor some people it might be a side hustle, but for other people it could really turn into, over time, a true income that could sustain a family,\u201d said Kate Asquith, program director at Appalachian Headwaters.Economists say this kind of diversification is important, especially in a region where coal is unlikely to make a major comeback, even if Trump administration policies are able to foster a revival elsewhere. Demand is strongest for the low-sulfur coal from the Powder River Basin straddling Wyoming and Montana, rather than what Appalachia produces. The new-energy industries cannot replicate what coal once did, economists say. Long-term jobs at the Wyoming wind farm would number in the hundreds at best, while the solar program thus far trains only 10 workers each year.Even a coal boom wouldn\u2019t create jobs the way it used to: like the steam drill that ultimately took John Henry\u2019s place, new equipment and technologies have replaced workers in heavy industries. Production of coal, for instance, increased over all from the 1920s until 2010, while the number of jobs dropped to 110,000 from 870,000.So interest in the bees has been high here. \u201cThought it was weird at first \u2014 bugs in a box in the backyard,\u201d said Sean Phelps, 27, who left a secure job as a school janitor to work with the bee program. Exposure to his father-in-law\u2019s hives changed his perspective. Now he sees them as a way to help the area, as well as fun. \u201cThis is what I want to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re out in them, it reduces a lot of stress.\u201dSHAWMUT, Mont. \u2014 It was after lunch, and Mr. Davila and Mr. Morgan were at the base of one of the wind towers, wearing heavy harnesses and waiting for the first group to finish so they could start the climb. Suddenly, Jason Willbanks, 39, who lost a job as an electrician with a coal company and now drives crews to and from their shifts on coal trains, emerged from within. Walking heavily into the blazing sunlight, he clattered onto the metal platform and stairs. Asked how he was, he shot back: \u201cSweating like a fat guy at an all-day dance.\u201dAs he pulled off the harness, dropped to his knees in a patch of shade on the grass and rolled onto his back, Mr. Davila offered him a bottle of water from a cooler. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned it,\u201d he said.Not long after, word came from the Goldwind crew: A thunderstorm was heading toward the farm, so the second group could not climb.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m all dressed up with nowhere to go,\u201d Mr. Davila said, disappointed, gesturing toward the harness. \u201c I wanted to see if I could get up.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve just witnessed what it\u2019s like to be a wind-turbine technician,\u201d Mr. Coffelt, the safety manager, said, cocking an ear over one shoulder and suggesting that the group move away from the rattlesnake he had heard. \u201cImagine if you\u2019re one or two stacks up when you get that alert: right back down we come.\u201d After weighing options, the Goldwind organizers called it a day, offering repeated apologies and promises to get the men back to the site which, over the following months, they did.Mr. Morgan, who posted a beaming selfie from atop the turbine on Facebook, did not apply for the training program. But Mr. Davila did, and was accepted.He is torn over whether to enroll, he said. He is desperate for the work but hesitant to leave his wife and home in Gillette, where he has lived since he was 6, for one of the jobs immediately available outside the state. Still, he added with a chuckle, it might be good to move: \u201cMaybe there\u2019s more to the world than Gillette.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The U.S. Still Leans on the Military-Industrial Complex", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIf you want to see what President Trump can do to expand manufacturing in America, look past his criticism of free trade and the few jobs he may have saved at Carrier. Instead, look at his plans for the military.And the spending shows. The United States, after all, has 10 aircraft carriers in active service versus just one for China, although China has a bigger manufacturing industry than the United States. One can argue that China is bent on big increases in weapons production and is still in the early stages. Whatever the case, America\u2019s weapons production is still far greater than China\u2019s, while China has burnished its reputation as a manufacturer of civilian goods for export and, increasingly, for its own citizens.The United States once went that route. In the summer of 1945, after nearly five years of wartime rationing, the civilian population of the United States was starved for new cars and appliances, new clothing and shoes, and new homes and their furnishings. So was the rest of the world, and American manufacturers prospered by meeting that need as well. Converting factories to civilian production was a no-brainer and sufficiently profitable to match wartime earnings.As weapons production increased, the manufacture of autos and electronics shifted partly or wholly overseas. So did the production of other civilian products \u2014 leaving behind weapons bought by the Defense Department as an ever bigger share of the nation\u2019s factory output.Given the history of recent decades, is it any wonder that we now have a president who, at least in part, equates \u201cmaking America strong again\u201d with an enhanced military equipped with the weaponry that an enhanced military requires?Public money flows to factory owners in many ways \u2014 often as a result of the frequent bidding by municipal governments to persuade a manufacturer to locate a factory in one community rather than another. These auctions sometimes top $100 million per factory location.A manufacturer who finally accepts a municipality\u2019s bid collects tax breaks, a gift of land on which to put a factory and sometimes the cost of building and equipping the factory itself at taxpayers\u2019 expense. Cities and towns are that eager to have a factory, with its network of nearby suppliers and its relatively well-paying jobs \u2014 relative, that is, to the lower paying retail and service industry work that is often the alternative for high-school- or even junior-college-educated men and women.Mr. Aboulafia based his estimate, he said, on an analysis of the Defense Department budget and export data. Dan Luria, research director of the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center, concurred with those figures. To put the matter graphically, factories in the United States churn out one rifle barrel for every nine auto fenders.These constraints make me yearn for the good old days just after World War II, when America seemed to have easier policy choices. Even inexpensive trinkets were manufactured in America, and my mother, for one, ordered her children to stay away from a neighborhood boy whose parents had bought him a BB gun. Disarmament ran deep in the late 1940s. We didn\u2019t need to produce weapons, even BB guns, to keep manufacturing afloat. I\u2019m afraid that we do now.Louis Uchitelle covered economics for The New York Times for more than 20 years. This essay is drawn from his latest book, \u201cMaking It: Why Manufacturing Still Matters,\u201d published in May by the New Press.Advertisement"}

But after 20 years of practice, they\u2019re seasoned enough for clients like the Menil to entrust them with significant commissions. They are in that fertile period \u2014 agewise, it typically runs from the mid-40s to mid-50s in architecture \u2014 when the profession\u2019s next generation of leadership begins to make its mark. Mr. Piano was 50 when the Menil, his American debut, opened. It was only after the renovation of his house, at 48, that Mr. Gehry became architecture\u2019s other important Frank. Zaha Hadid was mostly an academic architect well into her 40s.For Mr. Gong, the client\u2019s interest in repurposing the original building reflects a renewed Chinese appreciation for cultural preservation. \u201cOur society is rethinking what we\u2019ve been doing over the last 20 years \u2014 this rapid urbanization at the cost of all else,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a new interest in quality, and in respecting the memory of what came before.\u201dMr. Ingels calls his approach \u2018\u2018hedonistic sustainability\u2019\u2019: sustainability that increases the enjoyment of life.Now that\u2019s leadership any generation can appreciate.Advertisement"}

MacFarlane spent years collecting words from all over Britain, in all of its dialects, which are given in glossaries and read like a gift.I also recently read Grace Paley\u2019s \u201cEnormous Changes at the Last Minute\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m working on short stories, and she knew so well how be free in them \u2014 and reread \u201cThe Little Virtues,\u201d by Natalia Ginzburg, which I found to be just as great as ever. But most of all, Kafka\u2019s \u201cZ\u00fcrau Aphorisms,\u201d translated by Michael Hofmann and with a brief but beautiful introduction by Roberto Calasso.A friend recently gave me a book called \u201cArt and Experience in Classical Greece\u201d by J. J. Pollitt, which describes the state of anxiety that haunted the ancient Greeks and led to their obsession with the kind of order that can tame chaos and drive out the irrational. The book shed a certain light, for me, on our current obsession with factual knowledge, and its relationship to our own mounting anxiety.Which classic novel did you recently read for the first time?Which writers \u2013 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \u2013 working today do you admire most?I still don\u2019t want to accept that W. G. Sebald and Roberto Bola\u00f1o, working only yesterday, are gone today. They each published for only a decade before dying in their fifties, but not before expanding our idea of what a novel can be. Half of what\u2019s published these days bears their marks, and so it\u2019s impossible for me to think of writers working today without thinking first of them. After that, there is Laszlo Krasznahorkai, Rachel Cusk, Jenny Erpenbeck, David Grossman, Yoel Hoffman, Karl Ove Knausgaard, to name a few. I read plenty of contemporary fiction in translation, but less American and British, which I think has to do with the fact that the social novel bores me, I don\u2019t care for a plain good story, and prefer reflection to dialogue, of which I can be suspicious. But no, that\u2019s too much\u2014 now I\u2019m exaggerating. Maybe I just have a thing for elsewhere. And of course it happens that I read some new book in English that bowls me over: I thought Claire-Louise Bennett\u2019s first novel, \u201cPond,\u201d published here last year, was extraordinary.What\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?When I was six or seven my grandfather gave me a book called \u201cThe Aleph-Bet Story,\u201d which ascribed a unique personality to each of the Hebrew letters. It was oddly unforgettable. I don\u2019t know that I was aware of it then, but now I think it must have given me my earliest sense of language as possessing a life of its own.What kinds of books bring you the most reading pleasure these days?Novels that arrive at their coherence in unusual and elegant ways. That stretch form only to satisfy the book\u2019s mysterious inner command. I love when I feel that both the author and I are surprised at where we find ourselves.How do you like to read?

Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?My mother is English, and as she was the one who read to us, my early world was A .A. Milne, Beatrix Potter, Kenneth Grahame, Lewis Carroll and Roald Dahl. None of them thought it necessary to protect children from darkness. On the contrary, they guided their readers right toward it. This gives one an enormous sense of being respected as a child. Not just of being trusted to handle things as they are, but to be accepted as not entirely good. To be recognized as having darkness within oneself, too. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve trusted any author since who doesn\u2019t address me with that assumption.You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?The author of Genesis and the author of the Book of Samuel \u2014 if only to finally know who the hell those two were, and to ask what they meant by it all, and request a copy of the unedited versions.

{"Headline": "How to Decide Where to Donate Your Money After Disasters", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst, there was Hurricane Harvey. Then came Irma, Jose and Maria. In between, there were floods, earthquakes and wildfires, too.In the span of about one month, a large area of the world was hammered by natural disasters, leaving behind death and devastation. The rubble is being cleared, millions are without power, and drinkable water can be hard to find.With such widespread need, it can be hard to know how to help. Who needs it? What do they need? Which groups can you trust?But there are ways to guide your thinking, she and others said. Here are a few things to consider as you decide how best to help victims of natural disasters.When considering how to give, it\u2019s helpful to start by asking what motivates you.People with ties to a region may want to give locally. Animal lovers may want to give to a shelter. Others may want their money directed to certain groups of people, like children, or causes, like public health.Many opt to leave the decision to the charities themselves, which is sometimes best: \u201cIf you\u2019re trusting them with your money, you should trust them to spend it well,\u201d Mr. Harold said.Your time is a resource, too, and you should decide how you want to spend it.Some people prefer to deeply research the charities they support, while others simply want to know they\u2019re giving to a trustworthy group.Evaluating a charity is often the most daunting part of donating, but it doesn\u2019t have to be.Tax filings and other documents can shed light on a group\u2019s operations, but donors should look beyond the numbers, too, experts said. That includes reviewing an organization\u2019s website, annual report, governing board and mission.\u201cIf the organization is only talking about the problem, but not talking about how the work they do leads to solutions to that problem, that is a red flag,\u201d Mr. Harold said.Ask questions about the charity, including how much experience it has in disaster relief, how long it\u2019s been around, how it measures accomplishments, and how others in the field talk about it.He also said that too much focus is often placed on overhead, a measure of administrative and fund-raising costs. While it can signal inefficient spending or, worse, fraud, some overhead is necessary to support a nonprofit\u2019s long-term viability.It may feel impersonal, but money is often the most useful form of donation. Unlike goods, financial gifts have no associated transportation costs.Donations surge in the immediate aftermath of disasters, but recoveries unfold over a much longer timeline.For that reason, donors should consider sustained involvement with charities, whether that involves checking up on how resources were spent and how needs have changed weeks or months down the line or making automatic monthly contributions.\u201cBecoming a repeated supporter is super helpful to the organizations,\u201d Ms. Rusnock said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Spettacolo,\u2019 a Tuscan Town Where All the World\u2019s a Stage", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome tell their stories in kitchens, warming hands and souls over coffee; others write confessions. For decades, the residents of the tiny Tuscan town of Monticchiello have turned their lives into theater. Each year, they gather to discuss art and their world until they land on a topic that reflects their most recent, urgent concerns. Word by word, they push and pull, challenging one another as they shape a production. All the world\u2019s a stage, but in Monticchiello that truism is movingly real, especially because these days its aging resident-players have more exits than entrances.Perched on a hilltop some two hours south of Florence, Monticchiello tends to be one of those towns that in English-language guidebooks rates a line or two in between chapters on Florence and Venice. One such book mentions the town\u2019s \u201cTeatro Povero (a folk theater production)\u201d; another notes its \u201cforbidding walls\u201d and \u201cmedieval past,\u201d assuring readers that it\u2019s \u201cwell worth exploring\u201d even if over all \u201cthere is nothing much in the way of sights.\u201d These mercenary assessments are meant, of course, for harried, hurried travelers, including those of us lucky enough to shape a few precious days into something we call vacation.There\u2019s very little about the making of the documentary itself in \u201cSpettacolo,\u201d which assumes the point of view of the unobtrusive, not-quite omniscient witness. The people tell their stories directly on camera, at times with deep emotion, their reminiscences augmented by faded photographs and archival moving images. The history of the theater emerges gradually as assorted personalities \u2014 former partisans, an ailing woman, an indifferent son \u2014 click into place. Perhaps inevitably, Mr. Cresti, a charismatic figure with a gray beard and a leonine halo of hair, becomes the focal point as he struggles to turn the town\u2019s latest collective concerns into its next big show.As the spettacolo takes shape with fractious dialogue and insistent politics, it becomes evident that the filmmakers are less interested in the final play than in its production, in its process and multiple meanings. Nothing if not discreet (and sly), Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen have shaped much of their material into four chapters that are named for the seasons. Each chapter is accompanied by ah-and-ooh beauty shots of the region, yet as winter gives way to spring and brown hills turn green, the day-to-day lives of the townspeople create a gentle, insistent critique of these seasonal postcards. Much like the town\u2019s annual production, the movie is telling its own story dialectically.That story can be so poignant and is so intelligently told that it feels wrong, almost insulting, to call \u201cSpettacolo\u201d charming, even if the movie is often delightful. In guidebooks, charm tends to be a commercial marker, a signifier for an imaginary, easily salable and consumable notion of authenticity. Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen understand the allure of that imaginary world; they were, after all, on vacation when they discovered Monticchiello and their documentary is itself often lovely. Yet they remind you that people are not attractions and their homes are not museums, even if the global economy, its casual tourists and rich speculators are determined to prove otherwise.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

As his reedy legs wobbled, his 13-year-old brother thrust a cane into his hand.For Mr. Hama, and for several million fellow Kurds in the autonomous enclave of Kurdistan, the vote is a down payment on a dream deferred. Denied a homeland after World War I, Iraq\u2019s Kurds are determined to escape their tortured past and fulfill a national destiny: a country to call their own.\u201cKurds know no one will protect us but ourselves,\u201d said Mr. Hama, 35, whose back was injured by an roadside bomb as he battled Islamic State militants last year. \u201cThat is why I fought \u2014 for the day we Kurds will be both free and safe.\u201dAlmost every Kurd in northern Iraq can trace a family history stained by treachery and dispossession: Kurdish women and children killed in chemical attacks, villages razed, Kurdish men detained and murdered, families deported or banished to internment camps.For decades, Baathist-led governments in Baghdad tried to crush or evict the Kurds, and to repopulate their ancestral lands with Arabs. But protected from Saddam Hussein\u2019s troops by an American no-fly zone since 1991, the Kurds have since built a thriving proto-state across northern Iraq.Now that Kurdish fighters have proved nearly indispensable to the American-led coalition\u2019s fight against the Islamic State, Kurdish leaders sense that this is their moment. Some of the most urgent issues in the region \u2013 terrorism, oil, the brutal civil war in Syria and the upheavals of postwar Iraq \u2013 intersect in Kurdistan.But as tens of thousands of flag-waving Kurds packed a stadium in Erbil, the capital, on Friday, chanting \u201cBye-bye, Iraq!\u201d the referendum was under threat.If the vote does go forward, \u201cthere is no going back on independence,\u201d said Peter W. Galbraith, a former American diplomat who is close to the Kurdish leadership.Mr. Galbraith predicted a solid majority in favor of independence. \u201cWould you want to be part of a country that committed genocide against you?\u201d he asked.On the eve of the vote late Sunday, tensions escalated as Mr. Barzani declared that the Kurds\u2019 \u201cpartnership\u201d with Iraq was finished and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi warned that Iraq would take \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to preserve the country\u2019s unity.Iran, at Iraq\u2019s request, halted flights to and from the two international airports inside the autonomous Kurdistan region. Iranian troops initiated military exercises on Iran\u2019s border with Iraq near the Kurdish region, nearly a week after Turkey began conducting tank drills on its northern border with Iraq.In Baghdad, the United States Embassy warned American citizens about possible unrest during the referendum, particularly in the disputed areas.Often called the world\u2019s largest ethnic group without a homeland, some 30 million Kurds are spread across Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. They were denied statehood when the Middle East map was redrawn after World War I. Isolated and marginalized, Iraq\u2019s Kurds are now demanding a path to self-determination.Kurdistan is part of Iraq, but it looks and feels like a separate nation. It enjoys broad autonomy, with its own government and parliament, its own language and customs and a fighting force known as the pesh merga.After the American-led invasion that toppled Mr. Hussein in 2003, Kurdistan endured a mutually dependent but ultimately dysfunctional relationship with Iraq. In 2006, a Kurdistan agency hired an American company to produce an advertising slogan that was both ambivalent and taunting: \u201cKurdistan \u2014 the other Iraq.\u201dAfter pesh merga fighters seized the city of Kirkuk and its lucrative oil fields in 2014, Baghdad stopped sending budget payments, crippling a Kurdistan economy already battered by sinking oil prices.Arabic, once mandatory in Kurdistan schools, is fading among young Kurds, many of whom barely speak the language.Kazei Kurda, 22, a Kurdish university student, said teachers scolded pupils who said they lived in Iraq. They are told they live in Kurdistan, she said.Ms. Kurda said the atrocities inflicted upon Kurds were drummed into her as a child. Several members of her mother\u2019s family died in 1988, when Mr. Hussein\u2019s military killed up to 5,000 people in a chemical gas attack on the city of Halabja.\u201cThe history of the Kurds is one of betrayal,\u201d said David L. Phillips, a former State Department adviser who worked on Iraq for 30 years.Amina Ahmed, 53, a former pesh merga fighter, said her brother was executed by the Baathist government. Her family was evicted from the Kurdish region and spent seven years in an internment camp inside Iraq \u2014 \u201ca foreign country,\u201d Ms. Ahmed called it.Those memories will guide her hand, she said, when she votes \u201cyes\u201d in the referendum: \u201cWe are writing our own history now.\u201dSince the rise of the Islamic State in 2014, the pesh merga and the Iraqi Army have been allies in the fight to drive the militants from Iraq. After Iraqi soldiers fled an Islamic State onslaught that year, the pesh merga stood and fought, seizing Iraqi areas and expanding the Kurdish enclave by more than 40 percent.But the dispute over the independence vote has become so acrimonious and intractable that Kurds say now is the time to break away from Iraq.\u201cWe have given up on Baghdad now that the Iraq we fought for is broken,\u201d said Hoshyar Zebari, Iraq\u2019s former foreign minister and a leader of the referendum effort. Mr. Zebari said the Shiite Muslim-led Baghdad government had aligned with Iran, no friend of Iraq\u2019s Kurds or the United States.The Kurds\u2019 generations-long sense of mistrust and insecurity is playing out in the political showdown with the United States, which fears the referendum will foment ethnic violence, fracture Iraq and rupture the coalition against the Islamic State.\u201cThe Kurdish psyche is one of being different \u2014 and very bitter over how the rest of the world looks at us, especially the Arabs,\u201d said Alan Noory, a Kurdish university professor.Mahdi Ahmed Hamza, 49, a school headmaster, said he had always felt like a second-class citizen, barely tolerated by Iraqi Arabs outside Kurdistan.\u201cIt\u2019s like you are a bird in a cage that has food brought to it,\u201d Mr. Hamza said. \u201cBut only when you are able to fly away do you discover that you are able to feed yourself.\u201dFor Lt. Esra Salim, a pesh merga soldier, the sound of knocking will be playing in her head when she votes \u201cyes\u201d on Monday. She said she would always remember Iraqi security forces constantly knocking on her family\u2019s door, searching for male relatives hiding in attics and garden sheds. Many Kurdish men were killed, imprisoned or pressed into military service.Lieutenant Salim, 26, said her family was forcibly evicted and replaced by Arabs in the 1980s.\u201cWe can never, ever let that happen again,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why I fight \u2014 and why I will vote for independence.\u201dNajmaldin Karim, 67, said that in 1963, when he was 13, Iraqi government soldiers publicly executed Kurds in his hometown, Kirkuk, and hanged their corpses in the streets. Mr. Karim saw the dangling body of the father of one of his best friends.\u201cI still see that face \u2014 all those faces \u2014 right in front of me,\u201d he said.Today, Mr. Karim is the embattled governor of Kirkuk province, fired on Sept. 14 by Baghdad but still in office because Kirkuk is under Kurdish control.But Kirkuk, one of several disputed areas included in the referendum, is also home to Arabs and Turkmens, who feel threatened by possible inclusion in a Kurdish nation.\u201cMaybe the Kurds will tell Turkmens and Arabs to leave because now this is a home for the Kurds,\u201d said Ali Abdel, 37, a Turkmen who owns a billiard hall in Kirkuk.Mr. Abdel\u2019s Kurdish boyhood friend and business partner, Mohammed Hussein, 37, assured his friend that Kurdistan would continue to welcome everyone.\u201cThe Turkmens will be safe,\u201d Mr. Hussein said. \u201cAll we want is a homeland where we can be safe, too, along with our Arab and Turkmen brothers.\u201dSixty miles north, Mr. Hama, the wounded Kurdish soldier, practiced shuffling with a walker. He said his family was forcibly removed from their ancestral village in 1988 and confined to an internment camp for five years.\u201cI\u2019m ashamed to be an Iraqi citizen after what Iraq has done to our people,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m voting yes to make my children the first generation who can call themselves Kurdish citizens.\u201dHis father, Salah Mohamad Amin, 64, a former pesh merga fighter, said his sister and her four children were abducted by Iraqi forces in the 1980s and never seen again.\u201cPeople around the world may wonder why the Kurds are causing trouble with this vote,\u201d Mr. Amin said. \u201cIf they knew our history, they would understand.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the family member helping Dana Salah Hama, a wounded Kurdish soldier.

{"Headline": "Tax Cuts for the Rich by Another Name", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialRepublicans on the Senate Budget Committee violated their supposedly sacrosanct principles of fiscal hawkishness this week, by saying that it would be just fine with them to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years in order to cut taxes. They justify this hypocrisy by asserting what has been disproved time and again \u2014 that tax cuts spur the economy and compensate for any lost revenue.In fact, these cuts could hurt the very people they purport to help \u2014 small-business owners, middle-class professionals and working-class Americans.While even initial details of the tax plan are not expected before next week, deep corporate tax cuts have been a Republican priority for some time. Much of the discussion of that has revolved around the top rate, now 35 percent. President Trump has called for lowering it to 15 percent, while his economic aides and House Republicans favor a top rate around 25 percent.But the rate cut on corporate profits is only part of the plan. A centerpiece of proposals made in the past by Mr. Trump and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, has been to tax so-called pass-through income at the same rate as corporate profits.Currently, such income passes through businesses \u2014 including partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships \u2014 onto the owners\u2019 personal income tax returns, where it is taxed at rates of up to 39.6 percent. Instead, the Republicans would tax it at the new corporate rate of 15 or 25 percent.Republican advocates of this proposed sleight-of-hand like to sell it as a benefit for small businesses, freelancers and moonlighters \u2014 the middle class. But pass-through income from nearly 70 percent of small businesses already is taxed at top rates of 15 percent or less, because those businesses are, in fact, small, and their owners\u2019 income is modest.The average tax cut for millionaires would be $114,000 in 2018, raising their after-tax incomes by more than 5 percent. For multimillionaires, the tax savings would pile up even more. The 400 highest-income taxpayers in the country, with average annual incomes exceeding $300 million each, derive about one-fifth of their income from pass-through businesses.The Budget Committee agreement is a crucial first step in the tax-cut quest, because Senate Republicans must approve a budget before invoking rules that let them pass a tax-cut bill with only a simple majority, effectively eliminating the need for any Democratic support.The strategy now is for the committee\u2019s Republicans to pass the budget, after the expected vote next week on yet another attempt to repeal of the Affordable Care Act. After the Senate passes that budget, it would likely become the template for compromise budget legislation with the House. Self-styled deficit hawks in the House are expected to raise a fuss about tax cuts that are not offset by spending cuts, but when faced with a choice between controlling deficits and cutting taxes, it\u2019s a safe bet a majority of Republicans will choose tax cuts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Lives or Bottom Line? Activists Ask What N.F.L. Protests Are All About", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile a debate over professional football players kneeling during the national anthem consumed much of the country over the weekend, a scene was playing out around St. Louis that drew far less notice. There, demonstrators protested the acquittal of a white former police officer in the fatal 2011 shooting of a black man, marching inside a mall and through the streets in daily protests over the case for more than a week.Around the country, racial justice activists are concerned that the essential issues they have spent years trying to highlight \u2014 police brutality and systemic racism \u2014 could get lost in the growing national dialogue emerging from football stadiums.\u201cThis new wave of everyone kneeling, it means absolutely nothing,\u201d said L\u2019lerr\u00e9t Jazelle Ailith, the communications manager for Black Youth Project 100, an activist organization. \u201cIt\u2019s become very basic and watered down.\u201dMs. Ailith and other activists fear that the latest N.F.L. debate could cause the focus of the activism started by Mr. Kaepernick to stray from its original intent.The latest debate over the national anthem came in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments during a rally in Alabama last week. He urged N.F.L. owners to fire players who did not stand for the anthem, saying they should \u201cget that son of a bitch off the field right now.\u201d Many players, owners and the league took exception to Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh language. They responded by locking arms during the national anthem at Sunday\u2019s games, and many players and officials denounced the president for suggesting that peaceful protesters be fired.But Ms. Ailith said the protests should not focus on the president, but on achieving racial justice in areas like policing, education, health care and the economy. Otherwise, she said, the efforts would amount to little more than symbolism.\u201cThis becomes something that white people who think they aren\u2019t white supremacists do all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey like to hop on board a particular cause that allows them to dissociate themselves from racist American history.\u201dIt was up to social justice leaders to help focus the N.F.L.-centered activism, said Michael Skolnik, an entrepreneur and activist.\u201cFrom a movement perspective, it\u2019s critical as activists and as folks in the movement that we continue to message,\u201d Mr. Skolnik said of the array of groups that have emerged in recent years, including Black Lives Matter, aiming to change policies on issues like police training and oversight and criminal justice policies. \u201cAs much as Donald Trump wants to make it about him, this is not about him. This is about ending police brutality, fixing our criminal justice system and ending the killing of black men and black women by the police.\u201dFor Elle Hearns, an activist who has done organizing for Black Lives Matter, there is a contradiction in the N.F.L. being used as a vehicle for protest. It is an organization rooted in capitalism, a system that she said hurts and marginalizes black people. Several owners have contributed money to Mr. Trump, some have discouraged players from protesting during the national anthem and none has hired Mr. Kaepernick, who is now a free agent. Ms. Hearns and others said they wonder whether the league\u2019s owners are getting involved now because they fear that the president\u2019s comments will cause them to lose fans \u2014 and, by extension, money.\u201cThere\u2019s still no collective defining of what it means for people in this country to be in unity when black people are continuing to be discarded,\u201d she said.Ms. Hearns said she appreciated the movement that Mr. Kaepernick started, but was concerned by how people have responded. The focus, she said, needed to be less on celebrities, and more on marginalized people.\u201cThis is great for symbolism, which America is great at,\u201d she said of the anthem protests. \u201cBut it\u2019s not great for actually providing equity.\u201dIf nothing else, activists see the N.F.L. debate as another platform to bring attention to issues that they have been pressing, particularly given the league\u2019s huge popularity and broad reach.\u201cI feel like there is an opportunity where we can use Trump as a pawn to start a conversation to talk about the ways in which white supremacy has permeated our society,\u201d Ms. Ailith said.In the N.F.L., some players have taken concrete steps on matters of racial injustice. Mr. Kaepernick has donated $1 million to various charities. Malcolm Jenkins, a safety for the Philadelphia Eagles who has been raising his fist during the national anthem, has done a ridealong with the police and met with lawmakers in Washington. Anquan Boldin, a former N.F.L. wide receiver, retired from the sport to focus on activism.Still, some activists find it disturbing that it took Mr. Trump\u2019s comments to lead many in the N.F.L. to get involved.\u201cI\u2019m apprehensive that Charlottesville wasn\u2019t the match, that the killing of black and brown folks wasn\u2019t the match,\u201d said Wade Davis, a former N.F.L. player who works with athletes on social justice issues.But Mr. Davis said Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks had cleared the way for more players to protest, removing some of the political stigma and economic pressure that had led some to steer clear of such issues.Many of the athletes themselves came from backgrounds in which they were affected by racial injustice and watched their parents struggle, he said, even if they are now well-paid football players.\u201cThese athletes are wrestling with something that is so deep, that is so real, they can almost touch going back into poverty,\u201d he said.He said he hopes that the rush of protest now can remove some of those fears, and perhaps lead to a unified effort to combat racial inequality, adding: \u201cI hope that one of the largest takeaways is players really see the strength that they have in numbers.\u201dFollow John Eligon on Twitter @jeligonAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Currency Rebounds as Economic Optimism Returns", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 For those who worry about the state of the world economy, China has long been a major reason to lose sleep. Its financial system labors under a mountain of loans, while weaker growth has prompted many Chinese people and companies to move their money overseas in recent years.China still faces hefty debt and slowing growth. But even some vocal naysayers say the country has found ways to contain its problems \u2014 at least for now.That improving outlook is, in part, reflected in China\u2019s currency. The renminbi has surged in value in recent weeks, helped by growing confidence in the country\u2019s economic prospects and by a political push for stability.On Monday, Beijing set the currency\u2019s value at its strongest level in nearly a year and a half. While China keeps a firm grip on its value, investor interest in the renminbi helps strengthen it.Other signs point to China steadying its course after a stock market crash and surprise currency devaluation two years ago shook the financial world and brought the country\u2019s long-term problems to the fore. China\u2019s economic data suggest growth is continuing at a steady, if less heady, pace. Its stock market is rising again.China has not solved its problems, of course. But investors and economists say its efforts to keep the economy under control have restored some faith in the country\u2019s economic stewardship. In a sign of the government\u2019s own confidence, it eliminated two policies over the weekend that made it more expensive for investors to bet that the renminbi would weaken, measures adopted after money began to leave the country two years ago.In terms of his earlier worries about China\u2019s debt, he added, \u201cI\u2019m having doubts about what I believed as well.\u201dThe currency, which is one of the main ways the government controls the economy, is a gauge of the country\u2019s health and a source of tension for the United States and other trading partners. As the economy boomed, the renminbi largely strengthened. When growth faltered in recent years, money flooded out of the country, putting pressure on the currency.The currency\u2019s ups and downs play to the debt concerns.China relied on a huge wave of lending to power its economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis nearly a decade ago. While the strategy worked, it pushed China to similar debt levels, relative to the size of its economy, as the United States and other developed countries.Since then, the authorities have taken a number of steps that appear to be keeping the short-term problems at bay, though doing little for the longer term.Beijing has strictly limited how much money can be sent abroad and has clamped down on what a growing number of the country\u2019s leaders considered wasteful corporate purchases. The government has even resorted to strategies like face recognition software at automated teller machines in Macau, a Chinese-controlled territory and gambling mecca that has its own, more readily convertible, currency and that has long had a reputation for money laundering.Charlene Chu, a China analyst at Autonomous Research, a global company advising hedge funds and other international money managers, has long worried that China\u2019s debt accumulation was becoming unsustainable. Now, she said, Beijing has the ability to postpone its problems.\u201cWhat I appreciate now is there are just no independent actors here,\u201d Ms. Chu said. \u201cThere is no bank that is going to say in November that \u2018our economic outlook is not good \u2014 we\u2019re going to contract our loan book.\u2019 They can muddle on for a while.\u201dBut Ms. Chu and others see Beijing\u2019s efforts as stopgaps: If it does not address its debt, China risks a long period of low growth, as in Japan. Some economic indicators suggest that China\u2019s growth will begin to slow in the second half of this year.But China\u2019s surging currency suggests investors are not as worried as before. While China keeps a tight grip on the value of its currency, it allows the renminbi to move up or down by a certain amount in its local currency market.After falling to almost 7 to the dollar at the end of last year, the renminbi has rebounded. On Monday morning, China\u2019s central bank set the currency slightly stronger than 6.5 to the dollar for the first time since May 2016.\u201cThe market has turned around significantly its bearish view\u201d on the Chinese currency, said Zhou Hao, an economist in the Singapore office of Commerzbank.The currency\u2019s rally is partly political. China is preparing for a twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress to begin in Beijing on Oct. 18. President Xi Jinping has made clear that he wants stability until then in practically every aspect of the country\u2019s life, including the economy.Other currency moves \u2014 particularly the United States dollar \u2014 are contributing to the renminbi\u2019s strength. The dollar has weakened as the Federal Reserve has been slow to raise rates because the American economy has grown a little less vigorously than anticipated and as inflation in particular has fallen short of expectations.China can win some political gains from its stronger currency. President Trump, who has long criticized China\u2019s economic policies, has accused Beijing of keeping its currency artificially weak \u2014 an accusation that had been true in the past but is not today. It could also ease its limit on money outflows, if it chooses.\u201cIf the dollar is depreciating, China has a lot of easy policy options,\u201d said Brad W. Setser, a former deputy assistant secretary of the United States Treasury who is now a China specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations.Mr. Zhu, of Tsinghua University, said he believed that the Chinese government could continue to postpone its problems. But he warned against complacency, saying China\u2019s debt could cause problems if it were not watched carefully.\u201cWhen will the bubble burst?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen nobody believes it\u2019s a bubble.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bad News, World: China Can\u2019t Solve the North Korea Problem", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterAfter each North Korean provocation, a soothing mantra echoes through the halls of government and think tanks in the United States.China, it is frequently said, could solve this seemingly unsolvable problem, finally reining in North Korea, if Beijing were just properly motivated.But this oft-repeated line contains three assumptions, none of which has held up well in recent years.It assumes that outside pressure could persuade North Korea to curtail or abandon its weapons programs. That China has the means to bring about such pressure. And that Beijing will do so once it is properly cajoled or coerced.Each assumption has been tested repeatedly in recent years and, time and again, has collapsed. Yet three consecutive presidents \u2014 George W. Bush, Barack Obama and now Donald J. Trump \u2014 have invested their hopes and their strategies in China coming to the rescue.Asked whether this were possible, even in the abstract, John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, answered, \u201cNo, the Chinese can\u2019t fix this for us.\u201dIf China complied with every American request to cut trade, it could devastate North Korea\u2019s economy, which especially relies on Chinese fossil fuels.Jeffrey Lewis, who directs an East Asia program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, called notions that China could impose costs exceeding the benefit North Korea draws from its weapons \u201csad and desperate.\u201dImagine, Mr. Lewis said, that you are Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, and China turned against you, joining your enemies in pressuring you to disarm.\u201cThe last thing you would do in that situation is give up your independent nuclear capability,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing you hold that they have no control over. You would never give that up in that situation.\u201dWhen sanctions aim at forcing internal political change, they often backfire, hardening their targets in place.In the 1960s, the United States imposed a total embargo on its neighbor and onetime ally, Cuba. Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, ruled for half a century, even surviving the loss of Soviet support.When Americans rage at Beijing for failing to toughen sanctions, Mr. Lewis said, \u201cThe Chinese response is, \u2018Because they\u2019re not going to work.\u2019 And the data is on their side.\u201dNorth Korea may be especially resistant to such pressure.The Chinese, Mr. Delury said, \u201ccan keep reducing their already minuscule trade and investment ties to North Korea, but it will not deflect Kim Jong-un because one thing the North Korean system is especially good at is absorbing pain.\u201dEven a total trade ban would impose less suffering than what North Korea has already proved it can endure.In the 1990s, when Russian subsidies disappeared, a famine killed up to 10 percent of North Korea\u2019s population. But North Korea neither collapsed nor sought to end the crisis by opening up to the outside world.Overriding its calculus, then, would require imposing costs greater than destruction or famine but short of war, which would risk a nuclear exchange. That may be a Venn diagram with no overlap.And North Korea, unlike Cuba, has nuclear weapons, which frees it to retaliate conventionally against what Mr. Castro merely endured.In 2010, it shelled a South Korean island, killing four. It was also accused of sinking a South Korean Navy ship that year, killing 46. Its nuclear deterrent, now strengthened, allows it to act even more aggressively.\u201cLet\u2019s say there\u2019s a famine in North Korea that kills a million people,\u201d Mr. Lewis said, imagining, though not condoning, the harshest possible Chinese action. \u201cDo we think North Korea doesn\u2019t haul off and sink some ships?\u201dChina\u2019s reticence toward North Korea is often portrayed as a matter of will. Because Beijing is technically capable of inflicting harsher pain, it would do so if it cared enough.But when Americans look at their own options, they understand that they are useful only if they can be used.The United States could flatten Pyongyang overnight. But this would spark a conflict risking millions of Korean, Japanese and American lives. Washington declines such an option because it is unusable, not for any lack of will.China faces similar constraints, with drastic options risking unacceptable costs.In recent years, Beijing has tried to cut off trade or impose limited sanctions. These efforts have changed little or have backfired, with North Korea instead increasing its provocations, often timed to embarrass Beijing.In these tit-for-tats, Pyongyang is demonstrating that, though the weaker state, it has greater leverage because it is willing to accept more risk.North Korea has also labored to limit Beijing\u2019s diplomatic influence. It has purged officials thought to be sympathetic to China, including Mr. Kim\u2019s own uncle in 2013. This year, it killed Mr. Kim\u2019s brother, living in exile under Chinese protection. Though Mr. Kim is at times openly hostile to Beijing, he is its only option.Beijing may simply be trapped. Each North Korean provocation risks war on China\u2019s border. It invites an American buildup in China\u2019s backyard. And it pushes South Korea and Japan further into American arms.Its sticks and carrots all having failed with North Korea, China worries that increasing pressure will cut off what little influence it has.Americans might see parallels in their country\u2019s own troubled alliances, particularly in the Middle East.Egypt, for instance, regularly defies American demands, knowing that Washington will always come crawling back. So does Saudi Arabia, using the threat of a rupture in the relationship to pressure the United States into supporting its disastrous war in Yemen.Mr. Lewis drew a parallel, if only in the mechanics of alliance politics, with Israel.For decades, Washington has tried to persuade, induce or coerce Israel into altering its policies toward the Palestinians. Israeli leaders accepted American aid, ignored American demands and, in shows of calibrated defiance, often announced new settlement construction on the eve of American visits.To the outside world, American unwillingness to impose greater pressure looks like a lack of will. When American diplomats warn that more pressure would only deepen Israel\u2019s calculus and sacrifice American influence, they are blamed for perpetuating the conflict.For once, Americans can lob such accusations at another power. They have an obvious appeal, portraying the North Korea problem as someone else\u2019s to solve.\u201cWe\u2019re going to blame the Chinese for stabbing us in the back instead of admitting that our policy was dumb,\u201d Mr. Lewis said, calling this \u201cclassic scapegoating.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Present Conservative Vision for \u2018Dreamer\u2019 Protection", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Three Republican senators introduced a bill on Monday that would offer young undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship, signaling a possible bipartisan consensus on legislation to protect immigrants brought to the United States as children.Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina, James Lankford of Oklahoma and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah offered what they called the Succeed Act, billed as a Republican alternative to the Dream Act that is championed largely by Democrats. Both measures would provide a legislative solution for some of the 800,000 or so beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, an Obama-era order that President Trump rescinded this month.Congress has six months to figure out how to deal with the program\u2019s suspension before young recipients of the program begin losing their protections and potentially face being deported.\u201cThis bill, I believe, is a fair and orderly method for providing a permanent solution for the DACA children,\u201d Mr. Tillis said.It is unclear whether any Democrats will sign onto the Succeed Act, or whether common ground can be reached between the Republican bill and the Dream Act, which has languished in Congress since 2001. To be eligible for protection under the Succeed Act, immigrants must have arrived before the age of 16 and been in the United States since June 15, 2012.The Succeed Act also makes immigrants apply for conditional status for the first 10 years, similar to the work permits offered under DACA, after which they are allowed access to a green card. However, unlike other green card holders, those eligible under the Succeed Act would not be allowed to use their green cards to help other family members become legal residents. After five years as a green card holder, a person would be able to apply to become an American citizen.The Dream Act is considerably more lenient.\u201cI appreciate that my colleagues recognize the need to pass legislation giving a path to citizenship to Dreamers, young immigrants who were brought here as children and grew up in this country \u2014 so do 75 percent of the American people,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois who authored the Dream Act with Mr. Hatch. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said, the Republican bill \u201cfalls short.\u201dMr. Lankford said he had talked to Mr. Trump about the bill and that the president indicated he would support it. Mr. Lankford also pushed back on conservatives who argue that legalizing so-called Dreamers would take jobs from other Americans.\u201cIt actually hurts us to pull those individuals out of the economy,\u201d Mr. Lankford said of the young working immigrants. \u201cThis is not an amnesty bill where we take those individuals and say, \u2018We are going to give you a quick route to citizenship,\u2019 and just ignore the realities of what happened coming in.\u201dThe Republican bill\u2019s extended timeline led some activists such as Greisa Mart\u00ednez, a DACA recipient and advocacy director at United We Dream, to come out against it.\u201cRepublican Senators have created a new, partisan bill which leaves out many immigrant youth, requires us to sign away our day in court and walk on eggshells for 15 years,\u201d Ms. Mart\u00ednez said in a statement. \u201cWe demand a real solution to clean up the extreme danger that Republicans have put us in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Southern Magazines, Easy Pleasures and Hard Questions", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen Mr. Reece recounted his website\u2019s origin story, one he suffuses with a dash of the providential. It was originally going to be a breezy celebration of Southern cocktail culture, he said, until he and his friends hit on that curious name. \u201cBitter Southerner\u201d suggested a more ambitious mission. \u201cWe basically spent a year trying to figure out what that name was telling us to do,\u201d he said.And this, in essence, is what they heard: \u201cCross out the \u2018i\u2019 and add an \u2018e\u2019,\u201d Mr. Reece said. \u201cBitter\u201d would become \u201cbetter.\u201d This website was going to try to fix the South.In the last four years, The Bitter Southerner has emerged, on a shoestring budget, as a kind of kitchen-sink New Yorker for the region. It has tackled issues of race, class, crime and capital punishment, and published profiles of Southern farmers, bartenders, beekeepers, gay teenagers, spiritualists and civil rights pioneers. Begun as a hobby, the web-only magazine now has 100,000 visitors per month, a small staff and a cult readership that supports its journalism with the purchase of T-shirts that broadcast Mr. Reece\u2019s vision of inclusiveness (\u201cAll Y\u2019all\u201d) and the good life (\u201cDrink More Whiskey\u201d).Along the way, it is trying to manage a tension that has long dogged Southern publications: How much to sing the song of the South, especially amid genuine evidence of racial progress, and how much to be a skeptical voice in a place where issues of race and class often shadow conversations about even the most innocent pleasures?On the other end of the spectrum is Scalawag, a Durham, N.C., based nonprofit quarterly begun in 2015 by a three 20-somethings, with an unapologetic left-wing agenda and dispatches from self-identified queer Appalachia, gentrifying East Nashville and North Carolina\u2019s death row. Its circulation is about 1,500, and it does not review cocktail bars. Its motto: \u201cReckoning With the South.\u201d\u201cThe South is not this homogeneous place \u2014 it has a deep history, a really full history, and one that\u2019s not just for the upper class,\u201d said Alysia Nicole Harris, 29, an African-American who grew up in Virginia and is an editor in chief of Scalawag. \u201cThe demographics are changing. And ultimately, we believe that the South is going to be the voice that emerges to lead this conversation about trauma and healing, because here is where the trauma was the thickest.\u201dSomewhere in the middle is The Oxford American, the venerable literary journal, less overtly polemical than Scalawag, but more apt to tackle the hard questions than Garden & Gun, in part by publishing some of the region\u2019s best black authors. Here one finds the poet Nikky Finney spinning a \u201cradical libretto\u201d of slavery days and beyond; the cultural critic Zandria F. Robinson measuring the distance, in memoir, between Memphis and the Mississippi Delta; the novelist Kiese Laymon describing how the Atlanta hip-hop duo OutKast shaped his art.The most compelling contribution of the Atlanta-based Bitter Southerner may be the voice of Mr. Reece, the kind of 21st-century Southerner not always heard beyond the confines of the place. His is a white voice, simultaneously proud and conscience-stricken, screaming to be heard over the stock-car roar but always cognizant that there are other voices, in other flavors, that may deserve a hearing even more.\u201cIf you are a person who buys the states\u2019 rights argument \u2026 or you fly the rebel flag in your front yard \u2026 or you still think women look really nice in hoop skirts, we politely suggest you find other amusements on the web. The Bitter Southerner is not for you,\u201d Mr. Reece wrote when the site began publishing in August 2013. \u201cThe Bitter Southerner is for the rest of us. It is about the South that the rest of us know: the one we live in today and the one we hope to create in the future.\u201dWhen I returned to the South three years ago to work as a correspondent for The New York Times, The Bitter Southerner was gaining some buzz, but I was leery. Mr. Reece has written that his site exists \u201cto support anyone who yearns to claim their Southern identity proudly and without shame,\u201d and I suppose I think of my Southern identity as something less to claim than to puzzle out. The summer 2017 issue of The Oxford American features an essay by Harrison Scott Key, in which he describes his experience of playing in a Southern R&B band as a kid. I played in one, too. Apparently we shared the same small epiphany:\u201cWe played for friends here and there, and we sounded O.K. \u2014 but something was missing,\u201d Mr. Key wrote. \u201cOn the outside, we were white, but on the inside, we were also white. And inside that inner whiteness, there existed a deeper shade of white that knew things, such as how our good fortunes had come pretty easy, at least compared to the people we sang about in the songs we played.\u201dBut I like Mr. Reece\u2019s magazine, which, like any great periodical, feels like it is of its moment. At Kimball House, Mr. Reece held forth on a range of Southern topics both frivolous and deep: The introduction of okra as a cheap New World food supply for enslaved Africans. (\u201cYou can\u2019t write a story about how wonderful a thing gumbo is without acknowledging that it is an undeserved gift.\u201d) The mixology skills of New Orleans bartenders. (\u201cThere are old bars where folks never stopped doing it right.\u201d) His interview with the Atlanta rapper Killer Mike (\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not that different from people you call redneck. I drive a truck. I like to fish.\u2019\u201d) And Southern millennials, born into a world where correctives to the Lost Cause myth are only a couple of clicks away.They are an important part, he said, of The Bitter Southerner\u2019s target audience.\u201cWe have ancestors, recent ancestors, who grew up a certain way, and never challenged that way of thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got all of these kids who have all of the world\u2019s information at their fingertips. And they have the courage\u201d \u2014 Mr. Reece used a more earthy phrase here \u2014 \u201cto challenge it.\u201dMr. Reece grew up in tiny Ellijay, Ga., in the Appalachian foothills, raising hogs with the Future Farmers of America and working in a record store for credit that he spent on punk rock records.In 1979, he attended the University of Georgia, in Athens, where new cultural currents were percolating in a Southern context. He took in both the early music of R.E.M. and the art of Howard Finster, the rural Georgia preacher whose self-taught painting was full of otherworldly vision. Backwoods preaching was the kind of thing Mr. Reece thought he had moved to Athens to escape. Now he discovered the wonder in what he had shunned.These days, The Bitter Southerner is his only full time job \u2014 a labor of love, he says, but one that pays a small fraction of his old work in corporate communications. In the early 1990s, Mr. Reece served as press secretary for Gov. Zell Miller, the Georgia Democrat best remembered for railing against his own party at the 2004 Republican convention.The publication\u2019s challenge is to reflect a modern South that has one foot in the craft cocktail lounge and one in the racial violence of Charlottesville, a reflection of what Patterson Hood, the leader of the Southern alternative rock band Drive-By Truckers, calls \u201cthe duality of the Southern thing.\u201dThey spoke of the articles to come. Mr. Reece said they might run something on the novelist Thomas Dixon Jr., whose writings inspired the racist 1915 silent film \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d and celebrated the white backlash that brought an end to Reconstruction.\u201cBasically a lot of what you see becoming manifest in alt-right philosophy today has antecedents in Dixon\u2019s writing,\u201d Mr. Reece said.\u201cDark week,\u201d Ms. Tibbs Jones said. \u201cWe need to follow that up with some azaleas.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Roofs everywhere, he wrote, were being torn off by the powerful storm\u2019s winds. He himself had to be rescued from his official residence.\u201cWe will need help, my friend, we will need help of all kinds,\u201d he said, describing the damage as \u201cmind-boggling.\u201dAnd then silence. From Mr. Skerrit \u2014 and, it appears, from the rest of the island.As the storm, described by the National Hurricane Center as \u201cpotentially catastrophic,\u201d moved toward the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Tuesday, little could be learned about the conditions on Dominica. By early Tuesday morning, phone and internet signals on Dominica appeared to be down, leaving the island virtually incommunicado.The island of 72,000 was hit with maximum sustained winds of nearly 160 miles per hour.He said the island\u2019s immediate priority was to rescue people who were trapped and provide medical care to the injured. \u201cI am honestly not preoccupied with physical damage at this time, because it is devastating \u2026 indeed, mind boggling,\u201d Mr. Skerrit said.Early reports suggested that the neighboring islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique had not been as badly hit as Dominica, though at least one person was killed on Guadeloupe, by a falling tree, officials in the French overseas territory reported. Officials in Guadeloupe also said that two people were reported missing after their boat sank off the island of D\u00e9sirade, part of the territory\u2019s archipelago.Guadeloupe residents were struck less by the power of the slow-moving storm than how long it lingered.\u201cWe spent the whole night holding a door that was shaking,\u201d said Colette Cyrille, 52. \u201cWe tried to put beds, tables, wood, anything to keep it shut.

Two people reported minor injuries, two localities lost water service and between 25,000 and 33,000 households lost power.But some restaurants on the beaches were badly damaged, including in Le Carbet, in the northwest part of Martinique.\u201cThis is a disaster for Le Carbet,\u201d Marcel Palmont, a restaurant owner, told a local news site. \u201cThe economy of the restaurants took a big hit. I have been here for 25 years. I have rebuilt four times. I think it will be the last time.\u201dJacques Witkowski, France\u2019s head of civil security, said he had ordered local officials on Martinique to make a reconnaissance flight over Dominica to survey the damage. If the government there requires help, the French authorities will send rescue teams to the island, he said at a news conference in Paris on Tuesday morning.Around 250 military personnel and firefighters are scheduled to leave from France\u2019s mainland to its overseas territories on Thursday, complementing a force of 4,600 military personnel and search-and-rescue teams already on French islands in the Caribbean, Mr. Witkowski said.As the hurricane blew west-northwest through the Caribbean on Tuesday morning, residents in the British Virgin Islands raced to prepare for its arrival. The debris left behind by Hurricane Irma is still piled high on the sides of roads and homes remain damaged, but crews operating heavy machinery were trying to clear as much of the wreckage as possible Tuesday morning while marina workers secured boats.\u201cWe are all stressed trying to finish what needs to be done before we have to hunker down,\u201d said Christine Perakis, who rents an apartment on Tortola where she weathered Hurricane Irma. \u201cWhat makes us hopeful is that we took Irma head-on, and this one is about 60 miles away.\u201dFor Hurricane Maria, Ms. Perakis was staying with friends who live in the island\u2019s marina and have opened their home to outsiders. For now, there is food and water as they count down to another hurricane, holed up inside the house.\u201cI don\u2019t know what they did to get two hurricanes in a row,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll gladly do some rain dances to stop this.\u201dKirk Semple reported from Mexico City, and Azam Ahmed from Miami Beach.

{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Greatest Brexit Obstacle: Itself", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd right now the fiercest are in London.On Thursday the British government pressed ahead with what was supposed to be one of the easy parts of quitting the 28-nation bloc, introducing a parliamentary bill that essentially cuts and pastes European Union law onto the British statute book to ensure continuity when Britain leaves.\u201cThere is going to be continuous low-level warfare within a party that is so divided,\u201d said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThere is a lot of posturing, a lot of signaling.\u201dThat has turned discussions in Brussels into a \u201cphony war,\u201d said Mr. Menon, adding the European Union finds itself negotiating with \u201ca moving target.\u201dThere has been almost no progress in Brussels on the issues that need to be resolved before a long-term trade deal between the two sides can be addressed, and European officials are plainly unimpressed.Minutes from a meeting in July recorded that Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive, questioned \u201cthe stability and accountability\u201d of Britain\u2019s main Brexit negotiator, David Davis.For his part, Mr. Davis is convinced that a political deal will ultimately be done because continental Europe is a net exporter of goods to Britain. But this is a high-stakes gamble since Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc in 2019, the clock is ticking and British business is desperate for some certainty.The Europeans insist that before discussing future trade ties, there must be progress on issues like the rights of European citizens in post-Brexit Britain (and those of Britons in continental Europe); the future of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland; and Britain\u2019s agreement to pay billions of euros to settle commitments made as member nation.A deal on British payments could be politically explosive within the Conservative Party, where a hard-line faction wants to pay nothing at all and simply engineer a clean break with the bloc, whatever the economic damage.Other Conservative lawmakers accept the need to protect the economy, but the more access Mrs. May wants to Europe\u2019s single market, the more she will have to compromise over money, immigration policy and accepting elements of European law.Having lost her parliamentary majority, Mrs. May cannot afford to upset too many of the lawmakers on either side of the toxic debate over Europe, because it would take 48 of her party\u2019s legislators to challenge, and probably end, her leadership. So the equivocation goes on, and the moment when Mrs. May confronts the tough trade-offs is pushed back.Brexit is also divisive for Labour, the main opposition party, but at least it provides a chance to harry the government.On Thursday there was no let up either from Brussels, where its chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, criticized Britain\u2019s proposals for the Northern Ireland border. At the same time, the former president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, told the BBC that chances of trade negotiations going ahead in October, as Britain hopes, were \u201cin the neighborhood of zero.\u201dEven Britain\u2019s chief negotiator, Mr. Davis, has dialed down his trademark optimism over the talks, telling lawmakers recently that \u201cnobody has ever pretended this would be simple or easy.\u201dUnfortunately that is not entirely true. As Keir Starmer, who speaks for Labour on Brexit, pointed out, Mr. Davis\u2019s cabinet colleague, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, once argued that negotiations for a trade deal with the European Union would be \u201cone of the easiest in human history.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For a Preview of the Border Wall, Look to California", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 On a dusty patch of land surrounded by a chain-link fence near the border here, workers this week began shoveling ground for a large-scale prototype for a border wall with Mexico.The eight different models of President Trump\u2019s promised wall will range from 18 to 30 feet tall. Four will be made of concrete and four will use \u201cother materials.\u201d They are being built in a carefully protected area not far from a field, where, decades ago, Mexican migrants once openly gathered before crossing into the United States illegally.But in many ways a preview for a wall, and what it can and cannot accomplish, has been here for nearly two decades. Stretching roughly 20 miles along the southern edge of California and into the Pacific Ocean are two layers of steel and concrete, the toughest barrier in the country.The state has long been at the center of the debate over how to stop illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America. Now, the rest of the country is once again turning to the region that has long grappled with border security to see what the future of enforcement might look like.And despite California\u2019s role as the epicenter for opposition to Mr. Trump, the administration apparently never considered placing the models of a would-be wall anywhere else.Perhaps nobody relishes the region\u2019s return to the spotlight as much as Representative Duncan D. Hunter, a Republican whose district covers suburban and rural San Diego. Mr. Hunter\u2019s father also represented the area for years in Congress, spending much of his time in office pushing for more and stronger barriers on the border. Mr. Hunter calls the current fence a \u201cshining example of what a border wall could do.\u201d\u201cI told Trump that if you want to look at a model, it\u2019s done, it\u2019s in San Diego where you have almost no illegal immigration,\u201d Mr. Hunter said. \u201cCall it a fence, call it a wall. It\u2019s completely changed the area and made the border safe to live.\u201dIndeed, illegal immigration here has slowed to barely a trickle. The number of migrants apprehended in the region while trying to cross illegally is now about 5 percent of what it once was: roughly 32,000 a year compared to a peak of nearly 630,000 in 1986, according to the United States Border Patrol.But many of the migrants have gone elsewhere, to more dangerous and deadly routes through Arizona and the Rio Grande Valley. And immigration from Mexico over all has declined drastically, as a bustling economy has convinced many not to move north. The infrastructure and enforcement has cost billions of dollars \u2014 not only to build the barriers, but also to continually repair and patrol them.Just a few miles from where the prototypes are going up, Dick Tynan can easily see a hill on the other side of the Mexican border from the front lawn of his small horse ranch where he has lived for decades. On a recent evening, he recalled how two decades ago he used to pull out a lawn chair to watch the hundreds of men and women gather on the hill every afternoon and wait for sunset, when they would run across the border and down into the ranches and stables that line the small river here.So many people would play soccer on the patch of dirt while they waited that the area was named the \u201csoccer field\u201d \u2014 a term many locals still use, though it has been decades since any games have been played there.In the 1980s, roughly half of all Mexican immigrants to the United States came through Tijuana, and the overwhelming majority went through the soccer field, according to research from El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a think tank in Tijuana.\u201cThere\u2019d be a mess of people all the time; it was just chaos. You\u2019d watch them come down \u2014 there was nobody going after them. It was open season,\u201d Mr. Tynan said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what we said, who we complained to. There was just nothing anyone did about it.\u201dBut then he watched a fence go up in the 1990s: First came sheet metal \u2014 surplus helicopter landing pads turned on their side \u2014 then concrete columns that reached up to 18 feet. Now there is razor wire, and border patrol agents on horses or in trucks keep watch along the road every day, sometimes every hour. Eventually the immigrants stopped crossing where he could see them.Today, one of the most prominent features of the area is the sprawling outlet mall that abuts the barbed-wire barrier. A tidy subdivision of stucco homes is just across the street.No other section of the border is subject to as much monitoring and has as many physical barriers as the San Diego area\u2019s, which is supported by double-layer fencing, stadium lighting and video surveillance. San Ysidro, the point of entry here, remains the busiest border crossing in the country; half of all entries into the United States pass through it. After years of complaints of long waits from drivers from Mexico, a $740 million expansion of the vehicle crossing is now underway, intended to increase cross-border business.\u201cThere has been a massive effort and expense to create a border that is unlike anything else,\u201d said Wayne Cornelius, a professor at University of California, San Diego, who has studied the region for decades. \u201cWhat it did more than anything is reroute the flows. It created a balloon effect to send people elsewhere and pay smugglers more to get them through.\u201dIn the 1990s, images of immigrants dashing over the border and running across freeways were captured by news cameras and replayed night after night on television, fueling a fierce debate over who should be allowed in and how. Politicians \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 from all parts of the country trekked here to denounce what they saw as unfettered illegal immigration.\u201cAnyone who lives here remembers the time when they would wake up to someone in the backyard or garage,\u201d said Mayor Serge Dedina of Imperial Beach, who grew up in the area and remembers a time when the border was viewed almost as a combat zone, with hundreds of migrants regularly entering illegally. \u201cWe\u2019re nothing like that anymore. The reality is that very little about the border here feels the same now.\u201dThis time around, though, the political climate is very different. Opponents to the wall say that the barrier here was just one small factor in driving down the number of immigrants coming through illegally, arguing that the strong Mexican economy has been the major factor keeping would-be migrants from crossing. A wall through most of the southern border, they say, would move people and drugs to the most rugged terrain, as it has done here.California officials have continued to resist, arguing that there is already strict enforcement at the border and that a wall would do little more than antagonize Mexican allies. Last week, State Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, filed a lawsuit claiming that the plan to build a wall violated federal environmental laws and relied on statutes that do not authorize such projects in the area.\u201cIf you take Trump at his word, he\u2019s talking about some big medieval structure \u2014 a wall is a wall is a wall,\u201d Mr. Becerra said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re now in the 21st century and realize that there are all kinds of barriers that combine to give true border security, which is something all of us want. But we\u2019ve jumped beyond medieval walls.\u201dLocal officials are also bracing themselves for what some believe could be huge protests near the building area, like those at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation over the Dakota Access Pipeline.Mr. Trump has given mixed messages on just what the wall would look like, recently saying that it would need to have \u201ctransparency.\u201d Customs and Border Protection officials are not releasing any renderings or details of the prototypes, which were chosen from hundreds of proposals. The prototypes will cost between $300,000 and $500,000 each; estimates for a wall along the entire 2,000 mile border are in the tens of billions of dollars.Despite California\u2019s tough enforcement apparatus, problems with the border still exist: The flow of drugs, weapons and would-be migrants is a daily reality. Earlier that morning, before sunrise, one of the patrol dogs alerted officers to a 2010 Chevy Cobalt as a 52-year-old American citizen waited to drive it through the checkpoint. When officers examined the car, they found 31 packages of methamphetamine wrapped in plastic and hidden inside the rear bumper. On the street, officers said, the three-dozen pounds of drugs would fetch about $115,000.\u201cThere\u2019s a persistence of criminal organizations that are constantly trying to get drugs on the other side,\u201d said Mark Endicott, a Border Patrol agent who has worked in the region for decades. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with low-level players who are constantly figuring out ways to change what they are doing to avoid getting caught.\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t effective they wouldn\u2019t try it,\u201d Mr. Endicott said.While few try to reach above the eight-foot-tall fence that blocks the roughly 15 miles between San Diego and Tijuana, many still try to go beneath it and smugglers are routinely caught. In the last decade, drug cartels have created highly sophisticated tunnels in the region to get drugs through. For agents like Mr. Endicott, patrolling the border can still feel like a cat-and-mouse game: The officers change how they guard, and the smugglers change what they do.\u201cMaybe one day there will finally be concertina wire over everything,\u201d Mr. Endicott said. \u201cIt slows people down, but so far nothing we have done has stopped people from trying.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Detains Critics as New Crown Prince Consolidates Power", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Saudi Arabia has begun a wide-ranging crackdown against perceived opponents of the policies of the kingdom\u2019s new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Over the last week, 16 people were held, their friends, relatives and associates said in interviews. They include prominent Islamic clerics, academics, a poet, an economist, a journalist, the head of a youth organization, at least two women and one prince, a son of a former king.Some of them were taken from their homes in unannounced raids by security forces, and their computers, cellphones and personal papers were seized, the friends and relatives said. Those arrested have been held incommunicado, and it is not clear if they have been formally charged with crimes. Saudi Arabia has not publicly released any evidence it might have against them.Saudi activists have circulated lists of 30 or more people they say have been detained, but the scale and goals of the crackdown remain unclear, even to those who fear they could be targeted.\u201cIt is absurd,\u201d said Jamal Khashoggi, a veteran Saudi journalist who has advised the Saudi government and is now staying in the United States because he fears arrest if he returns home. He dismissed the idea promoted by government supporters on social media that the detained individuals were plotting against the country.\u201cThere were no conspiracies,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was nothing that called for such arrests. They are not the members of a political organization, and they represent different points of view.\u201dSaudi officials did not respond to requests for comments.While many of the proposed changes are popular with Saudis and hailed as necessary for the kingdom\u2019s future, some see the 32-year-old prince as a power-hungry upstart who is endangering the kingdom by overturning decades of tradition. Even if the reforms work, they could hit many Saudis in the wallet, lowering their standard of living.Others have cheered the arrests, accusing the detainees of working to destabilize the kingdom and suggesting the names of others they believe are beholden to foreign powers.Saudi Arabia, where political parties are banned and the news media tightly controlled, has long had tight restrictions on expression, but the government has signaled even less tolerance now for dissenting views.On Monday, as the arrests were picking up, the State Security Directorate announced that it had arrested and was investigating a number of Saudis and foreigners who were working \u201cfor the benefit of foreign parties against the security of the kingdom.\u201dA day later, a Twitter account run by the Interior Ministry, which oversees the security forces, called on Saudi citizens to report anyone who \u201cpublished terrorist or extremist ideas\u201d via the governmental cellphone application \u201cWe Are All Security\u201d that was designed to facilitate crime reporting.None of those arrested had publicly called for the overthrow of the government or for acts of extremism. But since the government has branded Qatar a supporter of terrorism, any show of support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s small neighbor is suspect.Mr. Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist, said the only characteristic the detained shared was that they had not vocally joined the condemnation of Qatar.\u201cThey are the silent or the people who refused to jump in the wagon with the government in its campaign against Qatar,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saw that this was not the thing to do, but they did not go against the government.\u201dAfter a telephone call between Prince Mohammed and the emir of Qatar, Shiekh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, Mr. Awda wrote on Twitter that he hoped they would reconcile.He was arrested from his home over the weekend and has not been heard from since, according three Saudis who know him. Like other associates of the detained, they spoke on condition of anonymity for fear that they, too, could be arrested.That is what happened to Mr. Awda\u2019s brother, Khalid, who was arrested after tweeting about his brother\u2019s arrest.Prince Abdulaziz, who had upset the government with his Twitter feed, was confined to a palace in the Saudi city of Mecca earlier this month after meeting King Salman at the end of the hajj pilgrimage. It remains unclear whether he is still there or is now being held elsewhere.Even longtime dissidents have been surprised by the arrest campaign.\u201cWhat is happening, I haven\u2019t seen it in my life,\u201d said Abdulaziz al-Hussan, a Saudi lawyer who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States after falling afoul of the government for his political activism.The government had long managed nonviolent dissidents quietly, by summoning them to security offices for scolding and making them sign vows to stay in line before releasing them, he said. But this time, he said, the government had sent security forces to their homes to arrest them in front of their wives and children, as they would do with suspected terrorists.Mr. Hussan said he believed the crackdown was an effort by the crown prince to shore up his power, and called the action an overreaction because little organized political opposition remained in the kingdom.\u201cNo one is going to take away your rule or keep you from becoming king,\u201d he said, rhetorically addressing Crown Prince Mohammed. \u201cIt\u2019s really a joke.\u201dAlso arrested was Essam al-Zamil, a writer and economist who had taken to Twitter to express doubts about the plan to privatize a portion of Saudi Aramco, the state oil monopoly. Mr. Zamil later deleted the posts.He was joined by Ziyad bin Naheet, a poet who had used social media to praise the country and its policies. His friends assumed he had been arrested for criticizing the harsh rhetoric against Qatar.The largest number of those arrested were clerics, some of them Islamist activists who had links to the Muslim Brotherhood, which Saudi Arabia considers a terrorist organization.But not all. Hassan al-Maliki had written that Wahhabism, the ultraconservative strain of Islam promoted by the Saudi state, fueled extremism by demonizing non-Muslims. He, too, was arrested, his son Alabbas wrote on Twitter.Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Coming War on Business", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe only time I saw Sam Francis face-to-face \u2014 in the Washington Times cafeteria sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s \u2014 I thought he was a crank, but it\u2019s clear now that he was at that moment becoming one of the most prescient writers of the past 50 years. There\u2019s very little Donald Trump has done or said that Francis didn\u2019t champion a quarter century ago.In a series of essays for conservative magazines like Chronicles, Francis hammered home three key insights. The first was that globalization was screwing Middle America. The Cold War had just ended, capitalism seemed triumphant and the Clinton years seemed to be an era of broad prosperity. But Francis stressed that the service economy was ruining small farms and taking jobs from the working class.His second insight was that the Republican and conservative establishment did not understand what was happening. He railed against the pro-business \u201cEconomic Men\u201d who thought G.D.P. growth could solve the nation\u2019s problems, and the Washington Republicans, who he thought were infected with the values of the educated elites.In 1991, when his political mentor, Pat Buchanan, was contemplating a presidential bid, Francis told him to break with the conservative movement. \u201cThese people are defunct,\u201d Francis told Buchanan. \u201cGo to New Hampshire and call yourself a patriot, a nationalist, an America Firster, but don\u2019t even use the word \u2018conservative.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore.\u201dHis third insight was that politics was no longer about left versus right. Instead, a series of smaller conflicts \u2014 religious versus secular, nationalist versus globalist, white versus nonwhite \u2014 were all merging into a larger polarity, ruling class versus Middle America.\u201cMiddle American groups are more and more coming to perceive their exploitation at the hands of the dominant elites. The exploitation works on several fronts \u2014 economically, by hypertaxation and the design of a globalized economy dependent on exports and services in place of manufacturing; culturally, by the managed destruction of Middle American norms and institutions; and politically, by the regimentation of Middle Americans under the federal leviathan.\u201dMiddle American voters, he wrote, were stuck without a party, appalled by pro-corporate Republican economic policies on the one hand and liberal cultural radicalism on the other. They swung to whichever party seemed most likely to resist the ruling class, but neither party really provided a solution. \u201cA nationalist reaction is almost inevitable and will probably assume populist form when it arrives. The sooner it comes the better.\u201dFrancis urged Buchanan to run an unorthodox campaign (of the sort Trump ended up running), and was ignored. \u201cIf Buchanan loses the nomination, it will be because his time has not yet come,\u201d Francis wrote. The moment would end up coming in 2016, 11 years after Francis\u2019 death.Francis\u2019 thought was infected by the same cancer that may destroy Trumpism. Francis was a racist. His friends and allies counseled him not to express his racist views openly, but people like that always go there, sooner or later.The Civil War was an open wound for many in his circle, and in 1994 Francis told a conference, \u201cThe civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people, nor is there any reason to believe that the civilization can be successfully transmitted to a different people.\u201dHe was fired by The Washington Times and cast out of the conservative movement by William F. Buckley and others.When you look at today\u2019s world through the prism of Francis\u2019 work, a few things seem clear: Trump is not a one-time phenomenon; the populist tide has been rising for years. His base sticks with him through scandal because it\u2019s not just about him; it\u2019s a movement defined against the so-called ruling class. Congressional Republicans get all tangled on health care and other issues because they don\u2019t understand their voters. Finally, Trump may not be the culmination, but merely a way station toward an even purer populism.Trump is nominally pro-business. The next populism will probably take his ethnic nationalism and add an anti-corporate, anti-tech layer. Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple stand for everything Francis hated \u2014 economically, culturally, demographically and nationalistically.As the tech behemoths intrude more deeply into daily life and our very minds, they will become a defining issue in American politics. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if a new demagogue emerged, one that is even more pure Francis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Why Move Up the 2020 Presidential Primary?", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.California may have the most people in the nation, but when it comes to nominating a president, it is relegated to the sidelines. The primary here comes late \u2014 in 2016, it rolled around in June \u2014 by which point the party is pretty much over.State leaders are trying to fix that. Again. Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation this week that would move the 2020 presidential primaries to March 3. \u201cCandidates will not be able to ignore the largest, most diverse state in the nation as they seek our country\u2019s highest office,\u201d said Alex Padilla, the Secretary of State.But will they? When California tried this before, other states quickly followed \u2014 leapfrogging ahead or landing on the same day, as happened in 2008, making California just one of many states shouting for attention on Super Tuesday, which fell on Feb 5. And influence? In 2008, California Democrats chose Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama. (California Republicans picked right, choosing John McCain over Mitt Romney).Raymond Buckley, the longtime leader of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said he was not worried that California might dislodge his state from the dominance it has long enjoyed at the start of the process. \u201cHave you seen it happen in the past?\u201d he asked.And Tom Vilsack, the former Democratic governor of Iowa, which has first-in-the-nation caucuses, said California could cause headaches for his party by forcing candidates to spend resources in a vast state like this. \u201cIf any large state is moved up it places an even greater premium on money,\u201d Mr. Vilsack said. \u201cI find that of interest since many party leaders complain about the role money plays in our politics. If anything moving up the calendar may make it harder for a lesser-known candidate to be given a real chance at being the nominee.\u201dRicardo Lara, the Democratic state senator who sponsored the bill, said that risk was worth taking. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be expensive to campaign in California,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather err on the side of giving us a greater voice and allowing us to be more influential as a state.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The grove is home to some of the world\u2019s largest redwoods \u2014 at heights of more than 320 feet and diameters as wide as 26 feet \u2014 tucked inside a dense forest in far northern California.If word got out, the fear was people would flock there and trample the trees\u2019 delicate root system.That, park officials now say, is precisely what happened.\u201cOur total visitation kind of just skyrocketed,\u201d said Brett Silver, a supervising ranger at California State Parks. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like an L.A. freeway system out there.\u201dBy 2011, map coordinates were published online. Waves of visitors followed, carving trails through the underbrush and compressing the soil atop the redwoods\u2019 shallow roots.Park officials have now reluctantly accepted a new reality: the Grove of Titans is a full-fledged tourist destination.A plan is moving forward to construct a $1.4 million boardwalk that lets visitors view the trees without setting foot on the forest floor.For Mr. Silver, who\u2019s worked in the park for 13 years, the public fascination with the Grove of Titans has been somewhat baffling.\u201cThere are just as impressive trees on other trails in the park. That\u2019s my thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those trees don\u2019t have names.

{"Headline": "In New York Suburbs, Plenty of Democrats \u2014 Just Not at the Top", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn this picture-book village on Long Island Sound, where owners of the generously proportioned Tudors and Dutch Colonials have long been overwhelmingly Democratic, a sense of political immediacy has clearly taken hold.But whether this energy filters down to local races remains to be seen.In November, voters in Westchester County will choose a county executive. Dismayed by Washington and the direction of the Republican Party, many Democrats say they are ready for change. And yet, even in a county where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1, only two Democratic county executives have led Westchester since the 1930s.The story is the same in Nassau County, where Democrats slightly outnumber Republicans and yet the Democratic hopeful for county executive, Laura Curran, is also seeking to become the third Democrat to hold that position in 80 years.With Election Day less than two months away, and both county executive posts up for grabs, Democrats are hoping to capitalize on the growing antagonism to President Trump among progressive voters.\u201cRob Astorino is a conservative, conservative Republican who has identified with the Trump campaign,\u201d said Michael Edelman, a longtime political commentator who bolted from the Republican Party to become an independent three years ago amid the Tea Party revolution. \u201cSo that\u2019s an albatross around his neck.\u201d\u201cMartins doesn\u2019t look like a pushover and the Democrats have also had scandals in Nassau,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran New York political consultant. \u201cBut the Democratic registration has increased and that should help Laura Curran. So on registration and Trump, she has the edge.\u201dStill, the Democratic candidates in both Nassau and Westchester concede that voter turnout will be critical to their success. In off election years like this one, without a presidential or gubernatorial race to draw people to the ballot, Democrats tend to stay home.On primary night in Nassau, for instance, less than 8 percent of registered Democrats voted, fewer than the percentage that cast ballots in the 2013 primary election, dousing confidence in a so-called Trump bump in November. Turnout was similarly low in Westchester.\u201cCertainly there are people who are motivated by the national scene and the Trump effect could lure them to the polls,\u201d said George Latimer, the Democrat who will oppose Mr. Astorino. Mr. Latimer defeated a county legislator, Ken Jenkins, to win the Westchester primary.\u201cBut many of the Democrats \u2014 they really don\u2019t focus on the small towns,\u201d he added. \u201cThey commute to the city and come back at night. The village looks nice; there are nice services. The townies tend to vote more.\u201dPolitical pundits note that, in fact, the county portion of a homeowner\u2019s tax bill is relatively small \u2014 around 15 to 20 percent \u2014 while school taxes make up the lion\u2019s share. Mr. Edelman, who counts Mr. Astorino as a friend, nonetheless faulted him for his no-tax ideology. Mr. Astorino boasts that he has shrunk the county work force by 16 percent and cut the county tax levy by 2 percent over his eight years in office.\u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful guy; we play golf,\u201d Mr. Edelman said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the point. The point is math.\u201d About 80 percent of the county property tax pays for expenses that are mandated by the state, giving the county discretion over a small fraction of the tax bill.\u201cSo when you say you are not raising taxes, you are saving a taxpayer who pays 10,000 a year in property taxes $20 a month,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd what are you doing to save that? You are cutting social services and co-opting the ability of the county to function financially.\u201dBut Mr. Astorino, who waged an unsuccessful run against Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in 2014, is unbowed in his commitment to fiscal austerity. While the county government has contracted, some 44,000 jobs were created in the private sector, he said.\u201cDonald Trump is not running in November and people know who I am and what we have been doing here for eight years,\u201d said Mr. Astorino, 50, whom some political observers predict will again challenge Mr. Cuomo next year. \u201cThey are going to vote on pocketbook issues here in Westchester. Taxes, jobs, the economy \u2013 that\u2019s what people care about.\u201d\u201cIf you are a in an upstate county, where 85 percent of the people have guns, that\u2019s different,\u201d Mr. Latimer, 63, said. \u201cIn Westchester, far more people have no guns than own guns. So my attitude is don\u2019t have a show like that; it\u2019s not our lifestyle.\u201dIn Nassau County, taxes have also floated to the top of political debates, with both Mr. Martins and Ms. Curran deploring the burden they place on residents. But ethics \u2014 more than property taxes \u2014 has dominated the race there.The supervisor of the Town of Oyster Bay, John Venditto, was charged along with Mr. Mangano, the county executive, and his wife, Linda, in what prosecutors said was a bribery and kickback scheme dating to 2010. The indictments further rattled Republicans in the county \u2014 home to the former State Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, who was convicted last year on corruption charges.Not surprisingly, Mr. Martins, a former mayor of Mineola, has sought to distance himself from the corruption scandals, calling for Mr. Mangano\u2019s resignation. He has also proposed a new code of ethics for the county that would enhance the vetting of prospective employees and the review of county contracts to prevent conflicts of interest.\u201cYou need to pay more than lip service to restoring public confidence in government\u201d said Mr. Martins, a 50-year-old father of four whose family has a construction business. \u201cYou need to understand that there are checks and balances and accountability and transparency.\u201dMs. Curran, a former reporter for The Daily News and The New York Post, has her own ethics plan. Among other things, she wants to beef up financial disclosure forms, enact term limits for county officials and strengthen the county\u2019s whistle-blower law. She has portrayed Mr. Martins as part of the corrupt Republican machine, reminding voters that he attended a fund-raiser for the Senate Republican Campaign Committee that was hosted by Mr. Skelos after his indictment.\u201cWherever I go in this county, whether a Republican area or Democratic area, there is a common denominator and that is that people are fed up,\u201d said Ms. Curran, a 49-year-old mother of three. \u201cThey see their tax dollars being wasted on corruption. My opponent in this race is a product of this failed status quo.\"An earlier version of this article misstated the beneficiary of a fund-raiser.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Politics: Liberal, With One Big Exception", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSilicon Valley has long preferred to remain aloof from national politics, but the Trump era has altered that stance.A politically awakened Silicon Valley, buttressed by the tech industry\u2019s growing economic power, could potentially alter politics long after President Trump has left the scene. But if the tech industry becomes a political force, what sort of policies will it push?The survey suggests a novel but paradoxical vision of the future of American politics: Technologists could help push lawmakers, especially Democrats, further to the left on many social and economic issues. But they may also undermine the influence of some of the Democrats\u2019 most stalwart supporters, including labor unions. And they may strive to push Democrats away from regulation on business \u2014 including the growing calls for greater rules around the tech industry.Over all, the study showed that tech entrepreneurs are very liberal \u2014 among some of the most left-leaning Democrats you can find. They are overwhelmingly in favor of economic policies that redistribute wealth, including higher taxes on rich people and lots of social services for the poor, including universal health care. Their outlook is cosmopolitan and globalist \u2014 they support free trade and more open immigration, and they score low on measures of \u201cracial resentment.\u201dOn most culture-war issues, they are unrepentantly liberal. They oppose restrictions on abortion, favor gay rights, support gun control and oppose the death penalty.Now for the twist. The study found one area where tech entrepreneurs strongly deviate from Democratic orthodoxy and are closer to most Republicans: They are deeply suspicious of the government\u2019s efforts to regulate business, especially when it comes to labor. They said that it was too difficult for companies to fire people, and that the government should make it easier to do so. They also hope to see the influence of both private and public-sector unions decline.\u201cYou would think that people with enough money to influence the political system would obviously use that influence to increase social and economic inequality in ways that benefit them,\u201d said David Broockman, an assistant professor of political economy at Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business and a co-author of the study.\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising to us,\u201d he continued, \u201cis that you could find this group that says, \u2018Actually, our taxes should go up and more money should go to things like universal health care, or that we should do more to protect the environment\u2019 \u2014 but at the same time believes that regulations and labor unions are a problem.\u201dThe researchers deliberately chose to examine what they call the tech industry\u2019s \u201celites\u201d \u2014 not rank-and-file workers, but the millionaire and billionaire founders and executives who are best positioned to influence politics. The study is based on a detailed survey of more than 600 such elites around the country (only about a third are in the Bay Area) conducted in February. The researchers also surveyed Republican and Democratic donors and voters for comparisons.The researchers were interested in the tech elite because the politics of Silicon Valley have always been something of a mystery. Many of Silicon Valley\u2019s pioneers initially thought of themselves more as freewheeling revolutionaries than as capitalists bent on global economic domination. They were hippies and draft resisters, as enthusiastic about LSD as about microprocessors, and they brought to their work the tenets of the counterculture.The Stanford study thoroughly debunks the idea that tech is lousy with libertarians. The researchers asked respondents whether they agreed or disagreed with this statement: \u201cI would like to live in a society where government does nothing except provide national defense and police protection, so that people could be left alone to earn whatever they could.\u201dFewer than a quarter of the tech elite agreed with that view. Democrats were almost twice as likely to agree, and Republicans agreed by huge margins.But if they\u2019re not libertarians, what accounts for techies\u2019 opposition to regulation? One idea might be that it\u2019s driven by self-interest. A large fraction said they opposed regulating car-sharing services as if they were taxis, for instance; to the extent that the tech elite have a lot of money riding on the sharing economy, they may worry that regulation of such companies could hurt their wallets.Yet the survey also shows that tech elites are generally willing to support other policies that go against their interest. Huge majorities supported increasing spending on programs that only benefit the poorest Americans, as well as increasing taxes on people who earn more than $250,000 per year.To tease out whether self-interest was at play in their views on regulation, surveyors asked a question about Uber\u2019s surge-pricing policy, which increases prices during periods of peak demand. But the researchers disguised it with a business unrelated to tech: \u201cOn a holiday, when there is a great demand for flowers, sellers usually increase their prices. Do you think it is fair for them to raise their prices like this?\u201dA majority of Democrats and Republicans said it would be unfair for a florist to do that. But 96 percent of the tech elite thought it would be fair.\u201cMy guess is there\u2019s an underlying principle to their views,\u201d Dr. Broockman said. \u201cThey see an entrepreneur trying to do what they want in the marketplace, and they see nothing unfair about that.\u201dThe tech elite\u2019s mix of views is unique; no other group in the survey favored both greater wealth redistribution and laxer regulation. It is genuinely difficult to think of any politician who aligns with that mix.But Mr. Khanna is no opponent of regulation. He has favored greater enforcement of antitrust laws, and recently said he was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods. When I asked him about the survey\u2019s findings on techie views of labor unions, he was adamant that he didn\u2019t share them.\u201cI\u2019ve always been a very strong supporter of labor,\u201d he said.But the Stanford researchers suggest that over time, given technologists\u2019 money and influence over media, they may have the power to subtly alter Democratic lawmakers\u2019 views. Indeed, that may already be happening \u2014 already, the researchers said, the Democratic Party looks far less interested in curbing the tech industry\u2019s reach than it once did.Consider that President Bill Clinton\u2019s Department of Justice waged a major war against Microsoft\u2019s market power. Just a decade later, the next Democratic president, Barack Obama, took little interest in stemming tech giants\u2019 growing clout.\u201cThere\u2019s one obvious difference between those time periods,\u201d Dr. Malhotra said. \u201cThat difference is the rising influence of the technology industry in politics.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Central Bank Signals End of Cheap Money Era is Coming", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Europe has taken a small step in its long march toward economic normalcy.The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it had pondered how to wind down its easy money policies, an enormous stimulus program aimed at promoting growth and inflation in the eurozone. But the bank also postponed a decision on when it would actually do so, and will likely decide at least some of the details at its next meeting in October, the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, said.Even though the eurozone is arguably in its best economic shape in a decade, Mr. Draghi and his colleagues on the bank\u2019s Governing Council have been exceedingly cautious about ending the emergency measures that helped prevent the euro from self-destructing after the global financial meltdown in 2008.The Federal Reserve in the United States began raising interest rates at the end of 2015, but the European Central Bank continues to flood the 19-nation eurozone with cash as a way to reduce interest rates, stimulate growth and nudge inflation from levels considered to be dangerously low. The measures have worked, for the most part, helping the region overcome a prolonged slump.But the program \u2014 known as quantitative easing \u2014 has also had side effects, including fueling a steep rise in real estate prices in Germany that have led to fears of a bubble.Mr. Draghi said Thursday that the benefits have far outweighed any negative effects. Still, with the Fed moving in the opposite direction, the European Central Bank has been under pressure to shift its policy.Yet he also left himself plenty of wiggle room in case conditions change. In particular, the central bank will be keeping a close eye on the euro\u2019s growing strength compared to the dollar, which Mr. Draghi said could alter assumptions about how the eurozone economy will perform.\u201cThe recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring,\u201d he said at a news conference.When the euro rises against the dollar, European exports become more expensive \u2014 not only in the United States but also in other countries, like China, whose currencies are linked with the dollar. That typically means that European companies will sell fewer goods abroad, hurting growth and prolonging the need for central bank stimulus.A robust euro also undercuts the bank\u2019s efforts to jolt inflation back to the official target of 2 percent, a level considered healthy for growth. A strong euro holds down consumer prices by making imported oil and other goods cheaper for eurozone residents. That\u2019s not all bad for people who live in Europe, but low inflation means that Mr. Draghi has to keep printing money longer than he would like.The eurozone\u2019s annual rate of inflation in August was 1.5 percent, and a substantial increase is nowhere in sight. According to forecasts by the central bank\u2019s staff, inflation will still be below the target in 2019.There\u2019s not much Mr. Draghi can do about the weak dollar, which analysts say reflects pessimism about the ability of President Trump and Congress to agree on legislation that many economists believe would help bolster growth in the United States, such as infrastructure programs or corporate tax reform.\u201cInvestors no longer trust the American government to push through tax reform and fiscal stimulus,\u201d Alwin Schenk, a portfolio manager at the German bank Sal. Oppenheim, said in a note to clients.In addition, investors have sold dollars and bought euros after becoming more optimistic about the eurozone\u2019s prospects for growth.Mr. Draghi may have tried to talk the euro down on Thursday by stressing that a stronger currency could alter assumptions about future inflation. But if that was his goal, the jawboning did not work \u2014 the euro rose about 1 cent to $1.20 after his remarks.The bank has said it will spend 60 billion euros, or $72 billion, a month in eurozone bond markets at least through December, but has not said what it will do after that. Mr. Draghi reiterated Thursday that it would not raise its benchmark interest rate, currently zero, until it has ended the bond purchases. That means rate increases are probably still years away.There may be another reason the European Central Bank must dial back the stimulus \u2014 the supply of bonds may be getting scarce.When it announced its quantitative easing program, the bank promised not to buy more than 33 percent of any one bond issue, to avoid distorting the market too much. The limit is also designed to protect against legal challenges by critics who say the bond buying is illegal because the central bank is barred by law from using its printing presses to finance eurozone governments.Many analysts believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the bank to avoid exceeding the limit for German Bunds and other kinds of bonds because it has already bought so many.Mr. Draghi dismissed those concerns Thursday. \u201cThese doubts were present at the very beginning of the program,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident we will be able to exploit all the flexibility the program has.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their soldiers have served together not just on the Korean Peninsula but in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. And under America\u2019s protective umbrella, the South Korean economy has soared.Now, as North Korea carries out a series of provocative missile and nuclear bomb tests, that alliance is straining at a time when both nations may need it more than ever.President Trump issued a blast of antagonistic comments in the last few days that have made South Koreans doubt that they can take the alliance for granted any longer.\u201dSouth Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter.The tone of Mr. Trump\u2019s statements stunned officials here and underscored what unlikely partners he and Mr. Moon are, at a time when their countries\u2019 67-year-old military alliance faces an ever-more-dangerous regime in Pyongyang.\u201dWe can never tolerate another catastrophic war on this land,\u201d his office said in a statement Sunday evening. \u201cWe will not give up our goal of working together with allies to seek a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201dMr. Moon has supported Mr. Trump\u2019s push for tougher sanctions against North Korea, and in a call on Monday, their first since the nuclear test on Sunday, the two leaders agreed to lift the weight limit on South Korean conventional warheads, Park Soo-hyun, a spokesman for Mr. Moon, said. Removing the 500-kilogram restriction, part of a treaty with the United States aimed at preventing a regional arms race, could give the South greater power to strike the North in the event of military conflict.But Mr. Moon has argued that sanctions and pressure alone have failed to stop the North\u2019s advances in nuclear and missile technology. And while Mr. Trump has threatened North Korea with \u201cfire and fury,\u201d Mr. Moon has said there must be a peaceful solution because South Koreans, not Americans, would bear the brunt of war.He called the North Korean nuclear test on Sunday \u201cdisappointing and infuriating.\u201dLee Seong-hyon, an analyst at the Sejong Institute near Seoul, said: \u201cTrump considers Moon na\u00efve for insisting on dialogue with North Korea when it keeps conducting missile and nuclear tests. Trump is asking Moon, \u2018Are you with us or not?\u2019\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s threat to cancel the trade agreement squeezes South Korea on its economy, which is already suffering in part because of South Korean cooperation with the United States.Mr. Trump is not the first American leader to be skeptical of a progressive South Korean president\u2019s approach to the North. Since North Korea was first discovered to be developing nuclear weapons in the 1990s, the allies have not always been on the same page.Mr. Moon was a close ally of President Roh Moo-hyun, a liberal who championed the so-called sunshine policy of engaging North Korea with dialogue, trade and aid shipments. Mr. Roh owed his 2002 election in part to a wave of anti-American sentiment, spurred by the deaths of two South Korean schoolgirls who were run over by an American military vehicle.\u201dWashington still suspects that President Moon is Roh Moo-hyun 2.0,\u201d said Kim Ji-yoon, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.Moreover, Mr. Moon and Mr. Trump lack personal chemistry, analysts said, inhabiting opposing political spheres and coming from vastly different backgrounds.Mr. Moon was a former human rights lawyer defending labor activists and political dissidents while Mr. Trump was a former real-estate magnate.If Mr. Trump sees North Korea primarily as a nuclear threat, Mr. Moon, a son of Korean War refugees, tries to resolve it in a broader context of building reconciliation and eventually achieving reunification on the divided Korean Peninsula.During his campaign, Mr. Moon alarmed Washington by saying that he would review Seoul\u2019s agreement on the deployment of the American missile-defense system known as Thaad. The system has infuriated China, which said the powerful American radar on its doorstep undermined its own security.Mr. Moon has since reversed himself, but Washington had a taste of his ability to say no when he took a swipe at Mr. Trump in a nationally televised speech last month. \u201cNo one should be allowed to decide on a military action on the Korean Peninsula without South Korean agreement,\u201d he said.Kim Keun-sik, a political-science professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said: \u201cMoon Jae-in had an uneasy start with Washington. The unease kept building up.\u201dThe North never showed an interest in talks, further undermining Mr. Moon\u2019s position.\u201cThe latest nuclear test is a wake-up call for those in South Korea who still believe that dialogue is possible with North Korea,\u201d said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul. \u201cKim Jong-un will never give up his nuclear weapons.\u201dThe challenge for South Korea now is how to live with the reality of a nuclear-armed North. South Koreans fear that once North Korea acquires nuclear-tipped ICBMs, it will use them to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul by offering to freeze its nuclear program in return for the withdrawal of American troops from the South.In the worst-case scenario, they say, North Korea may attack the South and use its nuclear arsenal to deter the United States from intervening.Mr. Moon also faces domestic pressure from the right, with South Korean conservatives clamoring for tactical nuclear weapons, and accusing Mr. Moon of endangering the alliance with Washington while \u201cbegging North Korea for dialogue.\u201d\u201cMoon Jae-in became president four months ago, and the 50 million South Koreans have already become hostage to the North Korean nukes,\u201d Hong Joon-pyo, leader of the conservative opposition Korea Liberty Party, said on Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the World Called for a Capital", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBookshelfIn the late 18th century, the national capital was temporarily transplanted from New York City back to Philadelphia, which unleashed New York from the federal bureaucracy to become the capital of capital.Around the same time, New York legislators sought a state capital that would not only be more centrally located, but also sufficiently insulated from downstate political influence. The consequences of that shift were profound: More than two centuries later, New York City officials need Albany\u2019s permission to levy taxes for mass transit and even to install more traffic cameras to catch drivers who speed through red lights.Despite Philadelphia and Albany stealing its thunder, however, New York managed to become the global capital by the mid-20th century.As the city prepares for its annual United Nations General Assembly gridlock this month, Pamela Hanlon makes the case that the relationship between New York and the world has still worked out pretty well.The city overcame the diplomatic corps\u2019 opposition to win out over dozens of other offers and the world body\u2019s earlier preference for Greenwich, Conn., whose wealthy suburbanites didn\u2019t want it.When the Security Council met on March 25, 1946, at Hunter College in the Bronx (now the site of Lehman College), Ms. Hanlon writes, a vote of confidence in the U.N. had already been cast by a local mechanic, Paul Antonio, who surprised delegates with an eloquent note:\u201cMay I, who have had the privilege of fabricating this ballot box, cast the first vote? May God be with every member of the United Nations Organization, and through your noble efforts bring lasting peace to us all \u2014 all over the world.\u201dPlaying host to the headquarters provided thousands of jobs and generated billions of dollars for the local economy. For better or worse, it also empowered mayors to espouse their own foreign policy (which typically meant snubbing a visiting Arab diplomat).Brian Urquhart, a former under secretary general of the United Nations, called New York \u201cthe U.N.\u2019s great blessing.\u201d Recalling the delegates\u2019 early resistance to the city, he said a few years ago: \u201cNew York is a grand, hard, gritty place where no one underestimates their own importance or overestimates anyone else\u2019s. In other places, diplomats are themselves the biggest fish in the little pond, but in New York they have to swim around like all the other fish, and no one will fail to criticize them if they deserve it.\u201dHis book is filled with fun facts (the city\u2019s population is so tightly packed that if Texas were as densely populated, the population of the entire world would fit within its borders; and New York is the only urban area with more Starbucks than McDonalds).Among Mr. van Rosendaal\u2019s tips: \u201cGo stand on the street with a city map and a camera and count the seconds before someone comes to your assistance.

{"Headline": "Amid Nuclear Tensions, Trump Mulls Exit From South Korea Trade Deal", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is considering pulling out of a major trade agreement with South Korea as he tries to fulfill get-tough campaign pledges on international trade. But he has not yet made a final decision, two senior administration officials said Saturday.The president\u2019s top economic advisers remain deeply divided over a possible withdrawal from the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, as negotiators from both countries struggle to rewrite the five-year-old deal.In recent days, a frustrated Mr. Trump has pushed his staff to take bold action against a host of governments, including the one in Seoul, that he has accused of unfair trade practices. But many of his more moderate advisers, including the chairman of the National Economic Council, Gary D. Cohn, believe that such a move could prompt a trade war that could hurt the United States economy.An industry publication, Inside U.S. Trade, first reported late Friday that the administration was considering withdrawing from the treaty as early as next week.\u201cDiscussions are ongoing, but we have no announcements at this time,\u201d a White House spokeswoman said in an email.But Mr. Trump, asked during a trip to the Gulf Coast on Saturday whether he was talking with his advisers about the trade deal, said: \u201cI am. It\u2019s very much on my mind.\u201dThe idea of potentially withdrawing seems to have been prompted by the breakdown in negotiations between South Korean officials and the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, an American official with knowledge of the situation said.An initial meeting generated little consensus, with South Korean officials offering to consider minor adjustments to the agreement but rejecting a wholesale renegotiation, angering hard-liners in the White House who have targeted countries like China, Japan, Mexico and South Korea that have large trade surpluses with the United States.But it remains unclear whether the administration would actually withdraw from the deal, and industry representatives who have lobbied the White House say the president\u2019s team has done little of the work \u2014 like a wide consultation with affected industries \u2014 needed before taking such a step.The possibility of abandoning the agreement has alarmed economists and some members of the president\u2019s own party who fear that such a move would force South Korea to block American manufacturers and farmers from a lucrative market.\u201cThe president and Nebraska have a basic disagreement about trade,\u201d said Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who has frequently criticized Mr. Trump. \u201cHis administration holds 18th-century views of trade as a zero-sum game. I side with our farmers and ranchers who are feeding the world now.\u201dMr. Lighthizer and other administration officials, including Peter Navarro, an economic adviser to the president, have long complained that many South Korean industries, especially the automotive sector, enjoy government protections that make it harder for American companies to compete.Scrapping the deal would also have profound geopolitical implications in the region, said Michael Green, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who oversaw issues on the Korean Peninsula during the administration of President George W. Bush.\u201cOne of the big reasons we decided to go forward with the agreement was to demonstrate to the South Koreans, North Koreans and Chinese that the U.S. was committed to this relationship for the long haul,\u201d Mr. Green said.That the administration would even consider canceling the agreement in the midst of the North Korean missile and nuclear crisis is astonishing, Mr. Green said.\u201cIt\u2019s probably all theater, but it has negative strategic consequences as we try to manage the North Korean threat,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

There is so much pot being grown in California that the wholesale price has been falling sharply in recent years and any pot sold on the legal market in January will have the added costs of taxes, fees and mandatory testing for pesticides and other chemicals.Tawnie Logan, chairwoman of the board of the California Growers Association, an advocacy group for small-scale marijuana producers, says the black market price for an eighth of an ounce of marijuana is around $20, compared with $50 in dispensaries.She predicts a bump in legal sales in January when recreational pot goes on sale because of the novelty of being able to buy pot in a store. But that novelty may wear off, she said.\u201cAll of a sudden they are calling their buddy again,\u201d Ms. Logan said, referring to black-market vendors who have thrived in California in recent decades.When regulators are asked how they plan to handle the black market their answer is law enforcement. This may prove difficult in areas of Northern California where pot is central to the local economy.\u201cYou would be turning these law enforcement agencies against their own communities,\u201d said Terry Garrett, a manager at Sustaining Technologies, a marketing company that researches the cannabis market in Sonoma County.\u201cThat\u2019s the conundrum for California.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)With the start of the N.F.L. season, the reality of a Charger-less San Diego is sinking in.The team had been in San Diego more than half a century.Some resolved to put their anger at Mr. Spanos aside and continue to root for the players.

He cited the camaraderie among fans that the Chargers had fostered for decades in San Diego.\u201cA lot of us are suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people in San Diego will never forgive Spanos, never.\u201dWatching the Chargers play the Broncos last week, he had an idea to get back at the team.Just say \u201cSpanos Taco\u201d and pick any taco off the menu.On Monday, a day after the Chargers fell to the Dolphins, the line was out the door all day, Mr. Lopez said.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "S.&P. Downgrades China\u2019s Debt, Citing a Surge in Lending", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China and the world received a fresh warning on Thursday that the country\u2019s dramatic debt binge of recent years threatens the stability of one of the global economy\u2019s most important growth engines.Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded its rating on China, saying that the country\u2019s strong economic growth has been fueled by heavy borrowing \u2014 and that it expects that borrowing to continue. That could hurt the ability of the world\u2019s second-largest economy to handle potential financial shocks, like a crisis among its banks, and could lead to longer-term growth problems.China has long been a major growth engine for the rest of the world. Its growing consumer class has fed strong demand for everything from iPhones to jet planes. Its factories consume vast amounts of the world\u2019s energy and minerals.But S.&P. warned on Thursday that China has been borrowing heavily \u2014 too heavily \u2014 to sustain that growth.State-controlled banks have been funneling big loans to wasteful, chronically unprofitable state-run companies. Indebted local governments have been borrowing heavily as well. Even China\u2019s national government, fairly cautious in its previous borrowing, has been running budget deficits lately, and the country\u2019s famously frugal households have begun using more credit.\u201cThe downgrade reflects our assessment that a prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased China\u2019s economic and financial risks,\u201d S.&P. said in a statement.Still, reaction to the downgrade was harsh.In a lengthy statement on Friday, China\u2019s Finance Ministry called the move \u201ca mistaken decision\u201d and labeled concerns about China\u2019s debt \u201cstale news.\u201d It cited the country\u2019s efforts to close excess factories and streamline industries that suffer from overcapacity and significant moves toward reform. It also cited the Chinese government\u2019s deep financial resources to address any potential debt shocks.\u201cThis type of misreading neglects the Chinese economy\u2019s good fundamentals and development potential,\u201d it said.The government is likely to be particularly upset because S.&P. issued the downgrade less than a month before the start of the Communist Party Congress. The meeting is expected to reconfirm President Xi Jinping as the country\u2019s core leader, but move some new officials to serve with him.Mr. Xi has made political and economic stability the country\u2019s top priority in the months leading up to the congress. That has included allowing the state-controlled banking system to continue, and even expand, its already heavy lending since midsummer, while a modest effort in late spring to limit the growth in lending has been pursued with less zeal.S.&P. downgraded its rating on the country\u2019s sovereign debt by one notch.Warnings about China\u2019s borrowing are not new.In the span of nearly a decade, China went from a country with few loans to one with debt levels comparable to those of the United States. While economists say China has plenty of financial firepower to address debt-related problems, the speed of the accumulation and the heavy lending in particular to rusty old industries such as steel and cement could cause issues.\u201cThis won\u2019t be news to anyone who has kept half an eye on China over recent years and shouldn\u2019t change anyone\u2019s thinking,\u201d Capital Economics, a research firm, said in a statement on Thursday evening, adding that since Moody\u2019s downgraded China in May and Fitch Ratings, another ratings firm, did so in 2013, \u201cS.&P. is playing catch-up.\u201dBut S.&P.\u2019s move could offer a reminder that those problems are not going away.The Chinese government has taken a number of small steps over the past year to rein in borrowing. While debt is still rising, it is not doing so quite as quickly relative to the size of the economy as it was a year ago. Banking regulators have also put pressure on financial institutions to move more fund-raising activities onto their balance sheets, in an effort to tame the country\u2019s large shadow banking sector.S.&P. also pointed out that China has a number of tools at its disposal to deal with any disruption resulting from its hefty debt levels. They include hefty foreign exchange reserves, large net overseas investments and large trade surpluses with other nations.S.&P. downgraded its rating on China to A+ from AA\u2212, but with a stable outlook, meaning that the company does not anticipate another rating change in the short term. It said it expected China\u2019s growth to slow to 5.8 percent by 2020. While that figure would be the envy of many countries, and S.&P. called it \u201cstrong,\u201d it would represent a slowdown from last year, with 6.7 percent growth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Using the E.P.A. to Prop Up Big Coal", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe Trump administration is unflinching in its misbegotten campaign to protect the coal industry from what has become an obvious and inevitable decline. Eight months in, the administration has already killed, or is in the process of killing, rules that would prevent the dumping of coal mining wastes in streams, impose a temporary moratorium on new mine leases in the West, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants \u2014 one of President Barack Obama\u2019s most important efforts to resist climate change. All of this to prop up an industry whose workers would be best served not by false promises of new mining jobs, but by aggressive programs to retrain them for a changing economy.What it does, rather, is to try to twist the clock back to the day when coal was essentially a monopoly fuel, a day that practical-minded utility executives know is long gone. In fact, these executives are busily shutting down coal-fired plants in favor of more affordable energy sources like natural gas and wind and solar power.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to build any more coal plants; that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Chris Beam, head of Appalachian Power, West Virginia\u2019s largest utility, bluntly told the state last April, despite President Trump\u2019s phantasmagorical campaign promise to resurrect lost jobs for coal miners. No less candid, Lynn Good, the head of Duke Energy, America\u2019s largest utility, defended the closing of 12 coal plants across five years, with more to come, in order to cut the company\u2019s coal-fired energy output by a third: \u201cOur strategy will continue to be to drive carbon out of our business.\u201dIn February, one of the nation\u2019s biggest coal-fired plants, the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona, set plans to shut down by the end of 2019 \u2014 more than two decades earlier than expected \u2014 in order to turn to alternatives, cut consumer prices and shed the notoriety of being the third-worst carbon polluter in the nation, according to the ratings of the (pre-Trump) E.P.A.While environmental rules have played some role in the closing of coal-fired plants, the main driver is cheaper and abundant natural gas. Coal\u2019s use in power generation has been declining since 2007, and by 2016 coal-fired plants produced only 30 percent of the nation\u2019s total generation, compared with 50 percent in 2003.It is shocking that an administration led and staffed by supposedly shrewd business executives deliberately overlooks the blossoming of profitable and cleaner energy products simply because of Mr. Trump\u2019s hollow showmanship before his campaign base.Until now, the E.P.A. and the environmental safeguards Congress has ordered it to enforce have been crucial to the development of new technologies. To have Mr. Pruitt sully that history with false promises to a fading industry is irresponsible.An earlier version of this editorial misstated findings of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Its report said at least 46 coal-fired units would close at 25 electricity plants in 16 states in 2017 and 2018, not over the next five years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Castro Can Save Venezuela", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter months of clashes with the security forces, street demonstrations in Venezuela have calmed down, but the economic and political crisis is far from over. The fraudulently elected National Assembly is drafting a new Constitution that will subordinate the judicial system and legislative bodies to the executive branch. The result will be a new dictatorship in Latin America \u2014 the first in decades.Having grabbed virtually total power to govern at will, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has wasted no time in jailing political opponents, resorting to torture and repression against students, and silencing the remaining critical news media outlets. Despite a humanitarian disaster leading his country\u2019s citizens to lose on average up to 10 percent of their weight, to be told to eat pet rabbits and to flee abroad by the hundreds of thousands, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor refuses to step down.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s animosity toward the Cuban regime in his United Nations speech on Tuesday, when he said Washington will not lift sanctions on Havana until it makes reforms, it may seem an unlikely partnership. But both countries have real incentives to work together: Only the Cubans can ease Mr. Maduro and his henchmen from power, and only United States\u2019 investment, tourism, trade and good will can allow Cuba to solve its serious economic problems. If Ra\u00fal Castro joins in, a deal could be struck, now or when the crisis takes another bad turn.International pressure on Venezuela has increased. Latin American countries have made powerful statements against the regime, and the United States has imposed sanctions; the European Union may soon impose economic and visa sanctions.But these measures alone are unlikely to bring about change in Venezuela, which makes the counterintuitive involvement of Cuba and the United States all the more attractive.Why should Washington and Havana play a role in extricating Venezuela from the mess it is in?First, Cuba has on occasion been helpful in key civil strife negotiations, most recently in Colombia\u2019s peace agreement.Second, the only external power with any real influence in Caracas is Cuba. With more than 40,000 Cuban doctors, teachers and intelligence and security personnel in Venezuela, the Havana government enjoys Mr. Maduro\u2019s complete trust. He relies on it for his own security, to influence his allies and to control his rivals and adversaries. In exchange, Cuba is paid in hard currency for the human resources it provides along with subsidized, though decreasing, supplies of crude oil for Cuban consumption as well as for resale at a higher price to other countries.In short, the Cubans are the only actors in this quagmire who can influence Mr. Maduro and persuade him to step aside. The opposition and the United States must be persuaded to grant Mr. Maduro and his closest cronies safe haven in Havana. This would prompt presidential elections in Venezuela and a reconciliation process with amnesty for all Venezuelans.Why would Cubans push Mr. Maduro to leave? They know that though he has weathered the latest crisis, there are many more to come: debt default, slipping oil production and prices, unrest in the armed forces. Cuba has bet the store on other countries in the past and knows well that the results have not been great.Is there room for a quid pro quo in all of this? Would Havana help ease out Mr. Maduro and facilitate the restoration of Venezuela\u2019s democracy if Mr. Trump were to pursue Obama-style normalization? What if countries like Brazil, Canada, Colombia and Mexico were to replace Mr. Maduro\u2019s oil subsidies for a time and the tens of thousands of Cuban foot soldiers in Venezuela were to be guaranteed a gradual and safe return home? It\u2019s hard to say, but everyone would benefit from such a deal, and none of the parties involved would lose excessively.Venezuela has a lot to gain from a grand bargain including Cuba and the United States, but so do Cuba, the United States and the rest of Latin America. At the moment, it might seem na\u00efve to think that Mr. Maduro and his allies would accept a deal in which he leaves power just as he appears to have consolidated it. But sometimes that is the best moment to reach an agreement. Venezuela\u2019s situation is untenable, and the Cubans, who have been around forever, know that. Does Mr. Trump?Jorge G.

{"Headline": "Bump in U.S. Incomes Doesn\u2019t Erase 50 Years of Pain", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe disconnect between positive statistics and people\u2019s day-to-day lives is one of the great economic and social puzzles of recent years. It helped fuel President Trump\u2019s political rise and underpins the frustrations that played out in calls to build a Mexican border wall, reopen trade agreements, and bring back well-paid work in coal mines and factories.Starting with 1957, the team looked at actual earnings during the prime working years \u2014 the ages of 25 to 55. For a while, it saw a clear pattern: Younger men could expect to make more over their lives than older ones. Every year the starting rewards were higher and kept growing. So men who turned 25 in, say, 1960 would end up with a higher median cumulative income by 55 than men who had turned 25 in 1959. And the \u201959ers would, in turn, do better over three decades than those who had turned 25 in 1958.But that steady progress stopped in the late 1960s. Then, instead of increasing, lifetime earnings for men made an about-face and began to decline. They have been dropping pretty much ever since. The result was that a 25-year-old man who entered the work force in 1967 and worked for the next three decades earned as much as $250,000 more, after taking inflation into account, than a man who had the same type of career but was 15 years younger.And the trend appears to be continuing. \u201cEvery new cohort made less in median lifetime income than the previous one,\u201d Mr. Guvenen said.\u201cAnd it all starts at age 25,\u201d Mr. Guvenen said. The decline in lifetime earnings is largely a result of lower incomes at younger ages rather than at older ages, he said, and \u201cthat was very surprising to us.\u201dMost younger men ended up with less because they started out earning less than their counterparts in previous years, and saw little growth in their early years. They entered the work force with lower wages and never caught up.According to one conservative measure of inflation, in 1967, the median income at age 25 was $33,300; in 1983, it was $29,000. Twenty-five-year-olds did better during the 1990s, but then the slide returned. In 2011, the median income for 25-year-old men was less than $25,000 \u2014 pretty much the same as it was in 1959.The picture for women looks different because so many more of them started at a disadvantage: Few worked full time in the 1950s, and those who did earned below-average wages. As more women entered the work force over the decades, their lifetime earnings rose. But more recently, as the share of women working has leveled off, their lifetime income gains, too, have slowed.The result is that, since the 1950s, three-quarters of working Americans have seen no change in lifetime income. Health and retirement benefits have made up some of the lost ground, but far from all of it.The recent progress reported by the Census Bureau doesn\u2019t conflict with this story. As the bureau explained, the income gains came mostly because more people were working full time. Roughly 2.2 million more adults had full-time jobs in 2016 than in 2015.To Mr. Guvenen, the research indicates that the political debates in Washington centered on earnings and employment have been too narrow. Given the early roots of lifetime income disparities, he said, more attention should be paid to what is going on even before people start entering the work force.\u201cOur findings suggest that both the stagnation of median lifetime income for men, and the increase in lifetime income inequality for men and women, can be traced to changes that newer cohorts have experienced before age 25,\u201d the research team concluded.That would mean looking at policies directly related to the family and education.The shrinking rewards of a high school education help explain not only the stress that Americans in the work force are feeling, but also why a larger proportion of men have dropped out altogether during their prime working ages. Work doesn\u2019t pay off the way it used to.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best Era for Working Women Was 20 Years Ago", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe working woman was everywhere in 1980s and 1990s pop culture: The tough single gal Murphy Brown ran the news on TV every week. Dolly Parton in \u201c9 to 5,\u201d Melanie Griffith in \u201cWorking Girl,\u201d and the ominously coldhearted mother in \u201cMrs. Doubtfire.\u201dThe late 1990s \u2014 Murphy Brown\u2019s decade \u2014 may have been as good as it gets for American women in the workplace.The steady, seemingly inevitable march of significant numbers of American women into paid jobs began during World War II. Women certainly worked before the war, but it was usually certain groups: women of color, who have almost always had to work, and single women. During and after the war, work suddenly opened for more and more women.But then, in the early 2000s, the rise in the share of working women came to a halt. And since the Great Recession the figure has even fallen. Today it\u2019s just over 57 percent.\u201cWe noticed right away,\u201d said Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. Her organization compiles an annual report on the economic status of women in every state, and in 1998 it sent a preview to some people in Vermont. The data showed that women\u2019s labor force participation had fallen in that state, a harbinger of a national trend. The reviewers said \u201cthis can\u2019t be right,\u201d she recalled, adding, \u201cWe looked at the numbers again and we wrote back and said, \u2018It is right.\u2019 \u201dThings seem to have changed around the 2001 recession. Until then, women tended to keep their onward march into employment steady even when the economy faltered. If their employment dipped, it quickly recovered. But this was the first time that the share of working women dropped without bouncing back.The 1990s were a turning point, Professor Moffitt noted. Every office suddenly had a computer. \u201cIt\u2019s an economywide thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not gender-specific.\u201d Just as technology has reduced the number of jobs on factory floors, it has also meant fewer secretaries, bank tellers and retail workers.It may very well be that the American women who were in the best position to make it all work \u2014 who faced the lowest hurdles to arranging child care and balancing work with family \u2014 have made it into the work force, but those who have bigger challenges simply can\u2019t swing it. \u201cA lot of women were able to make do, and those women are in the labor force,\u201d Professor Blau said. \u201cHow do the rest come in without some kind of change?\u201dIt\u2019s unlikely that the country has simply hit a ceiling for how many women want jobs. If the United States were to spend more on helping parents get child care, ensure they can take paid time off work and protect those who want or need to work flexible schedules, it would almost certainly tap into this pool of women who have stepped away from work.President Trump has said he wants to reach 3 percent G.D.P. growth. He would do well to focus on increasing how many women work. \u201cHe could probably get there much faster,\u201d said Dr. Hartmann of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, \u201cif he tried to do more on equal pay and provided subsidized child care for everyone.\u201dHe\u2019ll find out how dangerous it is for the economy when the government doesn\u2019t help put all women, married or not, to work.Bryce Covert is a contributor at The Nation and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Sloane\u2019s social prominence and acquisitive impulse were thus bolstered by the sugar trade and slavery, of which he was a defender. Delbourgo deftly unpacks Sloane\u2019s complicated attitude toward the enslaved peoples of the Caribbean. While he shared the white planters\u2019 misgivings about blacks, he employed these slaves to gather data about the island and was fascinated by their music, acquiring banjos and making musical annotations of their songs. Sloane left the island in 1689 with hundreds of pressed plants and preserved animals as well as a menagerie that included an iguana, a seven-foot-long snake and an alligator. None of the animals survived the trip.Once returned to London, Sloane never left.

{"Headline": "Nafta Talks Lurch Ahead Without Signs of Major Progress", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement sputtered forward on Tuesday as officials from the United States, Canada and Mexico concluded their second round of talks with plenty of pleasantries but little major progress to announce.After five days of discussions in Mexico City, trade negotiators from the three countries said they were encouraged by the talks\u2019 cooperative tenor and remained confident that they could reach a deal by the end of the year.\u201cI am pleased to report that we have found mutual agreement on many important issues,\u201d Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said during a briefing with reporters at the conclusion of the talks. \u201cOur work continues at a record pace.\u201dDespite their optimistic tone, however, there was no public discussion of the thorniest points of contention between the countries.The latest round of talks came as the Trump administration promised to upend America\u2019s trade agreements with the goal of creating better deals for domestic manufacturers.The lack of concrete progress raises questions about whether the three countries will be able to rewrite Nafta this year, if at all. Thus far, Canada and Mexico have made it clear that they will not be cowed by Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to unilaterally scrap the trade agreement, a move that would most likely damage the United States economy.\u201cI think they might be tougher than the Trump administration thought,\u201d Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said of Canada and Mexico. \u201cTrade negotiations are always challenging.\u201dIn the current talks, Canada\u2019s top concerns include low wages in Mexico and so-called right-to-work laws that have weakened unions and labor standards in some parts of the United States.Ms. Freeland noted in her closing remarks that Nafta had yielded substantial economic benefits for the United States since it was enacted in 1994 and said that the trade relationship between the United States and Canada was \u201creciprocal,\u201d a principle that Mr. Trump prizes.Echoing comments made recently by Vice President Mike Pence, Ms. Freeland said she was confident that the three countries could find a way to reach a deal that is a \u201cwin, win, win.\u201d\u201cAll three parties are absolutely committed to getting this done,\u201d Ms. Freeland said.For Mexico\u2019s part, a top priority remains finding ways to incorporate President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s 2014 energy program in a modernized Nafta. This would further open up Mexico\u2019s energy sector to private investment and could reduce the United States\u2019 trade deficit with Mexico.While many details remain to be worked out, the course of the Nafta talks is also likely to be directed by politics and the passions of Mr. Trump. The decision on Tuesday by Mr. Trump to end the Obama-era executive action that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation could ratchet up tension between the countries. And Mr. Trump\u2019s ongoing commitment to making Mexico finance a border wall rankles its leaders.\u201cIt is hard to reconcile the political language of the U.S. leaders and their aggressiveness and their sense of being abused by Mexico in the relationship,\u201d said Alejandro G\u00f3mez-Strozzi, Mexico\u2019s undersecretary of economy from 2000 to 2006. \u201cNafta needs some improvement, but not in the light that is being portrayed by the U.S. president.\u201dMr. Trump may have to decide if he wants to tweak the deal and call it a win, get bogged down in painstaking details or bail on Nafta entirely.Most trade experts agree that achieving a major rewrite of Nafta in the next few months is a long shot, if only because most major trade pacts take years to reach. To veterans of big trade agreements, the lack of immediate breakthroughs is not necessarily bad news for Nafta, but the urge to rush the negotiations could prove to be counterproductive.\u201cAs you\u2019re thinking about the timetable, you need to make sure you have enough time to consult with Congress, consult with stakeholders and find creative solutions to new problems,\u201d said Michael Froman, who was a trade representative under President Barack Obama.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As German Election Looms, Politicians Face Voters\u2019 Wrath for Ties to Carmakers", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Sometimes it is hard to tell where the German government ends and the auto industry begins.Daimler and Volkswagen\u2019s top lobbyists were once close aides to Chancellor Angela Merkel. The foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, used to sit on Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board. Ms. Merkel herself once buttonholed the governor of California to complain about the state\u2019s strict emissions standards.Those close relations between public officials and car manufacturers were once considered vital economic policy for Germany\u2019s most important export. Now, they are a political liability.The backlash has been building since 2015, when United States regulators uncovered widespread emissions cheating by Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s largest automaker. The broadening case, which has also ensnared BMW and Daimler, has called attention to the harmful effects of nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel vehicles. Cities across Europe are considering diesel bans, and sales of diesel engines are plummeting.For decades, the German government has been a crucial ally for carmakers, operating as a de facto lobbyist for the industry.With the active support of officials, automakers used their political clout in Brussels to block stricter emissions regulations and to promote subsidies for diesel. German leaders, including Ms. Merkel and her predecessor, argued against tough emissions rules and pushed for better terms for the country\u2019s carmakers abroad.Most recently, Germany led a group of auto-producing countries in weakening European emissions testing procedures that were designed to prevent the kind of deception committed by Volkswagen. New cars must pass road tests. Previously, they had to pass only laboratory exams, which Volkswagen and other carmakers were able to game. But, at German insistence, cars can emit double the legal limit of nitrogen oxides and still be approved.German political leaders and automakers have worked together to promote diesel technology since the 1990s. Ms. Merkel\u2019s predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, was proud to be known as the \u201cauto chancellor.\u201dGermany has taxed diesel fuel at a lower rate than gasoline since the 1980s, originally to make truck transport, which is predominantly diesel, less expensive. The goal, according to a 2011 study by Transport and Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels, was to lower costs to help German manufacturers compete internationally.Those tax breaks have ensured that diesel is significantly cheaper at the pump, leading to a steady rise in the popularity of diesel-powered cars. Until recently, they outsold their gasoline-powered counterparts around Europe.German carmakers and politicians engaged in a similar battle in Brussels, fighting for years to bat away tougher emissions rules. In 2013, Germany used its clout as the European Union\u2019s largest economy to intervene when the bloc\u2019s executive arm wanted to tighten limits on carbon dioxide emissions.Matthias Wissmann, head of the German Association of the Automotive Industry and a former transportation minister, wrote a letter to Ms. Merkel, warning that the new standards would hurt sales of German luxury cars. In that letter, he addressed Ms. Merkel as \u201cdu,\u201d the informal German word for \u201cyou\u201d normally used only between close friends.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.German leaders campaigned for carmakers farther afield, too. On a trip to California in 2010, Ms. Merkel complained about the state\u2019s strict limits on nitrogen oxides during a meeting with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.The bond between politicians and automakers persisted even after the Volkswagen scandal erupted.Stephan Weil, prime minister of Lower Saxony, home of Volkswagen, conceded in August that he had allowed company lobbyists to vet a 2015 speech about the emissions deception. The state of Lower Saxony owns a 20 percent stake in Volkswagen, and Mr. Weil sits on the carmaker\u2019s supervisory board.Mr. Weil, a member of the Social Democrats, denied making significant changes to the speech after it was shown to Volkswagen. Thomas Steg, head of government relations for the carmaker, said Volkswagen looked only for factual errors.Against that backdrop, deep political ties were forged.German carmakers have often recruited government insiders to represent their interests. Mr. Steg of Volkswagen was once a spokesman for Ms. Merkel.

{"Headline": "Trump to Propose Sweeping Tax Cut for Corporations and Individuals", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump will propose a sweeping rewrite of the federal tax code on Wednesday, outlining a plan to reduce rates for corporations and individuals and eliminate some popular deductions, in a move that will set off a scramble among powerful groups eager to protect their tax breaks.The proposal will call for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, doubling the standard deduction for individual taxpayers and slightly increasing the bottom tax rate to 12 percent from 10 percent, according to two officials briefed on the details of the blueprint.The framework, which has been agreed upon by Republican leaders in the House and Senate, leaves most of the details to Congress but proposes a reduction in the individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, while leaving the door open for an unspecified, higher bracket for the wealthiest Americans. The plan would also, for the first time, create a 25 percent tax for \u201cpass through\u201d businesses, which account for the vast majority of business income in the United States and are currently taxed at individual rates.Pulling the tax code levers inevitably creates winners and losers, but the scant details of the plan, including how it will be paid for and which deductions are on the chopping block, make it impossible to determine the distributional effects and whether it would actually help middle-class taxpayers and not the wealthiest Americans.Over a meal that ended with apple pie, Mr. Trump also said that repatriation of taxes on corporate profits kept offshore would be part of the plan. He did not describe changes to carve-outs or deductions, according to a person in the room.At one point, Mr. Trump said that getting the corporate rate down was the key to getting the economy to grow. The president said that he had grown tired of listening to foreign leaders, like India\u2019s Narendra Modi, describe a gross domestic product growth rate close to 10 percent, while Mr. Trump had nothing comparable to show, according to the person, who asked for anonymity because it was a private dinner.The White House is trying to navigate a narrow path on an issue that administration officials believe can reboot Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. It is an attempt to assuage the demand for lower taxes among wealthy party donors without being perceived by Mr. Trump\u2019s working-class base as giving a windfall to the rich.Mr. Trump promised after meeting with lawmakers on Tuesday that \u201cwe will cut taxes tremendously for the middle class.\u201dHe will make his pivot to overhauling the tax code official on Wednesday during a speech in Indiana where he will unveil details of a plan that he has promised will be the biggest tax cut in history.For Republicans who have been scarred by the experience of seeing tax cuts lead to fiscal shortfalls in states such as Kansas, South Carolina and Tennessee, Indiana represents a case study of where tax cuts worked.\u201cOur history of being a state that has reduced the size of government, specifically through Pence tax cuts in 2013, makes us an example of \u2018here\u2019s these tax cuts,\u2019 and then seeing economic growth,\u201d said Justin Stevens, the Indiana head of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity.As governor, Mr. Pence signed legislation modestly reducing personal income taxes and taxes on companies. Coinciding with that, the state\u2019s economy grew and unemployment declined. As of last year, Indiana\u2019s gross domestic product ranked 16th in the United States and its unemployment rate last month was 3.5 percent, below the national level of 4.4 percent.Mr. Trump on Wednesday will make the case that this is the recipe for economic success nationally, but some economists in the state are not certain that the local strategy can be replicated on a national scale. Michael J. Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University, said it was too soon to say if the Pence tax cuts actually stimulated the state economy.\u201cOn the right, you\u2019re going to hear that by cutting taxes you\u2019re going to have huge new tax revenues,\u201d Mr. Hicks said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no analysis that finds that.\u201dIndiana has also had to find new revenue to fund infrastructure projects and rebuild crumbling roads. This year, the state approved a 10-cents-per-gallon gas tax.Finding money to pay for the Trump administration\u2019s ambitious tax plan will be one of the bigger puzzles. Republicans say they are counting on a surge in economic growth and on the elimination of deductions to make up a fiscal shortfall that tax experts have suggested could amount to trillions of dollars.Last week, members of the Senate Budget Committee agreed on a framework that would add to the federal deficit in order to pave the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years. The budget resolution still must pass both houses of Congress before work can begin in earnest on tax legislation, and some Republicans have already expressed reluctance.Assessing the cost of the Republican tax framework will be difficult until more details are made available. Analyses of Mr. Trump\u2019s previous plans and the House Republican blueprint from 2016 were estimated to reduce government revenues by between $3 trillion and $7 trillion over a decade.Mr. Trump is expected to intensify his pitch to get Democrats on board with his tax plan.Mr. Donnelly, who is seen as vulnerable in a state that voted heavily for Mr. Trump, is one of three senators who did not sign a letter from Democrats making demands that the tax plan not benefit the rich or add to the deficit. Mr. Trump will probably call him out directly on Wednesday.During his meeting on Tuesday with Republicans and Democrats from the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Trump also made a pitch for bipartisanship.\u201cIt is time for both parties to come together and do what is right for the American people,\u201d he said.But garnering support from Democrats will not be easy.\u201cTrump asked for Democrats to jump on the caboose after the tax train has already left the station,\u201d said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, who complained that lowering top tax rates and repealing the estate tax would be a boon for the wealthy. \u201cI saw no Democrat ready to jump on board.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Africa, a Glimpse of Hope for Beating H.I.V.", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesCan you guess how many times, over the course of more than a year, an infected partner gave an uninfected partner H.I.V.?A. 928B. 0C. 503D. 17The answer is B. Zero. And in that fact lies hope.How do you stop AIDS? Not just treating H.I.V., but ending the epidemic. Even when there\u2019s no vaccine and no cure.Part of the answer can be witnessed in a white trailer on the grounds of a polyclinic in Hatcliffe, a dusty town in the northern part of greater Harare, Zimbabwe. Even before the trailer opens each day, the benches outside are full of people waiting for a checkup or a fresh supply of medicine for H.I.V. or the diseases that pounce on weakened immune systems.Hatcliffe\u2019s clinic, like all public clinics in Harare, charges $5 for visits that don\u2019t involve either H.I.V. or tuberculosis. That may seem like a bargain to Americans. But Zimbabwe is in an economic crisis, making millions of people struggle just to buy their staples of cornmeal, sugar and cooking oil.The clinic is supposed to offer medicines free, but has run out of many, said Sheila Chiedza, the nurse who runs it. (A doctor visits on Wednesdays.) The clinic must send patients to a pharmacy to purchase what they need. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have it here, we are not sure if they can get it,\u201d Chiedza said.For most Zimbabweans, then, medical care at the public clinic is a financial hardship. But H.I.V. and tuberculosis care are different: Drugs are free, each clinic visit costs just one dollar, and most patients come four times a year.When I visited in August, the trailer\u2019s back office was crowded with staff members entering data. I asked how well patients did on their AIDS meds. \u201cNinety percent undetectable,\u201d said a young man who gave his name as Mr. Edwards.But the clinic may not have been exaggerating. Zimbabwe is one of the world\u2019s worst-governed countries and has suffered a staggering economic decline. But it\u2019s doing right by people with H.I.V. \u2014 a lot better than the United States.Every epidemic has a tipping point. When the transmission rate drops below that point, it begins to recede. For H.I.V., reaching the tipping point requires three things: that 90 percent of people with the virus know they have it, that 90 percent of that group are taking antiretroviral medicines to keep the epidemic in check, and that 90 percent of those taking medicine control the virus to the point where it is undetectable and therefore cannot be transmitted.A large part of this success is due to George W. Bush, whose administration established the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, in 2004. Its impact is now evident in the trailer in the yard of Hatcliffe Polyclinic and just about every such trailer in countries with a large H.I.V. burden.Of course, Bush\u2019s initiative wasn\u2019t alone. Pepfar programs are dwarfed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, which began working around the world in 2002. Most governments take H.I.V. seriously, and campaigns by a global network of people living with H.I.V. and their supporters achieved those victories.Pepfar began work in seven African countries in 2004, and also contributed to the Global Fund. Now it works in 22 African countries, along with some in Asia and Latin America.In the past three and a half years, Pepfar has doubled the number of people for whom it provides treatment. It has added a million children in the past two years. On Tuesday, several organizations are releasing household surveys from two more countries \u2014 Lesotho, which is near a tipping point, and Uganda, which has stabilized its epidemic.\u201cZimbabwe has made great strides,\u201d said Martha Tholanah, a prominent campaigner there for the rights of H.I.V.-infected and gay people. Everyone I spoke with agrees.Still, here\u2019s what Zimbabwe has done right:It put its own money into fighting H.I.V. In 1999, the country instituted a 3 percent tax on income and corporate profits to fund AIDS programs. That continues, although the totals collected have suffered in synchrony with a failing economy. But few other poor countries have tried to do as much to pay for fighting the disease.Some of the country\u2019s leaders on H.I.V. are serious and competent, including Tsitsi Apollo, who directs the country\u2019s response.Deborah Birx, the United States\u2019 global AIDS coordinator and head of Pepfar, said that the biggest global challenge is the first 90 in the 90-90-90 formula: getting people tested so that they know their H.I.V. status. It\u2019s especially difficult to reach young people, so Pepfar focuses on them. \u201cMore than half of men under 35 and almost a third of women under 25\u201d who have H.I.V. don\u2019t know they\u2019re infected, Birx said. \u201cSo they\u2019re unintentionally passing it on.\u201dBut there\u2019s a lot Zimbabwe still must do. \u201cWhen we sit in committees with the National AIDS Council, it seems that everything is in place,\u201d Tholanah said. \u201cBut in the communities, you find out there are such a lot of things communities lack.\u201dShe said that clinics don\u2019t talk to patients about managing the side effects of medicines. Labs frequently lose blood tests, and when the tests do come back, it\u2019s with absurd delays. The results from one of her blood tests, taken in April, arrived in August, she said.Perhaps most important, money is so short that needed drugs are not always acquired. One is fluconazole, an important drug that treats thrush and other fungal diseases in AIDS patients. Cheng visited a number of health centers and found that almost none had the drug. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a much better job managing antiretrovirals,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with drugs for opportunistic infections, stock-outs are still a common occurrence.\u201dTholanah said that even some antiretrovirals are now going missing. \u201cWhen things are O.K., people go every three months,\u201d she said. \u201cBut of late, they\u2019re not O.K.\u201d She said that for some second-line drugs, clinics are giving out only a week\u2019s supply, and that she had heard of people getting only three days\u2019 worth.So they have to go back to the clinic over and over, which means paying for transportation, paying that dollar and enduring a long wait. Patients have started sharing drugs, she said. \u201cAnd yesterday I heard that even for first-line drugs, they\u2019re now giving a one-month supply,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a red flag.\u201dBoth the House and Senate appropriations committees ignored him, approving funding at the same level as last year\u2019s. When Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, proposed adding $500 million, however, that was voted down, along party lines.An earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of people with H.I.V. in the United States who have an undetectable viral load. It is 49 percent, not 30 percent.An earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to Swaziland. It was not the first country to achieve viral suppression in 73 percent of its H.I.V. cases; at least seven other countries preceded it.Advertisement"}

Academic research has found that workers bear between 50 and 75 percent of the burden of the corporate income tax and that a corporate tax rate reduction would lead to increased wages.American job growth and wages depend on the vibrancy of the corporate sector, where almost half of American private sector workers are employed. Tax reform that sets a competitive corporate tax rate and provides a modern international tax system would level the playing field for American companies to compete in foreign markets, bring additional earnings home, and bolster economic growth by making the United States a more desirable place for companies to invest and employ workers.The writer is president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank.To the Editor:Since tax cuts for corporations and rich people typically don\u2019t trickle down to workers, I propose another way.Let increases in worker compensation be a tax credit. So whatever the corporation pays in additional wages and improved benefits for its employees is the tax cut that it gets. The corporation does better than break even because expenses would be higher and net profit lower as the basis for the taxes due.The extra money that the employees in the lowest wage brackets get will be spent. The result would be a corporate tax cut that actually did produce growth in this consumer-driven economy.And no fair cutting everybody\u2019s wages first and then raising them back to where they were before.

{"Headline": "What the World\u2019s Emptiest International Airport Says About China\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyMattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the second-largest in Sri Lanka, is designed to handle a million passengers per year. It currently receives about a dozen passengers per day. Business is so slow that the airport has made more money from renting out the unused cargo terminals for rice storage than from flight-related activities. In one burst of activity last year, 350 security personnel armed with firecrackers were deployed to scare off wild animals, the airport\u2019s most common visitors.Projects like Mattala are not driven by local economic needs but by remote stratagems. When Sri Lanka\u2019s 27-year civil war ended in 2009, the president at the time, Mahinda Rajapaksa, fixated on the idea of turning his poor home district into a world-class business and tourism hub to help its moribund economy. China, with a dream of its own, was happy to oblige. Hambantota sits in a very strategic location, just a few miles north of the vital Indian Ocean shipping lane over which more than 80 percent of China\u2019s imported oil travels. A port added luster to the \u201cstring of pearls\u201d that China was starting to assemble all along the so-called Maritime Silk Road.Sadly, no travelers came, only the bills. The Mattala airport has annual revenues of roughly $300,000, but now it must repay China $23.6 million a year for the next eight years, according to Sri Lanka\u2019s Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry. Over all, around 90 percent of the country\u2019s revenues goes to servicing debt. Even a new president who took office in 2015 on a promise to curb Chinese influence succumbed to financial reality.To relieve its debt crisis, Sri Lanka has put its white elephants up for sale. In late July, the government agreed to give China control of the deepwater port \u2014 a 70 percent equity stake over 99 years \u2014 in exchange for writing off $1.1 billion of the island\u2019s debt. (China has promised to invest another $600 million to make the port commercially viable.) When the preliminary deal was first floated in January, protests erupted in response to the perceived sell-off of national sovereignty, a reminder of Sri Lanka\u2019s colonial past under British rule. \u201cWe always thought China\u2019s investments would help our economy,\u201d says Amantha Perera, a Sri Lankan journalist and university researcher. \u201cBut now there\u2019s a sense that we\u2019ve been maneuvered into selling some of the family jewels.\u201dThis is China\u2019s long game. It\u2019s not about immediate profits; infrastructure projects are a bad way to make money. So why is President Xi Jinping fast-tracking OBOR projects amid an economic slowdown at home and a crackdown on other overseas acquisitions? Economics is a big part: China wants to secure access to key resources, export its idle industrial capacity, even tilt the world order in its favor. But there is also a far greater cultural ambition. For centuries, Western liberalism has ruled the world. The Chinese believe their time has come. \u201cChina sees itself as a great civilization that needs to regain its status as leader of the world,\u201d says Kadira Pethiyagoda, a fellow at the Brookings Institution Doha Center. \u201cAnd America\u2019s retreat gives China the space to do that.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to see OBOR as a muscled-up Marshall Plan, the American-led program that helped rebuild Western Europe after World War II. OBOR, too, is designed to build vital infrastructure, spread prosperity and drive global development. Yet little of what China offers is aid or even low-interest lending. Much OBOR financing comes in the form of market-rate loans that weaker countries are eager to receive \u2014 but may struggle to repay. Even when the projects are well suited for the local economy, the result can look a bit like a shell game: Things are built, money goes to Chinese companies and the country is saddled with more debt. What happens when, as is often the case, infrastructure projects are driven more by geopolitical ambition or the need to give China\u2019s state-owned companies something to do? Well, Sri Lanka has an empty airport for sale.Sri Lanka may be a harbinger for debt crises to come. Many other OBOR countries have taken on huge Chinese loans that could prove difficult to repay. For example, Chinese banks, according to The Financial Times, recently lent Pakistan $1.2 billion to stave off a currency crisis \u2014 even as they pledged $57 billion more to develop the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. \u201cThe projects China proposes are so big and appealing and revolutionary that many small countries can\u2019t resist,\u201d says Brahma Chellaney, a professor of strategic studies at New Delhi\u2019s Center for Policy Research. \u201cThey take on loans like it\u2019s a drug addiction and then get trapped in debt servitude. It\u2019s clearly part of China\u2019s geostrategic vision.\u201dThis charge conjures the specter of colonialism, when the British and Dutch weaponized debt to take control of nations\u2019 strategic assets. China insists it is nothing like a colonial power. Its appeal to developing countries, after all, is often based on a shared negative experience of colonialism \u2014 and the desire to have cooperative \u201cwin-win\u201d trade and investment relationships. Unlike Western countries and institutions that try to influence how developing countries govern themselves, China says it espouses the principle of noninterference. If local partners benefit from a new road or port, the Chinese suggest, shouldn\u2019t they be able to \u201cwin,\u201d too \u2014 by securing its main trade routes, building loyal partnerships and enhancing its global prestige?After Zheng He\u2019s death at sea in 1433, China turned inward for the next six centuries. Now, as the country has become a global power once again, Communist Party leaders have revived the legend of Zheng He to show China\u2019s peaceful intentions and its historical connections to the region. His goal, they say, was not to conquer \u2014 unlike Western empires \u2014 but to establish friendly trade and diplomatic relations. In Sri Lanka today, Chinese tour groups often traipse through a Colombo museum to see the trilingual stone tablet the admiral brought here \u2014 proof, it seems, that China respected all peoples and religions. No mention is made of a less savory aspect of Zheng He\u2019s dealings in Ceylon. On a later expedition, around 1411, his troops became embroiled in a war. Zheng He prevailed and took the local king back to China as a prisoner.The unsanitized version of Zheng He\u2019s story may contain a lesson for present-day China about unintended consequences. Pushing countries deeper into debt, even inadvertently, may give China leverage in the short run, but it risks losing the good will essential to OBOR\u2019s long-term success. For all the big projects China is engaged in around the world \u2014 high-speed rail in Laos, a military base in Djibouti, highways in Kenya \u2014 arguably its most perilous step so far may be taking control of the foundering Hambantota port. \u201cIt\u2019s folly to take equity stakes,\u201d says Joshua Eisenman, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cChina will have to become further entwined in local politics. And what happens if the country decides to deny a permit or throw them out. Do they retreat? Do they protect?\u201d China promotes itself as a new, gentler kind of power, but it\u2019s worth remembering that dredging deepwater ports and laying down railroad ties to secure new trade routes \u2014 and then having to defend them from angry locals \u2014 was precisely how Britain started down the slippery slope to empire.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "Review: The Scandalous Friendship That Shaped Adam Smith", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryAlthough Adam Smith had no children, he has been identified as either the father of economics or, more expansively, of modern capitalism. And to be sure, the continuing relevance of his masterwork, \u201cThe Wealth of Nations,\u201d published at the moment our nation came to be in 1776, is undeniable.As with all iconic figures in the history of ideas, Smith\u2019s views are frequently misrepresented. Most notably, Smith\u2019s advocacy of free markets and free trade were not nearly as absolutist as is often supposed. That said, conventional wisdom does manage to capture the gist of Smith\u2019s broad conclusions with fair accuracy.Where conventional wisdom falls short is in understanding who Smith was and the nature of the intellectual journey that yielded these results.Smith was the ultimate establishment figure of the early Scottish Enlightenment. He held the most important professorial chair at the most important university, Glasgow. And this was not a chair in economics \u2014 the discipline did not yet exist \u2014 but in moral philosophy.The field of political economy was a branch of philosophy, and it would be more than a century before practitioners\u2019 \u201cscientific\u201d aspirations changed the term to economics (with the \u201cs\u201d representing science). The book that established Smith\u2019s reputation for most of his professional life was called \u201cThe Theory of Moral Sentiments.\u201dSmith published only two significant works, with \u201cThe Wealth of Nations\u201d coming a full 17 years after \u201cMoral Sentiments.\u201d Although it would not be fair to call the ultimately more famous book a sequel to his first, \u201cThe Wealth of Nations\u201d is not fully intelligible without understanding that context.In \u201cThe Infidel and the Professor: David Hume, Adam Smith and the Friendship that Shaped Modern Thought,\u201d Dennis Rasmussen, a professor of political theory at Tufts University, ably provides much of that needed context. In addition to painting a vivid portrait of the intellectual life of 18th-century Scotland, Professor Rasmussen provides a road map of the development of Smith\u2019s ideas based on his personal history and the broader political, social, theological and academic environments.Professor Rasmussen\u2019s greatest contribution, however, is to shed new light on the surprising depth and nature of the intellectual and personal influence of the radical skeptic philosopher David Hume on Smith. If Smith was the ultimate establishment figure, Hume was the ultimate subversive.Widely viewed as one of the greatest philosophers \u2014 if not the greatest \u2014 ever to write in English, Hume had already gained international renown before Smith produced his first book. Yet Hume\u2019s radical ideas, particularly on the nature of religious belief, ensured that he could never secure a university position of any kind \u2014 and prompted two failed efforts by the Church of Scotland to have him excommunicated.It was not just in their lifetimes that Hume\u2019s renown outstripped Smith\u2019s. Hume\u2019s continuing impact on individual thinkers and broader fields of study is truly breathtaking. Kant, Darwin and Einstein (who credited him with inspiration for relativity theory) is a short list of great minds deeply influenced by Hume. And, in addition to the effect of his thought on economics, he is considered by some to be the father of modern cognitive science.Hume was a dozen years Smith\u2019s senior. The two met shortly after Smith had completed his studies, but before he had secured a university position. Hume had already published his first major, and scandalously received, work. It is not completely clear how or why they connected, given their vast differences in both position and disposition: Hume was large and gregarious, Smith more of an absent-minded professor type.What is evident from the excellent use Professor Rasmussen makes of their letters and those of contemporaries is that the two quickly became devoted to one another.One of the more interesting aspects of \u201cThe Infidel\u201d is the extent to which the profound role of friendship in the thought of both Hume and Smith, neither of whom ever married, was colored by their own deep attachment. The most engaging aspects of the story relate to the nature of that friendship.Less satisfying is the description of how precisely the relationship \u201cshaped modern thought.\u201d Professor Rasmussen does a fine job of demonstrating how closely the thinkers\u2019 views align in a wide variety of areas, even where it is not readily apparent. But many of their most famous and influential ideas are not closely examined. There is, for instance, little discussion of either Smith\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d or Hume\u2019s \u201cis-ought problem.\u201dHume\u2019s impending death in 1776 \u2014 he had grown ill by that year, with what was probably some kind of cancer \u2014 was the source of great public interest, particularly among those most horrified by his skeptical views on religious belief. The philosopher wrote a short autobiography at the time, in part to demonstrate that he had managed to live and die \u201chappily and virtuously, without religion.\u201d The resulting \u201cfuneral oration for myself\u201d was sure to be a source of disappointment for those who had hoped for a recantation or at least moderation of his previous views in the face of imminent expiry. It was, however, not entirely unexpected.What was a source of both shock and fury was a letter appended to every edition of the work from Adam Smith, describing the \u201ccheerfulness and equanimity\u201d of his dear friend\u2019s final days. Even more infuriating was Smith\u2019s overall conclusion that Hume approached \u201cas nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man, as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit.\u201dSmith had spent his life and career avoiding the kind of controversy and offense that Hume had reveled in. By associating his name and reputation with such a strong defense of Hume\u2019s moral character, Smith risked not only his social and professional standing, but the fortunes of his long-gestating masterpiece, \u201cThe Wealth of Nations,\u201d which had just finally been published.Smith\u2019s letter was certainly an act of bravery and a reflection of the depth of his intellectual debt to Hume. As Professor Rasmussen argues, it \u201calso represents a kind of paean to friendship.\u201dThe same could be said of Professor Rasmussen\u2019s touching and illuminating book.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "How the New Immigration Is Shaking Old Europe to Its Core", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionIn the mid-1890s, the German sociologist Max Weber warned against \u201cthe continual swarm\u201d of cheap Polish laborers arriving in Germany. According to him, a \u201cfree market policy, including open borders in the east, is the worst possible policy at this point.\u201d And not just for economic reasons. The likely integration of these aliens would threaten the \u201csocial unification of the nation, which has been split apart by modern economic development.\u201d For Weber, a German nationalist, the \u201cinflux of Poles\u201d was \u201cfar more dangerous from a cultural viewpoint\u201d than even of Chinese \u201ccoolies.\u201dCompared with Weber\u2019s rhetoric about Germany\u2019s \u201cstruggle for existence\u201d and his strictures against Catholics and Jews as well as Poles and Chinese, there is nothing overtly racist about the denunciations Rita Chin quotes in \u201cThe Crisis of Multiculturalism in Europe\u201d by opponents of multiculturalism \u2014 which for them is shorthand for the nonwhite laborers Europe expediently imported after World War II to reconstruct its shattered economy. The political scientist Samuel Huntington\u2019s comment that \u201cmulticulturalism is in its essence anti-European civilization\u201d \u2014 approvingly cited by Douglas Murray in \u201cThe Strange Death of Europe\u201d \u2014 also seems coded in comparison. But as demagogues across Europe and America rant against immigration and promise to build a strong and unified national community through exclusion, it is hard not to feel d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Racial nationalism was commonplace in the late 19th century, the radically disruptive first phase of economic globalization. Hierarchies of race, ethnicity and religion were imposed on non-Western peoples as Europeans scrambled for territories and resources abroad, followed enviously by Americans. Exclusion was also central to their frantic effort to build political communities at home. Old bonds and solidarities had frayed in societies split apart, as Weber wrote, by modern economic development. Many of the aggrieved became eager to recreate and purify the social body, and to preserve \u201cour\u201d identity against people stigmatized as the \u201cother\u201d through their names, skin color or religious practices. Mass immigration to Western Europe and America, which peaked in the late 19th century, heightened the fantasy of a lost communal wholeness. So did unregulated flows of refugees: Pogroms in Russia sent thousands of Jewish survivors to Western Europe. (Weber\u2019s warnings against the Polish \u201cswarm\u201d reflected a then widespread anxiety about Ostjuden.)Virulent anti-Semites flourished in Austria-Hungary, Germany and France as the 19th century ended, while lynchings of blacks by white mobs in the United States became more common. The United States in the 1880s had pioneered racialized immigration policy, passing laws aimed at keeping Asians out. The Jim Crow laws that institutionalized segregation in the 1890s were accompanied by a mass hysteria in the United States against immigrants. Fears of degeneration haunted even powerful white men like Theodore Roosevelt. In 1905, amid widespread paranoia about the Yellow Peril, he warned of \u201crace suicide,\u201d exhorting white people to strengthen themselves against their rising nonwhite rivals.Needless to say, Murray\u2019s threnody for Europe is as fundamentally incoherent as its late-19th-century originals. It never strikes him, or other secondhand vendors of fixed and singular identities, that nowhere in the world have individuals been the exclusive heirs of a single culture or civilization. Europe as well as America has been a melting pot of diverse influences: Persian, Arab and Chinese, in addition to Greek, Roman, Germanic and Anglo-Saxon. As the Indian writer Rabindranath Tagore, a horrified witness to Europe\u2019s suicidal nationalism in the early 20th century, once wrote: \u201cIn human beings differences are not like the physical barriers of mountains, fixed forever \u2014 they are fluid with life\u2019s flow, they are changing their courses and their shapes and their volumes,\u201d in what is a \u201cworld-game of infinite permutations and combinations.\u201dMurray\u2019s retro claims of ethnic-religious community, and fears of contamination, call for close analysis. Their toxic effects, which have been amply verified by history, make it imperative to explore the deeper sources of contemporary anxieties: political, social and economic upheavals. And this is what Rita Chin\u2019s book does, synthesizing the endless debates over multiculturalism into a vivid picture of postwar Europe. Lucidly written and resourcefully argued, it is a superb example of a scholarly intervention in a public debate dominated by unexamined prejudice.Chin\u2019s parents were ethnic Chinese forced to leave Malaysia after the end of British rule and to move through many \u201cdifferent cultural worlds as students, employees, colleagues, neighbors, friends and in-laws.\u201d She wishes her reader to understand the multiple and perennially shifting identities of immigrants \u201cin a world where much of the political discourse is quick to demonize them as groups.\u201d Accordingly, she declines to accept identities \u2014 British, German or European \u2014 as unalterable essences. Rather, she explores the specific ideas that many in post-1945 British, French, Dutch and German societies have used to clarify their identity; and she never ceases to historicize what to a tub-thumper like Murray seems self-evident.The very notion of Europe, for instance, began to emerge out of European encounters with Muslim populations during the Crusades. European self-consciousness was then sharply demarcated in remote trading posts and colonies vis-\u00e0-vis subjugated and supposedly racially inferior peoples. But, as Chin writes, the \u201creversal of migratory patterns\u201d after World War II \u201cshifted the process of European self-definition in a dramatic way\u201d: \u201cInstead of Europeans moving outward into the world as they had done for hundreds of years, people from around the world began to settle in Europe, filling the demand for labor created by wartime destruction.\u201dFor Chin, an associate professor of history at the University of Michigan, this is the crux of the problem: \u201cIn the past, groups perceived as incompatible with European identity were usually located beyond European borders. But now they are firmly established within Europe itself.\u201d In the 19th century, nation-states premised on homogeneous populations needed foreign lands and resources in order to expand; and they had the brute power necessary to enforce hierarchies of race, class and education that kept the \u201cnatives\u201d in their place. This supremacy has been progressively weakened, first by the urgencies of postwar reconstruction, then by the accelerated flows of technologies, goods and capital in recent decades of globalization.Chin pays little attention to the socioeconomic traumas that have led to an acute obsession with immigration: deindustrialization, the shrinking of the welfare state, the fragmentation of working classes and the rise of extreme inequality. Nor does she go into a pre-1945 history of immigration in Europe, and the projection of internal problems on to various \u201coutsiders\u201d \u2014 Jewish, Italian, Portuguese, Irish, Polish. But she is consistently acute on how European elites since 1945 have reacted to the darker-skinned strangers in their midst, ignoring, misrepresenting and marginalizing them at first, and then turning them into a problem, often broadly identified as \u201cmulticulturalism.\u201dMulticulturalism, in Chin\u2019s account, appears largely to be a problem for people who have long been accustomed to an identity built on domination and exclusion, and are panicked by its slow crumbling. Certainly, immigration was not a problem foisted on Europe from the outside; the fates of Europeans and non-Europeans were inextricably connected in the 19th century by conquest, colonization and trade. Yet historical amnesia played an outsize role in dealing with nonwhite workers who were never expected to stay in Europe, let alone integrate or assimilate. Chin describes how people from the Caribbean who began to arrive in Britain after 1948, for instance, were seen as \u201ccolored immigrants\u201d when in fact they were British citizens. An unreconstructed racism (exemplified by the commonplace sign \u201cno dogs, no blacks, no Irish\u201d) remained for many years the appalling fate of people who had shaped, like millions of toiling workers and peasants in the imperial provinces, the privileged destiny of the rich in the metropolitan center.A backlash against multiculturalism began to gather force after the economic crises of the 1970s. The controversy over Salman Rushdie\u2019s \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d accelerated it. Black people had long been seen as culturally predisposed to crime and hooliganism. But after the Ayatollah Khomeini, wrongly identified by the uninformed as the sole representative of more than one billion Muslims, issued his fatwa against Rushdie, Islam began to seem incompatible with \u201cWestern values\u201d too. Diversity has come to seem unworkable to many as the unequal world made by imperialism unravels, and Europe suffers terrorist attacks, economic crises and huge influxes of refugees from the countries it once brusquely made and remade in Asia and Africa. Chin vigorously tackles the \u201cshared presumption,\u201d recklessly echoed by even mainstream politicians in Britain, France and Germany, that multiculturalism is a failure. \u201cDeclaring multiculturalism \u2018dead,\u2019\u201d Chin argues, \u201cis a way of white Britons, Germans and French telling immigrants, \u2018We don\u2019t recognize you; you aren\u2019t a part of our society.\u2019\u201dSurely, the many populations that now exist in every part of Europe cannot be homogenized, except through the savage ethnic cleansing practiced in almost every European country in the first half of the 20th century. In any case, as Chin asks, \u201cwhat exactly do Europeans imagine as a replacement for multiculturalism? How will they come to terms with multiethnic diversity moving forward?\u201d Chin offers no simple answers, but her questions have never seemed more urgent as Europeans (and Americans) seem to move forward to their grim past.Pankaj Mishra is the author, most recently, of \u201cAge of Anger: A History of the Present.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I said a new collar will start: that is metal collar. That metal collar will not only replace most of the blue collar jobs, but many of the white collar jobs. So when they become so smart and the muscles to move, what is the definition of what mankind\u2019s job should be? What should we do if they replace many of our jobs? What is the value of our lives? We have to think once more, deeply.\u201dMore from Mr. Son on artificial intelligence:\u201cI predict 30 years from now, the number of smart robots, the smart robot population on this earth will be 10 billion. By that time, human population will be around 10 billion. So here on this earth we will have 10 billion population of mankind and 10 billion population of smart robots. This is the first time on this earth that we live together with 10 billion robots.\u201d\u201cEvery industry that mankind created will be redefined. The medical industry, automobile industry, the information industry of course. Every industry that mankind ever defined and created, even agriculture, will be redefined. Because the tools that we created were inferior to mankind\u2019s brain in the past. Now the tools become smarter than mankind ourselves. The definition of whatever the industry, will be redefined.\u201dWhy It MattersSoftBank has made waves with its $93 billion Vision Fund technology investment vehicle. But many in the industry have been asking: What is Mr. Son trying to do?In the speech, Mr. Son said that it all went back to artificial intelligence and robots:\u201cWhat is my belief and vision for this investment? I have only one belief \u2014 Singularity.\u201dThe ContextIn Other SoftBank NewsSprint, which SoftBank controls, has made progress in its on-again, off-again merger discussions with T-Mobile.SoftBank would emerge as a large minority holder in any combination. While T-Mobile C.E.O. John Legere is expected to lead any combination that results from a merger, Son has made it clear he wants a say in how the company is run. That desire adds another layer of complexity to an already difficult transaction.Senate Republicans have learned to stop worrying and embrace deficit spending.Their current budget plan: $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years.But many obstacles remain:While the Republicans may coalesce around a $1.5 trillion tax cut, the details of the actual plan remain fraught with lawmakers divided on some key issues such as the corporate tax rate and which, if any, deductions will be eliminated or scaled back.\u2022 The Senate still needs to reconcile any bill they pass with the less-deficit-friendly House.\u2022 Traditional opponents of growing the deficit are unhappy with the plan. Here\u2019s Michael A. Peterson of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation:\u201cIrresponsible tax reform is counterproductive and anti-growth because increasing the national debt hurts the economy. Tax reform should grow the economy, not the debt.\u201dIn Other Economic NewsThey add:Investors remain wary that any mistake by the central bank, such as removing stimulus too quickly, could upend months of relative calm. Conversely, if the Fed falls behind and allows inflation grow too quickly that could also put the economic expansion at risk.Mark Walter, the chief executive of Guggenheim Partners, is under pressure to leave the role or quit the firm completely after reports of internal turmoil.Some investors have canceled meetings, threatened to pull their money from the asset manager and vented their frustration with Guggenheim\u2019s top management over what they see as a weak corporate culture, said several people informed about the matter.Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began looking at Guggenheim\u2019s operations, certain investments and disclosures, according to people familiar with the situation. The regulator has since requested from Guggenheim information on several deals, including one involving the firm\u2019s investment in an entity founded by former Barclays PLC chief executive Bob Diamond, the people said.The Journal adds that Mr. Walter is weighing giving up the chief executive job. A Guggenheim spokesman\u2019s response: \u201cMr. Walter has no current plans to relinquish his position as C.E.O. of Guggenheim.\u201dThe Context\u2022 Mr. Walter has been locked in a feud with Scott Minerd, Guggenheim\u2019s chief investment officer and most recognizable executive.The Taiwanese manufacturing giant has pledged to spend $10 billion and create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin.But Wisconsin may want to look to Brazil, where Foxconn made a similar promise. After six years, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo is still waiting for those jobs to materialize.\u201cThe area where Foxconn said it would build a plant is totally abandoned,\u201d said Guilherme Gazzola, the mayor of Itu, one of the cities that hoped to benefit from the project. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even expressed an interest in meeting us.\u201dFoxconn does the \u201cbig song and dance, bringing out the Chinese dragon dancers, ribbon cuttings, toasts and signature of the usual boilerplate agreements,\u201d said Alberto Moel, an investor and adviser to early-stage tech companies who until recently was a technology analyst at the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cThen, when it gets down to brass tacks, something way smaller materializes.\u201dThe problem? In China, Foxconn enjoys huge government support, including subsidies and help to quash labor protests.That\u2019s not necessarily available elsewhere. The Times adds:In Brazil, Foxconn\u2019s plans unraveled quickly. The administration that had wooed the company was soon swept from power amid corruption allegations and an impeachment vote. Some of the tax breaks that had been promised were reduced or abandoned, as economic growth and consumer spending slumped.The school has already made huge changes in how its $37.1 billion endowment is run, including appointing a new chief executive, N.P.

{"Headline": "He\u2019s 28, a Prince and Representing a Kingdom: Meet Washington\u2019s Newest Ambassador", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Prince Khalid bin Salman\u2019s first official American trip as the Saudi ambassador to the United States, he visited Saudi military officers at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, met with Saudi engineers in Silicon Valley and connected with Lockheed Martin executives in Texas.The journey, in a luxury jet staffed by women who offered chocolates, coffee or hot towels every few minutes, was the Saudi-prince version of learning on the job.Over a steak dinner in his suite at San Francisco\u2019s St. Regis Hotel, where the tailored suit of his trip had been exchanged for a loose white Oxford cloth shirt and navy pants, the young ambassador considered how his career path had abruptly changed.\u201cI used to wake up and check the weather,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cNow I wake up and check the news.\u201dPrince Khalid\u2019s American tour ended late last week. Back in Washington, he will rely on his built-in royal connections to enhance the considerable influence the Saudis enjoy in the capital, now more than ever. As other American allies are smarting from Trump White House slights, the kingdom has regained its status as a trusted partner after eight difficult years with the Obama administration.\u201cI think the relationship is stronger,\u201d Prince Khalid said. \u201cThe current administration understands the common threats and the common interests.\u201dPrince Khalid\u2019s arrival in Washington, observers familiar with the embassy say, will help consolidate the information that flows between the White House, the embassy and Riyadh, and smooth relations.Not everyone is convinced.Rami Khouri, a columnist and the former director of the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut, delivered a lecture during a two-week Harvard course on national and international security last fall. Prince Khalid was one of the students.Mr. Khouri said the Saudi relationship to the United States was more fragile than it looked \u2014 he likened it to a \u201csumo wrestler walking a tightrope.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the times when the Saudi king suddenly has his children in positions for which they have virtually zero qualifications,\u201d Mr. Khouri said, \u201cand Trump is doing the same things. So we\u2019ve got to kind of tighten our seatbelts.\u201dAnd Prince Khalid faces undeniable obstacles in Washington.\u201cAt the end of the day, our security is also very important to the United States,\u201d Prince Khalid said, adding that if the sales were stalled, the kingdom would procure weapons \u201cfrom somewhere else.\u201dThe ambassador is particularly concerned with bipartisan outreach during a volatile time in Washington. Robert Malley, a senior adviser to the Obama administration on the Middle East and now a vice president at the International Crisis Group, who recently met with the ambassador, said the Saudis would need to be careful.\u201cThey need to walk a fine line: Embracing Trump without alienating his foes,\u201d Mr. Malley said in an interview. \u201cOtherwise, they risk losing not just Democrats, but many who are not particularly sympathetic to this administration.\u201dThe regional blockade against Qatar poses another challenge. Prince Khalid made a beeline to Capitol Hill after presenting his credentials to Mr. Trump in July, and met with more than a dozen lawmakers.\u201cThe ambassador and I had a productive meeting,\u201d Mr. Corker said in an email relayed through a spokesman. \u201cHe and his brother, the Crown Prince, will play an important role in modernizing the partnership between our countries, and I am hopeful they will make positive contributions that foster shared interests for regional security and stability.\u201dAside from jaunts to Capitol Hill and quiet visits to a few Georgetown restaurants, Prince Khalid has kept a low profile in Washington, preferring to host visitors at his palatial compound overlooking the Potomac River in McLean, Va., where he lives with his wife and two young children.Andrew Exum, a friend of Prince Khalid\u2019s and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy in the Obama administration, said the ambassador\u2019s military background \u2014 including time spent in training programs at American Air Force bases in Mississippi, Texas and Nevada \u2014 produced a different type of Saudi official.\u201cHe was really living in America,\u201d Mr. Exum said, \u201cnot on the coasts.\u201dPart of the job, Mr. Exum said, is combating the kingdom\u2019s broader image problem among Americans.Prince Khalid framed the bill, known as JASTA, as a threat to the American-Saudi relationship, and therefore a threat to national security.\u201cI think at the end of the day wisdom will prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people in the United States understand that this relationship is very important to America and very important to counterterrorism.\"\u201cOur leadership is trying to balance that and make sure we move forward and make sure every citizen in Saudi Arabia moves forward with us,\u201d Prince Khalid said. \u201cSome people are going to be in the driving seat, in the front seat, some people will be in the back seat.\u201dThe prince\u2019s allies say his youth is a strength. Captain Mohammad al-Ajmi, an officer in the Saudi air force who said he flew dozens of missions in Yemen and Syria with Prince Khalid, said in an interview that his friend was unassuming and energetic.He has seen the prince quit only once.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to ski,\u201d Captain Ajmi, 29, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing he gave up on.\u201dEric Schmitt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Than a Week After Irma, St. Martin Is Still Trying to Survive", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRAND CASE, St. Martin \u2014 The woman carried a small suitcase, enough for her and her child to try to start over.But as the evacuees finally prepared to board their flight, the airline announced that they could not take their suitcases with them. The woman, a civil servant, fell apart.A soldier rushed to comfort the woman while her daughter broke into tears, fighting with the attendant to keep her mother\u2019s bag, a final indignity in a world stripped of its moorings.But there is still almost no fuel or electricity, and food delivery, for now, remains erratic. A near total communication blackout throttles the island. Almost all of the schools are destroyed and will be closed for months, at best.Hourslong lines wind through the port, as families, tourists and migrant workers alike wait for aid, receiving an odd assortment of items that on some days include frozen chicken and a three-pound bag of mozzarella cheese \u2014 on an island with no power and few working appliances to cook or refrigerate them.With little phone or internet service, residents rely on chance encounters to learn the fate of their neighbors and loved ones. Just outside the local government\u2019s makeshift emergency headquarters, a shriek rang out above the blare of car horns. Luce Kabache, the principal of a kindergarten who survived the storm with her family by hiding in a closet, saw one of her students and her parents passing in a vehicle. They stopped instantly, threw open the doors, ran into the street and embraced, weeping with relief.\u201cThere\u2019s no news, no way to communicate,\u201d said Ms. Kabache, 56.The island will have to start from scratch, creating itself anew, physically and psychologically. Tin roofing and smashed concrete line practically every street and alley, the disembodied bits of what was once a haven.Well beyond the urgent needs \u2014 distributing water and food to those without, restoring power and communications, repairing roofs and addressing the trauma inflicted by the storm \u2014 a faint possibility for the island\u2019s rebirth is emerging.For many, though, the future is confined to making it through the day.\u201cWe have the chance to start back from zero,\u201d said Daniel Gibbs, president of the local government on the French side of St. Martin. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough for my population. They are suffering. But today we have the chance not to rebuild, but to build.\u201dThe island \u2014 split between a French and a Dutch side, with a population of 75,000 over 34 square miles \u2014 has only just begun to take stock of its losses. The government on the French side has reported an official death toll of 11, but an assessment of the full extent of the islandwide destruction may be weeks or months away.\u201cI have no idea how high the death toll will go, but I don\u2019t think it will be in the hundreds,\u201d said Mr. Gibbs, adding that the number of bodies recovered and people reported missing is small for now. \u201cThis thing was just so big, I think people believe the death toll has to be higher.\u201dWhatever new form the island takes, tourism will remain the heart of its economy. How long that will take is anyone\u2019s guess. The storm did not differentiate between the island\u2019s stark socioeconomic differences. Poor areas flooded and suffered the same as the high-cost, pastel-colored communities of Orient Bay.Along the coastline of Marigot, the nerve center of the economy on the French side, the storm toppled restaurants, shops, banks and open-air markets, leaving them desolate, practically abandoned in the midday heat.R\u00e9my Thibaud sat on his battered patio in the shade of the only palm tree left standing, yelling into the phone. Around him were the splintered remnants of his restaurant and bakery. The sea, an inviting cerulean once again, offered a cruel contrast to the chaotic mess where he sat, alone and facing economic ruin.A creditor had called, checking on his next payment for the baking equipment he\u2019d bought two years earlier. What baking equipment, he wanted to know? The oven was filled with seawater when he came to check on his restaurant after the storm.He hung up.\u201cVulture,\u201d said Mr. Thibaud, 48, adjusting the motorcycle gloves he was wearing to clear debris. His insurance, he discovered, would not cover anything on the terrace, which was pretty much the entire restaurant. But he would stay, he had decided, and rebuild what he lost.Many others are leaving. Two of his waiters had already fled. Others, too, have made the difficult choice to abandon their homes, at least temporarily.Christiane Carvigant sat near the makeshift government offices with her three children, ages 17, 16 and 9, as they prepared to evacuate. The children cannot afford to miss school, she said, especially Emeline, a high school senior who is meant to graduate this year. Her two girls and little boy will stay with family on the French island of Guadeloupe, a little less than an hour away by plane.The family had survived the hurricane in the bathroom of their home, huddled in the tiny space for four hours as the wind howled and tore at the roof. Ms. Carvigant would rebuild as her children studied. Who knew when they could come back?A bus came past to collect the children for their flight. Ms. Carvigant began to cry.\u201cIt will be a long time before we can live normally again,\u201d she said, \u201cbut at least we have our lives.\u201dLudmen Vincia, a Haitian woman whose children were born in St. Martin, is trapped.

{"Headline": "China Tries to Steer Loans to Small Businesses", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China announced a move on Saturday aimed at addressing a vexing problem: how to steer more bank loans to small businesses while adding little to the country\u2019s huge debt load.Yet even as steel mills, aluminum smelters, cement factories and other big enterprises have gorged on debt, small businesses have struggled to find the money they need to expand.The People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, tried to address that on Saturday with a complex adjustment to a crucial regulation for commercial banks.The central bank lowered what is called the reserve ratio, or the amount of money it requires banks to keep at the central bank for a rainy day. When the move takes effect in January, it will become cheaper and easier for banks to make more loans.The People\u2019s Bank of China had used reserve ratio cuts in past years to spur broader economic growth. This time appears to be different.The central bank said it would cut the ratio only for banks that meet minimums for lending to small businesses or other borrowers that it called \u201cinclusive finance.\u201d The new category encompasses loans typically of less than 5 million yuan, or about $750,000, that are issued to small businesses, small family companies, farmers, students and poverty alleviation programs.Zhu Ning, a prominent economist at Tsinghua University, said that the central bank was trying to ease credit for the smallest-scale borrowers without setting off more wasteful lending.The move on Saturday, he said, \u201ckills two birds with one stone, by providing liquidity to small enterprises while also providing a subtle sign of loosening.\u201dReserve ratios are currently 15 to 17 percent of a bank\u2019s assets, depending on the bank\u2019s size. The central bank said that it would reduce the reserve ratio by half a percentage point for banks that have at least 1.5 percent of their loans in inclusive finance. It also said that it would lower the ratio by 1.5 percentage points for banks with at least 10 percent of their loans in inclusive finance \u2014 a threshold that practically no banks meet in China except for a few small, mainly rural financial institutions, experts said.In another move that makes the announcement this weekend different from past moves on reserve requirements meant to spur growth, the central bank said the rules would not take effect until the beginning of next year. In the past, such changes took effect immediately or within a few days. Delaying the start of the rule this time gives banks time to increase their lending to small businesses so they can qualify for the new reserve ratios.Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a research group in Shanghai, said that the timing of the central bank\u2019s action on Saturday, the day before China\u2019s National Day holiday on Sunday and before a week when most of the country will be on vacation, suggested that the central bank was trying to show that it was following a broad Communist Party mandate to regulatory agencies to keep the financial sector stable ahead of an important political meeting.The Chinese Communist Party will hold its twice-a-decade congress beginning on Oct. 18, an event that is expected to confirm President Xi Jinping as the party\u2019s general secretary for another five years while also shaking up the rest of the party\u2019s top leadership.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Far Right Complicates Life for Merkel, and the E.U.", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has gained a powerful place from which to alter the agenda of European politics. The far right\u2019s gains in Germany will now complicate not only the calculations of Ms. Merkel, the de facto leader of the European Union, but by extension the path ahead for the entire bloc.Polls indicate that the same will be true in Austria, where the Freedom Party seems set to enter the coalition government after next month\u2019s elections.The far right will be a constant presence in the minds of Europe\u2019s leaders if they want to avoid worse political fallout ahead, even as the populists may make it harder for Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron to come up with solutions that could keep them at bay.In Germany, many votes for the AfD were cast in protest against 12 years of Merkel\u2019s pragmatism about issues like immigration, national identity and the burdens of the European Union.As Mr. Macron himself has warned, a failure to reform the European Union, better secure its borders and fix the euro currency will only further feed the far right.Globalization, the bureaucratic nature of the European Union and its inability to protect its borders and produce thriving economies in all member states have led to increased nationalism, anxieties about national identities and Islamophobia.But while institutional reform of the European Union may be vital, it is harder to sell to increasingly fragmented national polities, especially as the center-left parties lose ground.\u201cThe German elections confirm the decline of mainstream traditional parties in Europe to the benefit of insurgents, including Macron\u2019s En Marche,\u201d said Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian diplomat based in Brussels.\u201cA domestically weakened Merkel must hold the E.U. together and safeguard the trans-Atlantic bond despite an unpredictable American president, while trying to forge a strong alliance with Macron, tame the Visegrad dissidents and bring on board Italy and Spain, both in choppy waters,\u201d he said. (The Visegrad countries are Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.)There is also a danger that Ms. Merkel will be forced to focus more domestically as she faces the absorbing challenge of balancing what promises to be a new, unwieldy and potentially less stable governing coalition. The decision of the Macron-friendly Social Democrats to leave government and become Germany\u2019s official opposition means that Ms. Merkel will now probably have to form a government with the liberal Free Democrats as well as with the Greens.\u201cThere is unlikely to be a large eurozone budget,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there will still be progress on European reform,\u201d including security issues. \u201cBut the fiscal integration that Macron wants looks much harder.\u201dToughness on eurozone budget discipline and opposition to any fiscal transfers within the eurozone are \u201ccentral points for the liberals, and they will continue to be hard on this, because this is where they compete with the AfD,\u201d he said.\u201cThe Social Democrats were very eager to be nice to the French, but the liberals are not,\u201d he added.Carsten Brzeski, the chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING Bank, said the Free Democrats \u201cwill be the big decelerator of European integration\u201d because of their opposition to a large eurozone budget, shared debt, and debt forgiveness for Greece.\u201cIt\u2019s a clear cold shower for Macron,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said. \u201cIt means a very cumbersome process of further integration.\u201dIn a telephone call on Sunday night, Mr. Macron congratulated Ms. Merkel on winning a fourth term, and he said on Twitter that \u201cwe resolutely continue our essential cooperation for Europe and our countries.\u201dMr. Macron is scheduled to make a speech on Tuesday to present his reform proposals. But he should expect little support from Ms. Merkel for any big ideas before she forms a government, which may take until the end of the year, and only selective support thereafter.In a briefing in Paris on Monday, French officials outlining Mr. Macron\u2019s speech were cautious and short on detail. They insisted that Mr. Macron was not pressuring the chancellor, but that it was important to outline French ideas as Ms. Merkel begins the laborious coalition negotiations.But it is also possible that Mr. Macron\u2019s early intervention may backfire in what will already be a difficult task for Ms. Merkel.It may be easier for her to support Mr. Macron\u2019s less controversial proposals, like better border security and turning an existing eurozone bailout fund into a kind of European Monetary Fund, as long as they do not involve new commitment of funds.She has already given some support to Mr. Macron\u2019s proposal of a eurozone finance minister.But the French and Germans differ on the responsibilities that such a minister should have. The Germans would want a taskmaster to enforce the rules and keep national budget deficits within the debt limits required by the eurozone. The French want a minister with flexibility who would control a eurozone budget financed by the states \u2014 but that is exactly what Ms. Merkel\u2019s likely new coalition partners, the Free Democrats, oppose.Mr. Lindner told journalists before the election that he would push for the finance ministry in a coalition. If he succeeds, it may produce little change from the similarly tough-minded Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who has been Ms. Merkel\u2019s finance minister.\u201cWill Lindner be tougher than Sch\u00e4uble?\u201d asked Hans Kundnani of the German Marshall Fund. \u201cUnlikely.\u201dIn the end, Ms. Merkel may have more trouble with her coalition from her sister party, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, which is deeply conservative and which lost about 10 percent of its vote from 2013, largely to the AfD.With regional elections next year, the Christian Social Union and its leader, Horst Seehofer, will try to push Ms. Merkel farther to the right on security and migration issues.To some degree he blames her for his poor showing at the expense of the AfD.But as Mr. von Marschall pointed out, Ms. Merkel\u2019s move toward the center over the last four years \u2014 on the euro, migration and same-sex marriage \u2014 also meant that she would not find herself losing to a left-leaning coalition. The sacrifice of conservative supporters was probably a price she felt she had to pay to keep her party in power after so many years, he said.The coalition that is likely to result will be unpopular in eastern Germany. And it is likely to be unstable, given the tensions within Ms. Merkel\u2019s own party.Yet unstable coalitions and early elections are the norm in most of Europe, Mr. Brzeski said. \u201cGermany has become a bit more European.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Berlin and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Not to \u2018Win Hearts and Minds\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67From the early stages of the Vietnam War, American officials insisted that winning the hearts and minds (yes, the acronym was WHAM) of the South Vietnamese people was the key to victory. But the Americans tasked with carrying out that strategy were ill equipped, linguistically and culturally, to make it work. And in the end, that deficit destroyed whatever good will might have existed on either side and doomed America\u2019s foray into Vietnam to failure.Bui Diem, South Vietnam\u2019s ambassador to Washington from 1965 to 1972, once called the two countries \u201cpeoples quite apart.\u201d And indeed, American and Vietnamese culture had little contact before 1950, when the United States began sending personnel to assist in the fight against Communism. Very few of the Americans sent to South Vietnam had more than a cursory understanding of the country\u2019s language, history, religious traditions, etiquette or politics. The cultural disjunction was exacerbated by a strategic one: While the two nations agreed on the fundamental goal of preserving an independent, non-Communist South Vietnam, the stakes of the war for each were grossly disproportionate. The United States sought merely to uphold its credibility; South Vietnam fought for its existence.Theirs was a patron-client relationship. The United States, the world\u2019s strongest country and still riding high off its victory in World War II, was confident in its power \u2014 and its virtue. It expected to lead, and to be followed. In contrast, the South Vietnamese, citizens of a fragile state newly freed from colonial rule and threatened by internal insurgency and external invasion, recognized their desperate need for American help, but they were also acutely sensitive to dominance by an outside power. They struggled to uphold their dignity and autonomy.Between 1950 and 1965, America\u2019s role in the region, while significant in terms of money and mat\u00e9riel, occupied a limited footprint in the lives of everyday Vietnamese. That changed between 1965 and 1967, when the Americanization of the war brought hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians into the country and put an American face on the increasingly widespread destruction wrought by both sides.Bui Diem noted the absence of communication between the two peoples during the major escalation in 1965, the \u201cun-self-conscious arrogance\u201d of the Americans and the impotence of the South Vietnamese. \u201cThe Americans came in like bulldozers and the South Vietnamese followed their lead without a word of dissent, for the most part without a thought of dissent.\u201dAfter 1965, the United States took on the burden of defeating the enemy militarily. It declined to establish a combined command structure with the South Vietnamese, as it had in Korea. It relegated the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to pacification, a task many Vietnamese considered demeaning. Americanization of the war also produced among South Vietnamese a \u201ctakeover effect,\u201d inviting them to stand by and let the Americans fight the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese. Tragically, American actions encouraged dependency in a nation whose independence it sought to sustain.As the American presence swelled, tensions between the two peoples grew. Vietnamese resented the way their visitors looked down on them and imposed their ways on a presumably inferior people. They were annoyed by American impatience. Some envied the opulent lifestyle of the Americans, with their enormous bases equipped with all the conveniences of home, including air conditioning, shopping centers and movie houses. Others protested that the troops acted \u201cdespicably\u201d toward them, speeding their trucks and cars through traffic at life-threatening speeds. Some claimed that America dispensed aid as though it were being \u201cgiven to a beggar.\u201dMost of all, many South Vietnamese resented their dependence on their ally and its suffocating presence in their lives. Some labeled the \u201cAmerican occupation\u201d a \u201cdemoralizing scourge.\u201d Vietnamese recognized that the Americans were not \u201ccolonialists,\u201d the journalist Robert Shaplen observed, but, he perceptively added, \u201cthere has evolved here a colonial ambience that can sometimes be worse than colonialism itself.\u201dIn the bonanza atmosphere that followed Americanization, South Vietnam\u2019s economy centered upon serving the needs of the new arrivals. Prostitution became a special problem. As the number of Americans in Saigon surged into the tens of thousands, the number of houses of ill repute expanded proportionally, provoking criticism in the United States and South Vietnam. Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas fumed that Saigon had become an \u201cAmerican brothel.\u201d South Vietnamese Catholics and President Nguyen Van Thieu were especially concerned about prostitution, and pleaded with American officials to do something about the suffocating presence of so many troops.The result was Operation Moose (Move Out of Saigon Expeditiously), implemented mostly during 1967. Thousands of G.I.s moved to base camps outside the city (where the prostitutes soon followed), some joking that they had been \u201cMoosed.\u201d Saigon was also declared off limits for R & R. The pace was sufficiently slow that the operation was unofficially tagged Goose (Get Out of Saigon Eventually).The exodus left around 7,900 American soldiers in the city. Moose did not satisfy President Thieu, and it provided no more than a partial solution to the prostitution problem. It also left Saigon more vulnerable to the urban attacks launched by the Viet Cong during the 1968 Tet offensive.The American way of war also inflicted a huge toll on village life in South Vietnam. To limit its own casualties and cope with unfamiliar and often inhospitable terrain, the United States unleashed extraordinary firepower on the country it was trying to save. Areas of suspected enemy strength were bombed and shelled and burned with napalm, often with little consideration of its impact on civilians. Defoliants were used to deny the enemy food and cover, with horrific short- and long-term consequences for Vietnamese.American firepower destroyed homes, villages and crops and alienated those whose hearts and minds were to be won. American commanders declared entire areas free-fire zones. Troops would round up villagers, burn their hooches and relocate them from their ancestral lands into squalid refugee camps. The area would then be bombed and shelled. During Operation Cedar Falls in 1967, Americans forcibly relocated some 6,000 civilians from the village of Ben Suc. Caught between the Viet Cong and the Americans, villagers who wanted only to be left alone became sullen or outright hostile. By early 1967, over 1.5 million refugees had drifted into urban slums, where they were susceptible to Viet Cong propaganda.To be sure, many Americans developed close ties with Vietnamese. Many also committed acts of kindness such as providing medical care and food to people in need. Especially in the early years and in remote areas, American advisers formed attachments with Vietnamese soldiers and villagers. Thousands of troops married Vietnamese women.Still, most Americans arrived in the country without knowledge of the land and the people. \u201cMy time in Vietnam is the memory of ignorance,\u201d one soldier later wrote. Not knowing the language or culture, the Americans did not know what the people felt, or even at times how to tell friend from foe. \u201cWhat we need is some kind of litmus paper than turns red when it\u2019s near a Communist,\u201d one officer half-jokingly told a journalist.Relations with South Vietnamese soldiers were likewise strained. Unaware of the difficulties their counterparts labored under, American troops disparaged their fighting qualities. The newcomers expected the people they were defending to offer the sort of gratitude they believed their fathers had gained for liberating France in World War II. When instead they encountered indifference or even hostility, they grew resentful.For many Americans, the South Vietnamese became an object of contempt, even hatred. \u201cThe people were treacherous,\u201d one soldier later recalled. \u201cThey say \u2018G.I. No. 1\u2019 when we\u2019re in the village, but at night the dirty little rats are V.C.\u201d The ability of the villagers to step around mines and booby traps that killed and maimed Americans provoked suspicion of collusion \u2014 and anger.Americans also brought with them deeply entrenched racist attitudes that prompted the use of slurs such as \u201cgook\u201d and \u201cdink,\u201d which they applied to enemy and friend alike. Contempt could quickly change to a rage that might be turned on Vietnamese civilians. During the summer and fall of 1967, the notorious Tiger Force, an elite commando unit, was assigned to remove civilians from the Song Ve River Valley, suspected to be a source of rice for Viet Cong units. The very name of the mission, Operation Rawhide, suggested a cattle roundup, which had a dehumanizing effect. When the civilians resisted, the Tigers vented their rage by burning their villages. Unhappy with the assignment and under constant fire from enemy snipers, the Americans declared the area a free-fire zone and shot anything that moved, resulting in the brutal killing of numerous civilians.The actions of the Tiger Force were replicated with even more savage results at My Lai, in Quang Ngai province, in February 1968, where American soldiers killed hundreds of Vietnamese civilians. Such atrocities were not typical of American behavior, and even at My Lai there were soldiers who pushed back against their commanders\u2019 orders to kill. Nevertheless, the atrocious violence reflected attitudes toward Vietnamese that divided the two peoples and made the Vietnamese subservient to Americans. Given the frustrations and failures and mounting casualties of the American war effort, atrocities were perhaps only a matter of time.George C.

His replacement may be unwilling or unable to follow in his footsteps, leaving uncertain whether China will tackle problems that could threaten its growth.Today, that effort appears to be ebbing.Now 69, Mr. Zhou is well past the usual mandatory retirement age for someone of his ministerial rank.One potential successor is Jiang Chaoliang, the leader of Hubei Province in central China. Mr. Jiang is a skillful bureaucrat within the Communist Party and has academic training as an economist, but he climbed China\u2019s political ladder while steering clear of the party\u2019s market reformers and skipping economic conferences with free-market themes. In a speech earlier this year, Mr. Jiang called for \u201cspreading Marxist scientific theory with self-confidence, and persistently using Xi\u2019s speeches to arm students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 minds.\u201dMr. Jiang quietly made a few market-oriented changes during the four years that he ran the Bank of Communications, one of the larger state-run banks, where he led an initial public offering of shares on the Hong Kong stock market. But some advocates of a more market-based financial system have been discouraged by Mr. Jiang\u2019s emergence as a leading candidate.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a passion for financial reform, you can\u2019t make that happen, and I don\u2019t think Jiang Chaoliang has that passion,\u201d said Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, based in Shanghai.Should Mr. Jiang get the nod, it would signal a shift away from Mr. Zhou, an English-speaking familiar face for many foreign leaders. By contrast, Mr. Jiang is perceived overseas as a bit of a mystery.Officials did not respond to requests to interview Mr. Jiang. The People\u2019s Bank of China declined to comment.Residents in Wuhan, Hubei\u2019s capital, said that they were not especially aware of Mr. Jiang, who unlike some provincial leaders has not pursued a propaganda campaign to burnish his personal image.

{"Headline": "As China Moves In, Serbia Reaps Benefits, With Strings Attached", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySMEDEREVO, Serbia \u2014 When President Xi Jinping of China chose an industrial town on the Danube River to announce that Serbia was at the center of a $900 billion \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d infrastructure initiative, it was a bold declaration that his country had set up shop on Europe\u2019s southeastern flank.Mr. Xi\u2019s decision to extol his signature policy in Serbia, one of the poorest countries in Europe, was a canny move that put the initiative on a collision course with the European Union\u2019s projects in the region.His strategy also exploited the European Union\u2019s troubled relations with the West Balkan countries seeking to join the bloc, and signaled that \u2014 as the United States retreated from the world stage \u2014 China was aiming to expand its influence right into the heart of Europe.But what was in it for Serbia?During Mr. Xi\u2019s state visit, he said China would bring more jobs, improve living standards and lift the country\u2019s economic growth. More important, by opening its economy to China, Serbia cemented Beijing\u2019s support against European Union pressure to recognize Kosovo\u2019s independence.\u201cIt would not be immodest or wrong to say that Serbia is China\u2019s main partner in Europe,\u201d Serbia\u2019s minister for construction, transportation and infrastructure, Zorana Mihajlovic, declared about Mr. Xi\u2019s overtures.Some in China have questioned the economic viability of Beijing\u2019s investment spree. And outside of China, some fear that China\u2019s ambitions would keep the authoritarian leaders of countries like Serbia in power and leave the nations deep in debt and stuck with environmentally flawed projects.But Mr. Xi\u2019s words saved 5,200 jobs in Smederevo, a city of 100,000 that has depended on the steel mill for decades. China\u2019s state-owned HBIS Group bought the steel mill, the only one in Serbia, for 46 million euros, or nearly $55 million at current exchange rates. Its previous owner, U.S. Steel, sold it to the Serbian government in 2012 for a symbolic $1.\u201cWe want to create a win-win situation,\u201d Mr. Xi said, shortly after the sale.Now, China\u2019s ambitions in the Balkan region have set up a potential clash with the European Union\u2019s plans \u2014 with countries like Serbia placing themselves in the middle.Mileta Gujanicic, a steelworker and union leader, is one of those who hope China fulfills its vision for the Smederevo mill: He has worked there for 40 years and says he got used to the ways of the Americans, whom he called \u201cthe aristocracy of the industrial world.\u201d\u201cAll my life I have been told that capitalism, particularly the American type, was bad,\u201d Mr. Gujanicic, 63, said. \u201cBut we workers have been valued, well paid and respected when the Americans ran this place.\u201dThe Chinese approach to running the mill, he said, is sharply different. So far, the new owners have maintained their pledge to retain jobs. But none of the promises Mr. Xi made during his visit have been kept.Workers\u2019 contracts are veiled in secrecy, safety standards have fallen, maintenance is at the bare minimum, and contact between the owners and the employees does not exist, he said. The erosion of workers\u2019 rights and the employers\u2019 disregard of labor laws are troubling, he said.While China sets its eyes on the region, the European Union is still the most powerful force there, and the bloc\u2019s projects are surging ahead. The styles of the two powers could not be more different.The initiative, known as the Berlin Process and championed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is part of a broader European integration plan for the Balkan countries. The plan aims to align the countries\u2019 national transport laws with those of the European Union and strengthen cooperation across contested Balkan borders.At the last regional summit meeting, in July in Trieste, Italy, the participating countries \u2014 Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, all seeking to join the European Union \u2014 also agreed to create a regional economic zone as part of an effort to consolidate a market of 20 million people.But Balkan officials have long complained of a protracted bureaucratic process, taking as long as a year, for getting funds from Brussels for the work. Crucially, while Serbia\u2019s president has embraced the initiative, Albania and Kosovo have political reservations, fearing that the infrastructure project and a common regional market would become a substitute for full membership in the European Union.In Serbia\u2019s case, its traditionally most generous patrons \u2014 Russia and European Union members such as Germany \u2014 have demanded that Belgrade alter its governing style in exchange for funds.Russia also controls much of Serbia\u2019s energy sector and has commanded considerable influence over successive leaders in Belgrade elected since the fall of the strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 2000.Now comes China, a relative novice in the turbulent Balkan region, offering cash with what appear to be only a few \u2014 but important \u2014 strings attached.For China, the attraction to Serbia is evident in its high state subsidies, lower environmental standards and diminished pressure for transparency in business dealings. But Serbia must embrace Beijing\u2019s model of state-led development.Serbia is also likely to be saddled with huge debts. Most of the investments are loans from Chinese banks, typically for 20 to 30 years with a 2 percent to 2.5 percent interest rate. So far, China has lent Serbia about \u20ac5.5 billion for the construction of bridges, highways and railroads.China is also pouring money into Serbia\u2019s neighbors, raising fears that Beijing\u2019s largess in the Balkans is not just about business, but also about geopolitics. Ms. Mihajlovic, Serbia\u2019s infrastructure minister, bluntly said that it was both \u2014 a sign to officials in Brussels that their Balkan headache had now become a migraine.Ms. Mihajlovic said Beijing was defending Serbia\u2019s interests in the world, and she praised China for not recognizing what she called an \u201cillegally declared independence of Kosovo.\u201d Recognizing the sovereignty of Serbia\u2019s former and majority-Albanian province is a key requirement for Belgrade to join the European Union.Elsewhere in the Balkan Peninsula, China has lent Montenegro hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of its workers to build a strategic but costly highway between Belgrade and Montenegro\u2019s Port of Bar on the Adriatic Sea.China first tested its construction model in Serbia in 2010, when it brought hundreds of workers from the state-owned contractor China Road and Bridge Corporation to build a mile-long bridge over the Danube.In 2014, Premier Li Keqiang inaugurated the \u20ac170 million bridge, built with a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China and named after the Serbian scientist Mihajlo Pupin.Another major infrastructure deal is a planned high-speed rail line connecting Belgrade and Budapest. The 217-mile link will include a cargo track along the old passenger line that once carried the trains immortalized in the Agatha Christie novel \u201cMurder on the Orient Express.\u201dBut some European countries view with skepticism China\u2019s leadership role in economic integration in their own backyard, fearing that the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative\u2019s new norms, along with the Balkans\u2019 old governing values, will challenge those of the European Union, according to Michal Makocki, an expert in Europe-China relations.Mr. Gujanicic, the union leader from Smederevo, says Serbia\u2019s leadership has bulldozed labor laws in exchange for foreign funds.\u201cI can\u2019t say I understand Chinese Communism, but what they\u2019re doing here is destroying us,\u201d Mr. Gujanicic said of Serbia\u2019s leaders. \u201cThey are collecting points for the next election with other people\u2019s money. All they care about is to stay in power on the back of our hard work.\u201dOwen Guo contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}

It also comes as the Trump administration is navigating an uncertain position in the international climate change negotiations, having declared it will withdraw from the global Paris agreement while also telling nations it remains open to continued discussions.Invitations were sent to officials from the world\u2019s largest economies. The event is billed as \u201can opportunity for key ministers with responsibility for these issues to engage in an informal exchange of views and discuss how we can move forward most productively,\u201d according to the invitation. The note says the group will be kept small and include ministerial-level officials only.\u201cIt is too early to say what may come out of the meeting, but it shows that the U.S. is keen to engage with key countries,\u201d said one diplomat who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak for his government. \u201cIf the U.S. expresses its clear intent on addressing climate change issues at the meeting, that would be a positive sign.\u201dA White House official said that the meeting was intended to be an informal discussion to help the Trump administration find a way to fulfill the president\u2019s pledge to reduce emissions without harming the American economy.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back.

{"Headline": "U.S. Governors at U.N. Assembly: \u2018You Have Allies\u2019 on Climate Change", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 Jerry Brown, the governor of California, huddled on Sunday night with European, Brazilian and small-island leaders \u2014 gathered here for the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly, which formally begins on Tuesday \u2014 and pledged to work with them on climate change. On Monday he met with Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, to discuss the future of the Paris agreement.It is the first time that governors have taken such a prominent role on climate change at the annual General Assembly. Analysts said it would be the first real test of whether governors can persuade world leaders that efforts by American states might be able to take the place, at least in part, of federal government action.The goal, the governors say, is to assure other countries that they, along with and hundreds of cities and businesses, remain committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions and meeting the goals of the Paris accord.\u201cYou have allies in the United States. You shouldn\u2019t put your foot on the brake or even tap it just because we have a climate denier in the White House. You\u2019re not alone,\u201d Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said he would tell world leaders this week.He rejected the idea that the governors represent a shadow diplomatic corps. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a shadow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the sunlight. We\u2019re shining the bright light of success.\u201dAmericans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.\u201cThat\u2019s why we have governors here. Because we don\u2019t have someone from Washington D.C.,\u201d Governor Brown said. \u201cThe states are picking up the baton.\u201dGovernor Inslee will also meet with Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji, which holds the presidency of United Nations climate change negotiations this year.Another governor, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, was expected to announce this week that his state would join California, 13 other states and Puerto Rico in the United States Climate Alliance, a group of states and territories that has pledged to uphold the Paris agreement.The addition of North Carolina to the group would be notable because it is among the highest-emitting states. Without big producers of greenhouse gasses, experts say, states will struggle to make significant gains in reaching global climate goals.As part of the Paris accord, the Obama administration vowed that United States greenhouse gas emissions would fall at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Each governor in the alliance is promoting individual policies aimed at meeting that goal.\u201cWe certainly believe if the federal government won\u2019t lead in this area, we want the world to understand there are states across the country that are committed,\u201d said Governor Ige, whose state enacted the first 100-percent-renewable energy standard.Terms like \u201c500-year flood\u201d and \u201c100-year flood\u201d are used as shorthand by government officials and actuaries, but they can confuse the public.Despite the push by the climate alliance, though, those states make up just one-third of the nation\u2019s population, and the United States as a whole is still expected to fall short of Mr. Obama\u2019s pledge. The big question, then, is whether the alliance can persuade other states to join its climate efforts.\u201cUnless their leadership is met with followership, the impact will be pretty limited,\u201d said David G. Victor, a professor of international relations at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThe idea has always been that if these states can demonstrate the technologies needed to cut emissions, that will help shift the politics in other states. But we have yet to see that play out.\u201dPerhaps the governors\u2019 biggest challenge will be the deep partisan divide over climate change in the country.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing if these governors are communicating their respective state climate plans, as ill-advised as they may be,\u201d Mr. Loris said. \u201cNo matter how expensive or ineffective these climate policies may be, it\u2019s their right. They can deliver that message to anyone they please. But they shouldn\u2019t pretend their actions are the will of the federal government or the entire country.\u201dFor now the climate alliance is focused on the economic argument that it is possible to cut emissions without harming the economy. According to a recent report from the Brookings Institution, every state in the alliance has managed to cut emissions since 2000 even while expanding their overall economic output. The coalition states say they have created 1.3 million clean energy jobs while cutting emissions.\u201cWe have blown up the argument that acting on climate change is bad for your economy,\u201d Governor Inslee said.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Syrian War Drags On, but Assad\u2019s Future Looks as Secure as Ever", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven some longtime rebel supporters have grown war-weary and started to embrace the inevitable.Since the government reclaimed control of the mountain town of Madaya after a prolonged siege, life there has improved for those who remained. The snipers left, electricity returned, and food appeared in markets. Cafes reopened, and people started going out.\u201cWe are sick of the war,\u201d a teacher there said via instant message, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to be targeted for her past opposition to the government. \u201cWe want to live peacefully and safe, and we can\u2019t do that unless we are with the regime.\u201dThese developments do not suggest that Mr. Assad has an easy road ahead. He remains a pariah in much of the world, presiding over a blasted, divided land. If he emerges victorious, he is likely to be left with a weak state that is beholden to foreign powers and lacks the resources to rebuild.But his endurance has serious ramifications for the country and for the Middle East, affecting the prospects of Syria\u2019s future stability, of refugees to return home and of the Syrian government to tap international funds to rebuild its destroyed cities.It is also a grim, late act in the Arab Spring uprisings that broke out in 2011. While protests and armed insurrections removed from power the leaders of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen, Mr. Assad has remained, despite wielding tremendous violence against his people.Mr. Assad himself has acknowledged the toll of the war, but argued that it has purified the state by eliminating threats to the nation and uniting Syrians around a shared project.\u201cWe lost the best of our youth and our infrastructure,\u201d he told a conference in Damascus, Syria\u2019s capital, last month. \u201cIt cost us a lot of money and a lot of sweat, for generations. But in exchange, we won a healthier and more homogeneous society in the true sense.\u201dSyria\u2019s conflict began in 2011 with a popular uprising against Mr. Assad, which his security forces sought to suppress with overwhelming force. The opposition took up arms, and the United States, Saudi Arabia and others endorsed the rebels\u2019 cause, backing them politically and giving them arms and cash.Now, Mr. Assad has succeeded in dispelling the rebel threat, largely because of the steadfast financial and military support of his foreign backers.His government controls Syria\u2019s largest cities and most of its remaining people, who generally live in better conditions than those elsewhere in the country. His allies \u2014 Russia, Iran and Hezbollah \u2014 have stood by him, bolstering his depleted military and helping it advance.But Mr. Assad is in many ways a limited head of state.Much of Syria\u2019s territory remains out of his hands, and foreign powers have carved out spheres of influence, undermining his claim to rule all of Syria.Turkish forces allied with local rebels hold territory in the north, and the United States is working with Kurdish and Arab fighters against the Islamic State in the east.Even in areas nominally under Mr. Assad\u2019s control, Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and local militias empowered by the war often exercise greater control than the Syrian state. And Russia has taken the lead in Syria\u2019s international diplomacy, negotiating safe zones with foreign powers around the country to try to stop the violence.The war\u2019s toll has been tremendous and could be a burden on Mr. Assad and his allies for decades to come.\u201cAs the conflict continues, it is not only the physical destruction, but also that the degradation in the social fabric intensifies,\u201d he said.Merely by staying in power, Mr. Assad could hinder reconstruction.Other countries that support Mr. Assad could help, but their resources are limited. Iran and Russia are under international sanctions, their economies hurting from low oil prices.Last month, the government held an international trade fair in Damascus for the first time since 2011, welcoming companies from Iran, Iraq, Russia, Venezuela and elsewhere. Among the new deals signed were ones for the importation of 200 buses from Belarus and contracts to export 50,000 tons of produce.Mr. Assad\u2019s hold on power could also affect the return of refugees, a critical issue for neighboring states.After years of living in exile, Bassam al-Malik, a businessman and former member of the main exile opposition group, tried to return to Syria this year to sell off some of his property. Through an intermediary, the government warned him not to return or he would be detained.Now he was stuck, he said, between \u201cthe regime and the opposition.\u201dSome Syrians have dropped their opposition and made their peace with a government that seems to be winning.The team, which is closely related to Mr. Assad, is still in the running to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.Other citizens, like the teacher from Madaya, are happy to support anyone who can provide basic security and services.\u201cWe are people who walk where the winds take us,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring the siege, we were with the revolution. Now we are hanging Bashar\u2019s photos and we sing for him.\u201dHwaida Saad and Nada Homsi contributed reporting from Beirut, and Karam Shoumali from Istanbul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel\u2019s Military Exemption for Ultra-Orthodox Is Ruled Unconstitutional", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe impassioned debate over military exemptions for strictly Orthodox Jews engaged in full-time Torah study goes to the heart of the struggle for the future character of Israel.\u201cThe history of this societal controversy reflects the history of the State of Israel itself,\u201d wrote the departing president of the Supreme Court, Justice Miriam Naor, in the 148-page ruling, noting that the court had already ruled on the issue several times before.The court gave the government a year to come up with alternative legislation that would satisfy the basic principle of equality. This latest ruling came in response to a petition by several nongovernmental pressure groups and Yesh Atid, a centrist party led by Yair Lapid, who has championed the cause of equal service in recent years both in the government and now in the opposition.Ultra-Orthodox politicians strongly denounced the ruling and vowed to fight it, but given the yearlong time frame for amending the law, the stability of the governing coalition did not appear to be in imminent danger.\u201cThose same Torah sons who chose to dedicate their lives to Torah study will continue to study Torah here in the land of Israel, the holy land,\u201d said Aryeh Deri, the interior minister and the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, in remarks after the ruling. \u201cNo force in the world will stop them,\u201d he said, adding that the court has proved itself \u201ctotally disconnected from our heritage and tradition and from our people.\u201dMr. Lapid of Yesh Atid (Hebrew for There Is a Future), speaking after the decision was announced, said: \u201cToday we started to turn the ship toward sanity and values. That\u2019s why we are in politics.\u201dMr. Netanyahu, he added, could not continue to wriggle out of making a decision. The draft, he said, is \u201cfor everyone, not just for suckers who don\u2019t have a party in the coalition. We\u2019re done being suckers. The court decided that we will not have first- and second-class citizens in Israel.\u201dThe policy of open-ended deferment dates to 1949 when Israel\u2019s founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, exempted 400 religious students from military service in an effort to restore the tradition of yeshiva scholarship, which had been nearly destroyed during the Holocaust. The issue has since become tendentious, with the number of those who have been exempted by now amounting to tens of thousands.Those who support wholesale deferment and exemption for Torah students in seminaries argue that Israel needs spiritual preservation as much as physical protection. Critics protest that the fast-growing ultra-Orthodox minority, known in Hebrew as Haredim, or those in awe of God, are not contributing enough to the country\u2019s economy or security, leaving others to bear an unfair burden.Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox sector makes up about 10 percent of the population of more than 8.5 million but it is rapidly increasing, with its members typically marrying young and having large families. Worry and anger has been growing among many Israelis who fear that the economy will become unsustainable in the coming decades without radical change, in part because many ultra-Orthodox men prefer full time Torah study over work and rely on government stipends.With the ultra-Orthodox parties often serving as coalition kingmakers and serving in most of the governments for more than three decades, they have accrued what many see as disproportionate power, privileges and subsidies.Far from homogeneous, the Haredi world is made up of different rabbinical courts, and a small but growing number of strictly religious Jews have already been opting for military service or civilian national service as a way of acquiring skills and a path out of poverty and toward integration into the work force. The army has tried to accommodate Haredi recruits. It has even established ultra-Orthodox battalions, allowing those soldiers to combine military service with religious life.After the 2013 elections, Yesh Atid entered the coalition as the second-largest party after Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud. The ultra-Orthodox parties were excluded. Mr. Lapid advanced legislation to phase out wholesale exemptions for the ultra-Orthodox, instituting annual quotas for the enlistment of yeshiva graduates and sanctions for those who evaded the draft. It was supposed to take effect at the end of this year.But after the 2015 elections, Yesh Atid was out of the government and the ultra-Orthodox parties were back in. Under the new coalition agreements, the government amended the legislation, canceling the provisions for sanctions, delaying putting it into effect for years and watering it down in other ways that essentially neutralized it.Advertisement"}

Leader Suggests Simplifying How the Bloc Is Run", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, laid out plans on Wednesday to simplify the byzantine governance of the European Union.In perhaps the boldest proposal in his annual address to the European Parliament, Mr. Juncker suggested streamlining the leadership of the 28-nation bloc \u2014 an idea that could in theory eliminate his own job.The complexity of the European Union is legendary. It has a plethora of institutions and no single leader, leaving many wondering who is in charge \u2014 or speculating that Germany, the bloc\u2019s largest economy, really runs the show.Then there is the Council of the European Union \u2014 not to be confused with the European Council \u2014 which is made up of ministers and has a six-month rotating presidency.Mr. Juncker seemed sympathetic to this criticism in his remarks on Wednesday, suggesting that a single president should lead both the European Commission and the European Council.\u201cThe European landscape would be clearer and more understandable if the European ship was steered by one and the same captain at the helm,\u201d he said.Mr. Juncker\u2019s wide-ranging speech touched on these themes:Economic growth, which stands at more than 2 percent across the European Union, has outstripped growth in the United States, while unemployment has reached a nine-year low, he said.\u201cTen years since crisis struck, Europe\u2019s economy is finally bouncing back \u2014 and with it our confidence,\u201d he said, a reference to the long, grinding battle to overcome a debt crisis that nearly destroyed the euro currency, prompted the imposition of austerity on millions of citizens and helped fuel a populist backlash that focused anger at the European Union.The idea, he said, would be for this new minister to coordinate among various European bodies to help countries that are in an economic recession or \u201chit by a fundamental crisis.\u201dThe goal would be \u201cefficiency\u201d rather to create a new position \u201cjust for the sake of it,\u201d Mr. Juncker said.Even as Europe opens up to new trade opportunities, Mr. Juncker said, it must do more to protect strategic sectors like defense \u2014 a remark that was essentially a response to calls from Germany, France and Italy to vet the acquisition of European technology by Chinese companies.\u201cWe will always regret this, and I think you will regret it as well soon, if I might say,\u201d Mr. Juncker told the British, to a thunderous burst of applause.In hopes of encouraging a strong voter turnout for European Parliament elections in May or June 2019 and shoring up confidence in the bloc, Mr. Juncker called on Romania, which is set to hold the union\u2019s rotating presidency during that period, to schedule a European Union summit meeting on the day after Britain\u2019s planned exit from the bloc.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wrong Time to Cut Back on Refugees", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAmid the world\u2019s worst migrant crisis on record, the Trump administration is cutting back on refugee resettlement. As part of his travel ban, President Trump capped the number of refugees to be admitted in 2017 at 50,000, the lowest number in decades. Now the administration has proposed lowering the goal even further, to 45,000, next year.Over the years, the United States has lived up to its ideals and brought millions of refugees to safety and freedom. It didn\u2019t become a resettlement leader out of pure altruism. By welcoming refugees, the United States revitalizes its democracy and its economy, helps preserve or restore stability in volatile regions of the world, and builds respect.In slashing resettlement, the president is taking a recklessly narrow view of how best to put America first. Shutting out refugees would not only increase human suffering; it would also weaken the country and undermine its foreign policy.Nonetheless, the resettlement effort under President Obama served American interests. For one thing, it helped the states that host the vast majority of Syrian refugees: Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon. (In fiscal year 2016, 12,500 of the refugees resettled by the United States came from Jordan, a key American ally in a strategically crucial region.) The huge influx of refugees into these nations has strained their resources and infrastructure, becoming a potential source of instability and even conflict. By resettling refugees, the United States helps preserve stability and sends a message of support to countries whose cooperation it needs on a range of issues.The Trump administration\u2019s cuts to resettlement send the exact opposite message. It is a message heard across the region, by enemies as well as friends of the United States. Restricting resettlement, especially in the context of the travel ban, appears to validate the propaganda of the Islamic State and other extremist groups, which claims that the United States is hostile to Muslims. The battle against violent extremism must be fought with guns, but also with ideas. Slamming the door on refugees is a significant strategic blunder.Opponents of refugee resettlement would have you believe that the country\u2019s enemies are exploiting the program. There is no factual basis for this claim. In fact, of all the people who enter the United States, refugees are the most thoroughly vetted. The screening process is exhaustive and lengthy, and involves numerous agencies. Our intelligence and national security professionals can both vet refugees and protect Americans. Indeed, they\u2019ve done just that for years.Refugees are victims of extremist groups and brutal governments. They become patriotic, hard-working Americans. Refugees are us. They are teachers, police officers, doctors, factory workers and soldiers. There are thousands of former refugees and children of refugees in the United States military.

{"Headline": "Professors Behaving Badly", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterIs there something about adjunct faculty members that makes them prone to outrageous political outbursts?Conservative commentators have glossed these incidents as the latest evidence that college and university faculties have been taken over by left-wing radicals. But the incidents might be viewed as part of a different phenomenon: adjunct alienation.In American academia there are two tiers of employment. The first consists of professors on the tenure track or already tenured. Once they\u2019ve proved themselves as teachers and researchers, their jobs are secure. The second tier is everyone else: lecturers who might be hired full time for a semester, but with no promise of continued employment; graduate teaching assistants; post-docs who work in labs; and instructors brought on part time to teach a class or two.The second tier \u2014 the adjunct tier \u2014 has been growing. In 1975, it made up 55 percent of the academic work force. Today it\u2019s 70 percent.The pay isn\u2019t good. Although there\u2019s considerable variation depending on the nature of the appointment, on average adjunct instructors receive only $1,000 for every course credit they teach. Most college courses are three or four credits, and full-time teaching loads pretty much max out at five classes a semester (at community colleges). You can do the math.Adjunct teaching has been expanding for three reasons. First, it\u2019s much cheaper for colleges and universities. Second, American graduate schools award an enormous number of Ph.D.s, even in disciplines where jobs are scarce. Graduates who can\u2019t find tenure-track positions may take adjunct employment rather than give up on the academic dream. And third, for decades conservatives have railed against the institution of tenure, which they see as protecting ideologues. Their attacks have succeeded in weakening it.But there\u2019s reason to believe widespread reliance on adjunct faculty may encourage the very radicalism conservatives fear. Social scientists have found that when aspiring intellectuals face highly restricted employment opportunities, they often take refuge in extreme politics. In a 1996 study, the sociologist Jerome Karabel sought to identify the circumstances under which intellectuals, from would-be academics to writers and artists, embrace or rebel against the status quo. \u201cEspecially conducive to the growth of political radicalism,\u201d he wrote, \u201care societies in which the higher levels of the educational system produce far more graduates than can be absorbed by the marketplace.\u201dFrustrated that their long investments in education and cultural cultivation haven\u2019t paid off, intellectuals in such societies train their anger \u2014 and ideas \u2014 at the economic and political systems (and social groups) they hold responsible. Professor Karabel cited the example of Germany in the 1930s, when a slow-moving academic labor market increased the appeal of Nazism for a surprising number of underemployed intellectuals.The same situation can breed support for radical movements of the left. Poor job prospects for American thinkers during the Depression helped draw many into socialism or communism. More recently, the sociologist Ruth Milkman found that well-educated millennials were overrepresented among Occupy Wall Street activists. These young people had spent their lives diligently preparing to enter the knowledge economy and became disillusioned when, after the financial crisis, it all seemed to be crashing down.It\u2019s not hard to understand why American adjuncts today would feel frustrated with their lot. Throw that into the mix alongside the heated politics of the Trump era and you\u2019ve got a recipe for outrage.Of course, most people in academia \u2014 a famously progressive occupation \u2014 are outraged these days, and activism and political engagement are up across the board, as the times demand. But those lucky enough to have landed coveted tenure-track or tenured posts generally recognize that they have too much to lose to become \u201cantifa\u201d rioters or rant uncontrollably on social media, even if they have stronger academic freedom protections than their adjunct colleagues. In a sense, the tenure system has tamed them, and much of their protest will remain merely academic.The occasional shocking public statement from an adjunct instructor should serve as a reminder of the volatility that comes when \u2014 in higher education or outside it \u2014 we allow employment conditions to deteriorate to whatever the market will bear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Coming Tax Increase", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 19th-century economist named Adolph Wagner made a prediction that came to be known as Wagner\u2019s Law: As societies became wealthier, their taxes would rise. They would rise because people would want more of the services that government tended to provide better than the private market, like national security, education, medical care and a guaranteed retirement.\u201cWith the same values and preferences, and the same basic attitude about government activity versus private activity,\u201d Summers said, \u201cyou should expect government to be larger in the future than it has been in the past.\u201dThere are four main reasons, he argued:\u2022 One, society is aging, which calls for greater spending on retirees. The ratio of elderly Americans \u2014 those expected to be in the last 15 years of their lives \u2014 to all other Americans will rise about 50 percent from 2010 to 2030.\u2022 Three, labor-intensive services, like education and medical care, have become more expensive, and they also tend to be the areas where the government spends money.\u2022 Four, American military spending has not kept up recently with the spending by our main rivals, including China, Iran and Russia. This trend shouldn\u2019t continue forever, Summers said.I don\u2019t mean to suggest that taxes should always be rising and that government will eventually take over the economy. Capitalism clearly has worked much better than any alternative. And there are times \u2014 for example, after a war or when a population is becoming younger \u2014 that taxes should fall. It\u2019s also important to cut government where it\u2019s wasteful.But believing in capitalism is different from believing that government cannot grow. Modern capitalism depends on a well-functioning government. Capitalism has already grown a lot over the last century, across this country and much of the world, and the world is a vastly richer place than a century ago.\u201cIf we want to maintain traditional American values,\u201d as Summers said, \u201cgovernment will need to be significantly larger.\u201dAdvertisement"}

China\u2019s G.D.P. may eventually outstrip America\u2019s. But per capita Chinese G.D.P. is lower than Mexico\u2019s, making it a rich country of relatively poor people.A better measure of national greatness is the ability of nations to cultivate, attract and retain human capital. People tend to vote with their feet. To trace the rise or decline of nations is to watch where those feet go \u2014 and where they leave.Take Hungary. Since 1960, seven Hungarians have won the Nobel Prize. Not bad for a small country \u2014 except that all of them left Hungary to make their lives and careers elsewhere.The United States provides the opposite example. The American economy is 12 percent larger today than it was at the time of the financial crisis. We\u2019re also taking in roughly half a million legal new arrivals a year. The foot-voting continues, and we\u2019re still coming out on top.A common American conceit is that we attract brilliant foreigners because we have brilliant things: great universities, vast financial resources, a dynamic economy, high-tech. That gets things mostly backward. It\u2019s because we have brilliant foreigners that we have those things in the first place. Google. Comcast. eBay. Kraft. Pfizer. AT&T. They all had immigrants as founders.Opponents of a liberal immigration policy often insist they welcome legal immigrants and only object to illegal ones. Rubbish. The immigration reform bill introduced in Congress this year by Republicans Tom Cotton and David Perdue and endorsed by Donald Trump aims to cut legal immigration by half.Restrictionists also argue that we need to favor newcomers with \u201cskills\u201d and educational credentials. More rubbish. Jan Koum arrived in the U.S. from Ukraine in 1992 as a 16-year-old boy with his mother, living off food stamps. She worked as a babysitter. He later dropped out of college. In 2009 he came up with an idea for a mobile messaging app. Five years later Facebook purchased WhatsApp for $22 billion.Should it make any difference to WhatsApp\u2019s billion-plus users that Koum arrived in the United States legally? And if it turned out that he hadn\u2019t, should he be required to leave the country, presumably so he can pay income tax \u2014 and create jobs \u2014 in his native Ukraine?That would be self-defeating. But it\u2019s the fate that may soon await 800,000 or so young people who were brought without visas to the United States as children, grew up in the country, in some cases only speak English, and now face deportation because the Trump administration seems poised to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that allowed them to stay in school or their jobs.Lose that faith, and lose what\u2019s best about America, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Luxury Building Boom Hits Montreal", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetAlong the main shopping street in the area of downtown Montreal known as the Golden Square Mile, Sonya Szczygiel and her husband, John Guinto, have sold beaded bracelets made of semiprecious stones for the last five years.From their kiosk on Saint Catherine Street, near Montreal\u2019s downtown Apple Store, the pair have had front row seats for a transformation playing out in the neighborhood and throughout Montreal.It is one of the many changes that Ms. Szczygiel welcomes. \u201cHigh-end hotels, stores and restaurants attract people with a higher disposable income,\u201d she said. \u201cThat should obviously benefit us and other retailers.\u201dThe current revitalization of the Golden Square Mile mirrors the larger comeback of Montreal.During a period of political instability, starting in the 1980s and leading up to a referendum about Quebec leaving Canada in 1995, many companies became skittish of keeping outposts in Montreal. The Four Seasons, which had opened a hotel in 1976 called Le Quatre Saisons, stopped managing the location in 1994. As businesses left, retail and restaurants, particularly the high-end sector in the Golden Square Mile, suffered.But over the last decade, after the city\u2019s politics had stabilized, companies started to come back. New start-ups have popped up, for example, particularly in the fields of technology, artificial intelligence and gaming. Facebook just announced it is creating an artificial intelligence research lab in Montreal, and last fall Google said that it would open a similar facility there.\u201cThe stable political environment in Montreal these last years, especially when we take into consideration the more unstable global environment created by Brexit and other elections in Europe, has made Montreal more attractive to business and leisure visitors,\u201d said Denis Coderre, Montreal\u2019s mayor.\u201cThe Montreal economy is booming,\u201d Mr. Coderre said.He added that the unemployment rate had reached one of its lowest levels since 2010, the labor force was growing and investments were increasing. New taxes on foreign investors in Toronto and Vancouver also appear to have played a part.But the city also has something else appealing to business, according to J. Allen Smith, the Four Seasons chief executive: \u201ccultural sophistication, European influences and storied history.\u201dPartnering with Carbonleo Real Estate, a Quebec developer and property manager, the Four Seasons project will include a 166-room hotel and 18 condos priced from nearly $3 million to over $12 million. The hotel will be connected to the flagship location for Ogilvy, a high-end department store that is undergoing more than $100 million in renovations and merging with Holt Renfrew, another luxury retailer.Near the new Four Seasons, the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Hotel just reopened its doors this July after a $114 million renovation.The Ritz Carlton blazed the path for high-end hoteliers in Montreal. The hotel, which first opened in 1912, reopened in 2013 after renovations that cost about $200 million. Those changes added 45 condos, larger hotel guest rooms and now features Maison Boulud, the first Montreal restaurant of acclaimed French chef Daniel Boulud.Visitors flock to Montreal for business, bachelor and bachelorette parties, as well as music festivals and sports events such as the Montreal International Jazz Festival and the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix car race. With four major universities, Montreal also attracts many students and educators.The Golden Square Mile, where the new Four Seasons will sit, is at the foot of the hilly Mont Royal park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted about 16 years after he helped create Central Park in New York. Between 1850 and 1930, some of North America\u2019s wealthiest families built mansions, as well as churches and universities in the Golden Square Mile. Now boutiques, restaurants, theaters, cinemas, art galleries and book stores populate the area.The developers of the new Four Seasons in Montreal, which is set to open next year, expect the shopping to be a big draw. While many high-end hotels feature luxury boutiques on their street level, the Four Seasons will be connected directly to the 250,000 square foot-luxury Ogilvy/Holt Renfrew department store.The Four Seasons will be a monochromatic 18-story building with tinted windows creating a reflective charcoal facade broken up by \u201ca golden thread that emphasizes the shift between volumes and outlines its main entrances,\u201d said Eric Pelletier, an architect and design principal at the firm designing the project. The gold inlay also highlights the 6,000-square-foot ballroom that will seat 500 guests.Four Seasons brought in Parisian-based architects Gilles and Boissier to design the hotel rooms, which are \u201ca balance of New World and Old World,\u201d said Dana Kalczak, vice president of interior design for Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.In contemporary shades of white, cream, rose and gold, the rooms maximize natural light, including bathrooms with windows that allow light to pass in from the room outside. Old world touches include a built-in cocktail cabinet featuring all the equipment for \u201cshaking up a great cocktail or pouring a super scotch,\u201d said Ms. Kalczak.The building will include condos, which went on sale this June and range from 2,886 to 6,910 square feet. The largest penthouse includes a home gym and 2,060-square foot terrace with a fire pit and the option of a pool.It remains to be seen whether the timing is good. This year the overall condo market is \u201ca lot healthier than it was,\u201d says H\u00e9l\u00e8ne B\u00e9gin, a senior economist at Desjardins Economics. But she noted that a surplus of high-end condos remain on the market.The most interest in purchasing Four Seasons residences has come from affluent empty nesters from Montreal and further afield, people looking to swap out large family homes for new homes \u201cthat don\u2019t represent a downgrade in lifestyle,\u201d said Jos\u00e9e Legault, a marketing director for Carbonleo Real Estate.While Ms. Szczygiel and her husband have been upbeat about how the various new developments, along with Montreal\u2019s many festivals and events, have made the city more dynamic and increased tourism, she acknowledged there is a downside.\u201cWe are unfortunately in for a lot of construction,\u201d she said. \u201cBut hopefully it will lead to long term benefits for business owners.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Reform for the Rich: Reduce the Rates but Lose the Breaks", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhen the Trump administration unveils new details of its tax plan, promised for next week, one group of taxpayers will be under the microscope: the rich.That\u2019s because they take advantage of so many tax breaks that few, if any, pay the top rate of 39.6 percent. Eliminating at least some of those breaks would make it possible to reduce tax rates for the highest earners (and everyone else) while raising the same or even more in total revenue.Doing so would reduce rates while broadening the base, and simplify the tax code while making it fairer \u2014 goals that nearly all economists from across the political spectrum say they support.The administration, too, seems to have embraced such an approach. \u201cThe rich will not be gaining at all,\u201d President Trump said last week.So who are the rich?Based on comprehensive data now available from the Internal Revenue Service, it\u2019s possible to pinpoint who pays what based on their percentile of adjusted gross income. The top 1 percent seems a fair representation of the rich. This group \u2014 about 1.4 million taxpayers \u2014 reported adjusted gross incomes of over $466,000 in 2014, the most recent year for which the data is available.The top 1 percent paid a total of $542.6 billion in federal tax, or an astounding 39.5 percent of the total income tax. If you want to take a more expansive view of rich, the top 10 percent (who earn upward of $133,000) pay 71 percent of the total tax.Do they pay the top rate? Not by a long shot. The average rate for the top 1 percent is 27 percent of their adjusted gross income. (It\u2019s even lower \u2014 24 percent \u2014 for the superrich in the 0.001 percent bracket.) The top 10 percent pay an average of 21 percent.That\u2019s why tax reform is all about them. They take most of the itemized deductions and have a disproportionate share of capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at a much lower rate than salaries and wages.Reform means ending those tax breaks, a move that always draws protests and intense lobbying from those who have benefited from them.While such breaks may yield benefits, the budget office warned that they also \u201cmay lead to an inefficient allocation of economic resources by encouraging more consumption of goods and services receiving preferential treatment\u201d and \u201cmay subsidize activity that would have taken place without the tax incentives.\u201dThe report specifically cited the home-mortgage deduction as encouraging taxpayers to \u201cpurchase more expensive homes, investing too much in housing and too little elsewhere relative to what they would do if all investments were treated equally.\u201dBut it\u2019s mostly hard-core libertarians and free market purists who want to get rid of all tax breaks for the rich. The political reality is that some of these \u201cexpenditures\u201d are off the table. The charitable deduction has proved untouchable for decades. The top 1 percent gave $77 billion in 2014, 37 percent of total charitable contribution deductions. Perhaps it\u2019s not so bad for the rich to pay a lower marginal rate, if it\u2019s because they give away so much.So what\u2019s left?The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the preferential capital-gains rate will cost the Treasury $1.34 trillion from 2014 to 2023.\u201cWe\u2019re taxing the rich much too lightly because we tax capital so much less than labor,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.Mr. Rosenthal favors taxing capital gains at the same rate as regular income \u2014 the approach adopted in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 during the Reagan administration and one supported by many economists. That would eliminate a host of tax shelters that capitalize on the differential, including special treatment for carried interest, a form of income for many wealthy hedge fund and private equity managers.This path would require Republicans to set aside a long-held belief that lower capital-gains rates promote more economic growth and investment. But that doesn\u2019t mean capital-gains rates have to be lower than rates for ordinary income. \u201cThere\u2019s no support for the idea that not taxing capital unleashes economic growth,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said. He noted that after the 1986 tax reforms, \u201cthe economy did great.\u201dIf Republicans are correct that lower rates spur economic growth, then lower rates on all income \u2014 made possible in part by raising capital-gains rates \u2014 should bolster economic growth across the economy.That would also address the probability that raising rates on long-term capital gains would encourage investors to defer selling assets, thus postponing or escaping the tax. While higher capital-gains rates might encourage holding assets longer (which some economists consider a good thing), eliminating the special treatment at the investor\u2019s death would ensure that the gains were eventually taxed.And given that the Trump administration\u2019s proposed 15 percent corporate tax rate is in many ways a windfall to shareholders, it seems only fair to tax their capital gains at higher rates.\u201cYou can\u2019t really broaden the base without addressing capital gains,\u201d said Frank Clemente, executive director of the liberal-leaning Americans for Tax Fairness He, too, favors taxing capital gains at death.Many economists agree, including N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard, who told me this week that he favored eliminating the deduction.That deduction, too, overwhelmingly benefits the rich. Most middle-class and low-income taxpayers don\u2019t itemize deductions, even in high-tax states, so they get no benefit. The top 1 percent accounts for 27 percent of the total taxes-paid deduction.Democrats, many representing high-tax states, have said eliminating the deduction is out of the question in any tax negotiations. One compromise that might attract at least some Democratic support would be to retain the deduction, but only for taxpayers with incomes below a certain level.As with state and local taxes, most middle- and lower-income taxpayers don\u2019t itemize, so they don\u2019t benefit from the mortgage deduction. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the mortgage deduction will cost the Treasury about $1 trillion, slightly less than the state and local tax deduction, over a decade. But it\u2019s not as skewed as heavily toward the top 1 percent \u2014 they account for under 10 percent of the total interest-paid deduction. That may be because many of the rich don\u2019t need to borrow to buy a house (or houses).A study by the foundation also found that the mortgage deduction had disproportionately favored taxpayers in states with high real-estate costs, which also tend to be blue states like New York and California.\u201cThe mortgage deduction is supposed to make homes more affordable, but do people with mortgages over $500,000 really need that?\u201d asked Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation and the author of the study.There are plenty of egregious smaller loopholes that should be eliminated, like the provision that lets real-estate developers (but not the rest of us) deduct passive losses against ordinary income. But these are the big four, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates. In total, they will cost the government $4.1 trillion over 10 years.(This doesn\u2019t guarantee that the government would actually raise that much if the tax breaks were eliminated, because the estimates don\u2019t account for the way taxpayers would change their behavior, such as by deferring capital gains.)Conversely, if proposed reforms don\u2019t address the biggest tax breaks, there will be little room to reduce rates over all \u2014 which is the carrot to make reform more palatable. \u201cIf all you do is eliminate the state and local tax deduction, there\u2019s not much room to maneuver,\u201d Mr. Pomerleau said.Fourth in a series of Common Sense columns about the shape a responsible tax reform plan might take.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Letter: Health Care Comparisons and an NYT Offer", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the most common complaints about the Canadian health care system is the duration of wait times. That was the reason that some judges favored other nations in The Upshot\u2019s tournament-style comparison of various countries\u2019 health systems. Indeed, fear of long wait times is one of the most commonly cited reasons people in the United States reject a single-payer health system.But there are trade-offs for seemingly everything in health care systems, and Canada benefits in other ways.But these access issues are not necessarily because Canada has a single-payer, or government-run, system. After all, Britain has a much more socialized system, and performs much better than many other countries with respect to wait times.The bottom line is that while Canada does have longer wait times compared with other countries, it seems to have made the decision to accept this as a trade-off for significantly reduced spending. We can choose to value different things, but those wait times are most likely an economic decision, not one inherent to single-payer.A dispatch from my colleague Dan Levin who was just on assignment in the Yukon:I was on a reporting trip that took me into the heart of an important debate in Canada: how to balance the lucrative extraction of natural resources with growing demands to respect Indigenous rights and to protect the nation\u2019s wilderness from environmental destruction.The Yukon \u2014 larger than California but with a population of just 38,000 \u2014 distills this tension into perhaps its most vivid form.But the legacy of mining has left deep environmental wounds on the Yukon that may prove impossible to completely heal. Even as the territory is prized for its soaring snow-capped mountains and wildlife, the Yukon is also home to one of Canada\u2019s worst environmental blights: the former Faro mine, the world\u2019s largest open-pit lead and zinc mine until it was abandoned in 1998 by its bankrupt operators. They left behind 320 million tons of waste rock and 70 million tons of tailings, enough to cover more than 26,000 Canadian football fields according to the Canadian government, which is planning to spend at least half a billion Canadian dollars to clean up the toxic site.On my journey, I witnessed another legacy of Canada\u2019s influential mining industry. A dirt road known as the Silver Trail led to a gate blocking the way up to Elsa, once a privately owned mining town that was Canada\u2019s second largest producer of silver in the 1950s, before it too was abandoned, in 1989. Today, Elsa is a ghost town of collapsing buildings too dangerous to enter, while a landfill of junked trucks and industrial equipment rust on its outskirts. Remote and largely forgotten, this apocalyptic scene serves as a sobering lesson about a major part of Canada\u2019s economy and the cost to peoples and wildlife.As I wrote in his obituary, Allan J. MacEachen, who died earlier this month at the age of 96, was the political mastermind behind two Liberal prime minsters, Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Elliot Trudeau. His political acumen brought, among other things, public health care to all Canadians.Advertisement"}

Bush, near reverence under Barack Obama, and outright dismay now that Donald Trump is president.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone in short order from the outhouse, to the penthouse, to the loony bin,\u201d he told me.My sense now is that if Greece hasn\u2019t precisely turned a corner, the worst is over. There have been two consecutive quarters of growth \u2014 at 0.5 percent, but still. A bond offering in July, the first in several years, found a responsive market. Tourism has boomed, thanks in part to troubles in Turkey and Egypt. The third international bailout is set to expire in mid-2018. Greece\u2019s humiliating tutelage, the source of anti-German outbursts, may soon end.The latest twist has seen the leftist government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, the Marxist anti-austerity firebrand of yore, lurch toward the center, call unabashedly for the foreign investment Greece needs, and embrace the United States.Tsipras, I hear, has taken to calling America his \u201cstrategic partner.\u201d He\u2019s angling for a visit with Trump (who may not like the fact that the young Greek leader and Obama bonded). He\u2019s trying to steal the thunder of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the charismatic, Harvard-educated leader of the opposition New Democracy party, by discovering the merits of private enterprise.An enduring symbol of Greek bureaucratic inertia is the vast Elliniko area in southern Athens once occupied by the airport. Its fate has been discussed for more than a decade. This could be one of Europe\u2019s biggest real estate projects but every time agreement is reached on private investment, another obstacle arises, most recently objections from the Central Archaeological Council and Piraeus forestry authority. There are, one weary observer suggested, some very tall weeds.If post-populist Tsipras is serious about investment and growth \u2014 and they\u2019re the only way forward for Greece \u2014 he needs to show he can break the logjam. But his coalition is still paralyzed somewhere between ideology and pragmatism.Still, in a turbulent neighborhood, through a disaster rarely seen outside wartime, with more than one million refugees transiting the country in recent years (and tens of thousands still there), Greece has held \u2014 and held with generosity. That is remarkable. I salute Greece.There\u2019s more behind the stability than the sun, family, remittances and civilization I mentioned. Geoffrey Pyatt, the American ambassador, told me he went to the island of Rhodes last month and met with Giorgos Hadjimarkos, the South Aegean Regional Governor. A United States troop ship with 300 Marines on board was docked. As discussion turned to the challenges in the area, Hadjimarkos walked to the window, opened the drapes, and, pointing to the ship, said: \u201cAmbassador, the best way to assure Greece\u2019s strategic direction sits right there in the harbor.\u201dGreek anti-Americanism, once virulent, has gone out of vogue. Old institutions, set up after World War II, have been mocked by Trump. But they have come through during the Greek crisis. Without NATO, without the European Union, the possibility of a catastrophic Greek lurch into chaos would have been much higher. Trump should stick a sign above his bed: \u201cThe European Union is a peace magnet.\u201dOf course, Greek participation in the euro, a currency improbably shared with Germany, was behind the crisis; and the European Union was one of the institutions imposing the austerity that wreaked havoc. But in the end, Greeks were reassured by their European Union passports and by the knowledge that they live now in a wider framework of peace and stability.A powerful lesson of the crisis is Europe\u2019s resilience. The commitment of countries like Greece and France to the European Union is strong \u2014 more so since the British decision to leave. Romance, not reason, lay behind Greece\u2019s miguided inclusion in the euro, but the romance had a kernel of truth: Greece is central to the European idea.Advertisement"}

Marika Treichel, who lives in Denmark, wrote, \u201cI have always dreamed of visiting the US. But the rise of gun violence and political chaos has made me want to cancel all future travels to the U.S. until I can feel safe as a tourist.\u201dThis has been a strong year for the U.S. dollar, which makes travel more expensive for other currencies \u2014 though exceptions make that an unsatisfying explanation for the tourism drop. The Canadian dollar, for example, is weaker than it has been in previous years (despite a summer surge), yet Canadian tourism to the United States was up 14.8 percent January through April.Within Europe, the tourism declines were largest in Switzerland at nearly 28 percent, Belgium at 20 percent and Britain at 15.5 percent. Britain accounts for the largest share by country of European arrivals in the United States, with 4.5 million tourists last year, making its slowdown significant. (Asian tourism was about the same as last year \u2014 up .6 percent \u2014 mainly due to a surge of South Korean travelers, up over 15 percent in the first quarter.)Some of the decline in first quarter results may be because of the shift of the Easter and Passover holidays, when travel usually spikes. Those occurred in March of 2016 and April this year, possibly skewing first quarter figures. April figures ease the overall decline of foreign visitors to the United States from 4.2 percent to 1.2 percent. A boost in arrivals from Canada, up 7.8 percent through April after two years of declines, helped offset slowdowns from Mexico at 4.9 percent for the first four months of the year and Britain. at 6.9 percent for the same period.Factoring in the April figures brings the loss to the U.S. economy to $1.7 billion, according to Tourism Economics.\u201cGiven the current political and social climate, now is an especially important time for the travel industry to stand for open borders, inclusivity and the celebration of diversity,\u201d wrote Leigh Barnes, the regional director for Intrepid Travel, in an email.Lucy Taylor, an Australian who is spending several weeks this summer and fall visiting the United States with her husband, altered the couple\u2019s itinerary based on anticipated xenophobia.\u201cWe decided not to do a road trip across the U.S. and just to stick to blue states,\u201d she said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure what kind of reception we would have.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nafta Negotiations: What\u2019s at Stake in the Second Round", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrade negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the United States resume discussions on Friday over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement.Nafta, which came into force in 1994, created what is now the world\u2019s biggest free-trade bloc.But the pact has been the focus of criticism in recent years. Opponents in the United States \u2014 President Trump chief among them \u2014 argue that it has allowed Mexico to benefit at the expense of its neighbor to the north.As proof, the Trump administration has pointed to the trade deficit, with Americans buying more goods and services from Mexico and Canada than vice versa. Many economists argue, however, that these bilateral trade deficits, when viewed in isolation, are not a good measure of a nation\u2019s economic health.The administration has also blamed Nafta for job losses in the United States, a persistent theme during Mr. Trump\u2019s election campaign. But American manufacturers worry that changes to Nafta could disrupt the global supply chain, raising their costs.Trade has contributed to economic growth, but changing dynamics have also prompted concerns about lost jobs and the trade deficit. But when something is manufactured in the United States, it is often made up of parts from around the world.While each country will have priorities, three issues have come to the fore.\u2022 Rules of originRight now, for example, a car assembled in Mexico is not subject to an import tax if a certain percentage of the vehicle was made in North America. The Trump administration wants to increase that figure, a move that is supported by the biggest automobile union in the United States. Carmakers, however, are wary, saying that such a move could raise their costs.\u2022 ArbitrationUnder Nafta, companies in North America can use a system of independent arbitration to force a country to do away with measures that violate the trade deal. The system has been used mostly by Canadian and Mexican companies against the United States, and the White House wants to overhaul it.\u2022 ModernizationOne area in which the countries seem to agree is the need to modernize Nafta, which predates the ubiquitousness of the internet. While the sides\u2019 positions differ, updates could address e-commerce and newer workplace and environmental rules.The first round of negotiations was not congenial.The Trump administration\u2019s representatives railed against Nafta in public while seeking major concessions from their Canadian and Mexican counterparts in private.\u201cWe feel that Nafta has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement,\u201d Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said when the first set of talks began on Aug. 16.The Canadian and Mexican representatives, however, insisted that the current version of Nafta was not biased against the United States.The three countries will follow up the five days of negotiations with another round in Canada this month. Several more rounds are expected to follow this year.There are time pressures. Mexico is scheduled to hold presidential elections next July. And a new deal may be tough to sell to the country\u2019s politicians as they gear up for the campaign.An article on Monday about negotiations on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement misstated the United States\u2019 goal for a system of independent arbitration under the agreement.

{"Headline": "If You Build It, the Dutch Will Pedal", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUtrecht JournalUTRECHT, the Netherlands \u2014 When city officials unveiled the first section of the world\u2019s largest bike parking garage in Utrecht, a small city in the center of the Netherlands, late last month, the feeling of accomplishment was short-lived.While many of the 6,000 new, state-of-the-art bike parking spots filled quickly, city engineers focused on the work ahead: creating thousands more such spots and hundreds more miles of bike paths to ensure that even more Utrecht residents can comfortably commute by bike.\u201cWe found that if you build it, people will use it,\u201d said Lot van Hooijdonk, a vice mayor, about her city\u2019s seemingly insatiable public demand for bike infrastructure.Utrecht, with 330,000 residents, is the Netherlands\u2019 fourth-largest and fastest-growing city. It is also one of the most bike-friendly places in one of the world\u2019s most bike-friendly countries.The city recently surpassed Amsterdam in a widely respected ranking of bike-friendly cities and is now second only to Copenhagen, which is more than twice its size.\u201cWhat the Danes and the Dutch do now is what people in most cities in the world did for decades,\u201d said Mikael Colville-Andersen, an urban design expert and chief executive of Copenhagenize Design Company, which releases the biennial index of bike-friendly cities.Elsewhere in the Netherlands, more than a quarter of all trips are made by bicycle, and the federal government has been building up the country\u2019s bike infrastructure over the last decade, despite cuts in other sectors.The yearly investment of roughly 500 million euros, or about $600 million, pays for itself, proponents say, by reducing health, social and other costs.The increased infrastructure has led to an increase in people using their bikes daily and contributes to the reduction of road accidents for cars and bikes.While promoting biking used to be an issue for more progressive political parties, recent successes have made it one of broad agreement in mainstream politics.In a country where there are more bikes than people \u2014 22.5 million vs. 18 million \u2014 daily usage has grown 11 percent in the last decade, mostly because of the introduction of electric bikes, which lengthens the time many older people can use two-wheel transportation.Deadly bike accidents have decreased 21 percent over the last two decades, according to state figures. Much of that is attributed to less competition with motor vehicles \u2014 the more people ride, the safer it gets.\u201cBiking saves medical costs since biking contributes to people\u2019s overall physical activity levels, and getting sufficient physical activity prevents against many noncommunicable diseases, including obesity, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and some types of cancers,\u201d Dr. Carlijn Kamphuis, the study\u2019s lead author, wrote in an email exchange.Frans Jan van Rossem, Utrecht\u2019s head of bicycle programming, put it another way. \u201cOur revenue is healthy people, less traffic and beautiful living,\u201d he said.On Mr. van Rossem\u2019s watch, the city has expanded its bike network and made innovations that have brought the average number of daily bike trips to 125,000. The city estimates these are worth $300 million in socioeconomic benefits that include health care savings, reduced air pollution and increased productivity.\u201cIt didn\u2019t fall from the cold blue sky,\u201d said Ms. van Hooijdonk, the vice mayor, whose yearly city budget includes an average $55 million for bike infrastructure projects and improvements.Not everyone, though, thinks the battle is won. Milieudefensie, a crowd-funded group of environmentalists, took the federal government to court last month over air quality, which it says is far below that called for by the European Union.Utrecht, like many other European cities, spent several postwar decades trying to make automobile use easier.The effort included building a four-lane highway over centuries-old canals, making space for parked cars on its narrow cobblestone streets, and planning for a highway that was to cross the medieval city\u2019s cathedral square.Decades later, the concept of progress looks quite different.At Dafne Schippers, a new elementary school named for the Dutch sprinter, the green roof serves as an access ramp to a bicycle and pedestrian bridge that stretches 360 feet across the Amsterdam Rhine canal, a major water thoroughfare. Yet children playing recently during recess hardly seemed to notice the steady stream of cyclists.A 15-minute ride from City Hall (which, like all other new buildings, has its own biking garage \u2014 this one for 1,650 bikes), a small start-up, Springlabs, is trying to perfect a device that tells bikers how hard to pedal to catch the next green light.\u201cCities want to innovate,\u201d said Jan-Paul de Beer, the company\u2019s director. \u201cThey want to do new stuff to make the cycling experience even better.\u201dHis traffic control system, Flo, is being tested in Utrecht, in Eindhoven and soon in Antwerp, Belgium.Finding bike parking in Utrecht\u2019s medieval downtown can be made easier by a smartphone app or a glance at the large digital street signs that show those garages with empty bike parking spots.\u201cThese old cities weren\u2019t made for cars,\u201d Mr. Wagenbuur said.Utrecht\u2019s cycling network includes nearly 250 miles of dedicated bike lanes. Large signs alert car drivers that they are merely guests on these roads and should limit their speed to less than 20 miles per hour.Besides its sheer size, the Utrecht Central station biking garage boasts several innovations. Cyclists can check in and find their spot while riding their bikes. Sensors on the racks give real-time information, making finding a free spot during rush hour much easier.The project\u2019s cost, $48 million, was paid not just by the municipality, but also by the region and the national train service, which recognizes that increasing the availability of bike parking leads to an increase in riders.\u201cCycling is like a piece of magic: It only has advantages,\u201d said Ms. van Hooijdonk, who like the majority of Utrecht\u2019s residents commutes to work by bike.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harrowing Storms May Move Climate Debate, if Not G.O.P. Leaders", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, climate change activists have faced a wrenching dilemma: how to persuade people to care about a grave but seemingly far-off problem and win their support for policies that might pinch them immediately in utility bills and at the pump.\u201cThe conversation is shifting,\u201d said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. \u201cBecause even if you don\u2019t believe liberals, even if you don\u2019t believe scientists, you can believe your own eyes.\u201dBut an array of political leaders \u2014 including some members of Mr. Trump\u2019s party, along with emboldened Democrats and environmental activists \u2014 see the underlying dynamics of climate politics bending, as drastic weather events throw up practical challenges for red and blue states alike. Mr. Schatz, one of the Democrats\u2019 most assertive spokesmen on global warming, said there were already \u201cpockets of opportunity\u201d to work with Republicans on measures to reinforce coastlines and support solar- and wind-energy production, though not on more ambitious policies.\u201cWe can get a fair amount of bipartisanship if we talk about severe weather and resiliency,\u201d Mr. Schatz said. \u201cFor some people, it\u2019s just about the phrase \u2018climate change\u2019 being too politically loaded.\u201dMost movement among Republicans has come from moderates and lawmakers from areas vulnerable to flooding, where seeming oblivious to extreme weather could be politically risky. There have been no notable cracks in Republican opposition to climate policy among party leaders, or even within the powerful Texas congressional delegation \u2014 a group battered by Hurricane Harvey but fiercely protective of the state\u2019s oil economy.For the most part, senior Republicans have avoided directly discussing climate in the aftermath of Harvey and Hurricane Irma, which pounded the Southeast this week. They have focused chiefly on scrambling to get government aid to stricken states. But Mr. Trump, on a visit to Florida on Thursday, appeared to indicate his views on climate were unchanged. \u201cWe\u2019ve had bigger storms,\u201d he told reporters.The safe ground for Republicans, party strategists say, may be embracing proposals to mitigate certain effects of environmental change, while skirting debate about more drastic actions that experts see as essential.That approach reached even the White House this week, with Thomas P. Bossert, Mr. Trump\u2019s Homeland Security adviser, declaring that the administration takes \u201cseriously the threat of climate change.\u201d He added, somewhat vaguely, \u201cNot the cause of it, but the things that we observe.\u201dRepresentative Scott Taylor of Virginia, a Republican whose district hugs the Atlantic Coast, said his constituents were growing more sensitive to the implications of climate change, including voters who lean to the right. Mr. Taylor, who is a member of the climate caucus, said he was still wary of hobbling fossil-fuel companies, but favors narrower measures to address dangerous environmental conditions. The Republican nominee for governor of Virginia this year, Ed Gillespie, has taken a similar tack, ignoring climate as an issue but releasing a plan on coastal flooding.\u201cWe have to deal with issues like sea-level rise and flooding and resiliency,\u201d Mr. Taylor said, cautioning, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re there, in a bipartisan way, for comprehensive action.\u201dJay Faison, a wealthy Republican donor who has made clean energy a personal cause, said he found Republicans increasingly open to engaging around the edges of the climate issue. Mr. Faison said he had reason to believe there was \u201csome appetite\u201d among congressional leaders for backing resilient infrastructure and energy research.\u201cI\u2019d like to see more, faster,\u201d Mr. Faison said. \u201cBut we play the hand we\u2019re dealt.\u201dPolitical polling has long found most voters sympathetic to policies that protect the environment, including the Paris agreement and rules proposed by the Obama administration to curb power-plant emissions. But Americans have also tended to rank climate low among their priorities, behind issues like health care and jobs.Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who has studied climate as a campaign issue, said that it was most relevant to voters as a \u201creference point\u201d to judge a candidate\u2019s worldview, and that voters tended to see those who reject climate science as extremists. Mr. Garin said catastrophic weather could make certain hard-line views less acceptable.\u201cThe salience of climate change denialism grows at moments when the consequences of that are more abundantly clear,\u201d Mr. Garin said, \u201csuch as when the country is hit by two exceptionally powerful storms, one right after the other.\u201dIs unclear whether climate will play a major part in the 2018 elections, when Democrats are defending a number of Senate seats in states that produce carbon fuel. Climate may feature more prominently in the 2020 elections, when a wider range of states will be contested and the environmental policies Mr. Trump has pursued through executive action \u2014 like withdrawing from the Paris agreement \u2014 will be more directly at issue.But some Democratic candidates and political donors hope to punish conservative politicians before then. In Florida, Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat seeking re-election next year, quickly went on the offensive this week, accusing one potential Republican opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, of having ignored the mounting threat of climate change.And advisers to Tom Steyer, a billionaire investor who has spent millions supporting Democrats, said his political committee might seek to link Republicans in Florida, Nevada and California to environmental catastrophes in those states, like the summer hurricanes and wildfires out west.Mr. Steyer said in an interview that acknowledging the impact of devastating storms should not get Republicans off the hook for opposing efforts to address global warming over all. He predicted the \u201chuman tragedy\u201d of climate change would be a permanent feature of politics. \u201cThis is not an isolated incident,\u201d he said of Irma and Harvey. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen again, only worse.\u201dMr. Regalado, the Miami mayor, said many of his Republican colleagues were wary of being \u201ccalled crazy or liberals\u201d if they talked about climate. But he said voters on the ground had grown sharply aware of the risks they face.\u201cI don\u2019t think my statements are going to change the way the administration thinks or the governor thinks, but let me tell you, people are afraid,\u201d Mr. Regalado said. \u201cPeople are understanding there is a new normal now.\u201dLisa Friedman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Get Ready for Technological Upheaval by Expecting the Unimagined", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewSelf-driving vehicles could upend the transportation sector and eliminate a million or more jobs. Algorithms that decode M.R.I.s put a whole medical subfield at risk. And the list of professions and sectors soon to be obsolete grows steadily by the day.New technologies are rattling the economy on all fronts. While the predictions are specific and dire, bigger changes are surely coming. Clearly, we need to adjust for the turbulence ahead.But we may be preparing in the wrong way.Both history and psychology tell us that our capacity to predict the future is limited, while our capacity to believe in such predictions is unlimited. We have always been surprised.Rather than planning for the specific changes we imagine, it is better to prepare for the unimagined \u2014 for change itself.Preparing for the unknown is not as hard as it may seem, though it implies fundamental shifts in our policies on education, employment and social insurance.Take education. Were we to plan for specific changes, we would start revamping curriculums to include skills we thought would be rewarded in the future. For example, computer programming might become even more of a staple in high schools than it already is. Maybe that will prove to be wise and we will have a more productive work force.But perhaps technology evolves quickly enough that in a few decades we talk to, rather than program, computers. In that case, millions of people would have invested in a skill as outdated as precise penmanship.Currently, all the formal education most people will receive comes early in life. Specific skills may be learned on the job, but the fundamentals are acquired in school when we are young. This sequence \u2014 learn early, benefit for a lifetime \u2014 makes sense only in a world where the useful skills stay constant.Once we recognize that human capital, like technology, needs refreshing, we have to restructure our institutions so people acquire education later in life. We don\u2019t merely need training programs for niche populations or circumstances, expensive and short executive-education programs or brief excursions like TED talks. Instead we need the kind of in-depth education and training people receive routinely at age 13.In addition, we must recognize that economic upheaval at the macro level means turmoil and instability at the personal level. A lifetime of work will be a lifetime of change, moving between firms, jobs, careers and cities.Each move has financial and personal costs: It might involve going without a paycheck, looking for new housing, finding a new school district or adjusting to a new vocation. We cannot expect to create a vibrant and flexible overall economy unless we make these shifts as painless as possible. We need a fresh round of policy innovation focused on creating a safety net that gives workers the peace of mind \u2014 and the money \u2014 to move deftly when circumstances change.Finally, we can learn from the economist Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s prescient analysis of entrepreneurs. He noted that for new innovations to spread and improve our lives, there will always be creative destruction. For new firms and sectors to arise, some of the old ones must die.Our current policies \u2014 and impulses \u2014 are to resist such destruction. If a large manufacturer is set to close, subsidies and other policies kick into action to prevent that shutdown. But while we may save a factory, ultimately we hinder the rise of new technologies; rather than propping up incumbent firms we ought to enable innovation to take its course.If that idea makes you uneasy, it is probably because our current policies do nothing to protect the most vulnerable from the costs of all this destruction. We resist letting factories close because we worry about what will become of the people who work there. But if we had a social insurance system that allowed workers to move fluidly between jobs, we could comfortably allow firms to follow their natural life and death cycle.By contrast, the current approach in the United States could be called \u201cflex-nosecurity,\u201d which hardly seems the appropriate way of preparing for an economy of rapid change.There are surely many other ways of preparing for upheaval. We should broaden the current conversation \u2014 centered on drones, the end of work or the prospect of super-intelligent algorithms governing the world \u2014 to include innovative proposals for handling the unexpected.One problem is that social policy may seem boring compared with the wonderfully evocative story arcs telling us where current technologies might be heading. How can the minutiae of unemployment insurance compete for attention with movies describing the birth of Skynet, the diabolical neural network in the \u201cTerminator\u201d series?Yet even science fiction teaches humility.Take \u201cStar Trek.\u201d The future it imagines is wondrous to the point of bordering on the impossible. The laws of physics as currently understood are circumvented so that ships can travel faster than the speed of light. Unfathomable technologies are routine. People can be disassembled atom by atom and transported somewhere else, keeping their memories and consciousness intact. Any kind of food can be instantly replicated.Even the inventive \u201cStar Trek\u201d writers peering into the future, though, could not imagine a completely self-driving Starship Enterprise. While at times the Enterprise appeared to have some autopilot capacity, it routinely relied on a navigator to pilot it and was even equipped with a view screen that looked suspiciously like a car windshield.The safest prediction is that reality will outstrip our imaginations. So let us craft our policies not just for what we expect but for what will surely surprise us.Advertisement"}

Mr. Philippot\u2019s camp sees the election as a setback but notes that more people supported the National Front than in any previous election.\u201cBut those same right-wing voters in France are closer to the identity politics of Marine Le Pen, so she might want the party to go this way,\u201d he added.Ms. Le Pen and her allies have had a more muted presence on the French political scene \u2014 as have more mainstream parties, like the struggling Socialists, who recently announced that they were going to sell their headquarters in an upscale Parisian neighborhood.Party officials accused Mr. Philippot of promoting his own political movement instead of working to rebuild the National Front.Tensions rose further last week when far-right militants criticized Mr. Philippot on social media for going to a couscous restaurant in Strasbourg, France, instead of eating choucroute, the region\u2019s traditional dish of sauerkraut and sausages.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s demotion of Mr. Philippot on Wednesday came after she repeatedly asked him to step down as president of The Patriots, which he repeatedly declined to do.After his departure, National Front officials blamed Mr. Philippot for refusing to discuss a change in strategy ahead of a party congress set for March.But Mr. Philippot said the party\u2019s \u201creconstruction\u201d was \u201cgoing badly.\u201d\u201cIn reality, it was hiding a terrible step backward,\u201d he told France 2. \u201cA return of a National Front caught up by its old demons.\u201dSophie Montel, an ally of Mr. Philippot\u2019s who also announced on Thursday that she was leaving the party, said the National Front \u201cowed a lot\u201d to him.Several other members of the National Front said on Thursday that they were leaving the party in Mr. Philippot\u2019s wake, but it was unclear whether he had had enough of a following to create a significant split.Davy Rodriguez De Oliveira, a deputy leader of the National Front\u2019s youth section, said that although the unit had grown to 25,000 members while Mr. Philippot was helping to reshape party strategy, young members would not quit the National Front.\u201cIt\u2019s Marine Le Pen who initiated the undemonization strategy, and since she is our leader, we will follow her,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said in a telephone interview. \u201cFinally, we are going to debate in a serene way about the reconstruction of our party.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when Marine Le Pen was defeated in a presidential election. It was this year, not last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pete Domenici, Long a Powerful Senate Voice on Fiscal Policy, Dies at 85", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPete V. Domenici, the former six-term Republican senator from New Mexico whose mastery of budget and tax issues and energy policy made him one of the Senate\u2019s most influential members, died on Wednesday in Albuquerque. He was 85.Steve Bell, his longtime chief of staff, said the cause was complications of abdominal surgery. Mr. Domenici died at the University of New Mexico Hospital.In 1972, Mr. Domenici (pronounced doe-MEN-ih-chee), a strong supporter of nuclear power in his home state, the site of the first atomic explosion, became the first Republican elected to the Senate from New Mexico in 38 years.But he was little known nationally until 1981, when he was named chairman of the powerful Budget Committee in the wake of the Republican takeover of the Senate and Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide victory over President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election.A fiscal conservative, Mr. Domenici set out to help fulfill Reagan\u2019s election-year promise to balance the federal budget. But it was a goal he would not achieve, as the federal deficit ballooned during the Reagan years.Mr. Domenici supported the conservative theory that tax cuts stimulate economic growth. But he went on to grapple with the president himself, as well as with Republican colleagues in the Senate, on the long-term fiscal consequences of the White House\u2019s proposed tax cuts and increases in military spending, questioning whether they might spur inflation and defeat any chances of balancing the budget.Congress passed steep tax cuts in 1981, and critics of the legislation said the reductions only deepened the federal deficit and fueled a subsequent recession. Reagan agreed to a huge tax increase in 1982 to reduce the deficit, and the economy began to rebound.Mr. Domenici also sparred with Democrats over their counterproposals to increase Social Security benefits and expand other entitlement programs.In fiercely partisan and ideological budget debates during the 1980s, he was lauded for his steadiness and credibility in helping to draw the opposing sides together to reach budget agreements and enact them into law.It was not until the boom years of the 1990s that Mr. Domenici, in concert with a Democratic White House under Bill Clinton, succeeded in writing two balanced-budget agreements, the first in more than four decades. In doing so he clashed with the House speaker, Newt Gingrich, a Republican, calling Mr. Gingrich\u2019s proposed tax cuts under his \u201cContract With America\u201d agenda fiscally irresponsible.His bipartisanship made him one of the most respected members of the Senate. \u201cMr. Domenici enjoys a universal reputation as one of the Senate\u2019s hardest-working, most intelligent and most intense members,\u201d The New York Times said in an editorial in May 1995.In a documentary film about Mr. Domenici made by a New Mexico PBS station, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the Senate, or in the House of Representatives, that can make the case like Pete Domenici can, and make it as convincingly and as powerfully as he does. And whenever he does, the U.S. Senate just responds overwhelmingly.\u201dMr. Domenici spent four years as chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy after the 2002 midterm elections. He was regarded as Capitol Hill\u2019s foremost authority on nuclear power and a friend to the industries that supplied and used nuclear generating equipment.Besides being the site of the first atomic explosion, in a test in 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico is home to two national laboratories, an underground atomic-waste repository and a privately owned uranium enrichment plant. A network of government and private nuclear installations employs more than 20,000 state residents. Scientists at Los Alamos called Mr. Domenici \u201cSt. Pete\u201d for his ability to direct federal funding their way.He also exerted influence on the Appropriations and Indian Affairs committees, helping to earmark funds for the settlement of Indian water disputes and land claims. And he pushed for giving mental health parity in health insurance coverage, a matter that affected him personally: One of his eight children had schizophrenia.That cause was embraced by the Senate in 2008 when it passed mental health legislation as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, which steered billions of dollars to banks, insurance companies and automobile makers during the financial crisis of the late 2000s.When he left office in January 2009, after 36 years on Capitol Hill, Mr. Domenici had become the longest-serving senator in New Mexico history. He was succeeded by Representative Tom Udall, a Democrat and a son of Stewart Udall, a former congressman from Arizona and the interior secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.Mr. Domenici\u2019s near-spotless political career was blemished in 2008 when the Senate Ethics Committee admonished him for creating an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d by telephoning David Iglesias, a top federal prosecutor in New Mexico, at home shortly before the 2006 midterm elections.Mr. Domenici\u2019s call, in which he asked about an impending indictment, was made only weeks before the Department of Justice, in December, dismissed eight United States attorneys, including Mr. Iglesias, a move that congressional Democrats said was a political purge by the Republican administration of President George W. Bush.Mr. Domenici publicly apologized for making the call, which he said had not been meant to pressure the prosecutor. The Ethics Committee appeared to support that assertion, saying it found no \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that Mr. Domenici had \u201cattempted to improperly influence an ongoing investigation.\u201dPietro Vichi Domenici was born in Albuquerque on May 7, 1932. He was the youngest of six children and the only son of Cherabino Domenici (who was known as Choppo) and the former Alda Vichi. His parents, who were both immigrants from northern Italy, ran a successful grocery business, where their children helped out.Mr. Domenici later resisted his party\u2019s hard-line policy on border protection and immigration policy, in part because of an experience he had as a young man during World War II, when he witnessed his mother, an undocumented immigrant, being arrested at home, taken away in a black car and then briefly detained by the authorities, who were looking for Italian sympathizers. His father had become a citizen after serving in the Army in World War I.Mr. Domenici attended the University of New Mexico, where he was a star pitcher on the baseball team, and graduated with a degree in education in 1954. He spent a year teaching junior high school science and math and then attended the Denver University law school, earning his degree in 1958. He married Nancy Burk, a physical therapist, that same year.He entered politics in 1966, when he was elected to the Albuquerque City Commission. By then he had legally changed his given name to Pete. He ran for governor of New Mexico in 1970, winning the Republican nomination but losing to his Democratic rival, Bruce King. Two years later, he won his Senate seat handily.In 2013, Mr. Domenici\u2019s upright image was tarnished when it was revealed that he had fathered a child in the 1970s with Michelle Laxalt, whose father was Senator Paul Laxalt, Republican of Nevada. Mr. Domenici was 46 and Ms. Laxalt was 24 at the time of their relationship.He and Ms. Laxalt disclosed the affair, they said, because they believed someone else was about to do so. Their son, Adam Laxalt, has been Nevada\u2019s attorney general since 2015.Besides his son Pete Jr. and Mr. Laxalt, Mr. Domenici\u2019s survivors include his wife and their seven other children \u2014 Lisa, Nella, Claire, David, Nanette, Paula and Helen \u2014 as well as 15 grandchildren, three great-grandchildren and two sisters.In 2004 Senator Domenici wrote a book on the signature issue of his career, whose title made clear where he stood: \u201cA Brighter Tomorrow: Fulfilling the Promise of Nuclear Energy.\u201d\u201cIn the 21st century,\u201d he wrote, \u201cnuclear power will be a major contributor to global peace and a better quality of life for both the developed and developing world.\u201cMy ultimate goal is that in the year 2045, 100 years after the detonation of the first atomic bomb and the birth of the nuclear age, the world will evaluate the role played by nuclear technologies and conclude that their overall impact was strongly positive.\u201dAn obituary on Thursday about the former New Mexico senator Pete V. Domenici, using information from a spokesman, misstated the number of great-grandchildren who survive him. There are three, not two.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "42 Minutes, \u00a32,600 Lost: The U.K.\u2019s Growing Gambling Problem", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Tony Franklin entered a betting shop in northwest London one morning last week and paid 300 pounds, or around $400, into a gambling machine \u2014 and lost that money within 16 minutes.Then he paid in another \u00a3300. Then a further \u00a31,000 six minutes later. And 20 minutes after that, a final \u00a31,000.Within 42 minutes, Mr. Franklin had lost \u00a32,600, the latest relapse in a decades-long gambling addiction that he reckons has cost him more than a million pounds, his marriage, several jobs and his relationship with his three children.\u201cI just don\u2019t know why I go in, and this is the problem,\u201d Mr. Franklin, 46, said a few hours later. \u201cYou know you\u2019re going to lose.\u201dMr. Franklin has been trying to quit gambling for years. What usually drags him back in is a particular kind of gambling machine, known as a fixed odds betting terminal, that lies at the heart of a bitter debate about the future of British gambling. Campaigners and some researchers say the machine is an unusually addictive form of gambling that is sucking billions out of Britain\u2019s poorest communities, and some hope it will be banned after a government review next month.The bookmakers, though, pointed to a line in the report that said the rate of problem gambling had remained \u201cstatistically stable,\u201d because both figures are small compared with the British population as a whole.Today, there are roughly 33,000 such machines spread across Britain\u2019s 9,000 betting shops. They collectively provided a profit of more than \u00a31.8 billion last year, far more than those outlets made from bets on horse races, dog races and soccer matches combined.The machines allow users to place bets of up to \u00a3100, once every 20 seconds, on computerized casino games such as roulette.While researchers are divided on the subject, many gambling addicts say that the machines\u2019 singular features make them uniquely addictive and uniquely harmful, both accelerating the rate of loss and decreasing the waiting time between bets.\u201cIt\u2019s a gambler\u2019s dream,\u201d said Jason Haddigan, a former addict who wrote about his decades-long addiction in a new book, \u201cHow and Why I Conned the Bookies.\u201d \u201cYou get the buzz straightaway and you get hooked straightaway.\u201dBookmakers dispute these claims. There is \u201cno link between gaming machines in betting shops and problem gambling,\u201d said Gary Follis, a spokesman for the Association for British Bookmakers, citing the Gambling Commission\u2019s recent report, which suggested that problem gamblers tend to use several different gambling products.Bookmakers also argue that the campaign against fixed odds betting terminals is backed by people who make money from other kinds of gambling, and say that banning the machines would force many shops to close, leading to job losses.A 2006 federal law intended to make it more difficult to gamble on the Internet has, by almost any measure, been a spectacular failure.That argument strikes campaigners as myopic, given the social damage they say the machines are already causing to some of Britain\u2019s poorest communities.\u201cSocially, it\u2019s decimating communities,\u201d said Carolyn Harris, a Labour Party lawmaker who heads a parliamentary group that discusses the machines. \u201cThe less money you put in these machines, the more disposable income people will have to put into other businesses,\u201d she said, adding that banning them would \u201cboost the economy and create employment.\u201dPart of the problem facing Parliament is that different investigations into the machines\u2019 addictiveness have drawn different conclusions, making it easy for bookmakers to argue that there is not enough evidence to support changing the law.Critics of the gambling industry say these discrepancies have been subtly encouraged by the industry itself.As a result, GambleAware is now the largest single source of financing for British gambling research, while simultaneously attracting claims that it is too close to the companies it is supposed to be examining impartially.\u201cThere\u2019s no question of money coming in with strings attached,\u201d Iain Corby, GambleAware\u2019s deputy chief executive, said in an interview, adding later, \u201cWe are the good guys.\u201dBut the charity has attracted criticism because until recently, roughly half of its trustees were representatives of the gambling industry.The government is due to release a long-awaited review of fixed odds betting terminals in October, and campaigners hope it will recommend increased restrictions on their use.Yet others, including Mr. Franklin, say the government needs to reform not just machine gambling, but also the industry as a whole.The controversial machines \u201care just one part of a massive problem,\u201d he said. \u201cOne part of the cradle-to-grave electronic gambling extraction business that is causing untold unhappiness in this country.\u201dAn article on Sunday about gambling in Britain misstated the percentage increase in \u201cproblem gamblers\u201d cited in a report by the country\u2019s Gambling Commission. The report said the number rose by more than 53 percent from 2012 to 2015, not by almost 50 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Minuscule Importance of Manufacturing in Far-Right Politics", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrade ImbalanceThere is no denying that there have been large-scale layoffs and job losses in manufacturing in recent years. Those should be put in context, however. Workers are laid off much more frequently in sectors like construction, retail and even professional services. And data show that the people more likely to have suffered losses in jobs and income from trade are no more likely to vote for the far right.That is hardly overwhelming support and is no higher than the share of workers in the construction industry, which does not compete with low-income countries, and lower than the share of workers in mining and agriculture, sectors in which the United States has a trade surplus with China.Notably, that 13-percentage-point advantage is biased by the fact that people more inclined to like Mr. Trump \u2014 older, white, heterosexual Christian men \u2014 happen to be overrepresented in manufacturing jobs. The Trump manufacturing advantage shrinks to just three percentage points after taking into account demographic factors (race, age, gender, sexuality, religion and educational attainment) and becomes entirely insignificant after including attitudes about racism.Trump voters are far more likely to disagree with statements like \u201cI am angry that racism exists\u201d and \u201cWhite people in the U.S. have certain advantages because of the color of their skin.\u201d Manufacturing sector exposure is among the least important factors in predicting Trump support.Nor is technology a big concern. Only 9 percent of Trump supporters are worried that their job will become obsolete as a result of technology compared with 15 percent of those who don\u2019t approve of the president.Likewise, exposure to trade competition played no apparent role in persuading Obama voters to switch to Mr. Trump. People who voted for President Obama in 2012 accounted for about 12 percent of all Trump voters, but again, these voters were not disproportionately involved in the manufacturing sector, either nationally or in swing states. Around 8.7 percent of Trump voters who also voted for Mr. Obama in 2012 work in manufacturing, compared with 9.5 percent of Trump voters who voted for Mitt Romney.Exposure to trade is even less important for far-right voters in Europe than it is for Trump voters. Using data from the European Social Survey, I find that working in manufacturing raises the probability of voting for a far-right party in the most recent election by less than one percentage point, using no demographic control variables. Adding the same controls as above \u2014 religion, race, age, education, gender \u2014 eliminates even that small effect.As in the United States, European far-right voters were far more likely to express concerns about immigration and race, saying, for example, that they are discriminated against, or that being white should be an important factor in determining whether foreigners are allowed to migrate.By contrast, voters reporting positive interactions with people from other races were much less likely to be far-right voters.None of this is to say that economics is unimportant to nationalist voting. Both Trump voters and European far-right voters are distinguished by their strong dissatisfaction with the present state of the national economy, even controlling for demographic factors and attitudes on race and immigration.Likewise, both groups are more likely to report that their family income situation is either difficult (for European far-right voters) or has gotten worse in the last four years (for Trump voters), even though family income is no lower for either group of voters.Even if nationalist voters are not direct victims of trade, many might still oppose it out of a belief \u2014 however mistaken \u2014 that cooperation with foreigners must come at the expense of their fellow citizens. While this view has historically been advanced by anticapitalist academics, it has seen new life among white nationalists on the right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Irma: Caribbean Tourism, Island by Island", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayFerocious storms are nothing new to these islands, but Hurricane Irma, with its 185-mile-per-hour winds, was catastrophic. Cities, and some islands, are almost entirely in ruins.Certain islands were better prepared than others as the storm roared from Barbuda, part of the country of Antigua and Barbuda in the eastern Caribbean, to the Florida Keys, destroying homes and infrastructure, including roads and hospitals; flooding hotels and restaurants; and leaving people without power, food and essential services.In the hardest-hit places, like St. Martin and St. John, a slow and arduous recovery is underway.Yet, as of Thursday, the damage in other places was so extensive that despite the projected loss of crucial revenue, government officials were not focused on tourism; they were still struggling \u2014 and continue to struggle \u2014 to ensure people\u2019s health and safety and evacuate stranded visitors.The situation is changing day by day, and varies greatly from island to island. For example, Barbuda, where Hurricane Irma made landfall, is devastated, while Puerto Rico is not only open to tourists, it\u2019s a hub for relief efforts, and is welcoming hundreds of people to its shores from battered neighboring islands.Below, a look at how the islands are faring.Puerto RicoMr. Izquierdo said in an interview that he expects tourism to continue to play a key role in Puerto Rico\u2019s economic resurgence, but that at the moment the island was focused on helping its less fortunate neighbors. The Puerto Rican government has been assisting the State Department and the Department of Health and Human Services (as well as hotels and cruise lines) to get U.S. citizens stranded on other Caribbean islands onto American soil. Once in Puerto Rico, they have been able to get food and medical assistance, as well as help arranging travel back to the continental United States.\u201cWe\u2019re very much thinking of all of our neighbors,\u201d Mr. Izquierdo said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position to help those in greater need.\u201dAntigua and BarbudaBarbuda\u2019s hotels were also damaged, yet as there were less than 100 rooms on the island, the overall effect on tourism is minimal, the Caribbean Tourism Organization said.Barbuda\u2019s population is much smaller than Antigua\u2019s, though its unspoiled land made it an attractive getaway. The actor Robert De Niro and James Packer, the Australian businessman, were in the process of transforming the island\u2019s former K Club Resort into the Paradise Found Nobu Resort when the hurricane struck.U.S. Virgin IslandsAccording to Central Intelligence Agency data, the economy of the Virgin Islands, while reliant on tourism, is a bit more diverse than other Caribbean islands. Additional sources of income include rum exports, trade and services.British Virgin IslandsThese 60 islands east of Puerto Rico, which include Tortola, are also extremely dependent on tourism and benefit from visitors from the nearby United States Virgin Islands. That\u2019s unlikely to happen with St. Thomas and St. John in shambles. And the British Virgin Islands were themselves walloped by the storm. Sharon Flax-Brutus, the director of tourism, said in a statement that there are many homes without roofs, power outages and downed cellphone towers. The government said it\u2019s working to restore commercial flights, but as of Monday , timing was unclear.AnguillaLuxury tourism is essential for this British dependency. However, some 90 percent of the electricity infrastructure was damaged, along with the main water supply, according to the Caribbean Tourism Organization. Humanitarian aid experts from the United Kingdom are assessing the situation. The chief minister, the Honorable Victor Banks, said the island plans to open for business before the all-important Christmas season.St. Kitts and NevisSt. Barth\u00e9lemySt. Martin / Sint MaartenTurks and Caicos IslandsCubaThe storm was yet another setback for the Communist nation, where the burgeoning tourism industry has provided much-needed income.

McDade, an 18-term Republican congressman from northeastern Pennsylvania who helped revive the local coal-driven economy, and who late in his career was accused and acquitted of helping himself to $100,000 in illegal gifts, died on Sunday at his home in Fairfax, Va. He was 85.His death was confirmed in a statement from his family. He had had Parkinson\u2019s disease since the 1990s.Conservative on social issues and an ardent advocate for military spending, Mr. McDade was immensely popular in his 10th Congressional District, in Lackawanna County, winning re-election even in the Democratic landslide of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. He was a largely pro-labor Republican who delivered generous servings of pork barrel legislation to his constituents.Mr. McDade preserved thousands of jobs by preventing the closing of the Tobyhanna Army Depot, southeast of Scranton, and was instrumental in the designation of the Delaware Water Gap Recreation Area. He wangled some $70 million from the federal budget for a museum called the Steamtown National Historic Site at an abandoned rail yard in Scranton, a tourist attraction that the National Park Service never requested.And, with Mr. Murtha, he persuaded the Defense Department to buy about 300,000 tons, or roughly 10 percent, of the nation\u2019s output of anthracite coal annually, providing the Pentagon with a perpetual 10-year supply of the fuel, which is mined in Pennsylvania.A federal investigation of Mr. McDade, begun in 1988, culminated in his indictment in 1992 on bribery and racketeering charges. He had been accused of failing to report gifts \u2014 including college scholarships for his son and vacation junkets \u2014 from people and corporations seeking government contracts.Tried in 1996, he was acquitted after he testified that his failure to disclose the gifts had been an honest mistake. Several of his aides blamed themselves for any reporting violations.Mr. McDade was re-elected twice while charges were pending. But the indictment embarrassed congressional Republicans, especially after he refused to relinquish his leadership role as ranking minority member on the House Appropriations Committee.In 1993, House Republicans voted to require indicted members to quit their leadership posts until their cases were resolved. But they carved out an exemption for those who, like Mr. McDade, were already under indictment. When the Republicans won control of the House in 1994, however, Mr. McDade was passed over for the committee chairmanship.In 1998, as a result of his indictment, House Republicans enacted a law requiring federal prosecutors to follow the ethical code for lawyers in the state in which they were operating. Prosecutors said the provision hampered their covert, undercover and sting investigations.Joseph Michael McDade was born on Sept. 29, 1931, in Scranton to John B. McDade and the former Genevieve Hayes. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1953 and from the University of Pennsylvania law school.He is survived by his wife, the former Sarah Scripture, and their son, Jared; two sons, Joseph Jr. and Mark, and two daughters, Aileen McDade and Deborah Bell, from an earlier marriage, to the former Mary Theresa O\u2019Brien, which ended in divorce; three sisters, Mary Gene Butler, Genevieve Tuthill and Ann Dwyer; and six grandchildren.An obituary on Sept. 27 about Joseph M. McDade, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who was a champion of the coal industry, referred incorrectly to anthracite coal. It has a low \u2014 not high \u2014 sulfur content.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toshiba Reaches Deal With Bain-Apple Group to Sell Chip Business", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Toshiba, the huge but struggling Japanese conglomerate, traded some of its size for financial security on Thursday by selling off most of its profitable microchip business.It was not the way the company, which has long been accused of being bloated and directionless, had hoped to slim down.Toshiba said it had signed a deal to sell 60 percent of the microchip unit, Toshiba Memory Corporation, to a group of international investors that includes Bain Capital and Apple. The deal, which followed months of tumultuous negotiations, will net Toshiba about $14 billion.Toshiba traces its roots to the 1870s, when its founders helped further Japan\u2019s industrial emergence, building the country\u2019s telegraph system and installing its first domestically made electric lights. If the company had collapsed, Japan would have lost a pillar of its economy and its tens of thousands of workers. It also would have lost the main contractor cleaning up the ruined Fukushima nuclear plant, which Toshiba helped build decades ago.While Toshiba\u2019s history in many ways embodied Japan\u2019s blazing economic rise, some people say the stumbles that led the company to sell chip unit reflected the country\u2019s more recent problems.In an era when the global technology industry is dominated by nimble specialists selling cutting-edge design and software, Toshiba has been defined by a stultifying management hierarchy, a dogged focus on hardware and a scattered portfolio of businesses.\u201cToshiba is one of Japan\u2019s last zombies,\u201d said Jesper Koll, the chief executive of WisdomTree Japan, an investment firm. \u201cIt\u2019s the last of the big conglomerates that does not have a defined strategy.\u201dSimilar problems have hampered other Japanese groups, but Mr. Koll said that Toshiba had been particularly slow to address them. Others, like Hitachi, another refrigerators-to-power-plants conglomerate, he said, \u201cmade hard decisions\u201d to restructure and become more accountable to shareholders, while Toshiba delayed.The inaction helped Toshiba executives save face, at least for a while.Now, with the sale of a majority of the microchip unit, Toshiba is shrinking further.Two financial institutions controlled by the Japanese government that Toshiba had previously identified as major potential investors will not contribute money initially, the company said. The institutions, the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan, may invest at a later date.The investors were instead drawn entirely from the private sector.In addition to Apple, they include three other American businesses: Seagate Technology and Kingston Technology, two data storage companies, and a venture capital arm of Dell, the computer maker. The South Korean semiconductor maker SK Hynix, and Hoya, a Japanese manufacturer of optical equipment, were also named as investors.Toshiba itself will retain just over 40 percent of the unit, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of the flash memory chips used to store data in smartphones and other digital devices.In negotiating the deal, Toshiba struggled to balance its need for cash and its desire to retain control of the microchip unit, which has been described as the crown jewel in its vast portfolio of businesses.Toshiba pioneered its core technology, NAND flash memory, and although it has fallen to second in global production, behind Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the business has generated the largest share of Toshiba\u2019s profits in recent years. Among the company\u2019s concerns was that its technology could fall into the hands of investors, like SK Hynix and Kingston, that are also its competitors.Although Japan dominated the global microchip market in the 1980s and 1990s, it has lost ground more recently. Tsugio Makimoto, a retired semiconductor engineer at Hitachi, said that in the past, big conglomerates were good at nurturing microchip businesses, because they had the money to finance research and build factories.Now, as the pace of technological change has quickened, \u201cmanagement speed and specialization are more important,\u201d he said.While Toshiba will retain only a minority of the chip unit\u2019s shares, it will still exercise significant control.The American investors, whose precise financial contributions were not disclosed, will receive preferred shares that do not carry voting rights, Toshiba said. SK Hynix would be limited to an ownership stake of no more than 15 percent for 10 years.Hoya is buying 10 percent. In a line that reflected nationalistic concerns about the sale, Toshiba made a point of noting that, \u201cWith Toshiba and Hoya\u2019s investments, Japan-based companies will hold more than 50 percent of the common stock.\u201d It added that Japanese owners would \u201ccontinue to hold a majority\u201d in the future.In proceeding with the deal, Toshiba brushed aside objections by one of its business partners, Western Digital, the American storage company. Western Digital could still move to block the sale\u2019s completion.A Western Digital subsidiary, SanDisk, shares ownership with Toshiba of a flash memory production operation in Japan. Because of that, the American company contends that its approval is necessary for Toshiba to sell the chip unit. Western Digital said this week that it would seek an injunction against the deal.If the legal battle is settled in Toshiba\u2019s favor, or if the two sides reach a settlement, it could make it easier for risk-averse government institutions like the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan to join the buyout conglomerate. That would take pressure off other investors and Toshiba\u2019s banks, which Toshiba said had agreed to provide 600 billion yen in fresh loans.Regardless of the legal outcome, Toshiba\u2019s relationship with Western Digital and SanDisk has been badly damaged, presenting a challenge for the chip unit\u2019s new owners.\u201cToshiba\u2019s flash memory success has a lot to do with its relationship with SanDisk,\u201d said Mr. Makimoto. \u201cThere are still a lot of issues to address before Toshiba can breathe easy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You wouldn\u2019t ask a car dealer to give you two cars for the price of one, she says: \u201cThis is my job.\u201dMs. Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance is canny and layered: a freelancer with no pimp, Candy has to entice clients and manage them, one eye on the future, one on the next 30 minutes.The show\u2019s other big name is James Franco, playing identical twins: Vincent, a hardworking barkeep, and Frankie, a hard-gambling black sheep.

{"Headline": "Sale of Brooklyn Housing Complex Would Benefit Trump", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe longtime owners of Starrett City, the sprawling Brooklyn housing complex overlooking Jamaica Bay, are selling the development for more than $850 million, and among those who stand to benefit is President Trump, a partial owner.Starrett City is the largest federally subsidized housing development in the country, and the sale will require the approval of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and state housing officials, raising potential conflicts of interest for Mr. Trump and his family. Mr. Trump owns a 4 percent stake in the complex, according to his federal financial disclosure forms; other members of the Trump family also own stakes in the partnership.The buyer is a joint venture of the Brooksville Company, a recently formed residential real estate firm, and Rockpoint Group, a private equity firm that invests in real estate. The pending deal, which is expected to close early next year, was announced to tenants, employees and elected officials on Wednesday.Mr. Trump\u2019s share of the proceeds \u2014 after the partners pay off their mortgage, transfer taxes and other transaction costs \u2014 could be about $14 million, according to real estate executives familiar with the details who spoke anonymously because they have no authority to disclose them.Carol Deane, the managing partner for the sellers, Starrett City Associates, said that the sales agreement \u201cprovides stability for our residents, and guarantees their apartments will remain affordable for many years to come.\u201d Under previous agreements with the state and federal governments, the owner of Starrett City is locked into rent-regulated housing programs for at least another 22 years.Andrew MacArthur, the founder of Brooksville, said that he and Rockpoint were \u201ccommitted to preserving the original vision of the complex as stable, quality affordable housing.\u201dProviding affordable housing in a city where rents have climbed outside the reach of many has been a major focus of both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo who have struggled to keep pace with the loss of units converted to market-rate rents.Everything about Starrett City is supersized. It sits on 145 acres between the East New York and Canarsie neighborhoods, with 5,881 apartments in 46 buildings and 15,000 residents, as well as its own power plant, schools, shopping center, houses of worship and ZIP code.All of the apartments are rent regulated for low, moderate- and middle-income tenants. In 2016, HUD provided the owners of Starrett City with nearly $80 million in rent subsidies and a tax break worth more than $16 million.Starrett City rose on the site of a landfill in the early 1970s and it was originally designed as a union-sponsored housing cooperative called Twin Pines Village.With rising costs and a weak economy, the unions asked Starrett Housing Corp., a private real estate company, to take over construction.Disque Deane, an irascible real estate investor who kept a stuffed white Alaskan timber wolf in his office, led the partnership that owned the complex.\u201cThey put together a group of investors, 200 if I recall, of the richest people in the country, including Trump\u2019s father,\u201d said Robert C. Rosenberg, a former city housing commissioner who later ran Starrett City for many years.President Trump\u2019s father, Fred, acquired as much as a 20 percent stake. His interest was later split among his children and several corporate entities.The investors collectively put in $22 million, or roughly 6 percent of the $382 million cost of building the project. The state housing agency provided $360 million in financing. The investors benefited from existing tax laws that allowed them to use losses at one project to shield profits from other investments from taxes.At the same time, the complex also participated in a variety of housing programs, including Section 8, under which tenants pay 30 percent of their income with the government subsidizing the rest of the rent. The government, in turn, set a 6 percent cap on profits.\u201cI generated so many tax losses for them that they did better than any other tax shelter in the history of America,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said. \u201cBecause of Section 8, I had enough money to keep the place in good shape.\u201dIn a 2007 interview, Donald J. Trump called Starrett City \u201cprobably the greatest tax shelter ever made.\u201dThe complex opened in 1974 in a city wracked by racial tension and fiscal and economic distress. Starrett promised the city that 70 percent of the tenants would be white and 30 percent minority and maintained separate waiting lists to ensure those goals.Advertisements for Starrett City at the time offered an \u201cinvitation to better living,\u201d with \u201camazingly low rentals\u201d \u2014 $275 for a two-bedroom with a balcony and a \u201cmagnificent $3,500,000 pleasure dome,\u201d or sports center.The Open Housing Center challenged the quotas in court in 1979, resulting in a settlement in 1984, but no major changes to the waiting lists. A subsequent lawsuit forced the creation of a single waiting list for all applicants.According to census data, almost half the residents today are black, a quarter are white, 21.8 percent are Hispanic and about 3 percent are Asian.The complex was renamed Spring Creek Towers several years ago but few residents call it that.At the height of the debt-fueled real estate boom in 2006, major real estate investors bought meat-and-potatoes housing that they had once ignored like Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village on the East Side of Manhattan and the Riverton Houses in Harlem.They often paid exorbitant prices with cheap money from Wall Street and invested little equity. Often the new owners\u2019 plan was to oust long-term, rent-regulated residents in favor of new tenants willing and able to pay higher rents. But many of the deals collapsed under the weight of enormous debts.In 2007, Starrett City Associates sought to sell the complex to a partnership led by David Bistricer, who owned thousands of units across the city, for $1.3 billion. The partnership planned to convert the complex to market rate housing.On Wednesday, elected officials, including RuthAnne Visnauskas, commissioner of New York State Homes and Community Renewal, largely took a wait-and-see approach to the sale, though Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said that he will be \u201cwatching like a hawk to make sure any new owner follows every iota\u201d of the 2009 agreement on affordability.But Assemblyman Charles Barron was dismayed. He said it was a \u201cgross miscarriage of economic justice\u201d that President Trump would profit from the sale. He was also concerned about the tenants. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do this without a full vetting by the tenants,\u201d Mr. Barron said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a battle on this one.\u201dBrooksville and its financial partner Rockpoint say they will not be under the same financial pressure as buyers were during the last boom because they are putting up more than half of the $850 million sale price in cash.Douglas Harmon of Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate company, helped put the deal together for Starrett City Associates. A decade ago, he said the deals were \u201chigh wire acquisitions\u201d that were not sustainable investments.The deals today are very different, Mr. Harmon said. \u201cTheir purchase is fueled by low leverage and in this historic low interest rate environment they can be satisfied with boring, bond-like investment returns.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dreamers, Liars and Bad Economics", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDoes it matter that Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, tried to justify Donald Trump\u2019s immigration cruelty with junk economics?It\u2019s definitely not the main issue. Trump\u2019s decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy is, above all else, immoral. The 800,000 beneficiaries of DACA \u2014 the so-called Dreamers \u2014 have done nothing wrong; they came to the United States illegally, but not of their own volition, because they were children at the time.They are, according to all available data, an exemplary segment of our population: hard-working young people, many seeking to improve themselves through higher education. They\u2019re committed to the values of their home \u2014 because America is their home.To yank the rug out from under the Dreamers \u2014 perhaps even to use the information they supplied voluntarily to harass and deport them \u2014 is a cruel betrayal. And it\u2019s self-evidently driven by racial hostility. Does anyone believe this would be happening if the typical Dreamer had been born in, say, Norway rather than Mexico?It\u2019s true that Trump and company tell a lot of lies about economics (and everything else).So having officials make false claims about the economics of DACA is, in a way, just standard operating procedure for this administration. Yet I\u2019d argue that in this context it\u2019s especially noteworthy, and especially vile.For one thing, what was stuff about jobs even doing in a statement by the attorney general?Furthermore, the claim was, as I said, junk economics. The idea that there are a fixed number of jobs, so that if a foreign-born worker takes a job he or she takes it away from a native-born worker, is completely at odds with everything we know about how the economy works. Hearing it from a conservative is especially surreal.The truth is that letting the Dreamers work legally helps the U.S. economy; pushing them out or into the shadows is bad for everyone except racists.To understand why, you need to realize that America, like other advanced economies, is facing a double-barreled demographic challenge thanks to declining fertility.On one side, an aging population means fewer workers paying taxes to support Social Security and Medicare. Demography is the main reason long-run forecasts suggest problems for Social Security, and an important reason for concerns about Medicare. Driving out young workers who will pay into the system for many decades is a way to make these problems worse.On the other side, declining growth in the working-age population reduces the returns to private investment, increasing the risk of prolonged slumps like the one that followed the 2008 financial crisis.It\u2019s not an accident that Japan, which has low fertility and is deeply hostile to immigration, began experiencing persistent deflation and stagnation a decade before the rest of the world. Destroying DACA makes America more like Japan. Why would we want to do that?In short, letting Dreamers work is all economic upside for the rest of our nation, with no downside unless you have something against people with brown skin and Hispanic surnames. Which is, of course, what this is all really about.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Republicans Embrace Plan for $1.5 Trillion Tax Cut", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans, abandoning a key fiscal doctrine, agreed on Tuesday to move forward on a budget that would add to the federal deficit in order to pave the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years.The Republican lawmakers, under mounting pressure to score a legislative win on taxes, say a tax cut of this magnitude will stimulate economic growth enough to offset any deficit impact.Yet critics say a deficit-financed tax cut is at odds with longstanding Republican calls for fiscal discipline, including that tax cuts not add to the ballooning federal deficit. The federal debt topped $20 trillion earlier this month and is projected to grow by another $10 trillion over the next decade.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who considers himself a strict deficit hawk, said he remains deeply concerned about enacting tax cuts that add to the deficit. But he suggested that Republicans may not solely rely on traditional estimates of a bill\u2019s costs. Republicans have recently voiced concern that some estimates, including those from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office, undervalue the effect of economic growth.In announcing the agreement, Mr. Corker insisted that he was not casting away his concern about the debt.\u201cMy support will be contingent on a final package that generates significant economic growth and does not worsen, but hopefully improves our fiscal situation,\u201d Mr. Corker said of the tax plan.An agreement on the size of the tax cuts between Mr. Corker and Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who has pushed for deeper tax cuts, helped seal the deal.Passing a budget resolution is a crucial step for unlocking an arcane procedural tool that would allow Republicans to push a tax overhaul through the Senate with a simple majority and without the support of Democrats. Republicans have said they want a bill passed by the end of the year.Even with Tuesday\u2019s deal, there is still a tough road ahead. The full Senate would need to vote on the budget and it would then need to align with the House version, which was voted out of committee earlier this year.That may prove a tricky task, since House lawmakers may be more reluctant to enact tax cuts that would add to the deficit.Still, any tax cut may wind up being temporary. Under existing Senate rules, Republicans can pass legislation with a simple majority only if the bill is not found to add to the deficit after a period of 10 years. That means all \u2014 or part \u2014 of the tax legislation could expire after a decade if official estimates of the costs do not align with Republicans\u2019 optimistic economic growth projections.Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee have been wrestling for weeks over how big a tax cut is feasible and have been under pressure to reach a budget deal this month so that the work on tax legislation can officially begin in October. Still, while the Republicans may coalesce around a $1.5 trillion tax cut, the details of the actual plan remain fraught with lawmakers divided on some key issues such as the corporate tax rate and which, if any, deductions will be eliminated or scaled back.Some details of the plan are expected to be released next week when the \u201cBix Six\u201d working group of Republican congressional leaders and the White House economic team outline their policy framework.President Trump said this month that the wealthiest Americans might end up paying a bit more in order to lower tax bills for the middle class. A White House official said on Tuesday that while the rich would not see a benefit from the tax plan no final decisions on top rates had been reached.Republicans have been wary of sharing too many details given the intense lobbying crush that is expected once it becomes clear which industries stand to win or lose valuable provisions currently ingrained in the tax code. Those include things like the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for charitable donations.Financing tax cuts through deficit spending essentially means the government will borrow money to pay for tax reductions, rather than finding spending cuts to make up for the lost revenue.Such a move would add to an already-hefty debt load that is only expected to grow as an aging population drives additional spending on retirement and health programs. The C.B.O. estimates that within 10 years, the federal debt will rise to its highest percentage of gross domestic product since just after World War II.Republican lawmakers, who for years have complained about the country\u2019s deteriorating fiscal situation, are now turning to arcane budget arguments and making the case that tax cuts will unleash enough economic growth to compensate for lost revenue.\u201cJust going from 2 to 3 percent growth adds about $14 trillion of economic activity over a decade, $2 to $3 trillion of revenue to the federal government,\u201d said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and a member of the Budget Committee.Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he continues to worry about the deficit. But he supports a budget that provides maximum flexibility to produce a tax overhaul that will move America forward.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely in need of something that will stimulate the economy,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Whether a big tax cut can stimulate an economy already saddled with debt is at best uncertain and many experts think it will actually stifle growth.At a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, warned that deficit financed tax cuts could prove to be a drag on the economy.\u201cYou should always think of these tax reform proposals as a race between the effects of the tax changes and the effect on the budget,\u201d Mr. Marron said. \u201cThere is a cost to deficit financing.\u201dAnti-deficit groups say they plan to remind Republicans who railed against deficits during the Obama administration of their past criticisms.\u201cThe president and members of Congress have spent years warning of our large and growing national debt and have said their goal was to pursue tax reform that doesn\u2019t make that debt worse,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cIt is extremely disheartening that the Senate budget may be abandoning that commitment.\u201dThe tax cuts, she added, \u201ccould result in debt as large as the economy in just over a decade and take us into uncharted waters after that.\u201dMichael A. Peterson, president of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said that the national debt topping $20 trillion should not be an invitation for Republicans in Congress to exacerbate a problem that they were elected to fix.\u201cIrresponsible tax reform is counterproductive and anti-growth because increasing the national debt hurts the economy. Tax reform should grow the economy, not the debt,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cThis proposal fails the test of fiscally responsible tax reform.\u201dWary of any tax legislation that benefits the rich, Democrats have taken a firm stance against Republican policies that would add to the deficit and said they will not support a bill that does not pay for itself.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the finance committee, warned against a proposal that would provide a \u201csugar hit\u201d of economic growth and a painful hangover in the coming years.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d Mr. Wyden said, referring to previous Republican tax cuts. \u201cIt is a prescription for more trouble in the American economy in the long term.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ryan Says Trump Cut Deal With Democrats to Avoid Partisan Fight Over Hurricane Aid", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Paul D. Ryan voiced his disagreement with President Trump\u2019s decision to cut a debt limit deal with Democrats and cast doubt on his call to cut the corporate tax rate by more than half in an interview on Thursday with The New York Times.The comments underscore the rift between the White House and the top House Republican at a time when they are pressing to reach several major legislative goals before the end of the year. However, Mr. Ryan said that he understood the president\u2019s motivations.\u201cWhat the president didn\u2019t want to do is have some partisan fight in the middle of the response to this,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, referring to Hurricane Harvey. \u201cHe wanted to make sure we had a bipartisan moment.\u201dOn Thursday, he said that he continued to believe that short-term debt limit extensions were not a good idea.\u201cI personally believe, for the credit markets\u2019 sake, we should have longer extensions of these,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.Democrats have celebrated the agreement because they think it will give them leverage in other negotiations when the extensions expire in December. Many conservatives assailed Mr. Trump for aligning himself with his political opponents.But that was not the only difference of opinion that emerged between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump on Thursday.Mr. Ryan also said Mr. Trump\u2019s call for a 15 percent corporate tax rate was unrealistic and suggested that the president\u2019s math did not add up. He said that getting the corporate tax rate to the mid to low 20 percent range was more likely and would make American businesses more competitive.\u201cHe obviously wants to push that as low as possible,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cAt the end of the day we have to make these numbers work.\u201dMr. Ryan has spent the last month traveling the country making the case for a comprehensive rewrite of the tax code and a plan is expected to begin working its way through congressional committees later this month.Despite months of meetings between Trump administration officials and Republican leaders in the House and Senate, fundamental differences remain. Lawmakers continue to debate whether the eventual legislation will be \u201cdeficit neutral\u201d and whether they would support temporary tax cuts that add to the deficit as a last resort.Mr. Ryan argued on Thursday that an outdated tax code was a drag on the economy and that the changes that Republicans are proposing would raise wages and accelerate economic growth.After their failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act without the help of Democrats, Republicans in the House and Senate have been quietly reaching out to see if bipartisanship is possible. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump traveled to North Dakota with Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, to make the case that she should support the efforts underway to rewrite the tax code.The effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s deal with Democrats to tie Hurricane Harvey aid to three month extensions to the debt limit and government funding remain unclear.Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic and legislative advisers disagreed with his decision to cut a deal with the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader. Some who opposed the deal tried to put a positive spin on it on Thursday by arguing that it gave a clear opening to work on the tax legislation.\u201cWe\u2019re very happy that we have a deal,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on the Fox Business Network. \u201cI would say the best part about this is this clears out the next 90 days for us to focus on important things.\u201dMr. Ryan said in June that his personal goal was to get tax reform done before deer hunting season, which begins before Thanksgiving, and he said he was still confident that it could be completed by the end of 2017.\u201cWe want America to wake up on New Year\u2019s Day 2018 with a new tax system,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.But more storms are coming and other legislative priorities are piling up. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision earlier this week to end former President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program gives Congress just six months to come up with a solution.Mr. Ryan, who had urged Mr. Trump to maintain the program, said that he planned to introduce a \u201cconsensus plan\u201d to the floor of the House in the coming months. That plan, he said, would deal with both border security and how to handle the children of undocumented immigrants who entered the country illegally.\u201cI think you can find a compromise,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cI think six months is enough time for us to figure it out.\u201dDespite the recent signs of tension between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan defended Mr. Trump against accusations that he has been fomenting racism in the country.\u201cI really think he\u2019s disgusted by these people,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, referring to the neo-Nazi groups that held protests in Virginia last month.It remains to be seen if Democrats will really work with Republicans on a tax plan or if they will try to prevent Mr. Trump from securing a major legislative win.Mr. Ryan said that even though Mr. Trump surprised many Republicans with his outreach to Democrats this week, he believes that he can still count on the president to shepherd the first overhaul of the tax code since 1986.\u201cOn tax reform, he\u2019s very very engaged,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cHe is very committed to selling tax reform.\u201dWatch the full conversation:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manufacturing Is a Bright Spot in a Subdued Jobs Report", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMACUNGIE, Pa. \u2014 At the sprawling Mack Trucks factory here, the last of the workers laid off in 2016 after sales slowed down are back on the line, and for the first time in years, the company is hiring new employees.The turnabout in the Lehigh Valley, whose shuttered factories inspired Billy Joel\u2019s elegiac 1980s song \u201cAllentown,\u201d was evident more broadly on Friday, when the Labor Department reported that manufacturers nationwide added workers last month at the fastest pace in more than four years.Hiring in other sectors was more muted, with the economy creating 156,000 jobs, fewer than expected and well off the much bigger employment gains earlier this summer. The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.4 percent, while wages barely grew.Still, the latest payroll data underscores the striking rebound at American factories, which lost more than two million jobs in the recession, but have clawed their way back and recovered more than one million positions since 2010.Dennis Slagle, Mack\u2019s president, said his company\u2019s hiring reflected increased demand for its big trucks. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen confidence rise,\u201d he said, noting that truckers benefit whether shoppers do their buying online or at brick-and-mortar stores. \u201cIf you bought it, we brought it.\u201dAfter dropping to 1,287 at the end of 2016 from 1,875 a year earlier, employment at Mack\u2019s Macungie plant has rebounded to 1,800. To attract new workers, the company has set up tables at local job fairs, including one in May at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown, home of the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs baseball team.The company has had a presence in the Lehigh Valley since 1905, when the Mack brothers moved truck production to Allentown from Brooklyn, where the company was founded in 1900.It has endured even as giants like Bethlehem Steel, which once employed thousands of workers who turned hot metal into finished steel, vanished. And unlike many of its competitors, it builds both the truck cabs and components like engines and transmissions in the United States.Mack is foreign-owned \u2014 by the Volvo Group of Sweden \u2014 but the parent company recently completed an $84 million project to modernize and expand the Macungie factory. Mack plans to roll out its first new truck line in about two decades on Sept. 13.\u201cLabor relations are good enough that they were willing to spend that much money,\u201d said Edward Balukas, president of Local 677 of the United Automobile Workers union, which represents production line employees at Mack. Salaries start at $18.75, according to Mr. Balukas, rising to $27 after six years, and the jobs come with a full benefit package and retirement plan.One explanation for stagnant wage growth \u2014 even with low unemployment and steady hiring \u2014 is automation, as workers like retail store clerks, tollbooth operators and bank tellers are forced to move on and take whatever jobs they can find.Robots really are not much of a presence at Mack, however, where workers in T-shirts and shorts clamber atop newly finished chassis to attach hulking cabs that move on an overhead belt.Big rigs represent a major investment for buyers \u2014 prices start at about $115,000 and can run as high as $250,000 for a dump truck. And their customized nature makes it hard to automate production, said Jonathan Randall, senior vice president for North American sales at Mack.\u201cWe build fleets one at a time,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt takes skilled human beings to do that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a bed of roses when you go down to Mexico,\u201d said Mr. Slagle, Mack\u2019s president. \u201cWe feel this is the place to be.\u201dThe jump in manufacturing last month, along with construction, stands in sharp contrast to some service sectors, where job growth was much less impressive.Retailers shed 900 jobs, confirming the assault on traditional stores by online retailers. Leisure and hospitality, which has been especially robust in recent months, added just 4,000 positions, while the public sector lost 9,000.President Trump campaigned on reviving the kinds of jobs done in factories, coal mines and oil fields. Since he took office, hiring has indeed ticked upward in these sectors, but is there any connection?Those losses help explain why August\u2019s overall payroll increase fell well short of the 180,000 gain that economists on Wall Street had been expecting. But few took it as a sign of more fundamental weakness, especially because the initial August figure has come in below expectations in five of the last six years, only to be revised higher in some cases.\u201cIn months where there are anomalies like this, we look at the three-month average, which is 185,000,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cThe labor market is healthy, but we still have the conundrum that solid employment gains haven\u2019t translated into faster wage growth.\u201dOne wild card in the second half of 2017 will be gasoline prices. The surge following Hurricane Harvey\u2019s devastation in Texas will leave less money for consumers to spend on other goods and services.On Friday morning, the average price for regular gasoline nationwide was $2.52, a 7-cent increase from Thursday. Prices have risen 15 cents a gallon in the last week, and the current price is 30 cents above the national average for regular gasoline a year ago. Over the course of a year, every penny increase is equivalent to a $1 billion tax on consumers.But Wall Street was happy with the report \u2014 benchmark indexes closed up 0.2 percent Friday \u2014 as the slowdown in hiring and minimal wage growth mean the Federal Reserve is likely to stick to its promise to raise interest rates only gradually.\u201cFor the economy, it\u2019s steady as she goes, but for the markets, it\u2019s Goldilocks,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, referring to the not-too-hot, not-too-cold August payroll increase.Traders now assume a 30 percent chance of a rate increase when Fed policy makers meet in December, down from a 50 percent chance a few weeks ago. The Fed is set to meet later this month, but is not expected to raise rates.Like many economists, Mr. Slok does expect the Fed to move at the end of the year, even if market participants are betting otherwise. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign of inflation, which keeps the Federal Reserve on hold in terms of interest rate hikes, and it suggests stocks should keep doing well,\u201d Mr. Slok said.Clifford Krauss and Bill Vlasic contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Older Americans Stand to Lose if \u2018Dreamers\u2019 Are Deported", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move, Mr. Sheik said, would compound an already \u201cdisastrous situation in terms of shortages of supply.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is a big issue we\u2019re focusing on.\u201dIn health care, on the other hand, the economic impact could be significant, depriving patients of help they depend on and driving up costs for families and taxpayers.Surveys of DACA beneficiaries reveal that roughly one-fifth of them work in the health care and educational sector, suggesting a potential loss of tens of thousands of workers from in-demand job categories like home health aide and nursing assistant.At the same time, projections by the government and advocacy groups show that the economy will need to add hundreds of thousands of workers in these fields over the next five to 10 years simply to keep up with escalating demand, caused primarily by a rapidly aging population.Josue De Luna Navarro, a DACA beneficiary, came to the United States from Mexico when he was 9 years old. He became interested in a career in health care after his father nearly died from complications relating to heart disease.Now a 21-year-old senior at the University of New Mexico, Mr. Navarro works as a health assistant at a clinic in Albuquerque and plans to apply to medical school after he graduates.He worries that if DACA is revoked, he will not be able to work at all. \u201cWithout that work permit, my career in medicine will be very, very difficult,\u201d he said.Under the Obama-era program, recipients had to apply to renew their status every two years. The Trump administration said on Tuesday that some beneficiaries would be able to renew their status up until Oct. 5. Others could face deportation beginning in March, unless Congress intervenes beforehand.Experts say the effects of undoing the program could quickly ripple out from DACA beneficiaries to other workers.\u201cIt destabilizes that work force,\u201d said Robert Espinoza, vice president for policy at PHI, a group that advocates on behalf of personal care workers. \u201cIf you are seeing family members, children, neighbors being deported, threatened, and so on, the ability to be present on the job is undermined.\u201dThe health care field\u2019s reliance on immigrant labor makes it particularly vulnerable. According to census data Mr. Osterman analyzed, more than one-quarter of home health aides in 2015 were immigrants. The proportion in certain states is far higher, reaching nearly one-half in California and nearly two-thirds in New York.\u201cWe know from surveys that T.P.S. recipients are highly represented in the work force in certain areas,\u201d said Tom Jawetz, a vice president of the Center for American Progress, a think tank that favors more liberal immigration policies. \u201cIn particular, many \u2014 especially Haitians \u2014 work in home health care.\u201dThis may be welcome on some level: The department estimates that the typical home health aide made less than $25,000 in 2016, for a job that can be physically and emotionally grueling.The economic problem is twofold, however. First, the government, through Medicaid, often pays the salaries of home health workers, meaning that escalating wages could blow a hole in the federal budget. (Medicaid, through the decisions of the state and federal governments, effectively caps compensation for home health workers, but the caps could rise more quickly in a world of plunging labor supply.)Second, an acute shortage of home health workers could force many older and disabled Americans out of their homes and into care facilities, where costs are roughly two-to-three times the cost of home care for a full year. The government typically picks up that tab as well.Still, it is the personal toll that may be greatest: A patient\u2019s quality of life tends to be far higher when they can continue living in their own home.For patients and families who rely on immigrant workers, \u201cif that person is gone, can\u2019t get renewed, it\u2019s not a cute thing,\u201d Professor Osterman said. \u201cA home health aide is what lets you stay at home.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Catalonia Showdown Tests Spanish Leader\u2019s Instinct for Survival", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is the great survivor of Spanish politics. He has withstood electoral defeats, a banking bailout and party corruption scandals, not by demonstrating political boldness but rather by being cautious and often waiting for others to fail.\u201cRajoy has always shown the phlegmatic approach of a clever administrator rather than the vision of a great political leader,\u201d said Josep Ramoneda, a political columnist and philosopher. \u201cBut I think he is now going to pay a high price for his inactivity and unwillingness to take charge of this issue and for believing instead that Catalonia was a problem that would somehow die on its own.\u201dAlmost immediately, roughly 40,000 people poured into the streets in protest. Catalan leaders suggested that Mr. Rajoy was taking the country back to the dark days of Franco and fascism.\u201cThe Spanish government has overstepped the red line that separated it from authoritarian and repressive regimes,\u201d said Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan leader, after the arrests on Wednesday.Those detained were eventually released, but they are expected to be charged with civil disobedience and the misuse of public funds to organize an illegal vote. On Friday, the Spanish government announced that it would send more police officers to Catalonia to maintain order and block a referendum; additional officers are being billeted in ferries off the Catalan coast. And over the weekend, Madrid announced that it would centralize the command of all police operations in Catalonia, including the region\u2019s autonomous police force.There is disagreement over who is responsible for the escalation of the conflict. But there is a growing consensus in Madrid that Mr. Rajoy missed opportunities to negotiate with Catalonia\u2019s leaders and also to take advantage of the political divisions within the autonomous region. Instead, his critics said, he stonewalled the Catalans, who were initially more focused on issues of money than of sovereignty.Mr. Rajoy has years of experience in negotiating with Catalans. In 1996, he was among the leaders of the conservative Popular Party who traveled to Barcelona to strike an agreement with their Catalan counterparts to allow Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar to become prime minister of Spain.In his autobiography, Mr. Rajoy said the Catalan deal opened \u201cone of the most brilliant periods in the recent history of contemporary Spain.\u201dBut in 2012, in the midst of Spain\u2019s banking crisis, Mr. Rajoy rejected a request from Catalonia\u2019s regional government to negotiate better fiscal terms for a region that accounts for almost a fifth of Spain\u2019s economy. The leadership of the main conservative party of Catalonia then joined the drive to split from Spain.Five years later, Catalan leaders are saying that they are no longer interested in tax concessions but want to manage their own state. The separatists hold most of the seats in their regional parliament (without having won a majority of votes). Opinion polls show support for independence waning, but a majority in favor of voting over Catalonia\u2019s future.\u201cRajoy\u2019s focus has always been on keeping the loyalty of his own electorate, based on the rule of law but now also with the use of more force in Catalonia,\u201d said Jaime Pastor, a Madrid-based professor of politics at UNED, a distance-learning university. \u201cThat can perhaps help keep him in power in the short term, but it can only deepen the territorial fracture of Spain.\u201dIndeed, Spain\u2019s main opposition Socialist party, which had backed Mr. Rajoy\u2019s stance toward Catalonia, now appears less certain in its support.On Tuesday, Margarita Robles, the party\u2019s parliamentary spokeswoman, criticized Mr. Rajoy for relying on purely legal rather than political tools to confront the separatists. She asked him to clarify exactly what emergency steps the government was willing to apply in Catalonia.\u201cThe Socialists are caught between wanting to be seen as a solution for Catalonia and wanting to use this conflict as the opportunity to remove Rajoy,\u201d Mr. Ramoneda, the columnist, said.Analysts say Mr. Rajoy had no choice but to toughen his stance. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Rajoy or someone else in charge, nobody can allow separatists to dynamite the rule of law,\u201d said C\u00e9sar D\u00edaz-Carrera, a politics professor at the Complutense university in Madrid.In 2014, however, Catalonia\u2019s vote was nonbinding, and Mr. Rajoy held a parliamentary majority, which meant his political survival was not on the line.Even as Mr. Rajoy faces criticism from the Socialists, he is under pressure from hard-liners within his own Popular Party, who want him to activate emergency powers to take full administrative control over Catalonia, rather than use piecemeal steps to stop Catalans from financing and organizing their referendum.Mr. Rajoy\u2019s administration is also reliant on the support of lawmakers from Ciudadanos, a party that was initially started in Catalonia in opposition to the separatist movement.While Mr. Rajoy might have squandered previous opportunities to negotiate an end to the Catalan conflict, he is now at least giving a \u201cmeasured response\u201d to separatists who are willing to violate Spanish law, according to Luis Garicano, a leading member of Ciudadanos.\u201cI don\u2019t think any state in Europe or the United States would accept somebody preparing a unilateral declaration of independence without reacting against that,\u201d Mr. Garicano said. \u201cHe is at least keeping the demons of nationalism under control, while the Catalan separatists are unleashing forces that they cannot control.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Suddenly, Chinese companies are racing to snap up all things Bollywood \u2014 partnerships and distribution rights, but also Indian directors and screenwriters. And that has led to some unease.But more and more, the two Asian giants are also competing to project soft power \u2014 or cultural influence \u2014 outside their borders. And \u201cDangal\u201d has revived concerns in China that it is falling behind.\u201cChina\u2019s development has been very comprehensive in terms of politics, economics and military,\u201d said Jiang Jingkui, director of the Southeast Asian Research Institute at Peking University.\u201cBut in terms of soft power, India has done better than China,\u201d Mr. Jiang said. \u201cAlthough India\u2019s economy is not as developed, they have put a huge emphasis on promoting their culture, including things like Buddhist traditions and yoga.\u201dChina\u2019s anxieties about India are colored to an extent by widespread stereotyping. People here often invoke India as an example for why China, with its even larger population, is not ready for democracy.Some call Indians \u201ca-san,\u201d a derogatory term that was once used to refer to the Sikh guards who worked in Shanghai\u2019s British settlement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In more recent years, the public perception of India has largely been shaped by Chinese state media, which tends to highlight stories on India\u2019s caste system and the treatment of women in Indian society.Even today, the word that most often comes up in discussions about India is luan \u2014 or chaos.\u201cThere\u2019s a perception among Chinese that India is dirty and unsafe,\u201d said Tansen Sen, a history professor at New York University Shanghai. \u201cEven though Indian movies have been popular, Chinese tourists still don\u2019t go to India. They would rather go to Sri Lanka or Nepal.\u201dIndians, for their part, are also less than enthusiastic about China. Ever since 1962, when the two countries engaged in a brief but bloody border war, India has been highly suspicious of China and its intentions.\u201cThe newspapers in India all tend to reinforce the same view,\u201d said Mr. Sen, who was born in India and moved to China at the age of 14. \u201cThat is: The Chinese cannot be trusted.\u201dSome have come out in defense of the Chinese film industry, arguing that it is still relatively young. But the discussion around \u201cDangal\u201d came at a time when many Chinese are expressing concerns that their film industry \u2014 in its quest to catch up with Hollywood \u2014 has become too narrowly focused on profit and entertainment over quality and substance.\u201cIn China, the decisions are made by the people who have money,\u201d said Gu Wancheng, senior vice president at Peacock Mountain Films, which specializes in Chinese and Indian collaborations. \u201cBut these people typically don\u2019t have a feeling for a good story. They would rather invest in big stars or special effects.\u201dPerhaps going back to basics and taking lessons from Bollywood, some say, could mitigate that problem.\u201cIn Bollywood it\u2019s different,\u201d Ms. Gu added. \u201cPeople there have the self-confidence to say that \u2018we can tell this story well.\u2019\u201dKaroline Kan contributed research.Advertisement"}

A likable wastrel takes up with a beautiful woman, who offers him the choice of leaping from a precipice to his death or being licked by a pig, as ultimately happens. A father trudges a great distance, with his blind son on his back, only to discover the child is a man he murdered 100 years before. A dying woman asks a man to bury her and wait 100 years for her return \u2014 as a white lily.The concept is intriguing, and there is much to admire in this production: Mimi Lien\u2019s set design, Oana Botez\u2019s costumes and Raja Feather Kelly\u2019s choreography. But Tuce Yasak\u2019s lighting design, while sometimes evocative, often assaulted eyes that had grown used to darkness.Still, there is a fundamental problem for anyone familiar with Soseki\u2019s feather-light \u201cTen Nights\u2019 Dreams,\u201d with its quintessential economy of language and evanescent images. To add music and try to tease out a plot is to weigh down the original and make it earthbound. Some scenes dragged on too long.And for anyone not familiar with Soseki, Mr. Osada\u2019s English libretto was probably hard to follow in the absence of projected titles, which might have made a nice substitute for some of the lighting gimmicks. Though much of the text setting was almost recitative-like in nature and easily understood when solo singing was involved, some of the words were lost in long, flowing lines, like those by the fine lyric soprano Marisa Karchin in the final scene.Others were covered by competing voices or the brilliant orchestration. And that orchestration was compelling in itself, so effective in setting a mood that it was almost easier at times to see the work as a four-movement symphony with voices rather than a four-act opera supported by an orchestra.In any case, it was splendidly performed by the Japanese players and a small vocal cast. Makoto Winkler, after a tentative start amid manic lighting effects, was impressive as the samurai. Christopher Sokolowski, in the father\u2019s measured plod around the auditorium, sang with solid, attractive tone; Jesse Malgieri was a winsome idler, and Gloria Park striking as his tormentor.In all, this was a refreshingly original take on Western opera, notable for its daring concept, however flawed in the execution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christine Todd Whitman: How Not to Run the E.P.A.", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorI have been worried about how the Environmental Protection Agency would be run ever since President Trump appointed Scott Pruitt, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, to oversee it. The past few months have confirmed my fears. The agency created by a Republican president 47 years ago to protect the environment and public health may end up doing neither under Mr. Pruitt\u2019s direction.As a Republican appointed by President George W. Bush to run the agency, I can hardly be written off as part of the liberal resistance to the new administration. But the evidence is abundant of the dangerous political turn of an agency that is supposed to be guided by science.A broad consensus of scientists also warn of the influence of the warming climate on extreme weather events. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the enormous wildfires in the Western United States and widespread flooding from monsoons in Southeast Asia are potent reminders of the cost of ignoring climate science.As a Republican like Mr. Pruitt, I too embrace the promise of the free market and worry about the perils of overregulation. But decisions must be based on reliable science. The red team begins with his politically preferred conclusion that climate change isn\u2019t a problem, and it will seek evidence to justify that position. That\u2019s the opposite of how science works. True science follows the evidence. The critical tests of peer review and replication ensure that the consensus is sound. Government bases policy on those results. This applies to liberals and conservatives alike.There are two sides, at least, to most political questions, and a politician\u2019s impulse may be to believe that the same holds true for science. Certainly, there are disputes in science. But on the question of climate change, the divide is stark. On one side is the overwhelming consensus of thousands of scientists at universities, research centers and the government who publish in peer-reviewed literature, are cited regularly by fellow scientists and are certain that humans are contributing to climate change.The red-team idea is a waste of the government\u2019s time, energy and resources, and a slap in the face to fiscal responsibility and responsible governance. Sending scientists on a wild-goose chase so that Mr. Pruitt, Rick Perry, the energy secretary, who has endorsed this approach, and President Trump can avoid acknowledging and acting on the reality of climate change is simply unjustifiable. And truly, it ignores and distracts from the real imperative: developing solutions that create good jobs, grow our economy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of climate change.Policy should always be rooted in unbiased science. The E.P.A. is too important to treat like a reality TV show. People\u2019s lives and our country\u2019s resources are at stake.

{"Headline": "Facebook Faces a New World as Officials Rein In a Wild Web", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a muggy, late spring evening, Tuan Pham awoke to the police storming his house in Hanoi, Vietnam.They marched him to a police station and made their demand: Hand over your Facebook password. Mr. Tuan, a computer engineer, had recently written a poem on the social network called \u201cMother\u2019s Lullaby,\u201d which criticized how the communist country was run.One line read, \u201cOne century has passed, we are still poor and hungry, do you ask why?\u201dThe diplomatic game that unfolded in Vietnam has become increasingly common for Facebook. The internet is Balkanizing, and the world\u2019s largest tech companies have had to dispatch envoys to, in effect, contain the damage such divisions pose to their ambitions.As nations try to grab back power online, a clash is brewing between governments and companies. Some of the biggest companies in the world \u2014 Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba among them \u2014 are finding they need to play by an entirely new set of rules on the once-anarchic internet.And it\u2019s not just one new set of rules. According to a review by The New York Times, more than 50 countries have passed laws over the last five years to gain greater control over how their people use the web.\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s a grand power struggle,\u201d said David Reed, an early pioneer of the internet and a former professor at the M.I.T. Media Lab. \u201cGovernments started waking up as soon as a significant part of their powers of communication of any sort started being invaded by companies.\u201dFacebook encapsulates the reasons for the internet\u2019s fragmentation \u2014 and increasingly, its consequences.The company has become so far-reaching that more than two billion people \u2014 about a quarter of the world\u2019s population \u2014 now use Facebook each month. Internet users (excluding China) spend one in five minutes online within the Facebook universe, according to comScore, a research firm. And Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, wants that dominance to grow.The Silicon Valley giant\u2019s tussle with the fracturing internet is poised to escalate. Facebook has now reached almost everyone who already has some form of internet access, excluding China. Capturing those last users \u2014 including in Asian nations like Vietnam and African countries like Kenya \u2014 may involve more government roadblocks.\u201cWe understand that and accept that our ideals are not everyone\u2019s,\u201d said Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of communications and public policy. \u201cBut when you look at the data and truly listen to the people around the world who rely on our service, it\u2019s clear that we do a much better job of bringing people together than polarizing them.\u201dBy mid-2016, a yearslong campaign by Facebook to get into China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest internet market \u2014 appeared to be sputtering.At a White House dinner in 2015, Mr. Zuckerberg had even asked the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whether Mr. Xi might offer a Chinese name for his soon-to-be-born first child \u2014 usually a privilege reserved for older relatives, or sometimes a fortune teller. Mr. Xi declined, according to a person briefed on the matter.But all those efforts flopped, foiling Facebook\u2019s attempts to crack one of the most isolated pockets of the internet.China has blocked Facebook and Twitter since mid-2009, after an outbreak of ethnic rioting in the western part of the country. In recent years, similar barriers have gone up for Google services and other apps, like Line and Instagram.For all the courtship, things never quite worked out.\u201cThere\u2019s an interest on both sides of the dance, so some kind of product can be introduced,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google in China who now runs a venture-capital firm in Beijing. \u201cBut what Facebook wants is impossible, and what they can have may not be very meaningful.\u201dOne factor driving Mr. Zuckerberg may be the brisk ad business that Facebook does from its Hong Kong offices, where the company helps Chinese companies \u2014 and the government\u2019s own propaganda organs \u2014 spread their messages. In fact, the scale of the Chinese government\u2019s use of Facebook to communicate abroad offers a notable sign of Beijing\u2019s understanding of Facebook\u2019s power to mold public opinion.Chinese state media outlets have used ad buys to spread propaganda around key diplomatic events. Its stodgy state-run television station and the party mouthpiece newspaper each have far more Facebook \u201clikes\u201d than popular Western news brands like CNN and Fox News, a likely indication of big ad buys.Fittingly, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s eagerness and China\u2019s reluctance can be tracked on Facebook.Last summer, emails winged back and forth between members of Facebook\u2019s global policy team. They were finalizing plans, more than two years in the making, for WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook had bought in 2014, to start sharing data on its one billion users with its new parent company. The company planned to use the data to tailor ads on Facebook\u2019s other services and to stop spam on WhatsApp.A big issue: how to win over wary regulators around the world.By late October, all 28 of Europe\u2019s national data-protection authorities jointly called on Facebook to stop the practice. Facebook quietly mothballed its plans in Europe. It has continued to collect people\u2019s information elsewhere, including the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing awareness that people\u2019s data is controlled by large American actors,\u201d said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France\u2019s privacy regulator. \u201cThese actors now know that times have changed.\u201dFacebook\u2019s retreat shows how Europe is effectively employing regulations \u2014 including tough privacy rules \u2014 to control how parts of the internet are run.The goal of European regulators, officials said, is to give users greater control over the data from social media posts, online searches and purchases that Facebook and other tech giants rely on to monitor our online habits.As a tech company whose ad business requires harvesting digital information, Facebook has often underestimated the deep emotions that European officials and citizens have tied into the collection of such details. That dates back to the time of the Cold War, when many Europeans were routinely monitored by secret police.Now, regulators from Colombia to Japan are often mimicking Europe\u2019s stance on digital privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural European regulators would be at the forefront,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer. \u201cIt reflects the importance they\u2019ve attached to the privacy agenda.\u201dIn interviews, Facebook denied it has played fast and loose with users\u2019 online information and said it complies with national rules wherever it operates. It questioned whether Europe\u2019s position has been effective in protecting individuals\u2019 privacy at a time when the region continues to fall behind the United States and China in all things digital.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the German government is a strong voice inside the European community,\u201d said Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. \u201cWe find their directness pretty helpful.\u201dEurope has the law on its side when dictating global privacy. Facebook\u2019s non-North American users, roughly 1.8 billion people, are primarily overseen by Ireland\u2019s privacy regulator because the company\u2019s international headquarters is in Dublin, mostly for tax reasons. In 2012, Facebook was forced to alter its global privacy settings \u2014 including those in the United States \u2014 after Ireland\u2019s data protection watchdog found problems while auditing the company\u2019s operations there.And on Sept. 12, Spain\u2019s privacy agency fined the company 1.2 million euros for not giving people sufficient control over their data when Facebook collected it from third-party websites. Watchdogs in Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere are conducting similar investigations. Facebook is appealing the Spanish ruling.\u201cFacebook simply can\u2019t stick to a one-size-fits-all product around the world,\u201d said Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who has been a Facebook critic after filing the case that eventually overturned the 15-year-old data deal.Potentially more worrying for Facebook is how Europe\u2019s view of privacy is being exported. Countries from Brazil to Malaysia, which are crucial to Facebook\u2019s growth, have incorporated many of Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules into their legislation.\u201cWe regard the European directives as best practice,\u201d said Pansy Tlakula, chairwoman of South Africa\u2019s Information Regulator, the country\u2019s data protection agency. South Africa has gone so far as to copy whole sections, almost word-for-word, from Europe\u2019s rule book.Blocked in China and troubled by regulators in Europe, Facebook is trying to become \u201cthe internet\u201d in Africa. Helping get people online, subsidizing access, and trying to launch satellites to beam the internet down to the markets it covets, Facebook has become a dominant force on a continent rapidly getting online.But that has given it a power that has made some in Africa uncomfortable.Some countries have blocked access, and outsiders have complained Facebook could squelch rival online business initiatives. Its competition with other internet companies from the United States and China has drawn comparisons to a bygone era of colonialism.For Kenyans like Phyl Cherop, 33, an entrepreneur in Nairobi, online life is already dominated by the social network. She abandoned her bricks-and-mortar store in a middle-class part of the city in 2015 to sell on Facebook and WhatsApp.\u201cI gave it up because people just didn\u2019t come anymore,\u201d said Ms. Cherop, who sells items like designer dresses and school textbooks. She added that a stand-alone website would not have the same reach. \u201cI prefer using Facebook because that\u2019s where my customers are. The first thing people want to do when they buy a smartphone is to open a Facebook account.\u201dAs Facebook hunts for more users, the company\u2019s aspirations have shifted to emerging economies where people like Ms. Cherop live. Less than 50 percent of Africa\u2019s population has internet connectivity, and regulation is often rudimentary.The company has struck partnerships with local carriers to offer basic internet services \u2014 centered on those offered by Facebook \u2014 for free. It has built a pared-down version of its social network to run on the cheaper, less powerful phones that are prevalent there.Facebook is also investing tens of millions of dollars alongside telecom operators to build a 500-mile fiber-optic internet connection in rural Uganda. In total, it is working with about 30 regional governments on digital projects.\u201cWe want to bring connectivity to the world,\u201d said Jay Parikh, a Facebook vice president for engineering who oversees the company\u2019s plans to use drones, satellites and other technology to connect the developing world.Facebook has already hit some bumps in its African push. Chad blocked access to Facebook and other sites during elections or political protests. Uganda also took legal action in Irish courts to force the social network to name an anonymous blogger who had been critical of the government. Those efforts failed.In Kenya, one of Africa\u2019s most connected countries, there has been less pushback.Facebook expanded its efforts in the country of 48 million in 2014. It teamed up with Airtel Africa, a mobile operator, to roll out Facebook\u2019s Free Basics \u2014 a no-fee version of the social network, with access to certain news, health, job and other services there and in more than 20 other countries worldwide. In Kenya, the average person has a budget of just 30 cents a day to spend on internet access.Still, Facebook\u2019s plans have not always worked out. Many Kenyans with access to Free Basics rely on it only as a backup when their existing smartphone credit runs out.\u201cFree Basics? I don\u2019t really use it that often,\u201d said Victor Odinga, 27, an accountant in downtown Nairobi. \u201cNo one wants to be seen as someone who can\u2019t afford to get online.\u201dAn article on Monday about the effect on Facebook and other technology companies of government efforts around the world to regulate online activity misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Allen.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, Mark Scott from Nairobi, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Constitution Wasn\u2019t Built for This", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionExactly 230 years ago, on Sept. 17, 1787, a group of men in Philadelphia concluded a summer of sophisticated, impassioned debates about the fate of their fledgling nation. The document that emerged, our Constitution, is often thought of as part of an aristocratic counterrevolution that stands in contrast to the democratic revolution of 1776. But our Constitution has at least one radical feature: It isn\u2019t designed for a society with economic inequality.There are other things the Constitution wasn\u2019t written for, of course. The founders didn\u2019t foresee America becoming a global superpower. They didn\u2019t plan for the internet or nuclear weapons. And they certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined a former reality television star president. Commentators wring their hands over all of these transformations \u2014 though these days, they tend to focus on whether this country\u2019s founding document can survive the current president.But there is a different, and far more stubborn, risk that our country faces \u2014 and which, arguably, led to the TV star turned president in the first place. Our Constitution was not built for a country with so much wealth concentrated at the very top nor for the threats that invariably accompany it: oligarchs and populist demagogues.From the ancient Greeks to the American founders, statesmen and political philosophers were obsessed with the problem of economic inequality. Unequal societies were subject to constant strife \u2014 even revolution. The rich would tyrannize the poor, and the poor would revolt against the rich.The solution was to build economic class right into the structure of government. In England, for example, the structure of government balanced lords and commoners. In ancient Rome, there was the patrician Senate for the wealthy, and the Tribune of the Plebeians for everyone else. We can think of these as class-warfare constitutions: Each class has a share in governing, and a check on the other. Those checks prevent oligarchy on the one hand and a tyranny founded on populist demagogy on the other.What is surprising about the design of our Constitution is that it isn\u2019t a class warfare constitution. Our Constitution doesn\u2019t mandate that only the wealthy can become senators, and we don\u2019t have a tribune of the plebs. Our founding charter doesn\u2019t have structural checks and balances between economic classes: not between rich and poor, and certainly not between corporate interests and ordinary workers. This was a radical change in the history of constitutional government.At the time, many Americans believed the new nation would not be afflicted by the problems that accompanied economic inequality because there simply wasn\u2019t much inequality within the political community of white men. Today we tend to emphasize how undemocratic the founding era was when judged by our values \u2014 its exclusion of women, enslavement of African-Americans, violence against Native Americans. But in doing so, we risk missing something important: Many in the founding generation believed America was exceptional because of the extraordinary degree of economic equality within the political community as they defined it.Unlike Europe, America wasn\u2019t bogged down by the legacy of feudalism, nor did it have a hereditary aristocracy. Noah Webster, best known for his dictionary, commented that there were \u201csmall inequalities of property,\u201d a fact that distinguished America from Europe and the rest of the world. Equality of property, he believed, was crucial for sustaining a republic. During the Constitutional Convention, South Carolinan Charles Pinckney said America had \u201ca greater equality than is to be found among the people of any other country.\u201d As long as the new nation could expand west, he thought, it would be possible to have a citizenry of independent yeoman farmers. In a community with economic equality, there was simply no need for constitutional structures to manage the clash between the wealthy and everyone else.The problem, of course, is that economic inequality has been on the rise for at least the last generation. In 1976 the richest 1 percent of Americans took home about 8.5 percent of our national income. Today they take home more than 20 percent. In major sectors of the economy \u2014 banking, airlines, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications \u2014 economic power is increasingly concentrated in a small number of companies.While much of the debate has been on the moral or economic consequences of economic inequality, the more fundamental problem is that our constitutional system might not survive in an unequal economy. Campaign contributions, lobbying, the revolving door of industry insiders working in government, interest group influence over regulators and even think tanks \u2014 all of these features of our current political system skew policy making to favor the wealthy and entrenched economic interests. \u201cThe rich will strive to establish their dominion and enslave the rest,\u201d Gouverneur Morris observed in 1787. \u201cThey always did. They always will.\u201d An oligarchy \u2014 not a republic \u2014 is the inevitable result.As a republic descends into an oligarchy, the people revolt. Populist revolts are rarely anarchic; they require leadership. Morris predicted that the rich would take advantage of the people\u2019s \u201cpassions\u201d and \u201cmake these the instruments for oppressing them.\u201d The future Broadway sensation Alexander Hamilton put it more clearly: \u201cOf those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people: commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.\u201dStarting more than a century ago, amid the first Gilded Age, Americans confronted rising inequality, rapid industrial change, a communications and transportation revolution and the emergence of monopolies. Populists and progressives responded by pushing for reforms that would tame the great concentrations of wealth and power that were corrupting government.On the economic side, they invented antitrust laws and public utilities regulation, established an income tax, and fought for minimum wages. On the political side, they passed campaign finance regulations and amended the Constitution so the people would get to elect senators directly. They did these things because they knew that our republican form of government could not survive in an economically unequal society. As Theodore Roosevelt wrote, \u201cThere can be no real political democracy unless there is something approaching an economic democracy.\u201dWith economic inequality rising and the middle class collapsing, the deep question we must ask today is whether our generation has wise patriots who, like the progressives a century ago, will adapt the institutions and laws of our country \u2014 and save our republic.Ganesh Sitaraman, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, is the author of \u201cThe Crisis of the Middle-Class Constitution: Why Economic Inequality Threatens Our Republic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canada Letter: The Land Where Trade Talks Make Headlines", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week the roadshow to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement made its way to Ottawa. Although the city was suffering through an exceptional September heat wave, the Canadian government offered school buses that lacked air conditioning to shuttle government officials and reporters to and from the site hosting the talks.Among those reporters, although she avoided the overheated buses, was Ana Swanson who joined The Times\u2019s Washington bureau as its trade reporter earlier this month. Here are some of her thoughts about the trip:Oh, to be a trade reporter in Canada. I crossed over the border this week to a place where the renegotiation of Nafta is front-page news, and people appear to understand \u2013 and to be interested in \u2014 countervailing duties. In the United States, which initiated this vast shuffling of bureaucrats from North American capital to North American capital, trade tends to take a back seat to other policy and political issues.Chrystia Freeland, the foreign affairs minister, said this week that all Canadians are becoming trade experts. Chad Bown, a trade expert I often talk to at the Peterson Institution for International Economics, retweeted that comment with an amendment: \u201cMy only disagreement is on her verb tense. In my experience, all Canadians a good time ago somehow became amazing trade experts.\u201dThe somehow, of course, is having an economy that is so dependent on trade, and being on the receiving end of many United States trade actions. Another came Tuesday as the United States ruled in favor of a trade complaint by Boeing and imposed large duties on Bombardier\u2019s new CSeries jet.The Bombardier ruling added tension to Nafta talks, and while discussions were cordial, you could feel the frustration beginning to bubble under the surface. One of the main irritants is that while the United States has discussed President Trump\u2019s more ambitious proposals for renegotiating Nafta, it hasn\u2019t yet put forth concrete text detailing them.\u201cWithout a formal position tabled, we can\u2019t respond to it,\u201d Ms. Freeland said at the end of the session. Robert Lighthizer, the United States Trade Representative, blamed the delays an especially lengthy review process in Washington.There is a long road ahead for negotiators, who were already looking a bit rumpled and weary. At least there should be plenty of work for trade reporters.Nearly 30 years after it made Julia Roberts a star, the film \u201cPretty Woman\u201d is making its way to a stage on Broadway. The stage version of the rich guy, poor girl romance has a Canadian connection: Bryan Adams is co-writing its music.Mr. Adams was born in Kingston, Ontario, but is most closely associated with Vancouver, British Columbia, where his career in soft rock began.Nellie Bowles spoke with Jim Watson, Ottawa\u2019s mayor, for an article looking at the sometimes peculiar methods that cities are using to get Mr. Bezos\u2019 attention. Mr. Watson also makes an appearance, strumming a guitar and with a rose clenched between his teeth, in an illustration for the piece.Ottawa is not the only Canadian contestant highlighted. Detroit is using its neighbor and my hometown, Windsor, Ontario, as part of its bid. Detroit\u2019s boosters are proposing that Amazon\u2019s second headquarters could span the Detroit River to take advantage of Canadian immigration rules that make it easier to hire tech talent.To address some emails I expect to receive: We\u2019re very aware that our events have been concentrated on Toronto, and we\u2019re actively working to bring them to other parts of the country soon.Advertisement"}

To survive the coming earthquake, he advises, you need to radically re-examine your plan for the future \u2014 and you need to learn Silicon Valley\u2019s ways rather than expect to defeat it.\u201cMost of you are screwed,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel,\u201d arguing that a coming revolution in robotics and artificial intelligence will eliminate millions of jobs and destroy the old ways of getting ahead in America. \u201cThe world is becoming controlled by the few, powerful, and clever people who know how to create those robots, or how to design the software and the tablet on which you\u2019re reading this.\u201dMr. Calacanis is not wholly optimistic about where all this change will lead. \u201cIn my mind, candidly, we\u2019ve got a 70 percent chance of figuring out this massive sea change without starting a full-on revolution in the streets, like we saw in Greece or Egypt, or any other place where unemployment among young adults breaks 20 percent,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dBe warned: One reason that Mr. Calacanis is willing to diagnose this economic ill is that he is also selling a prescription that he claims will alleviate it.His book is intended as a guide for getting into the business of investing in very young tech companies at their earliest stages, known as \u201cangel investing.\u201d Mr. Calacanis is peddling a kind of populist movement for investing \u2014 he wants doctors, lawyers and other wealthy people, and even some in the middle class, to bet on start-ups, which he says is the best way to prepare financially for tech change.\u201cI want to inspire 10,000 people to become full-time angel investors,\u201d he says.Financial advisers I spoke to were not won over by Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice. They called his method indistinguishable from gambling, and they warned that the potential gains were not worth the risks. Invest in start-ups with your \u201cfun money\u201d but not the money you are counting on for your future, advised Spencer Sherman, the founder of Abacus Wealth Partners.Even other tech investors aren\u2019t sold on Mr. Calacanis\u2019s movement. Hunter Walk, a partner at the seed-stage fund Homebrew, said ordinary investors would be better off putting their money into public tech giants rather than gambling on small firms. \u201cUnless you\u2019re willing to lose all your money, you shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Walk said.Mr. Calacanis genuinely believes that investing in start-ups is good advice; he has even offered his three children a chance to skip college and to use the tuition money on betting on start-ups. His 7-year-old daughter, he said, is leaning toward taking the deal.But like other recent populist movements, Mr. Calacanis\u2019s isn\u2019t without its apparent grifts. Mr. Calacanis runs a \u201csyndicate,\u201d a kind of investing club in which people co-invest their money alongside his bets. The book, he says, led to a surge in new investors on his syndicate \u2014 and if those investments pay off, Mr. Calacanis gets a 20 percent cut of his co-investors\u2019 returns.Not that he\u2019s shy about any of this. \u201cOf course, I plan to make a great deal of money in these revolutions,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dYou could call his attitude chutzpah, or you could call it hustle, which is a quality Mr. Calacanis has in spades. He grew up in a working-class family in Brooklyn and writes that he spent much of his youth wondering, \u201cWhat would it be like to be rich?\u201dHe got his start in the 1990s as a reporter covering the budding internet industry in New York. Later, he helped found Weblogs, one of the early digital media companies, which, in 2005, he sold to AOL for $30 million. Along the way, he made dozens of connections \u2014 he casually name-drops every big name in tech \u2014 and now, as an angel, he parlays those connections into \u201cdeal flow,\u201d getting early access to invest in the best start-ups.One charge against Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice is that his wins aren\u2019t widely replicable \u2014 not everyone can make a fortune off their friends\u2019 billion-dollar ideas, after all.But Mr. Calacanis isn\u2019t suggesting that people enter the angel business expecting to get rich quickly.\u201cLook, I\u2019m going to wind up being the GOAT,\u201d he said, using internet-speak for Greatest Of All Time. \u201cYou don\u2019t read a book by Michael Jordan or LeBron James and expect to start playing basketball like Michael Jordan or LeBron James.\u201dInstead, he outlines a careful and systematic approach for newcomers to the angel business. He said people should start slowly, first as part of syndicates like his. Those deals will help newbie investors get exposed to other investors and tech founders, which will bring them access to bigger and better deals. He said repeatedly that this would take time and effort \u2014 people should be willing to spend 20 hours a week on their investments, and if they really want to hit it big, they should be willing to move to Silicon Valley.And he is frank about the risks. The book begins with an all-caps disclaimer warning, \u201cDON\u2019T READ THIS BOOK IF YOU CAN\u2019T HANDLE LOSING YOUR MONEY INVESTING IN THE RISKIEST ASSET CLASS ON THE PLANET: START-UPS.\u201dBut to Mr. Calacanis, the risks are worth taking. The world seems to have lost its moorings; it\u2019s changing in ways that none of us can predict anymore.So shouldn\u2019t you do something big? As Mr. Calacanis argues: \u201cNo gamble, no future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lobbyists Rally to Save Tax Breaks Under Threat in Trump Plan", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans\u2019 release of a sweeping plan to rewrite the tax code has set off a scramble among Washington lobbyists and trade groups to protect valuable tax breaks and other long-ingrained provisions.The plan\u2019s scant details make it hard to know what, exactly, is on the chopping block. But within hours of the plan\u2019s unveiling on Wednesday, flash points emerged over measures that supporters said could hurt the housing market, raise borrowing costs and increase the tax burden on families in high-tax states.The response put Trump administration officials on the defensive as they embark on a campaign to sell the plan.\u201cThe lobbyists shouldn\u2019t have input, but the people in Congress should have input, and we\u2019ll be working with them closely as we turn this into a bill and get it to the president to sign this year,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Fox Business Network on Thursday.Opposition from the real estate industry was swift and vocal, with trade groups strongly criticizing elements of the plan that they say will make home-buying less attractive and weaken the housing market. While the plan specifically calls for preserving the mortgage interest deduction, real estate agents are warning that a proposal to double the standard deduction will make taxpayers less likely to itemize their tax returns and claim the mortgage deduction.The deduction is a key incentive for people to buy homes, since it reduces their taxable income by the amount of interest paid on a mortgage. Real estate agents worry that doubling the standard deduction may provide a richer tax break than itemizing and claiming the mortgage deduction.\u201cWe have always said that tax reform \u2014 a worthy endeavor \u2014 should first do no harm to homeowners,\u201d said William E. Brown, president of the National Association of Realtors.A proposal to limit the deductibility of corporate interest has prompted jockeying among powerful groups that rely on debt to help finance their operations, including real estate companies, private equity firms, financial companies and other businesses.The Build Coalition, a group of associations from the telecommunications, manufacturing and agriculture industries that formed to protect the corporate interest provision, warned that Republicans would be acting counter to their promise to spur business investment by following through on the proposal. Businesses that rely heavily on debt to finance their investments will see costs go up, they say, driving down profitability, investment and job creation.\u201cAltering that would make it more difficult for American companies to compete in the global economy and harm job creation and long-term economic growth,\u201d said Mac O\u2019Brien, a spokesman for the group. \u201cFortunately, the discussion on tax reform is far from over.\u201dSimilar concerns are emanating from Wall Street, with the American Bankers Association warning that a limitation on borrowers\u2019 ability to deduct interest expenses could \u201cadversely impact economic growth.\u201dRepublicans have only slightly tipped their hand as to the overall structure of the tax rewrite. The plan would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and create a new 25 percent tax rate for \u201cpass through\u201d businesses such as partnerships, sole proprietorships and family farms.It would also lower the top individual tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, while raising the bottom rate to 12 percent from 10 percent as it also doubles the standard deduction. The plan would eliminate many corporate \u201cloopholes\u201d and deductions, such as the state and local tax deduction. But it would also get rid of many provisions that are currently costly to the rich, like the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.The most politically fraught proposal is eliminating the state and local tax deduction, which allows taxpayers who itemize to write off their property, state and local taxes. The measure is particularly prized in blue states with high property taxes, but is also widely used in some Republican districts in Virginia, New Jersey and California.Eliminating the deduction, which the real estate industry also opposes, would save more than $1 trillion over a decade and make room for the tax cuts. But Republican members of Congress in affected states have already expressed concern about the provision, and a plan that repeals the deduction could be impossible to pass.\u201cThe state and local tax piece is very concerning, because we\u2019re already a donor state to Washington, and this would exacerbate that problem,\u201d said Representative John J. Faso, Republican of New York, referring to the amount the state pays in taxes. \u201cAnd so I want to see \u2014 based on income categories \u2014 how a hypothetical family of four with a certain amount of income, with a $8,000 property tax and state income tax bill, how they are affected.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, also expressed doubt on Thursday that the deduction would die easily.The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.\u201cThat\u2019s been a long-heralded and expected set of tax rules, and it\u2019s really, really tough to change that,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Changes to core components of the tax plan could force Republicans to slim down the size of the tax cuts.\u201cRepublicans from high-taxed states are, in our view, unlikely to go along with the elimination of the SALT deduction,\u201d said Brian Gardner, an analyst at the investment banking company Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, referring to the state and local tax deduction. \u201cKeeping the SALT deduction, or even merely reducing it, would ultimately result in smaller tax cuts or a larger budget deficit, which we think would be a tough sell to congressional budget hawks.\u201d\u201cOur No. 1 concern is that this delivers massive, massive tax cuts to millionaires and corporations,\u201d said Michael Linden, an adviser to the progressive Not One Penny campaign, which is fighting to make sure the tax overhaul is not a boon for the rich.The group, which includes liberal organizations such as MoveOn, Tax March and the Working Families Party, has already spent more than $1 million advertising in congressional districts across the country to urge lawmakers from both parties to oppose tax cuts for the rich, and it expects to become more active.\u201cWe\u2019ll be ramping it up,\u201d Mr. Linden added. \u201cThis campaign has been bubbling below the surface for the last several months, but now it\u2019s going to take center stage.\u201dFor its part, the Trump administration is maintaining that surging economic growth produced by the tax cuts will prevent the plan from adding to the deficit, and that it will benefit middle-class families.However, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser acknowledged in an interview with ABC News that it was too soon to make promises. It remains possible that some middle-class families could see their tax bills increase under the plan.\u201cThere\u2019s an exception to every rule,\u201d said Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee anything. You can always find a unique family somewhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Did Marriage Become a Mark of Privilege?", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClass DivideMarriage, which used to be the default way to form a family in the United States, regardless of income or education, has become yet another part of American life reserved for those who are most privileged.Fewer Americans are marrying over all, and whether they do so is more tied to socioeconomic status than ever before. In recent years, marriage has sharply declined among people without college degrees, while staying steady among college graduates with higher incomes.In 1990, more than half of adults were married, with much less difference based on class and education: 51 percent of poor adults, 57 percent of working-class adults and 65 percent of middle- and upper-class adults were married.A big reason for the decline: Unemployed men are less likely to be seen as marriage material.\u201cWomen don\u2019t want to take a risk on somebody who\u2019s not going to be able to provide anything,\u201d said Sharon Sassler, a sociologist at Cornell who published \u201cCohabitation Nation: Gender, Class, and the Remaking of Relationships\u201d with Amanda Jayne Miller last month.As marriage has declined, though, childbearing has not, which means that more children are living in families without two parents and the resources they bring.\u201cThe sharpest distinction in American family life is between people with a bachelor\u2019s or not,\u201d said Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins and author of \u201cLabor\u2019s Love Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Working-Class Family in America.\u201dThe research brief defined \u201cworking class\u201d as adults with an adjusted family income between the 20th and 50th percentiles, with high school diplomas but not bachelor\u2019s degrees. Poor is defined as those below the 20th percentile or without high school diplomas, and the middle and upper class as those above the 50th percentile or with college degrees.College graduates are more likely to plot their lives methodically \u2014 vetting people they date until they\u2019re sure they want to move in with them, and using birth control to delay childbirth until their careers are underway.Less educated people are more likely to move in with boyfriends or girlfriends in a matter of months, and to get pregnant at a younger age and before marriage. This can make financial and family stability harder to achieve later on.\u201cIt starts with moving in together quickly, for economic exigency reasons as opposed to relationship reasons,\u201d Ms. Sassler said. \u201cThen struggling with making ends meet and trying to manage this with a partner just elevates the challenges.\u201dLabor market changes made men less marriageable, they concluded. There were fewer available men, because unemployment was associated with a rise in incarceration or mortality from drugs and alcohol. The men who were left were less desirable, because they lacked income and were more likely to drink to excess or use drugs.Researchers found a corresponding increase in births to unmarried mothers. The decline in marriage was not offset by more couples living together.\u201cA bad economy lowers the cost of having bad values \u2014 substance abuse, engaging in crime, not looking for a job right away,\u201d said Gordon Hanson, an economist at the University of California, San Diego, who wrote the paper with David Autor of M.I.T. and David Dorn of the University of Zurich.Women, meanwhile, have learned from watching a generation of divorce that they need to be able to support themselves. And many working-class women aren\u2019t interested in taking responsibility for a man without a job.\u201cThey say, \u2018If he\u2019s not offering money or assets, why make it legal?\u2019 \u201d said June Carbone, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and the author with Naomi Cahn of \u201cMarriage Markets: How Inequality Is Remaking the American Family.\u201dWhen thinking about how to make families more stable, researchers debate whether the decline in marriage is an economic issue or a cultural one. Those on the left usually say it\u2019s economic \u2014 and could be reversed if there were more and better jobs for men without college degrees. Those on the right are more likely to say it\u2019s because of a deterioration of cultural values.In reality, economics and culture both play a role, and influence each other, social scientists say. When well-paying jobs became scarce for less educated men, they became less likely to marry. As a result, the culture changed: Marriage was no longer the norm, and out-of-wedlock childbirth was accepted. Even if jobs returned, an increase in marriage wouldn\u2019t necessarily immediately follow.Economists often downplay cultural factors, Mr. Hanson said. \u201cWe think about marriage in a laboratory setting, and ignore the role of churches and bowling leagues and community organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have job decline in a big way, that fabric unravels. So even if you bring the jobs back, once the damage is done, it might take a while to repair.\u201dIf economics and culture are linked, then policy ideas aimed at creating more stability for children would ideally address both.Social scientists suggest more routes to good jobs, like through community colleges or apprenticeships. More affordable housing for young people would help, so they don\u2019t move in together simply from economic necessity. Inexpensive and accessible contraception would help, too. Some have suggested expanding the child tax credit, and removing the marriage penalty for benefits like the earned-income tax credit.People with college degrees seem to operate with more of a long-term perspective, social scientists say. They are more likely to take on family responsibilities slowly, and they often benefit from parental resources to do so \u2014 like help paying for education, birth control or rent to live on their own. In turn, the young adults prioritize waiting to have children until they are more able to give their children similar opportunities.\u201cThe cultural reinforcement, people relying on contraception and abortion, reinforces a norm, that you don\u2019t have the kid with the wrong guy,\u201d Ms. Carbone said.Mr. Wilcox suggests a bigger emphasis in high schools and pop culture on what\u2019s known as the success sequence: degree, job, marriage, baby. \u201cThe idea is that if people follow that sequence, their odds of landing in poverty are much lower,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Says Fed Plans to Keep Raising Rates", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCLEVELAND \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Tuesday that the Fed plans to keep raising its benchmark interest rate despite the mysterious weakness of inflation.Ms. Yellen said that increasing competition for workers was driving up wages, and inflation was likely to follow. She said that the Fed could raise rates more slowly if it concluded that its inflation expectations needed to be revised but that the central bank was not yet ready to recalibrate.The Fed has raised its benchmark rate twice this year, to a range between 1 and 1.25 percent. Investors expect the Fed to raise the benchmark rate for a third time at its final meeting of the year, in mid-December. The Fed kept rates unusually low for years after the 2008 financial crisis to encourage borrowing and risk-taking; it is gradually raising rates to reduce that stimulus as the economy recovers.The unemployment rate was 4.4 percent in August, and Fed officials expect it to keep falling toward 4 percent, the lowest level since 2000. Wages are rising, too, as companies start to feel the impact of a tighter labor market.On Tuesday, Ms. Yellen visited Cuyahoga Community College, which runs job-training programs to help workers gain skills and help employers find qualified workers. Swagelok, an Ohio company that manufactures industrial parts, has started offering guaranteed internships to students who complete an eight-week training program at the college. Christopher Koszewski, 55, enrolled after 17 years as a truck driver, eager for less dangerous work and higher pay.\u201cYou can go on Craigslist every day and see five to seven new want ads\u201d for skilled machinists, Mr. Koszewski said. \u201cIt\u2019s a target-rich environment.\u201dThe economic mystery is that inflation has remained low despite the tightening labor market. The Fed has undershot its goal of 2 percent annual inflation in each of the past five years. After getting close early this year, inflation has swooned again.Low inflation is a concern because it keeps nominal interest rates at a relatively low level, Ms. Yellen said, limiting the Fed\u2019s ability to respond to economic downturns.Some Fed officials argue that it is also a sign the economy is weaker than it appears.Referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets Fed policy, Mr. Evans said, \u201cInflation has been lower than the F.O.M.C.\u2019s 2 percent target for too long, and there is little in the recent data to suggest that inflation will soon rise to target.\u201dHe has warned that the Fed may be contributing to the problem by failing to convince the public through its actions that it is committed to raising inflation back to 2 percent.That, however, remains a minority opinion among Fed policy makers. Ms. Yellen and her closest allies have continued to describe low inflation as an aberration.Fed policy makers generally agree that a surplus of workers eases inflation, while a shortage of workers leads to higher inflation. In her judgment, Ms. Yellen said, this is a Goldilocks moment \u2014 the labor market is neither too hot nor too cold.\u201cI view the data we have in hand as suggesting a generally healthy labor market, not one in which substantial slack remains or one that is overheated,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.She said the weakness of inflation in recent years reflected other factors, including idiosyncratic events like a price war among cellphone service providers.This year, she said, the weakness is harder to explain. \u201cI think my main message about what we\u2019ve been seeing is that 2017, the shortfall in inflation is a mystery,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen explored three explanations for the weakness in her remarks.Some economists argue that the low unemployment rate is a misleading measure of the health of the labor market because it does not account for the recent increase in the share of American adults who are neither working nor looking for work.Some of those people are returning to work as the economy gains strength.The high cost of child care kept Jessica Dicus out of the work force for the past 10 years, but she recently enrolled in the same training program as Mr. Koszewski. She is paying $4,200; when she completes the program, she will make $15 an hour.\u201cI never planned on being out of the labor force for so long,\u201d said Ms. Dicus, 37, who served in the Army before starting a family. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for me to get on with my life.\u201dThe Fed under Ms. Yellen has prolonged its stimulus program, but she said she saw clear evidence the labor market was strengthening. For example, the percentage of firms planning wage increases has returned to its pre-recession level, she said.Ms. Yellen gave more credence to the theory espoused by Mr. Evans: the possibility that Americans are losing confidence the Fed will return inflation to 2 percent, and that those diminished expectations in turn are reducing the pace of inflation.Finally, she said that changes in the structure of the economy, such as slower growth in health care costs, might be suppressing inflation even as the labor market tightened.These \u201csignificant uncertainties\u201d about the likely pace of inflation weighed in favor of caution in raising rates, she said. \u201cMoving too quickly risks overadjusting policy to head off projected developments that may not come to pass,\u201d she said.The Fed\u2019s concern about low inflation strikes some critics as misplaced.\u201cI can\u2019t work up any enthusiasm for that issue,\u201d said Martin Feldstein, an economics professor at Harvard. \u201cI can\u2019t see why anybody other than a professional economist or a journalist who covers these issues should care about whether inflation is 1.6 percent or 2 percent.\u201dMr. Feldstein said he shared in the general puzzlement that inflation was not rising more quickly, but he said the Fed\u2019s sole concern was to keep it that way.\u201cI was there when the inflation rate was 10 percent\u201d in the late 1970s, he said. \u201cIf somebody told me we would have zero inflation, I would say that\u2019s O.K.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.O.P. Points to Welfare Overhaul as a Model for Health Care. The Comparison Has Limits.", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As they propose to give each state a wad of federal cash to replace the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance, Senate Republicans have a ready comparison to press their case: the overhaul of welfare adopted two decades ago.But the authors of the Senate\u2019s latest bill to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s health law face one glaring flaw with the analogy: Few people would applaud a dramatic plunge in health insurance coverage the way they cheered the steep declines of the welfare rolls after the 1996 welfare law went into force.For Republicans, the comparison makes for a compelling political argument.\u201cIn 1996, we block granted money for welfare reform, and it worked like a charm,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an architect of the health care plan. \u201cWe put governors in charge of the program. We held them accountable.\u201dPresident Trump got into the act when he praised block grants on Twitter.But health care is not welfare, and voters may not accept the analogy. The welfare law, signed by President Bill Clinton, ended the federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation\u2019s poorest children and gave states vast new authority to run their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of federal money.So too would the Senate Republican bill eliminate the entitlement to Medicaid and health insurance subsidies for many low-income people and would give the money to states, along with sweeping discretion over how to use it for health care or coverage.\u201cWe give states the flexibility to come up with their own solutions,\u201d said Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and a co-author of the health care bill with Mr. Graham. With that flexibility, he said, states will find that the money for health care block grants is adequate, just as they have found the welfare block grants.Federal money for the basic welfare block grants has been set at $16.5 billion a year since 1996. If that sum was adjusted for inflation, it would be $25.5 billion.\u201cDo you ever hear a governor come to Washington and complain about not having enough money for their welfare program?\u201d asked Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the former senator who helped devise the latest Senate health bill. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Why? Because we gave them the money and the flexibility to be able to design a program that worked for them.\u201dBut it was easier for states to do more with less when they had fewer people to worry about. After the welfare law was enacted, the number of welfare recipients plunged more than 50 percent in five years, to 5.7 million in 2001, from 12.3 million in 1996.An equivalent drop in the number of people with health insurance or insurance subsidies would probably not be viewed as a great success.The goal in 1996 was to help people move from welfare to work. With health insurance, the goal is to increase enrollment. And no one advocates time limits for insurance like the time limits on cash assistance.Mr. Graham said his bill, providing $1.2 trillion for states to share from 2020 to 2026, would allow federalism to flourish. It \u201cgets the money and power out of Washington,\u201d he said, and \u201cpatients in this country will do better.\u201dBut Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said the welfare program, known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, showed the risks of fiscal federalism.\u201cThose extolling the TANF block grant should check the record,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cFederal dollars have declined by one-third in real terms, states have diverted funds for other purposes, and as a result the number of poor children served by the program has shrunk to an all-time low. If we follow this model for health care, many millions of Americans will lose their health insurance.\u201dRonald T. Haskins, who helped write the 1996 welfare law as an aide to House Republicans, said it had clearly achieved one of its main purposes. \u201cIt has controlled spending,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was $16.5 billion in 1997, the first year of TANF, and it\u2019s still $16.5 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are saving 30 to 35 percent, billions and billions of dollars, because there is no adjustment for inflation or population growth.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Haskins said: \u201cIf you want to make sure people get health care or coverage with a block grant, that\u2019s questionable. Over the years you will have to do more with less. States will have less money. That normally means they\u2019ll have less coverage.\u201dOne goal of the 1996 law was to require adult welfare recipients to work. To the consternation of conservatives, the flexibility provided by the welfare block grant has allowed some states to avoid the work requirements.Conservatives worry that the Graham-Cassidy bill could allow states to set up and operate \u201csingle-payer\u201d health care systems with federal block grant funds. Mr. Graham did nothing to allay this concern when he said last week on the Senate floor, \u201cIf California wants to go to single-payer health care, it can.\u201dThat possibility alarms insurers. In a letter to Senate leaders last week, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a lobby for the industry, said the Graham-Cassidy bill could undercut the private market by \u201callowing government-controlled, single-payer health care to grow.\u201dUntil the recession began in late 2007, the welfare overhaul was generally viewed as a success. Large numbers of single mothers took jobs in a strong economy as states revamped their welfare programs to emphasize work.But the number of welfare recipients did not increase much when the economy softened and poverty inched up in the recession. Since 1996, the proportion of poor families with children who receive cash assistance has plummeted by about two-thirds.\u201cThe program has provided a temporary safety net to fewer and fewer poor families,\u201d said LaDonna A. Pavetti, a vice president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group.Welfare is thus a poor model for health care, Democrats say.\u201cThe Graham-Cassidy bill gives a super block grant blank check to the states,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cThey can do whatever they want in terms of Americans\u2019 health care, and it guts the funding for those block grants over a very short period of time. This will mean a whale of a lot of pain for vulnerable people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There are dukes, sheikhs, flamboyant entrepreneurs \u2014 even Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family.What they have in common besides ownership of some of Britain\u2019s finest estates \u2014 adorned with stately homes, manicured gardens and, sometimes, racing stables \u2014 is their legal status as farmers, which means they are on the dole for European Union farm subsidies.But that could be about to change because of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, known as Brexit.At a time when even the Conservatives under Prime Minister Theresa May have declared war on the growing wealth inequality and the inequities of capitalism, there is a rising clamor to stop, or at least curb, the handouts to the titled, and entitled.\u201cThe only way we have been able to defend it in the past is that it is a European Union system,\u201d he said. The British government has, Mr. Bryant added, \u201cfor years argued that we spend too much on agriculture, and the logical consequence of that would be not to have such high subsidies.\u201dThe government has promised to retain current subsidies until 2022, but dropped strong hints that thereafter, the rich might have to pay more of their own way.Decisions have yet to be made, but ministers are studying ways to shift cash from farmers with large estates to those struggling with smaller holdings.Buckingham Palace said the subsidies for Sandringham also included payments for a separate estate, Balmoral, in Scotland, but it would not comment on what might happen after Brexit. In a statement, it said that \u201csubsidies are open to all farmers; and like others with agricultural interests, some subsidies are received on the queen\u2019s private estates. Figures are in the public domain as a matter of record.\u201dBut at Sandringham recently, where the public can walk through the queen\u2019s house, view prized portraits and heirlooms \u2014 including shotguns and other antique weaponry \u2014 visitors seemed less than convinced that the cash was needed.Linda Thorpe, a health administrator, argued that while the Sandringham farm supported livelihoods, farmers generally got too much subsidy. Her husband, Colin Thorpe, was more blunt, saying: \u201cMoney always goes to money. That will never change.\u201dKevin Kilkenny, who trains apprentices in Hull, in northeast England, added: \u201cIt\u2019s the old boys\u2019 club. It is all the rich boys in the rich club looking after each other.\u201dBrussels has tried several times to limit the maximum amount that farmers can claim, and individual governments are already entitled to impose curbs on big payments.But such initiatives have often clashed with Britain\u2019s national interest. As a big net contributor to the European Union, it believed it got a raw deal from Europe\u2019s agricultural policy because Britain has less farmland than, for example, neighboring France. Yet, of the subsidy that does flow to Britain, a significant proportion goes to owners of bigger parcels of land, who form a relatively large part of the nation\u2019s farmers.The European Union has been scaling back its agricultural policy and trying to reward better environmental practices. Its defenders argue that farm subsidies help provide food security while sustaining the economies of remote rural communities that have few alternative sources of income.Professor Helm says that the British government will either devote less money to farm subsidies over all or distribute the funds differently, and that there will be a ceiling on subsidy grants to individual claimants.\u201cThere is enormous pressure, rightly, to stop subsidizing the large intensive farms of the lowlands,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a natural evolution away from paying people who have several thousand acres and toward the smaller farms, which tend to be in the uplands. It\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201dSome critics counter that cutting subsidies would put British farmers at a disadvantage, vis-\u00e0-vis their continental competitors, and that large landowners may break up their holdings into smaller plots of land to get around curbs on big beneficiaries.Professor Helm argues that tariffs could be applied to food imports if British farmers cannot compete, and that splitting up holdings to keep subsidies could be treated like tax evasion.As for Queen Elizabeth, David McClure, the author of \u201cRoyal Legacy,\u201d a book on the monarchy\u2019s finances, argues that even though Sandringham has historically struggled to make a profit, the queen\u2019s finances are solid enough to survive a loss of the subsidies.\u201cShe\u2019s not going to be pawning the family silver,\u201d Mr. McClure said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Tax Cuts on the Table, Once-Mighty Deficit Hawks Hardly Chirp", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFast forward to President Trump\u2019s Washington, where the budget deficit for this fiscal year is projected to near $700 billion and the federal debt has topped $20 trillion.A new tax cut is emerging to rival those of the Bush years, and the deficit hawks have hardly peeped.\u201cIt\u2019s a great talking point when you have an administration that\u2019s Democrat-led,\u201d said Representative Mark Walker, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of about 150 conservative House members. \u201cIt\u2019s a little different now that Republicans have both houses and the administration.\u201dThis month, the majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate voted to raise the debt limit without doing anything to rein in spending.And as Congress mulls large tax cuts, the tabs for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria keep rising.Now, the budget office forecasts that deficits will total $10.1 trillion over the next decade. The deficit is expected to top $1 trillion a year in 2022 and keep growing from there. Federal debt held by the public is at the highest level since shortly after World War II, at 77 percent of the gross domestic product.\u201cI think the greatest threat to our nation is us,\u201d warned Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and a member of the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cThe way we handle our finances, we as a nation are the greatest threat to our nation. It\u2019s not ISIS. It\u2019s not North Korea. It\u2019s not ascendant China. It\u2019s not Russia. We are the greatest threat.\u201dBut such voices are strangely quiet these days in Washington. Even Mr. Corker seems accommodating.Last week, he reached a deal with another Republican on the budget panel, Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, to allow a tax cut of up to $1.5 trillion over a decade, helping pave the way for the overhaul of the tax code that is a top goal for Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans. He did say he would not vote for a final tax plan if it would add to the deficit.The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.The mantra now is economic growth.\u201cEvery Republican I know of is concerned about the deficit,\u201d said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. \u201cEvery Republican I know of is concerned about tepid growth, too.\u201dWhile Republicans denounced the ballooning debt when President Barack Obama was in office, they have much less of a political incentive to dwell on the issue now that their party controls the government.\u201cThere\u2019s been less talk about it this year with a Republican-led administration than there has been the last seven or eight years,\u201d said Mr. Walker, who bristled at the Senate\u2019s plan for tax cuts that would add to the deficit. He said it was imperative that lawmakers pay attention to the debt.Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said it seems like \u201cfiscal responsibility is more about playing defense than it really is caring about the issue.\u201d\u201cThe party that is the minority, you hear them talk about fiscal responsibility so much more to try to stop the other party from implementing their agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then when that party gets in power, and you\u2019re seeing that now, they\u2019re more likely to throw those fiscal concerns to the wayside in order to implement their agenda without having to face any of the hard choices about how to pay for things.\u201dHe left unsaid the answer to his question: Not many.The change in tone on fiscal matters has been swift. This spring, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, asserted that the tax overhaul needed to be revenue neutral, citing the nation\u2019s debt and invoking Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor.\u201cWe added an enormous amount of debt during the Obama years,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.Now, Republican lawmakers are betting that economic growth will fix the nation\u2019s fiscal woes with no pain and a lot of gain.\u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to solve our long-term debt and deficit issue to allow the federal government to have the revenue it\u2019s going to need to fund all these promises made is with strong \u2014 and I mean strong \u2014 economic growth,\u201d said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and a member of the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to achieve that with an awful tax system.\u201dMr. Kennedy, another member of the budget panel, said Americans have to have faith.\u201cIf we do it right, then the economy will be stimulated appropriately and tax revenues will go up and the deficit won\u2019t increase,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cNow, I can\u2019t prove to you that that will happen.

{"Headline": "When the Rich Said No to Getting Richer", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA half-century ago, a top automobile executive named George Romney \u2014 yes, Mitt\u2019s father \u2014 turned down several big annual bonuses. He did so, he told his company\u2019s board, because he believed that no executive should make more than $225,000 a year (which translates into almost $2 million today).The old culture of restraint had multiple causes, but one of them was the tax code. When Romney was saying no to bonuses, the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent. Even if he had accepted the bonuses, he would have kept only a sliver of them.The high tax rates, in other words, didn\u2019t affect only the post-tax incomes of the wealthy. The tax code also affected pretax incomes. As the economist Gabriel Zucman says, \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it to try to earn $50 million in income when 90 cents out of an extra dollar goes to the I.R.S.\u201dThe tax rates helped create a culture in which Americans found gargantuan incomes to be bizarre.The theory behind all those high-end tax cuts \u2014 a theory that I once found persuasive, I admit \u2014 was that it would unleash entrepreneurial energy: The lure of great wealth would inspire business leaders to work harder and smarter, and the economy would flourish.The first half of that theory may well have come true. Many of the world\u2019s most successful companies are American \u2014 not only Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but also Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson and JPMorgan Chase. The second half of the theory, however, has been a bust. Most Americans have not flourished in the era of a reduced top-end tax rate.Across society, the most powerful members of organizations have fought to keep more money for themselves. They have usually won that fight, which has left less money for everyone else.What would be the right top tax rate today? I don\u2019t know the precise answer. A top rate of 90 percent clearly has the potential to drive away entrepreneurs. But I am convinced that the current top tax rate, 39.6 percent, is too low.This week, President Trump and Congress will turn their attention to tax policy. After the failure of their health care bill, they are desperate for a legislative win and hope to pass a bill by year\u2019s end. Of course, they are not considering a higher top tax rate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Public Health Insurance Could Help, Even if You Don\u2019t Want It", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewAdding public insurance as an option in the complex American health care system has been treated as a consolation prize for those who really favor single-payer health care, but the lighter approach might pack much more punch than you might think. What\u2019s more, the best way to see that is by looking at the Indian labor market and the Mexican grocery market.Why should jobs in India or food in Mexico have anything to do with health care in the United States? They are linked by the logic of supply and demand, which applies in the United States and in countries very different from it \u2014 countries that the United States doesn\u2019t turn to often enough for policy lessons.In fact, India\u2019s and Mexico\u2019s experiences offer some of the best evidence on what happens when we add a public option to a marketplace: The private sector is forced to improve its game to retain customers, so more people benefit than just those who directly use the public services.Here\u2019s how a public option could play out in American health care.The government would begin to compete with private insurers by giving people the opportunity to buy health care coverage through an existing program like Medicaid or through an entirely new plan. Some people will buy the publicly run insurance, but many others will stick with the private insurance to which they have grown accustomed.But the people who stick with private plans could still be helped by the public option because its mere existence will be a jolt to private insurers, which will need to reduce prices or improve quality to retain market share. Consumers who stick with private plans will enjoy those benefits \u2014 even if they never buy the public plan.We can\u2019t really know for sure that these predictions about the health care market will materialize until we try it, but the experience of the rural labor market in India is instructive.The program has paid a daily wage that was often higher than what local employers had offered. As a result, private-sector employers needed to make their jobs more attractive to retain workers.Shaking up the private market is especially useful if the labor market isn\u2019t very competitive to start with. Powerful employers in such a market can get away with paying a lower wage, allowing them to earn fatter profits (although this entails a probable sacrifice in output). Adding a public option to a market like this is not a zero-sum game where higher wages just shift money from employers to workers. Instead, with better paid workers, the size of the economic pie, or \u201csurplus,\u201d increases.For those families, the main benefit was the free food, but there was another boon: Local stores responded by reducing prices, and those prices dropped the most in villages with relatively few stores and little competition.In Mexico and India, when the government entered the market and started competing with private businesses, those businesses felt the pressure and offered their customers or employees a better deal. If the same thing happens with health insurance in the United States, a public option might help millions of people who don\u2019t end up buying it.Seema Jayachandran is an economics professor at Northwestern University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At U.N. and in the Air, North Korea and U.S. Trade Tough Messages", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 American warplanes flew close to North Korea\u2019s coast on Saturday, the same day that the North\u2019s foreign minister told the United Nations General Assembly that President Trump\u2019s threats against the country were \u201cmaking our rocket\u2019s visit to the entire U.S. mainland inevitable all the more.\u201dEarlier Saturday, the Pentagon said the Air Force had sent B-1B bombers and F-15C fighters over waters north of the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas, in response to what it called the North Korean government\u2019s \u201creckless behavior.\u201d It was the farthest north \u201cany U.S. fighter or bomber aircraft have flown off North Korea\u2019s coast in the 21st century,\u201d Dana W. White, the Defense Department\u2019s chief spokeswoman, said in a statement.\u201cThis mission is a demonstration of U.S. resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat,\u201d Ms. White added.Although B-1B bombers have flown near the Demilitarized Zone over land several times, this flight seemed intended to underscore American military strength to Mr. Kim, who has been engaged in a war of words with Mr. Trump.At the General Assembly on Saturday, Mr. Ri said that North Korea intended to have a \u201cnuclear hammer of justice\u201d against its rivals and boasted that it was \u201ca few steps away from the final gate of completion of the state nuclear force.\u201d\u201cNone other than Trump himself is on a suicide mission,\u201d he added.But Mr. Ri also said the North\u2019s nuclear program was a deterrent intended to avert an invasion, with the ultimate goal being \u201cbalance of power with the U.S.\u201d\u201cWe do not have any intention at all to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against the countries that do not join in the U.S. military actions against\u201d North Korea, Mr. Ri said.Over the years, as Pyongyang raced to build a nuclear arsenal, the world has often turned to its neighbors for help: China, because of its economic leverage over the North, and South Korea, because it would suffer the most in any military confrontation.Now, China and South Korea have been left squirming on the sidelines, with Mr. Kim having been essentially granted his wish: dealing directly with the United States, which the North believes has the most to give.To the North Koreans, the United States can offer a peace treaty, diplomatic recognition, the easing of sanctions and the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, which the North considers its existential threat.Since Mr. Kim came to power nearly six years ago, North Korea has accelerated its nuclear and missile tests to grab Washington\u2019s attention and to force negotiations on terms favorable to the North, according to South Korean intelligence officials and analysts who study Mr. Kim\u2019s motives.To back up such talk, Mr. Kim will probably carry out more weapons tests, analysts said.A tremor detected Saturday near North Korea\u2019s underground nuclear-testing site raised fears of another detonation, but South Korean experts said it appeared to have been a natural earthquake.\u201cWe now can\u2019t avoid the military tensions on the Korean Peninsula further escalating,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute, a think tank near Seoul, the South\u2019s capital. The standoff is intensifying partly because \u201cSouth Korea lacks capabilities to confront North Korea while the North ignores the South and insists on dealing only with the United States,\u201d Mr. Cheong added.As the crisis spiraled over the last few days, China found itself a bystander \u2014 an uncomfortable role for President Xi Jinping, who was most likely seething about Mr. Kim and about the North Korean government\u2019s criticism of China\u2019s most vaunted institution, the Communist Party, as its leadership prepares to meet, analysts said. The North\u2019s Korean Central News Agency referred to a coming party congress in Beijing in unflattering terms on Friday.The quiet in Beijing illustrated China\u2019s almost complete lack of influence in controlling the North and its unsuccessful efforts to persuade Mr. Trump to tamp down his language, they said.Fearful of failing and of losing face in a peacemaking role, Mr. Xi would be reluctant to make any diplomatic or strategic moves before the party congress opens on Oct. 18, analysts said.Mr. Xi was left merely humoring Mr. Trump by agreeing to tougher sanctions at the United Nations this past week.\u201cI think China\u2019s diplomatic leverage over North Korea is zero,\u201d said Feng Zhang, a fellow at the Australian National University\u2019s department of international relations. \u201cNorth Korea doesn\u2019t want to see Chinese envoys and is not interested in Chinese views.\u201dPresident Moon Jae-in of South Korea has also found room for diplomacy shrinking, as North Korea and the United States locked themselves in what he called an escalating \u201cvicious cycle\u201d of provocations and sanctions.North Korea has not responded to Mr. Moon\u2019s calls for dialogue as it accelerates its missile and nuclear tests. When he came to power in May, Mr. Moon found little leverage left over North Korea: Under his conservative predecessors, South Korea had cut off all trade ties and pulled out all investments in North Korea.\u201cWe need a breathing room, an easing of tensions,\u201d Mr. Moon said Friday.Despite the tightening sanctions, North Korea is unlikely to stop weapons tests until it believes it has enough leverage to enter talks as an equal with Washington, some South Korean officials and analysts say. It will reach that point when it has secured a capability to deliver a nuclear payload to the mainland United States, they added.Although Asia\u2019s regional powers say they want North Korea to stop developing nuclear arms, they are also playing a complex game of geopolitical chess among themselves, which is partly why the nuclear crisis has been so intractable for more than 20 years.While Mr. Trump is hinting at military action to rid the North of its nuclear arms, South Korea opposes the use of force, fearing war on the peninsula and an attack on Seoul. China also does not want war on its border, hoping that North Korea will remain a Communist buffer against South Korea and its ally, the United States.Mr. Kim\u2019s refusal to listen to China shows how far apart China and the North have become, said Chen Jian, emeritus professor of history at Cornell University.\u201cKim and North Korea are making more trouble and headaches for Xi and Beijing than anyone else in today\u2019s world,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cWhy should China fight a war against the U.S. for Kim and North Korea\u2019s sake?\u201dOn Saturday, China said it would ban exports of some petroleum products to North Korea, as well as imports of textiles from its neighbor, to comply with new sanctions by the United Nations Security Council. China\u2019s support of the sanctions was largely a nod to Mr. Trump and would be insufficient to cripple the North Korean economy and force it to the negotiating table, Chinese experts said.Mr. Xi has displayed contempt for Mr. Kim, who is half his age and whom he has never met. His new envoy for North Korean negotiations, Kong Xuanyou, cannot go to Pyongyang because the North Koreans will not let him.If Mr. Xi thinks Mr. Kim is a lost cause, he would be more likely to turn to Mr. Trump for solutions, but only after the party congress.In a reflection of the North\u2019s festering anger at China, the Korean Central News Agency carried a column by a writer called Jong Phil at the same time it issued Mr. Kim\u2019s denunciation of Mr. Trump on Friday. The column said that North Korea owed little to the Chinese and that Beijing should consider North Korea more than a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d that protects it from \u201cgangsters\u2019 invasion.\u201dIt also questioned whether China\u2019s news media should be \u201centitled to enter the coming party conference hall\u201d because recent reports had been \u201cbetraying the peoples of the two countries.\u201dSome China experts considered the commentary an attack on a fellow Communist government in almost unheard-of terms.\u201cThis is a very big and serious matter, and certainly unprecedented,\u201d Mr. Chen of Cornell said. \u201cEven during the Cultural Revolution, when Chinese-North Korean relations reached the lowest point, and the Red Guards were making all kinds of nasty attacks on Kim Il-sung \u2014 Kim Jong-un\u2019s grandfather \u2014 the eldest Kim avoided personally attacking his \u2018comrades\u2019 in Beijing.\u201dChoe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and at least six state attorneys general have opened investigations.The credit bureaus have for decades successfully fended off calls in Congress for more oversight, despite warnings about potential problems that go back to Senator William Proxmire, a Wisconsin Democrat, in the 1960s. Now, the industry is likely to find support in the agenda of President Trump, who has pledged to strip away \u201cburdensome\u201d business regulations.Regulators aren\u2019t likely to fill the void. The F.T.C., which oversees data protection, can\u2019t dole out big financial punishments. While the consumer bureau has shown a willingness to take on the industry, the agency is mainly focused on the accuracy of the data and the products that are sold to consumers.\u201cI have no reason to believe that this Congress has the capacity or will to actually legislate on those issues,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading. \u201cThe most we could see passing is targeted legislation aimed at enhancing consumer protections following identity theft.\u201dFor years, consumer advocates have pressed for stricter oversight of the credit bureaus and stronger privacy rules covering all companies. One often-pursued goal is a federal privacy law mandating notifications to those whose personal information has been compromised, as well as meaningful financial penalties for lax data protection.Equifax lobbied on two bills under scrutiny at last week\u2019s House hearing, including one called the F.C.R.A. Liability Harmonization Act. The six proposals discussed at the hearing, all introduced by Republicans, would amend, and often scale back, a variety of consumer protection laws. The various proposals would ease certain mortgage lending rules, narrow the scope of debt collection restrictions and limit corporate liability by capping financial penalties for violations of the F.C.R.A., the Fair Credit Reporting Act.Meredith Griffanti, a spokeswoman for Equifax, said the company \u201cworks to ensure that new legislation captures the benefits of credit reporting to the U.S. economy, as well as the effects of certain regulation on the financial system.\u201d\u201cWe believe in fair industry regulation,\u201d she added, \u201cand advocating for policies that protect consumers\u2019 rights, as well as the integrity of the consumer data industry.\u201dCongress has sounded warnings for decades.In the 1960s, a series of congressional hearings pulled the secretive industry into a public spotlight. Aggrieved customers, academic experts, and industry insiders spoke out about how the vendors \u2014 including Equifax, then known as the Retail Credit Company \u2014 amassed files filled with intimate personal information on millions of people.The bureaus hired thousands of investigators to ferret out details on subjects\u2019 financial habits and their \u201cmoral character,\u201d according to the hearings. Drinking, philandering or simply having a dispute with a gossipy neighbor could lead to black marks.Those credit files, which helped determine who could get a business loan, rent an apartment or even land a job, were available for purchase by any creditor. But they were kept hidden from the subjects themselves.Senator Proxmire was a vocal critic of the power and the secrecy of credit bureaus. Without strict oversight, he thought the industry might be tempted to cut corners on data protection.\u201cTight security standards are expensive,\u201d he said during congressional testimony in 1969. \u201cSince credit bureaus are almost entirely responsive to the needs of business and have little responsibility to consumers, it is difficult to see major expenditures on security systems in the absence of public standards.\u201dMr. Proxmire helped lay the groundwork for the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the main law that governs the three major credit bureaus. Passed with broad support, it was signed into law by President Nixon in 1970.The act \u201cprovides significant remedy and relief,\u201d said Leonard Bennett, a consumer attorney in Newport News, Va.The act gave consumers the right \u2014 for the first time \u2014 to view their own credit reports. It also forced the credit bureaus to create a dispute process to allow people to challenge inaccuracies.But it placed enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, which has limited supervisory powers and little ability to levy significant penalties. When the agency finds wrongdoing, it takes companies to court to force corrections, but it can generally only impose fines for repeated violations.The F.T.C.\u2019s approach is \u201cremedial,\u201d and focused on noneconomic punishment, said Chris Jay Hoofnagle, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who wrote a book about the F.T.C.\u2019s enforcement of privacy laws.With little federal oversight, the credit bureaus rapidly expanded beyond their core business of building consumer credit dossiers for lenders and other companies. In 2000, Equifax started selling online credit scores and credit monitoring products directly to American consumers. That line of business is a small, but lucrative, part of Equifax\u2019s empire.The creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in 2011, has begun to rein in the industry, to some degree.In a series of investigations, the C.F.P.B. found that the credit bureaus lacked sufficient quality controls to make sure consumers\u2019 data was accurate, and forced the bureaus to make changes. The agency also pressed the companies to improve their processes for fixing errors.\u201cThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has moved the needle and has gotten them to think about compliance, at least on accuracy issues,\u201d said Chi Chi Wu, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.One new consumer protection initiative may have been inadvertently saved by the backlash over Equifax\u2019s response to its data breach.Customers immediately cried foul. Equifax quickly backed down and removed the clause.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Contradiction Buried in Trump\u2019s Iran and North Korea Policies", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump is now fully engaged in two nuclear confrontations, one with Iran over a nuclear accord he finds an \u201cembarrassment\u201d and the other with North Korea that is forcing the Pentagon to contemplate for the first time in decades what a resumption of the Korean War might look like.The fiercest defenders of the Iran deal argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s team has not thought about how his threats to Tehran resonate 4,000 miles away in Pyongyang, especially since Iran has held up its end of the agreement.\u201cIf the president pulls back on the Iran deal, given Iranian compliance\u201d with its terms, said Wendy R. Sherman, the chief negotiator of the accord, \u201cit will make diplomacy on North Korea almost impossible because U.S. credibility will be shot.\u201dPresumably, the United States would have to make some concessions to North Korea in return for limits on its nuclear program. But why negotiate with the United States if this president or the next one can just throw out any agreement?Mr. Trump\u2019s aides see the problem and in an entirely different way.The lesson that the North Koreans would take away from the Iran deal, they say, is that the United States can be rolled. The Iran deal is not a permanent solution to the Iranian nuclear problem, they argue, but just a temporary fix. After 15 years, many of the limits on the production of nuclear material will be lifted, even if inspection requirements remain.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to stick with the Iran deal there has to be changes made to it,\u201d Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said on Fox News on Tuesday. \u201cThe sunset provisions simply is not a sensible way forward,\u201d he added, arguing that they amount to \u201ckicking the can down the road.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s argument goes further. In interviews with The New York Times last year, he criticized the deal as failing to address Iran\u2019s missile capability, the detention of American citizens and Tehran\u2019s support of terrorist groups around the Middle East. He seeks something more akin to a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Iran, something the nuclear deal was never intended to be.In an interview this summer, Mr. Zarif said he and Mr. Tillerson had never spoken, and the American-educated Iranian diplomat left little doubt on Tuesday what he thought of Mr. Trump\u2019s address to the United Nations General Assembly, in which the president called the Iranian leadership a \u201ccorrupt dictatorship\u201d that masks itself as a democracy.In the end, this entire argument may be moot. China and Russia have said they have no interest in renegotiating the deal. Britain and France have said they would be willing to engage Iran in a negotiation over an addendum to the accord, but the Iranians have rejected that out of hand. And the White House has never said what, if anything, it was willing to give up in return for renegotiating the terms.What is missing from this debate is obvious: If Mr. Tillerson extracted anything resembling the Iran agreement from North Korea, it would mark a historic breakthrough, one any of the four previous American presidents would rightly have celebrated.The accord that Mr. Trump finds so lacking would prevent Iran from assembling the makings of a bomb for a year or so, by the best estimates of American national nuclear laboratories, which advised the negotiators. By comparison, North Korea already has an arsenal of 20 to 60 fully formed weapons, depending on whose intelligence estimates one believes.In the best case scenario, some administration officials say, the Trump administration would be lucky to win a nuclear \u201cfreeze\u201d that keeps North Korea from conducting more nuclear and missile tests.But that would enshrine the North Korean nuclear arsenal at something around its current level, an outcome Mr. Trump and his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, have already rejected as intolerable. And it is possible that the North is even more capable than we know, some experts say.Michael J. Morell, a former deputy director of the C.I.A., recently argued that the North most likely already had everything it needed to mount an attack on the mainland United States \u2013 and that the only solution is classic containment.\u201cI believe that North Korea may have the capability today to successfully conduct a nuclear attack on the United States,\u201d he wrote recently, saying that Washington was relying on flawed logic in its assumption that Pyongyang did not possess the technology needed to deliver a warhead to Los Angeles or Chicago simply because it had yet to demonstrate the mastery of those technologies.If Mr. Morell is right \u2014 and no one will know until the North Korean regime collapses and inspectors can assess the extent of its technology \u2014 Mr. Trump faces a problem far more urgent than the one that confronted President Barack Obama in Iran.Over the next few months, Mr. Trump must decide whether it is truly worth the many risks of war to force the North to disarm, as he has seemed to suggest several times, including in his United Nations speech, or whether he can acquiesce to Cold War-style containment.So while Mr. Tillerson presses the Europeans to add restrictions on Iran, Mr. Trump and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, will be focusing on pressuring China to cut off Pyongyang\u2019s supplies of oil and gas.It is not clear what a warning shot might look like. Inside the Pentagon, military officials say they are looking at several options, including cyber attacks that could turn off Pyongyang\u2019s lights and shooting down North Korean test launches \u2014 though Defense Secretary Jim Mattis noted on Monday that the United States had avoided doing so as long as the missiles looked as though they would fall harmlessly into the sea.Reporters asked how that might be possible. New technology? A way of finding and silencing North Korea\u2019s mortars?\u201cI won\u2019t go into detail,\u201d Mr. Mattis said.In an earlier version of this article, a picture caption referred incorrectly to the North Korean ambassador shown during a session of the General Assembly. The ambassador, Ja Song-nam, was pictured before \u2014 not during \u2014 President Trump\u2019s speech.Advertisement"}

This is demanding work for very little money. Why do they volunteer?Do they feel exploited by the low wages?Some do and some don\u2019t. A lot of women were just really happy to be there and happy to do the work. A couple of women expressed real dissatisfaction with the wages. And of course all of them would welcome an increase.Did you see evidence that the program provides rehabilitation for the inmates?A lot of the inmates felt that it was rehabilitating to do the work. But in terms of recidivism rates and how they functioned once they were outside of the program and whether there was a clear path to apply what they were learning to the outside world, I didn\u2019t see that.And I think that\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s actually really incredible work that\u2019s happening and it does feel like there\u2019s potential for true rehabilitation.

Many people in Latin America appreciate having these options thanks to the multinational companies that have made those products available.To deny to others what those of us in developed countries have had for many years is not too different from the greenhouse gas debate: We\u2019ve got our air-conditioned cars and homes, but now we know better, so those catching up need to figure out a different path.JEFFREY SHARLACH, MIAMI BEACHThe writer is the founder of a strategic communications company that provides services to multinational companies in Latin America.

Examples include fortification with vitamins and minerals, which has diminished inadequate intake by adding them to common foods; heat pasteurization, which has reduced food-borne illness by killing disease-causing micro-organisms; and canning and freezing, which have extended the shelf life of perishable foods and decreased food waste.But as your article illustrates, there is a darker side to advances in food processing. Somehow these negative advances have overtaken historical benefits. The challenge to the food industry is to shift the balance from less desirable trends that occurred during the last few decades toward using its tremendous creative capacity to shift course and move toward emerging methodologies to improve the quality of the food supply available worldwide.ALICE H.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Mars Vision: A One-Size-Fits-All Rocket. A Very Big One.", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe key is a new rocket \u2014 smaller than the one he described at a conference in Mexico last year but still bigger than anything ever launched \u2014 and a new spaceship.Speaking on Friday at the International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide, Australia, Mr. Musk said he had figured out a workable business plan, although his presentation lacked financial figures to back up his assertions.But he did not convincingly explain then how SpaceX, still a company of modest size and revenues, could finance such an ambitious project.\u201cNow we think we have a better way to do it,\u201d he said Friday.The new rocket and spaceship would replace everything that SpaceX is currently launching or plans to launch in the near future. \u201cThat\u2019s really fundamental,\u201d Mr. Musk said.The slimmed-down rocket would be nine meters, or about 30 feet, in diameter instead of the 12-meter behemoth he described last year. It would still be more powerful than the Saturn 5 rocket that took NASA astronauts to the moon. Mr. Musk called it B.F.R. (The \u201cB\u201d stands for \u201cbig\u201d; the \u201cR\u201d is for \u201crocket.\u201d) The B.F.R. would be able to lift 150 metric tons to low-Earth orbit, Mr. Musk said.For Mars colonists, the rocket would lift a spaceship with 40 cabins, and with two to three people per cabin, it would carry about 100 people per flight. After launching, the B.F.R. booster would return to the launching pad; the spaceship would continue to orbit, where it would refill its tanks of methane and oxygen propellant before embarking on the monthslong journey to Mars.But with the smaller size, the B.F.R. would also be useful much closer to Earth, Mr. Musk said. He said it would be able to take over the launching duties of SpaceX\u2019s current Falcon 9 rocket, taking many satellites to orbit at once, as well as ferry cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station. A variation of the spaceship could be used to collect and dispose of relics of satellite and other debris cluttering low-Earth orbit, he said.Because all parts of the rocket and the spaceship are to be fully reusable, the cost of operating them would be low.Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society, a nonprofit organization that advocates human exploration and settlement of the planet, liked the changes that Mr. Musk has made. \u201cThis is a much more practical approach than he presented last year,\u201d Dr. Zubrin said. \u201cIt means he is serious.\u201dThe same spaceship could also land on the moon. \u201cIt\u2019s 2017,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cWe should have a lunar base by now.\u201dEven on Earth, the rockets, traveling at up to 18,000 miles per hour, could make long-distance trips short \u2014 New York to Shanghai in 39 minutes, for example. Any two points on Earth would be less than an hour apart, Mr. Musk said.After the presentation, Mr. Musk took to Instagram to elaborate on the price of those round-the-world rocket flights: \u201cCost per seat should be about the same as full fare economy in an aircraft. Forgot to mention that.\u201dMr. Musk maintained a highly optimistic schedule for his Mars dreams. He said the company had already started work to build pieces of the new rocket.A cargo mission, without any passengers, could launch as early as 2022. \u201cThat\u2019s not a typo, although it is aspirational,\u201d he said. \u201cFive years feels like a long time to me.\u201dTwo years later, the next time that Mars and Earth would swing by each other, SpaceX would launch four B.F.R.s to Mars \u2014 two carrying cargo, two carrying people.In the lead-up to Mr. Musk\u2019s talk on Friday, the main entrance to the Adelaide Convention Center was closed and locked, with a swell of people outside waiting to get in.\u201cHe\u2019s such an iconic character,\u201d said Paris Michaels, the chief executive of Air@Wave Communications in Sydney, who attended the congress. \u201cI planned the day around making this event. I\u2019m taking a later flight home, even though I\u2019m averaging two hours\u2019 sleep this week.\u201dFrom Mars orbit, astronauts could control robotic explorers like rovers and flying drones.Mars Base Camp is more of a suggestion to NASA of what the agency could do rather than a corporate strategy that Lockheed Martin would pursue by itself.\u201cThis isn\u2019t Lockheed Martin\u2019s vision, and it\u2019s not the only vision of how to get to Mars, but we put it out here so that we can globally begin the dialogue,\u201d Robert Chambers, an engineer working on the Mars Base Camp concept, said during the presentation.Unlike Mr. Musk\u2019s dreams, Mars Base Camp would not require unproven business plans or novel technologies far beyond what already exists or is already in development. \u201cWe know how to do this,\u201d Mr. Chambers said.The spacecraft, which looks as one might expect a traditional NASA expeditionary mission to Mars to look, would incorporate both the Orion crew capsule that Lockheed Martin is building for NASA deep-space missions and the agency\u2019s plans to put a space station high above the moon. This week, the Russian space agency announced that it would like to collaborate with NASA on this lunar space station, called the Deep Space Gateway.Lockheed Martin is one of six companies that NASA selected to develop a prototype of a habitat module that could be used for the Deep Space Gateway. Lockheed Martin officials said their vision for Mars Base Camp did not depend on their design\u2019s being selected.The Mars Base Camp proposal would also fit within the NASA budget, Lockheed Martin officials said.This year\u2019s update unveiled a reusable, hydrogen-fueled lander that would take astronauts to the Martian surface on a follow-up mission. Up to four astronauts could live on the Martian surface for two weeks at a time in the lander.Reflecting the interest of many to return to the moon before going to Mars, Lockheed Martin officials said the lander could also be used to travel to different parts of the moon from the Deep Space Gateway.Adam Baidawi reported from Adelaide, and Kenneth Chang from New York.Advertisement"}

The four-bedroom, four-bath house, built in 2014, has treetop views and limited vistas of the downtown skyline of Sandton, a business hub nearby, from the second floor.A long driveway leads to the parking court in front of the main entrance, said Lynda Greeff, a saleswoman with Pam Golding Properties Gauteng, which has the listing. There is a two-car garage on either side of the staircase to this entrance.The house, which is in a gated community, has an open layout and a double-height foyer. To the left of the foyer is a quarter-turn staircase with stainless-steel railings and an alcove leading to a guest suite with a balcony and an en-suite bath. To the right is a study with sliding glass doors that open to the yard.There are floor-to-ceiling glass walls throughout the house. In the living and dining areas, which are separated by a gas fireplace, the walls stack back and can be opened to the lawn and a solar-heated pool at the center of this walled property.The kitchen has glossy laminate cabinetry, Caesarstone counters, a center island with room for stools and a Smeg cooktop and stove; it is connected to a pantry and a laundry room.Upstairs, a central den opens to the master suite and two bedrooms, all of which are carpeted. The master bedroom has a gas fireplace; a separate dressing room with built-in cabinetry; a balcony overlooking the yard and pool; and a bathroom with a double vanity, a spa tub and an oversized shower. The other two bedrooms also have built-in cabinetry, balconies and en-suite baths. There are wall-mounted air-conditioners throughout the house.The garage level includes a wine cellar and access to both garages. There is another outside entrance to a separate bedroom and full bath, Ms. Greeff said.Bryanston, a diverse and affluent suburb, has about 29,000 residents, as well as \u201cexcellent private schools and some amazing shopping centers,\u201d said Francois Rohlandt, a property consultant for Pam Golding Properties Gauteng who shares the listing with Ms. Greeff.

Central Johannesburg is about 14 miles away, or about a 30-minute drive, and O.R. Tambo International Airport is about a 35-minute drive.MARKET OVERVIEW\u201cHome prices are very undervalued\u201d in Johannesburg, said Ronald Ennik, the principal of Ennik Estates, an affiliate of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. \u201cIt\u2019s the cheapest it\u2019s been in 20 years.\u201dIn northern suburbs like Hyde Park, Sandhurst, Westcliff, Bryanston, Rosebank and Sandton, Mr. Ennik said, \u201cbuyers are really few at the top end,\u201d and there is \u201can oversupply of stock.\u201dAs Mr. Finnemore put it, \u201cThe more affordable and middle housing bands are tending to outperform the higher-end, luxury segment of the market.\u201dThe problems aren\u2019t entirely recent either, said Lew Geffen, the chairman of Lew Geffen Sotheby\u2019s International Realty: \u201cThe Johannesburg market has been a roller coaster since 2012.\u201d When the 2008 global recession began to ease five years ago, he said, the property market was buoyant, but that did not last.In early 2016, Mr. Geffen said, the market changed course to favor buyers over sellers, in \u201ca reflection of the depreciation of the local currency, a loss of investor confidence as a result of a sharp decline in political leadership faith and the resultant stagnation of the national economy.\u201dAt the same time, many Johannesburg homeowners moved to Cape Town, fueling its property market to the detriment of Johannesburg\u2019s, Mr. Ennik said. But in the past three or four months, with the recession over and the rand and interest rates stabilizing, he said, the market is steadying and \u201cfinally beginning to come right.\u201dA number of new commercial buildings and high-rise condominiums are being built, he said, with new development fetching 30 percent more than resales of existing properties.And more inventory is coming on the market \u201cat the correct price level,\u201d Mr. Geffen said, so it\u2019s easier to sell. But at the high end of the market, he added, people are still cautious about taking on properties that will be costly to maintain.WHO BUYS IN JOHANNESBURG Buyers from Africa \u2013 Nigeria, Angola, Ghana, Uganda, Gabon, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Congo and Mozambique \u2014 make up \u201can increasing proportion\u201d of foreigners buying in the Johannesburg metropolitan area, Mr. Finnemore said. There has also been an increase in buyers from China and India, Mr. Ennik said.Those from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, he added, typically work for multinational companies in the area.But as Mr. Geffen noted, the \u201cpercentage of foreign second-home purchases is so small as to be statistically irrelevant in Johannesburg,\u201d which has mostly primary residences and investor and corporate properties.BUYING BASICS\u201cLimitations on foreign property ownership in South Africa pertain solely to agricultural land,\u201d Mr. Geffen said. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively easy for foreigners to purchase property in urban areas.\u201dHowever, the maximum financing available to nonpermanent residents is 50 percent, Mr. Ennik said.Lawyers who specialize in property transfer are selected by the seller but represent both parties.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIES Zulu, English, Afrikaans, Sesotho; rand (1 rand = $.075)TAXES AND FEESProperty transfer taxes are paid on a sliding scale, depending on the price of the property.

They fill water tanks that keep the computers from melting down or bursting into flame. Around them, hundreds of thousands of cooling fans fill the building with whooshing white noise.Bitcoin\u2019s believers say it will be the currency of the future. Purely electronic, it can be sent across borders anonymously without oversight by a central authority. That makes it appealing to a diverse and sometimes mismatched group that includes tech enthusiasts, civil libertarians, hackers and criminals.Bitcoin is also, by and large, made in China. The country makes more than two-thirds of all Bitcoin issued daily. Bitmain, founded by Jihan Wu, a former investment analyst, makes money mostly by selling equipment to make Bitcoins, as well as mining the currency itself.China has mixed feelings about Bitcoin.On one hand, the government worries that Bitcoin will allow Chinese people to bypass its strict limits on how much money they can send abroad, and could also be used to commit crimes. Chinese officials are moving to close Bitcoin exchanges, where the currency is bought and sold, though they have not set a time frame. While that would not affect Bitcoin manufacturing directly, it would make buying and selling Bitcoin more expensive in one of its major markets, potentially hurting prices.Dalad Banner may be far away from Beijing\u2019s internet start-up scene and southern China\u2019s gadget hub. Still, many of the workers and surrounding residents see a digital opportunity for Dalad Banner and the rest of their part of Inner Mongolia, an area famous in China for half-finished factories and towns so empty that they are sometimes called ghost cities.\u201cNow the mine has about 50 employees,\u201d said Wang Wei, the manager of Bitmain China\u2019s Dalad Banner facility, using one of several metaphors for the work being done there. \u201cI feel in the future it might bring hundreds or even thousands of jobs, like the big factories.\u201dMr. Wang, a 36-year-old resident and former coal salesman, purchased one Bitcoin about six months ago. It has since more than doubled in value. \u201cI made quite a lot of money,\u201d he said.Dalad Banner is not the sort of place that at first glance looks like a home for high-tech work. Indeed, the idea took some getting used to, even among the workers.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about Bitcoin then,\u201d said Li Shuangsheng, a 28-year-old resident who maintains the operations of one of the eight factories.He bounced from job to job \u2014 the chemical plant was too noisy and polluted, he said \u2014 before he landed about one month ago at Bitmain China\u2019s Dalad Banner factory, one of the few lucrative job opportunities in the sparsely populated region.Mr. Li does not yet own any Bitcoin, but he is happy with the work and studying up on the subject online when family time permits.\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m starting to have some idea.\u201dMany at the farm have experienced the ups and downs of the local economy.Bai Xiaotu was laid off from a state-owned furniture factory in 1997.

Bai Dong, Mr. Bai\u2019s 31-year-old son, had never heard of Bitcoin when his father first got the job.

{"Headline": "Is It New York Fashion Week? Or Is It Rihanna Inc.?", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs New York Fashion Week, which officially begins Thursday but actually begins Wednesday (thank you, Tom Ford), a dead duck? Is it a sinking ship, in the soup, up the creek? Is it \u2014 gasp! \u2014 over?Not \u201cover\u201d in the literal sense, of course. There are more than 130 shows on the schedule. But \u201cover\u201d in the substantive sense. Over as a power player in a global system that puts a premium on showcasing clothes that redefine how women present themselves. Over as we know it. Forget whether or not suits are back; this is the existential question underpinning the fashion season.According to the laws of fashion (hemlines that go up must come down; minimalism will have an equal and opposite maximalist reaction), one example of anything is a fluke, two is a coincidence, and three is a trend. This is way past trend.The basic issue is simple: Despite all the allotted catwalk time, there are a handful of names that matter in terms of broad influence and renown.In the beginning there were three \u2014 Ralph, Calvin, Donna \u2014 the brands that became synonymous with upwardly mobile, female-first sportswear.They were joined by Carolina (Herrera) and Oscar (de la Renta). Later came Marc (Jacobs) and Michael (Kors) and Narciso (Rodriguez), the three Americans chosen in the 1990s to help revive major French houses (Louis Vuitton, C\u00e9line and Loewe) and hence crowned the Next Big Things. After them came another generation championed by the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund in the post-9/11 world: Proenza Schouler, Rag & Bone, Rodarte, Altuzarra, Thom Browne \u2014 all newer names with international magnetism.Yet it is exactly that latter group of success stories who are decamping for alternate shores. When the exodus began, I talked to Steven Kolb, chief executive of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, about whether he was concerned, and the message was: absolutely not. It was a personal step for each brand based on its business needs, not a vote against New York.And besides, to have the Paris seal of approval \u2014 to have American brands be good enough to show in Paris \u2014 should be seen as a badge of honor for New York.It is true that all the designers who left New York Fashion Week have done so for individual reasons: because it\u2019s better for deliveries to show in July; because they need to reach international buyers; because their parent company is French.But it should be pointed out that no one who shows in Paris, London or Milan seems to feel a need to experiment in quite the same way. Indeed, the Paris schedule is exploding, even without that impulse. And to a certain extent, that simply underscores the stereotype that Paris is a more fertile place for aesthetic growth than New York, one that focuses on creativity as opposed to \u2014 sniff! \u2014 mere clothes.There will be a pop-up store featuring designer-made New York Fashion Week T-shirts, masterminded by WME/IMG, the sports and entertainment behemoth that administers the largest group of shows. Which has also introduced, for its corporate clients and high-net-worth consumers, the option to buy NYFW: The Experience, a behind-the-scenes opportunity to \u2026 well, experience the collections.As a result, the balance of power seems to be shifting from aesthetic influencers to Instagram influencers. From fashion to fashertainment.If you measure success during shows simply by viewership, by clicks and buzz, that\u2019s probably absolutely fine. More people may be watching more catwalks. But if you measure success by the ability to bring decision makers to the city because they have to see \u2014 for themselves, not through a screen \u2014 the way a garment moves on the body, how it can resonate in the memory and change the way an individual may dress so that consumers look to this country for leadership, it might not be.No one is questioning whether American fashion is O.K. It\u2019s doing just fine, retail worries notwithstanding. New brands are born seemingly every F.I.T. and Parsons graduation month. But this particular expression of fashion, the one that represents the soul of American fashion in the global imagination, is a different story.But Sebastian Manes, the buying director of Selfridges in London, told me earlier this summer that Thom Browne was one of the main reasons he came to New York. Now that reason has gone. Alix Morabito, fashion editor of Galeries Lafayette, which will be sending a smaller team to New York this season, said that between the brands that had left the schedule and the rise of see now/buy now, the city had become \u201cless attractive from the buyer side.\u201dFashion is a global business, divided more by psychographics than by geography. And in the map of the mind that is the fashion system, New York has lost its identity.Brian Phillips, president of the creative agency Black Frame, said that the moves create an opening for smaller brands to make a bigger impact, and it is possible that one extraordinary brand could break through and change it all. (The fashion hive mind can turn on a dime.) The street wear scene is still bopping along, though it is unclear whether street wear needs to be seen in person or if the small screen will suffice.More interesting, the CFDA has teamed up with the American Civil Liberties Union (along with Planned Parenthood, which it worked with last year) to create runway events demonstrating support of the nonprofits\u2019 causes; and WME/IMG is giving part of the profits from its shop to Unicef, and encouraging models to wear T-shirts between shows designed by Prabal Gurung that read: \u201cModel Citizen.\u201d\u201cWe want to be on the front line, not the sidelines, to boldly fight to protect our precious rights and freedoms,\u201d Mr. Kolb said in a news release. Fashion is at its essence about identity politics, but brands have traditionally shied away from overt positioning. New York could assume that mantle of leadership, with every brand interpreting it in its own way.But out of the cacophony needs to come a core of consensus. Otherwise it risks the worst look of all: irrelevance. Accessorized by parochialism.New York may be in the hot seat, but that does not mean there isn\u2019t action in the other three fashion month cities. Here\u2019s what you need to know.LondonAlso jumping to Europe is Tommy Hilfiger, who will take his #TommyNow interactive party to London (along with Gigi Hadid). Emporio Armani is moving to London as well; ditto Nicopanda, the brand started by Nicola Formichetti, Lady Gaga\u2019s former stylist and the artistic director of Diesel. It is one-upping every other see now/buy now brand by teaming up with Amazon to guarantee delivery of some runway pieces in certain territories in under two hours. Yes: You watch the show and order on the app. It gives new meaning to immediate gratification.MilanMissing from the schedule: Pucci, designer-less since the decision to part ways with Massimo Giorgetti in April.ParisAll that excitement may go by the wayside, however, if Brigitte Macron makes a front row appearance at either Vuitton or Dior, the two brands shaping up to be staples of her wardrobe in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Virgin Islands, Hurricane Maria Drowned What Irma Didn\u2019t Destroy", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "As islanders wait for doctors, medicine, fuel and manpower to rebuild, the economic toll from the storms is only starting to come to light.Supported byCRUZ BAY, V.I. \u2014 Even before two Category 5 hurricanes struck the United States Virgin Islands with punishing fury this month, the notion of paradise here was already about as brittle as a sand dollar.The local treasury had barely enough cash to keep the government funded for three days. Its debt had grown so large that Wall Street stopped lending it money. The unemployment rate was more than twice the national average.The one-two punch of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria 14 days later was especially cruel. In many places across the three major islands of this American territory, the second storm drowned what the first couldn\u2019t destroy, ravaging what was once one of the Caribbean\u2019s most idyllic landscapes.\u201cMaria broke our spirit,\u201d said Ian Samuel of St. John, who lost parts of the upstairs of his house to Irma\u2019s wind and his downstairs to two and a half feet of water from Maria. \u201cI was in a pretty bad car wreck. And it\u2019s like that \u2014 when you get out of the car and you\u2019re trying to figure out what\u2019s happening.\u201dThe governor, Kenneth E. Mapp, said he expects that the hospitals on St. Thomas and St. Croix, the most populated islands, will have to be torn down and rebuilt. In St. Thomas, not far from where cruise ships have long unloaded vacationers, tarps and trash cans now collect dripping water from the ceiling of the emergency room, which has to evacuate any critical patients to the mainland.On St. Croix, one of the few working cell towers went down after someone stole the generator powering it. The authorities had to ease the strict curfew after bodies started piling up at the morgue because people could not stay out long enough to bury those who had passed away of natural causes since the storms.On St. John, the smallest and most remote of the islands, water and wind reduced beachfront hotel rooms to rubble. A landslide blocked the one road that connects the island from east to west, leaving just enough room for cars to pass but not an ambulance.So many public school buildings have been compromised on the three islands that students cannot go back to class. And the wind has stripped the trees of all their leaves, leaving the once lush tropical forests looking as if they were set afire with napalm.The 103,000 people who live in these islands are at the end of a long supply chain of relief that depends heavily on the ports in neighboring Puerto Rico \u2014 now crippled by Maria and unable to meet the needs of its own people.And as Virgin Islanders wait for doctors, medicine, fuel and manpower to rebuild the flattened communications and power grid, the economic toll from the storms is only starting to come to light.\u201cThe economy evaporated pretty much overnight,\u201d said Clint Gaskins, the owner of Longboard, a restaurant on the island of St. John where the only customers these days are the locals who stop by twice a day to pick up meals provided by the Red Cross.Across the island, the picture is grim: The two largest resorts will not be able to open until next year, if not longer; owners of the restaurants and bars that came away unscathed wonder who will be left for them to serve; and residents who are suddenly without jobs are leaving en masse for the mainland.\u201cAnd you\u2019ve got a nearly bankrupt government,\u201d Mr. Gaskins added. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they get out of this.\u201dThe troubles in Puerto Rico are far better known. That island is facing a humanitarian catastrophe following the flooding and destruction from Maria. A debt crisis has left the government so badly strained that it effectively declared bankruptcy in May.But on a per-capita basis, the often out-of-sight, out-of-mind Virgin Islands carry more debt than Puerto Rico. Wall Street analysts have warned that the territory may be unable to pay back the nearly $2 billion it owes creditors and keep up with billions more in payments it is required to make into a pension system that is projected to be insolvent in less than six years.\u201cWe believe there is a large chance they will default,\u201d said David Hitchcock, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s, which has said it plans to withdraw its ratings of the Virgin Islands \u2014 already at a level considered junk by investors \u2014 by October because the government has stopped providing it with basic information on its cash flow and financial outlook.Governor Mapp said in an interview this week that the territory had already made its bond payment due next month and was not in danger of default or bankruptcy, which would have to be authorized by Congress, similar to what happened with Puerto Rico. He said his administration has been working with Wall Street to try to borrow additional funding, but no deals have come together yet.\u201cI\u2019m not an economist, so I don\u2019t want to sort of say to you it\u2019s going to be all fine. It\u2019s not going to be all fine,\u201d Mr. Mapp said. The government \u2014 the territory\u2019s largest employer \u2014 had been able to pay its employees since the hurricanes and would do so again this week, he said. But beyond that, he offered no guarantees. His priority, he said, was making sure critically ill patients got out of the two damaged hospitals.He asked that Washington remember \u201cthe forgotten Americans\u201d in the territories. \u201cWe are no different than Americans anywhere else,\u201d he said.Tourism is not only the livelihood for many Virgin Islanders, it provides a third of the local gross domestic product \u2014 a revenue stream the local government cannot afford to live without.A vicious cycle of financial mismanagement, combined with other factors like the loss of one-tenth of the islands\u2019 population since 2008, were hampering the Virgin Islands even as the rest of the country bounced back from the Great Recession.Basic government functions have suffered neglect for years. The government has shortchanged the hospitals of the funding they are supposed to receive. And that has caused the hospitals to fall behind on payments to entities like the local water and power authority, which has raised rates so high on customers that they pay three times as much as the average in the states. Compounding the financial stress, the federal government caps the amount of money it provides the territories for Medicaid.\u201cI\u2019m so at a loss right now and really trying to hold it together because we were on the brink before this, in terms of our finances,\u201d Representative Stacey Plaskett, the Virgin Islands delegate to Congress, said in an interview. Ms. Plaskett, like other territorial delegates, cannot vote.After Irma hit three weeks ago, aid was slow to trickle into St. Thomas and St. John. When military, law enforcement and emergency medical workers finally did begin to settle in, they were forced to pull out as Maria approached, taking the semblance of safety and order they brought with them.\u201cWhat it did was send everybody back into shock,\u201d James Smith of St. Thomas, a ferry operator, said of Maria. Many people like him shared a similar reaction now that a week has passed: While the initial shock has worn off, the trauma lingers. \u201cI hear my shutters rattle at night, and I get excited,\u201d Mr. Smith added.One of the businesses hit badly by the storm was the marine industry. Harbors are littered with ferries that capsized or were washed ashore, leaving fewer vessels to carry supplies back and forth. Masts from sunken sailboats jut out of the water. Charter boats, a big economic driver, lie on beaches, their hulls ripped open.Reinforcing the sense of despair, St. Croix was hit especially hard by Maria after being spared the worst of Irma\u2019s ferocity. And what had been a staging ground there for relief operations for St. Thomas and St. John was suddenly thrown into a state of emergency.A week after Maria blew through, the recovery efforts were still lumbering to get off the ground. Power lines sit in tangled piles on the side of the road. Some droop down from broken poles and slap the windshields of cars as they pass by. Houses have been knocked from their foundations and rest precariously on steep hillsides. Piles of garbage grow larger and more fetid by the day, rotting in the tropical sun.And help from the local and federal government can be hard to come by. When the public clinic on St. John ran out of essential medicines like tetanus shots and did not have doctors and nurses to relieve its overtaxed staff, it was a private individual, Tom Secunda, a co-founder of Bloomberg L.P., who flew them in on a company jet and ferried them to St. John while the federal government kept the ports closed. The company has also donated generators and sent staff to help with recovery logistics.With no commercial air traffic allowed in or out of the St. Thomas airport, evacuations are being left to wealthy individuals with ties to the islands, including Mr. Secunda and Kenny Chesney, the country singer, who chartered a plane usually used by Nascar to get people and their pets out on Tuesday.Even as relief begins to flow, residents understand that normalcy will not return for months, if not years.Kimmeiqua Mahoney sat in what was left of her apartment in a public housing development in the Tutu section of St. Thomas this week, kneading dough for johnny cakes as her fianc\u00e9 fried them in a pan heated with chunks of broken drywall \u2014 his improvisation for charcoal. Ms. Mahoney has two weeks until she is supposed to give birth to her third child, a girl.She rubbed her belly and looked outside at where there used to be a wall. She said she had no idea where she would live or work after she has her baby. Her job as a warehouse supervisor at a nearby resort is gone. And she has no idea if the housing stipend the government is offering her will cover her expenses. She cannot access her bank account because she has no internet. Neither do the grocery stores, which cannot process her food stamps.\u201cAlready the island was short on jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now we\u2019re just filing for unemployment because it\u2019s the only thing we can do.\u201dA picture caption in an earlier version of this article misstated the location of a ferry terminal littered with ship wreckage.

{"Headline": "The Cold Warrior Who Never Apologized", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67As Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, wrote in his book \u201cDereliction of Duty,\u201d the early stages of the Vietnam War caught America\u2019s military leaders flat-footed. Having gone through World War II and Korea, they were all ready for a conventional war. But insurgencies and unconventional warfare were something else. As a result, they were inordinately acquiescent to the wishful thinking of their civilian overseers \u2014 and no one thought more wishfully about the war than Walt Whitman Rostow.A Yale Ph.D. and a Rhodes scholar, Rostow left his academic perch at M.I.T. to join the State Department under John F. Kennedy; he was later Lyndon Johnson\u2019s national security adviser during the center-cut of American involvement in Vietnam, from April 1966 to January 1969. More than anyone else, he epitomized the overweening confidence of the civilian strategists of the era \u2014 he was the best and the brightest of \u201cthe best and the brightest.\u201d He could lay distant claim to operational warfighting competence, having selected bombing targets as a major in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. But like many other prominent civilian strategists of the day, he was by training and disposition an economist and a technocrat.In his 1960 book \u201cThe Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto,\u201d Rostow posited that robust growth was a nation\u2019s best insurance against the political emergence of Communism, and cast growth as a multistage process that depended crucially on a \u201ctakeoff\u201d period propelled by rapid expansion in key segments of an economy. Though criticized as tendentiously Western-centric, the book attracted Kennedy\u2019s attention. In a matter of months, Rostow moved from holding forth in the academy to planning America\u2019s strategy in Vietnam, tightly guided by his ideas about economic development.Most leading civilian strategists, who were so inventive and authoritative on nuclear strategy, steered a safe middle course between withdrawal and escalation in Vietnam, and did not enunciate big strategic concepts to guide the prosecution of the war. Rostow was different. He believed that the Vietcong were impeding South Vietnam\u2019s advancement to the takeoff stage, and that the United States therefore needed to expend all necessary military and diplomatic means to stop the Vietcong\u2019s guerrilla infiltration. This was a neatly packaged but narrow vision that both opened the door to expansive military action but also reduced it to an adjunct of politics and economics.Along those lines, Rostow reflexively argued for a \u201cflexible response\u201d when it came to military escalation, from ratcheting up the role of military \u201cadvisers\u201d \u2014 that is, embedded Special Forces \u2014 in the early 1960s, to bombing North Vietnam starting in 1965, to steadily increasing the United States\u2019 expeditionary combat presence in the mid- and late 1960s. Directly defeating the enemy was never the goal; military action was just a way to apply pressure, to maximize psychological intimidation \u2014 what came to be known as the \u201cRostow thesis.\u201dBut crucially, Rostow didn\u2019t actually know much about fighting a war. Any soldier could have told him that increased bombing or troop levels were not the same as, say, increasing food aid. Nor could one rely on data in the same way when it came to war. Rostow was one of the most avid followers of the weekly body counts, equating the number of enemy reported killed with military progress, as if he were reading the latest reports on grain production.In November 1967, an increasingly wary Robert McNamara, the secretary of defense, raised the idea of reassessing the war effort, shifting greater combat responsibility to the South Vietnamese \u2014 the policy that would become known as \u201cVietnamization\u201d under President Richard Nixon \u2014 and a bombing halt. Rostow agreed to the first two measures, but opposed the third, and President Johnson sided with him.Despite McNamara\u2019s crisis of confidence \u2014 he departed the Pentagon in February 1968 \u2014 Rostow continued to comb through intelligence reports looking for reassuring factoids. During the Tet offensive he denied even the possibility that the surprise attacks had provided a psychological shot in the arm to the Vietcong, concentrating instead on the huge casualties American and South Vietnamese forces had inflicted on them. \u201cThis is a great victory for our side,\u201d he told a colleague while they sat in the White House Situation Room. The ensuing 24-day battle for Hue, an agonizing engagement that American forces would also tactically win, drove home the strength of the enemy\u2019s determination and staying power. But Rostow never saw the battle that way.To the end, Rostow remained not just a supporter of the president, but a crutch. As David Halberstam wrote of Rostow in \u201cThe Best and the Brightest\u201d:He became the president\u2019s national security adviser at a time when criticism and opposition to the war were beginning to crystallize, and he eventually served the purpose of shielding the president from criticism and from reality. He deflected others\u2019 pessimism and rewarded those who were optimistic. It was not contrived; it was the way he was.The upshot was that Rostow\u2019s status as designated administration hawk in chief induced in him a preoccupation with bureaucratic politics and buoying morale that impaired his strategic objectivity as American frustrations in Vietnam mounted. He, more than any of Johnson\u2019s other advisers, was consumed with showing the press and the American public \u201clight at the end of the tunnel.\u201dThe historian David Milne has called Rostow \u201cAmerica\u2019s Rasputin.\u201d He was not alone as an early advocate for flexible response and a deepening commitment in Vietnam. But long after McNamara and others turned against the war, even as evidence mounted against the Rostow thesis, he remained steadfast.He remained a Cold Warrior until the end. In 1986 he superficially attributed the fall of Saigon to Congressional budget cuts. And he continued to insist that the war was worthwhile. Joining a wave of historical revisionists, he argued that the war had bought time for other Southeast Asian nations to consolidate Western-leaning governments and subdue Communist influences \u2014 in other words, that the domino theory was right. Like many of Kennedy\u2019s brain trust, Rostow was initially praised for his pragmatic, technocratic liberalism \u2014 but in his determination to impose his sterile ideas on the complicated realities of Southeast Asia, he proved to be as ideologically committed as the Communists he so adamantly opposed.Jonathan Stevenson, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, was the director for political-military affairs, Middle East and North Africa, on the National Security Council from 2011 to 2013.Advertisement"}

His governing coalition collapsed on Friday when the center-left Bright Future Party withdrew its support over the letter and accusations that he had attempted to cover it up.The letter from Mr. Benediktsson\u2019s father, Benedikt Sveinsson, sought a form of civil pardon for Hjalti Sigurjon Hauksson, an acquaintance who was sentenced in 2004 to five-and-a-half years in prison for raping and sexually abusing his stepdaughter over a 12-year period until she was 18.Mr. Sveinsson\u2019s letter, written in June last year, became public last week, but the justice minister, Sigridur Andersen, said that she had told Mr. Benediktsson about it two months ago.Bright Future has accused the government of a \u201cserious breach of trust\u201d for concealing the existence of the letter, and politicians across the political spectrum have seized on the scandal to call for greater transparency.Mr. Benediktsson said he had been shocked to learn of his father\u2019s letter. \u201cI want to stress that it was a shock for me to hear this,\u201d he said at a news conference on Friday. \u201cI could never have signed such a letter and I would never have defended such actions.\u201dMr. Sveinsson apologized in a statement released last week, saying that he in no way absolved Mr. Hauksson of responsibility for his crimes. \u201cI did not think of it as something that would justify Hjalti\u2019s position toward his victim,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhat was supposed to be a small gesture of good will toward a convicted criminal has instead turned into a continuation of the tragedy for the victim. For this I again apologize.\u201dThat revelation prompted thousands of angry Icelanders to take to the streets, and spurred anger now being intensified by this latest scandal.Mr. Helgason said the financial crisis still exerted a powerful influence on Icelandic voters. \u201cThe distrust makes governments fragile and politicians more afraid of voters,\u201d he said.

The decline is a result of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The 32 states and District of Columbia that participate in the A.C.A.\u2019s expansion of Medicaid for low-income families had larger declines in their uninsured populations than states that do not participate. Massachusetts, for example, a pioneer in broad coverage, has the lowest uninsured rate in the nation, 2.5 percent, while Texas, which rejected Medicaid expansion, has the highest, 16.6 percent.The data also show the success of federal safety-net programs. If not for tax credits for low-income workers, an additional 8.2 million people would have been classified as poor last year. Similarly, food stamps and low-income housing aid lifted 3.6 million and 3.1 million people, respectively, out of poverty last year.For all the improvement, however, broad prosperity remains elusive. For income gains to meaningfully raise living standards, they would have had to exceed the peak from before the recession, not merely met it. One in eight Americans, 40.6 million people, are still poor. Some 28.1 million are still without health coverage.And yet, Republican policy makers seem determined to undo the progress that has been made. The Trump administration has opposed Obama-era rules to update the nation\u2019s overtime-pay protections for salaried workers, arguably the single most important policy option to raise middle-class pay. President Trump and the House Budget Committee have both issued budget proposals for 2018 that call for deep spending cuts to safety-net programs. This week, the Republican senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina plan to introduce yet another draconian bill to end Obamacare.Those giant steps backward would all shift income up the economic ladder. They would also create fiscal room for big tax cuts for the rich, a grail of Republican policy, despite the poor job and wage growth after the tax cuts of the George W. Bush era.The result would be greater income inequality, the one measure that did not improve in the new Census data. Income gains at the top far outstripped those at the bottom.Republicans\u2019 policies would undermine the gains of average Americans. Incompetence and public opposition have limited their success so far. They will not give up, though, so neither can the opposition.Advertisement"}

Now it\u2019s trying a different approach.Why? To double down on producing its own hardware. Google has been especially focused on its Pixel line of premium smartphones, some of which are made by HTC and have gotten good reviews.Apple has followed a similar strategy for years, and that has provided the iPhone maker with an easier path when adding new features, such as augmented reality functions, since it designs nearly all of the internal parts of its phone.A beefier hardware team should also help Google bring much more of the design in-house. It should also help it realize some of its bigger smartphone hardware ambitions, which include things like making its own SoCs and building machine learning coprocessors.FlashbackGoogle was in hardware once before: It paid $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in 2010. It sold that business to Lenovo for just $2.9 billion three years later.The decision to buy Motorola was \u201cthe extravagance of being a company with over $350 billion in market cap,\u201d said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Motorola was fixable, and growth is much easier to come by on a company that\u2019s not a fixer-upper.\u201dStandard & Poor\u2019s move, which cut China\u2019s sovereign rating to A+ from AA-, was its first reduction in the rating since 1999.

It is believed the intrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, jeopardize the operations of the commission, or result in systemic risk.The disclosure, coming on the heels of a data breach at Equifax, the major consumer credit reporting firm, will likely intensify concerns over potential computer vulnerabilities lurking among pillars of the American financial system.\u201cSo, as you may have read, I was fired by the president of the United States.\u201dThe HighlightAt the start of the podcast, Mr. Bharara recounted his interactions with Mr. Trump in the months leading up to his dismissal as a United States attorney.

{"Headline": "Saudis Wonder What\u2019s Next After the King Allows Women to Drive", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Rights groups attacked it. Conservatives defended it. Comedians sang about it. A king had vowed to end it, but died without doing so.While the change does not take effect until next June, the announcement was so abrupt it stunned the country. Many Saudis took to social media on Wednesday to express their joy, or consternation, over the end of the driving ban and to debate what other relaxations might be on the way.\u201cIt didn\u2019t solve all the issues, but it made them one less,\u201d said Muna AbuSulayman, a Saudi television presenter. She called the change \u201cone step closer to being a full citizen.\u201dFor decades, the issue of women driving has been a key battlefield for the fight over the nature of the Saudi state and its future.Built on an alliance between a royal family and the descendants of an ultraconservative Muslim cleric, Saudi Arabia has struggled throughout its history with how to reconcile modernization with loyalty to religious heritage.That debate heated up as oil wealth enriched the state, bringing in unfamiliar customs and technologies like television, public education and automobiles.Over time, competing camps dug in around women and the right to drive.For liberals, the driving ban was a blot on the national brand that was hampering modernization and weakening the economy.Conservatives, including powerful clerics employed by the state, thought that allowing women to drive would be a crack in the dam that would allow secularism to flood in, washing away the kingdom\u2019s unique Islamic identity.The royal decree announced on Tuesday handed victory in that battle to the reformers, who had gained an advantage in recent years because of demographics, economics and the country\u2019s young leadership, analysts said.The government also worked behind the scenes to control the message.At least eight prominent women\u2019s activists received calls and text messages from Saudi security officials warning them not to tweet or speak to the news media about the issue, according to three Saudi activists.They presumed the government did not want to give credit to activists for prompting the change and spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize the women \u2014 or themselves.Many women cheered the decision, calling it a final victory in a long campaign for social change.Manal al-Sherif, who was jailed for having posted videos of herself driving and who wrote a book about her activism, said her life had tracked the wider social changes in the kingdom.Born into a poor conservative family in Mecca, Ms. Sherif, now 38, was taught that women were to remain at home and that good Muslims were to avoid \u201cinfidels\u201d who did not share their faith, she said by phone from Australia, where she now lives.Her worldview changed when as a university student in the Red Sea port city of Jidda, she saw women who did not cover their faces in public and even had boyfriends, though covertly.Then she got a job with the state oil company, Saudi Aramco. On its sprawling compound women enjoy greater freedoms than elsewhere in the kingdom, including the ability to drive.She said that the status of women in Saudi Arabia had been used by the government over the years to placate conservatives.\u201cOur rights as women were always used in a political game, and that is what we wanted to stop,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really kept the country behind.\u201d\u201cThe government took the right decision,\u201d she said. \u201cFinally, they had the guts to say, \u2018We were wrong.\u2019\u201dIt was difficult to immediately gauge reactions to the rescinded ban among more conservative Saudis. The government recently arrested more than two dozen people, including prominent clerics, some of whom had criticized government policies.Three clerics employed by the government declined to comment when asked for their thoughts on the rescinded ban.\u201cHahahahahahaha,\u201d one responded on Whats App, offering no further comment.Social media provided a glimpse.By midafternoon on Wednesday, the Arabic hashtag \u201cThe people reject women driving\u201d had appeared on 335,000 tweets, while the hashtag \u201cThe king is victorious for women driving\u201d had appeared in only 33,700 tweets, according to Twitter.But many users used the hashtags to join discussions, even if they disagreed with their message.Even longtime campaigners said they expected some resistance.\u201cWe\u2019re a religious country,\u201d said Fawziah Al-Bakr, a professor who has been campaigning for the right to drive for nearly three decades.But religion had nothing to do with the issue, she said, noting that women in other predominately Muslim countries like Egypt, Sudan and Pakistan have been driving for a long time.\u201cAll these women are Muslim and yet they are driving,\u201d she said. \u201cNot being able to drive has nothing to do with Islam.\u201dPrevious reforms have been met with great resistance in the kingdom. Conservatives campaigned against the introduction of television, fearing it would fill Saudi homes with un-Islamic images.Now many Saudi clerics have their own shows and are enthusiastic users of social media.They also tried to prevent girls\u2019 education.Now many of their daughters are studying in Saudi universities, and even in the United States.For many Saudi women, gaining the right to drive is not the end of the struggle. Many hope the government\u2019s next step will be to lift its so-called \u201cguardianship laws,\u201d which require women to have the permission of a male \u201cguardian\u201d in order to get a passport, travel abroad or undergo certain medical procedures.That could take time, but Ms. AbuSulayman, the television presenter, said the trajectory was clear.About two thirds of the kingdom\u2019s 22 million citizens are under 30 and they will grow up seeing women differently than their elders, she said. Many will not remember when women could not drive.\u201cI actually hate driving,\u201d she said, laughing, but still planned to get a Saudi license.Yousur Al-Hlou contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Big Banks Became Our Masters", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTen years on from the financial crisis, it\u2019s hard not to have a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Financial scandal and wrangles over financial rule-making still dominate the headlines. The cyberhacking at Equifax compromised personal records for half of the adult population of the United States. At SoFi, a one-time fintech darling that offers student loans and other types of credit, the chief executive was forced to resign after revelations of sexual harassment and risky lending practices (the company misled investors about its finances and put inexperienced customer service representatives in charge of credit evaluations). The White House and Republicans in Congress in the meantime are trying to roll back hard-won banking regulations in the Dodd-Frank financial oversight law.All of it brings to mind an acronym familiar to financial writers like myself \u2014 BOB, or \u201cbored of banking.\u201d Even some of us that cover the markets for a living can find ourselves BOB. Over the last 10 years, there has been so much financial scandal, so many battles between regulators and financiers, and so much complexity (more liquidity and less leverage with your tier one capital, anyone?) that a large swath of the public has become numb to the debate about how to make our financial system safer.That\u2019s a dangerous problem, because despite all of the wrangling and rule making, there\u2019s a core truth about our financial system that we have yet to comprehend fully: It isn\u2019t serving us, we\u2019re serving it.Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, envisioned financial services (and I stress the word \u201cservice\u201d) as an industry that didn\u2019t exist as an end in itself, but rather as a helpmeet to other types of business. Yet lending to Main Street is now a minority of what the largest banks in the country do. In the 1970s, most of their financial flows, which of course come directly from our savings, would have been funneled into new business investment. Today, only about 15 percent of the money coming out of the largest financial institutions goes to that purpose. The rest exists in a closed loop of trading; institutions facilitate and engage in the buying and selling of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets that mainly enriches the 20 percent of the population that owns 80 percent of that asset base. This doesn\u2019t help growth, but it does fuel the wealth gap.This fundamental shift in the business model of finance is what we should really be talking about \u2014 rather than the technocratic details of liquidity ratios or capital levels or even how to punish specific banking misdeeds. The big problem is that our banking system would no longer be recognizable to Adam Smith, who believed that for markets to work, all players must have equal access to information, transparent prices and a shared moral framework. Good luck with that today.While the largest banks can correctly claim that they have offloaded risky assets and bolstered the amount of cash on their balance sheets over the last decade, their business model has become fundamentally disconnected from the very people and entities it was designed to serve. Small community banks, which make up only 13 percent of all banking assets, do nearly half of all lending to small businesses. Big banks are about deal making. They serve mostly themselves, existing as the middle of the hourglass that is our economy, charging whatever rent they like for others to pass through. (Finance is one of the few industries in which fees have gone up as the sector as a whole has grown.) The financial industry, dominated by the biggest banks, provides only 4 percent of all jobs in the country, yet takes about a quarter of the corporate profit pie.Perhaps that\u2019s why companies of all stripes try to copy its model. Nonfinancial firms as a whole now get five times the revenue from purely financial activities as they did in the 1980s. Stock buybacks artificially drive up the price of corporate shares, enriching the C-suite. Airlines can make more hedging oil prices than selling coach seats. Drug companies spend as much time tax optimizing as they do worrying about which new compound to research. The largest Silicon Valley firms now use a good chunk of their spare cash to underwrite bond offerings the same way Goldman Sachs might.The blending of technology and finance has reached an apex with the creation of firms like SoFi, which put the same old models on big data steroids. It\u2019s an area we\u2019ll likely hear much more about. A couple of weeks ago, at the Senate Banking Committee hearings on fintech, lawmakers once again struggled with how to think about these latest lending crises. But it\u2019s not data or privacy or algorithms that are the fundamental issue with our financial system. It\u2019s the fact that the system itself has lost its core purpose.Finance has become the tail that wags the dog. Until we start talking about how to create a financial system that really serves society, rather than just trying to stay ahead of the misdeeds of one that doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll struggle in vain to bridge the gap between Wall Street and Main Street.An Op-Ed essay on Wednesday about big banks included an outdated description of the online lending start-up Social Finance, or SoFi. It no longer uses crowdsourcing to fund loans.Rana Foroohar, an associate editor and global business columnist at The Financial Times, is the author of \u201cMakers and Takers: How Wall Street Destroyed Main Street.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marching to a Second Term, de Blasio Faces a Diminished Mayoralty", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio should be at the peak of his powers. Crime is down. The economy is up. He has scared away his most serious possible challengers this election year.But in two dozen interviews, with Mr. de Blasio\u2019s own aides and allies, city officials, leading political strategists and veterans of New York politics, there was near-universal agreement that though Mr. de Blasio is on more of a glide path to re-election in New York City than any mayor in a generation, he is still struggling to project his political voice in a job that has long produced towering national figures.If Rudolph W. Giuliani ended up as \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d and Michael R. Bloomberg exited office with lofty talk of being \u201cmayor of the world,\u201d Mr. de Blasio\u2019s moniker, as he heads toward the Democratic primary on Tuesday, is still very much to be determined.\u201cHe just didn\u2019t have the stars lined up like they did because a lot of being a national figure is based on the national climate,\u201d said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a supporter of Mr. de Blasio, adding that \u201cthe national climate in the age of de Blasio\u201d did not afford the mayor \u201ca clear shot to be the progressive symbol.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just functional,\u201d said Eric Phillips, the mayor\u2019s spokesman. \u201cYou might be surprised but most people don\u2019t recognize him outside of New York City.\u201dDespite Mr. de Blasio\u2019s efforts to take his message national, other progressives, most notably Senator Bernie Sanders, more thoroughly captured the left\u2019s imagination. His equivocation on endorsing Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, angered traditional Democratic power brokers, leaving him fewer loyalists on either end of the party\u2019s ideological spectrum.The last three New York mayors who made a clear national imprint \u2014 Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Giuliani and Edward I. Koch in the 1980s \u2014 all assumed power in a moment of crisis: Mr. Bloomberg after the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Giuliani amid a crime epidemic and Mr. Koch in the wake of fiscal calamity. They forged their reputations from those acute challenges, and New York\u2019s recoveries were seen as standard-bearing moments for the rest of the country. Even David Dinkins, whose mayoralty was far more low key, was a nationally recognized figure as the first black mayor of New York.But New York is not the center of an increasingly fractured and segmented nation the way it once was, and its mayor is no longer seen as a natural representative of the country as a whole.The mayor, who declined to be interviewed for this article, often sounds surprised he does not get more credit for his achievements.Kathryn Wylde, the chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, one of the city\u2019s leading business groups, said the difference comes down to \u201cconvening power.\u201d\u201cBloomberg didn\u2019t depend on being mayor for that power,\u201d she said of the billionaire businessman and philanthropist. \u201cBloomberg had a global reach. De Blasio\u2019s convening power is entirely local, and with other mayors. It\u2019s that of a mayor.\u201dIn February, Mr. de Blasio went to Atlanta to campaign for his choice to lead the national Democratic Party. But despite being among the most prominent elected officials working the halls, Mr. de Blasio was not tapped to deliver one of Representative Keith Ellison\u2019s official nominating speeches. (He did speak at another event.) The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, delivered a nominating address for former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who won.Rebecca Katz, one of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s former top aides at City Hall and a longtime adviser, said, \u201cThe challenge for Bill de Blasio was always that he was focused on getting people out of poverty and that\u2019s just not sexy to the media the same way as personality.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s team sees his mission as catering to people \u2014 many of them black, Latino and poor \u2014 long ignored by the New York power set. They form his political base; the elites grousing about his reduced stature do not.From the start, Mr. de Blasio framed his ambitions beyond the traditional municipal charges of trash and potholes \u2014 but in terms of enacting a progressive agenda as the first Democrat to rule the city in two decades. In his inaugural address, he acknowledged \u201ca city government\u2019s first responsibilities\u201d are clean streets, safe neighborhoods and good public transportation, but he declared, \u201cWe know that our mission reaches deeper.\u201dLess than a year and a half later, Mr. de Blasio stood at Gracie Mansion to reveal his grand plan to take his vision for income inequality nationwide, anchored by his hosting a presidential forum on the topic. It was April 2015. Senator Bernie Sanders was still weeks away from being a candidate for president. There was a seeming opening on the left.But the mayor had to cancel the forum when no candidates agreed to attend. He formed a group to lobby for a national progressive agenda, including taking a trip to the nation\u2019s capital and Iowa, but it has since disbanded. He dragged out his decision to endorse Hillary Clinton for months, despite having managed her campaign for Senate in 2000. He was repaid with that undesirable speaking slot.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s diversions into national politics came at the price of appearing ineffectual on a larger stage and disengaged back home.Chris McNickle, the author of three books on New York mayors, including a forthcoming one on Mr. Bloomberg, said Mr. de Blasio \u201cdoesn\u2019t project the kind of command of city government that we associate with the strongest mayors.\u201d\u201cLa Guardia, Koch, Giuliani and Bloomberg all were forceful personalities that projected a sense of being in control of city affairs in a way Mr. de Blasio hasn\u2019t matched,\u201d Mr. McNickle said.Constant feuding with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, has also hampered Mr. de Blasio. In recent days, both men refused to endorse each other for re-election.Some of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s confidantes, both current and former, have grown frustrated with what they describe as the mayor\u2019s self-defeating righteousness, especially when it comes to his relationship with the media. He has refused advice from friends that things like his late-morning chauffeured trips to a Brooklyn gym damage his public image. They worry that his scolding obscures his successes.\u201cThe mayor hates the media as much as Trump does. I can understand this feeling sometimes, but generally you gain no advantage by bad-mouthing journalists,\u201d said Karen Hinton, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s former press secretary, who also praised the mayor\u2019s policy achievements.Mr. de Blasio has gained no advantage by shunning some traditional galas and black-tie affairs that past mayors have used to polish their reputation. Where Mr. Bloomberg once brought Lady Gaga as his guest to the New Year\u2019s Eve ball drop (they kissed on the lips), Mr. de Blasio attended his first ball drop as mayor with his wife and children (and later questioned why so many revelers brave the cold in Times Square anyway.)\u201cHe made a gamble that people care more about him addressing income inequality, or the affordability crisis, than they do about him hanging out at fancy events,\u201d said Mr. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s spokesman. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see who won that gamble.\u201dWith Democrats out of power in Washington, Mr. de Blasio has already begun to cast himself as a counterweight to Mr. Trump in the president\u2019s hometown and will likely have another full term to burnish his image. He has said he is not running for president but those close to him say he wants to shape the Democratic debate.\u201cHe will probably emerge much more nationally in his second term because you\u2019ve got an enemy in the White House,\u201d Mr. Sharpton predicted.But first, Mr. Sharpton offered the mayor some unsolicited advice. \u201cHe\u2019s got to stop getting in the little fights and get in the bigger-picture fights,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou run into a problem when you major in minors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The False Promises in President Trump\u2019s Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe president\u2019s claim also defies history. Wages have long stagnated, despite tax cuts in the 1980s and 2000s, while profits, shareholder returns and executive pay have soared. Profits, whether lifted by favorable economic conditions, by tax cuts or by both, have not translated into employee raises and have instead been used for other purposes. One is to buy back stock, which lifts share prices and, by extension, executive compensation. Following a huge one-off corporate tax cut in 2004, big piles of corporate cash were also used to pay dividends to shareholders, settle legal issues and finance severance packages for layoffs.Then, too, there is the budget issue. Mr. Trump has proposed cutting the top corporate rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, a point he emphasized on Wednesday despite warnings from his economic advisers that a cut that sizable would cause the deficit to explode. Separately, he and his advisers have also proposed ending taxation on the foreign profits of American corporations, even though such profits are often actually earned in the United States and simply relabeled as foreign through the use of complex accounting maneuvers.Over all, the cuts, paired with loophole closers, would cost at least $3.4 trillion in revenue in the first 10 years and $5.9 trillion over the following decade. The question is how House Republicans will deal with those potential deficits. Many of them have built their reputations as fiscal hawks. Even if they were inclined to set aside their professed aversion to deficits to pass a big tax cut, their scope for deficit financing has now been narrowed by the floods in Houston, which will force them to borrow and spend for relief and recovery efforts. That is a responsible thing to do in an emergency. Borrowing to cut taxes \u2014 akin to taking cash advances on a credit card \u2014 is not responsible, in good times or bad.The fixation on tax cuts is regrettable, because corporate tax reform is a worthy goal. Done right, it would lower the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent or so, bringing it more in line with the rates of other developed nations. It would also raise revenue by eliminating special-interest loopholes and enacting a small per-trade tax on financial transactions to account for the growth of financial markets in the nation\u2019s economy. As yet, there is no sign that Republicans are prepared to take that sensible path.Advertisement"}

Now, at 36, he has prematurely gray hair, but with the help of an Alcoholics Anonymous group he swears he has finally stopped drinking.In recent years, Iran, where alcohol has been illegal since the 1979 revolution and is taboo for devout Muslims, has taken the first step and admitted that, like most other nations, it has an alcohol problem.The relaxing of prohibition has allowed addicts like Mehdi to emerge from the shadows and embrace a new circle of friends \u2014 recovering alcoholics \u2014 who greeted him as he entered a West Tehran apartment one recent evening. \u201cI\u2019ve given up the bottle for 12 days now,\u201d said Mehdi, a tall computer specialist who requested anonymity because of the stigma still attached to alcoholism in Iran. To cheers and hoots, he added, \u201cThis is a big step for someone who was drunk most of the time.\u201dThe government is even running public campaigns warning Iranians not to drink and drive, something it never would have done in the past.Along roads leading to the Caspian Sea, a favorite holiday destination, billboards showing bottles of whiskey and crashed cars surprised many drivers. The Iranian police still organize media events where bulldozers squash thousands of bottles and cans confiscated from smugglers. But in contrast to the past, when the official line was that there was no drinking problem because no one drank, they now provide officers with breathalyzers.President Hassan Rouhani, who came to power in 2013, has been trying to insert realism into Iran\u2019s often strict ideology. The decision to open more alcohol treatment clinics came from his Health Ministry, and reflects the way many social changes are introduced in Iran: quietly ordered and carried out by local governments under the radar.One reason is that alcohol is relatively easy to procure. There are alcohol suppliers anyone can call, and they will deliver whatever you want to your doorstep. Dealers receive their goods through a vast illegal distribution network that serves millions with alcohol brought in from neighboring Iraq.To some extent, the sheer availability of alcohol is driving the changes in official attitudes.\u201cThese days there is so much alcohol available, simply punishing everybody and using force is no longer working,\u201d said Reza Konjedi, 36, a former alcoholic who runs several Alcoholics Anonymous support groups in Tehran. \u201cDrinking and bootlegging used to be viewed as equal crimes, and people would be lashed for being abusers. Now, security officials, the municipality, they all view alcoholics not as criminals, but as patients who need treatment.\u201dBefore the revolution, Iran\u2019s national spirit was aragh sagi, or \u201cdog spirit,\u201d which was distilled from raisins and contained 65 percent ethanol. It remains popular and is typically sold in four-gallon jerrycans.In July, after three people died and dozens were poisoned in the city of Sirjan, a former police chief went so far as to publish an open letter calling for an end to the taboo on alcohol.Mehdi was brought into the group by Mr. Konjedi, after nearly a decade of run-ins with the law. He said he drank to forget. \u201cMoney problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy is not good here. Whenever I would feel pressure, I would get a bottle and drink it.\u201dMr. Konjedi\u2019s wife, Samin \u2014 they met through A.A. \u2014 said she needed at least two meetings a day to prevent her from taking up the bottle. \u201cIt\u2019s like chemotherapy,\u201d she said. \u201cI constantly need a dose to cure my disease.\u201dA.A. and another group, Aware Anonymous, sponsor groups across the country, Mr. Konjedi said, adding that there were dozens in Tehran alone and over a thousand nationwide.A week earlier we met around 7 a.m. at a regular A.A. meeting in a municipal building in the western part of town. Next to the room, which was provided rent-free, were a kindergarten and a room for Quran classes. Inside were 15 men and women who nearly every day would meet to help one another stay sober.\u201cLocal governments across the country are asking for our help, and facilitating our groups, because they are seeing that our work is effective,\u201d Mr. Konjedi said.The only thing lacking is an official permit, something even groups fighting drug addiction have. That is because the Quran mentions the evils of wine but has nothing to say about drugs. \u201cIn Islam alcohol is seen by some as more dangerous than drugs,\u201d Samin said. \u201cThis while many in the society see drugs as being much worse.\u201dIn fact, some Iranians, especially in larger cities, view alcohol as something completely normal. On a recent midweek evening, eight Iranians met at a rooftop, where the red wine, vodka and aragh sagi flowed freely.One guest said he had been arrested recently for drunken driving and was now awaiting lashings. Another said he, like many others, had developed liver problems because of regular drinking. Some people joked that they were alcoholics.Mr. Konjedi said that he had seen the number of people with alcohol problems increase over the years, from a decade ago when he himself was homeless and drinking hard. \u201cWe need more billboards, more groups, to help them,\u201d he said.He did not want to comment on whether the nearly 40-year prohibition was the best way to prevent people from drinking. \u201cAt least our officials are now taking the right steps to deal with those who are suffering,\u201d Mr. Konjedi said. \u201cWe should be happy with that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will a Corporate Tax Holiday Give Workers Anything to Cheer?", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThey had lobbied hard for this \u2014 dangling before members of Congress the promise that the repatriated money would add more than 500,000 jobs in the United States over the next two years, as companies paid down debt and engaged in more capital spending, acquisitions, and research and development.The smell of a tax holiday is back in the air. From Apple to Facebook to Starbucks, big business is waiting with bated breath for details on President Trump\u2019s promise to slash the tax rate on profits held abroad to encourage companies to bring the money home.Of course, the standard claims are being made about the vast stimulative effects of the repatriated cash. They are being met this time with vigorous counterclaims based on the results of the Bush administration\u2019s shot over a decade ago.Pfizer, for instance, brought back $35.5 billion, the largest amount repatriated by a single company during the tax holiday, according to the Senate report. Then it turned around and spent over $20 billion in stock repurchases from 2005 to 2007. By 2007, the aggregate compensation of its top five executives was nearly $13 million higher than in 2004. Its United States payroll was 12,000 smaller.The pattern was similar across most repatriating companies. Hewlett-Packard, which brought home $14.5 billion, bought back $22 billion worth of stock over the three years and cut its payroll by more than 8,500. The tobacco company Altria, which brought over $6 billion home during the holiday, spent $2.5 billion on share buybacks and bumped pay in the executive ranks by more than $50 million, but cut 6,000 jobs.With a new move afoot to put such holdings back on American books, there is a critical question that is too quickly glossed over: Why do businesses act this way? Why didn\u2019t corporate executives invest more in their businesses and their work forces? Why did they go to the trouble of dribbling around a rule forbidding the use of repatriated profits to pay themselves a bonus? (Note to Congress: Money is fungible.)Call me na\u00efve. Professor Forbes and her colleagues \u2014 indeed, many economists \u2014 might swat the question away by arguing that businesses didn\u2019t use the extra cash to invest and employ because they were well-run businesses, well invested and sufficiently staffed to maximize their profitability.Still, the question should resonate in an administration that came to power on a promise to address the plight of the working class. Because the working class stands on the other end of a deal with the corporate class. I don\u2019t think it is possible to fully address workers\u2019 demands without understanding, and changing, corporate motivations.Many forces have shaped this deal, including technology, which replaced workers performing routine tasks, and globalization, which squeezed the margins of many businesses and exposed their workers to competition from cheap labor markets. And yet it would be a mistake to ignore the impact of a corporate ethos that has come to focus on rewarding shareholders and executives at the expense of any other consideration \u2014 be it workers\u2019 welfare or even the company\u2019s long-term sustainability. Indeed, workers today amount to little more than a line on the cost side of businesses\u2019 balance sheets, with little claim to its prosperity.\u201cHow you divide the pie is a choice,\u201d said Rick Wartzman, who heads the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute of Claremont Graduate University. \u201cIt is being carved differently.\u201dThe good news is that it is not impossible to modify the behavior of the corporate leaders who have so drastically altered the contract with their work force over the last few decades. While it may be tempting to cast the new breed of executives as selfish villains who somehow lost their sense of right and wrong, the shift in their behavior responded to a shift in the incentives they faced. It was fed by a belief that snaked its way three or four decades ago from the halls of the University of Chicago through investment-bank trading floors and into the corner offices of corporate America: that the interests of corporate managers must be brought into tight alignment with those of shareholders. It was accompanied by one of the most destabilizing propositions in the modern history of corporate governance: This alignment was best achieved by paying corporate managers almost exclusively with stock.Professor Desai points out that in the end, this structure does not really serve shareholders, at least not those with an interest in a company\u2019s prosperity more than a few quarters down the road. \u201cCapitalism seems to be serving managers and investment managers at the expense of shareholders,\u201d he wrote.Changing this behavior is not beyond the reach of policy. Just as changes in the tax treatment of executive pay in the 1990s encouraged stock-based remuneration, tax reforms might motivate corporate executives to invest for the long term rather than for an immediate stock bump \u2014 maybe even encourage stable employment and worker training. Until then, offering tax breaks to American corporations seems more likely to line the pockets of executives and shareholders than to improve their long-term prospects or the prosperity of their workers.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China Piles on Debt, Consumers Seek a Piece of the Action", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQIQIHAR, China \u2014 Over the past eight years, to the world\u2019s growing alarm, China\u2019s big state-owned companies and powerful local governments have borrowed trillions of dollars to get what they want.Now, it\u2019s Li Jing\u2019s turn.Ms. Li, a 33-year-old car saleswoman here in the middle of China\u2019s declining industrial zone, is one of the growing millions of Chinese using mortgages and credit cards to finance a middle-class lifestyle. Over the past two years, she and her husband have bought and remodeled a $120,000 apartment and purchased two new cars for $30,000 apiece.To help pay for it all, they took out a 10-year mortgage that absorbs nearly a third of their monthly income \u2014 once considered an unusual amount of debt in a country that used to depend almost solely on cash.\u201cI view the mortgage as a form of savings,\u201d Ms. Li said, \u201cbecause in 10 years, I\u2019ll own the whole apartment.\u201dChinese central bank data shows that consumer loans have grown almost 50 percent since the start of last year, when the government began encouraging more lending to households. That lending could grow considerably higher: The International Monetary Fund said it expected China\u2019s household debt as a percentage of its economic output to double by 2022 compared with a decade before.There are signs that China is moving on the fringes to contain mortgage lending, in part to tame housing costs. In the past week, banks in Beijing began raising mortgage interest rates. In a lengthening list of China\u2019s largest cities, banks are under instructions to discourage the use of personal loans for real estate speculation. Six large cities established new home sales restrictions in recent days to cool off prices.\u201cChina will get less of a kick out of consumer debt in the coming 18 months than it did in the past 18 months,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, an economist with Oxford Economics, a British research firm.Some economists also worry that consumer loans may be a backdoor way for bloated companies to maintain or even expand their capacity. China\u2019s domestic automakers \u2014 many of which are state owned and suffer from too many underused factories \u2014 have unleashed a blizzard of zero-interest car loans in the past two years, often through their own financing subsidiaries. In that time, the majority of Chinese consumers began to pay for cars with credit instead of cash, according to J. D. Power and Associates, a global consulting firm.To be clear, most economists consider China\u2019s consumer credit splurge to be a good thing. Chinese families are nowhere near the borrowing levels of spendthrift Americans, whose household debt is equal to more than three-quarters of the annual economic output of the United States. In China, that measure is still less than half.Traditionally, China\u2019s state-controlled banking system focused on lending money to big state-owned companies. Economists view household lending as an appealing alternative to having banks shovel more money into unprofitable, debt-ridden state firms that cannot be closed because they provide jobs to millions of workers.So far, consumer lending has helped Chinese consumers weather the gradual slowdown in the country\u2019s economic growth in recent years. That is particularly true in places like Qiqihar, a city of five million in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. The local economy took a hit last year when a large steel mill closed a big blast furnace and overstaffed communal- and state-owned enterprises pushed out more than 40,000 workers.But even here, 500 miles north of China\u2019s border with North Korea, the local economy seems to be rebounding from a slump two years ago, when the national economy was looking shaky. Walk out the front door of the recently completed high-speed rail station in Qiqihar and no fewer than 45 cranes are visible, erecting apartment towers and office buildings. The city\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 6.4 percent in the first half of this year, up from 5.6 percent in the same period last year and nearly matching the national growth rate of 6.9 percent thus far this year.Borrowing has been a big help, residents say. Whereas apartments once sold for cash only, many people now offer down payments of between 20 percent and 30 percent and take out mortgages for the rest.\u201cCertainly more people tend to borrow when purchasing apartments,\u201d said Fu Shiqiang, a real estate agent. \u201cThey may want to get a bigger apartment or do business.\u201dZhao Ying, another property agent, said he used a credit card at supermarkets and shopping malls and bought a $21,000 Toyota Vios sedan last year with a zero-interest loan. He said he had bought his current apartment with cash but would do things differently next time.\u201cI will definitely get a mortgage,\u201d Mr. Zhao said. \u201cIt is very convenient, and I could use the leftover money to do some business or investment.\u201dMs. Li, the car saleswoman, and her husband built their wealth the traditional way. They bought an inexpensive, two-bedroom apartment in 2003 when they married. Her husband was given a small apartment by his employer. They bought a third apartment as an investment.Real estate prices have surged since then, and Ms. Li and her husband have cashed in. They sold all three units and bought a spacious, three-bedroom apartment for themselves and spent $30,000 to remodel it. They also bought a Volkswagen Tiguan and a Honda Accord.Their mortgage helps support that lifestyle. Ms. Li, who said nearly a third of her customers buy with credit, knows that they are not alone.\u201cWhen I got my first car in 2006, almost no one in my local community had one,\u201d Ms. Li said. \u201cNow the roads are packed, and it\u2019s really hard to find a place to park.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May Seeks to Unlock Brexit Talks in Florence Speech", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMrs. May\u2019s long-awaited intervention, during a speech in Florence, Italy, was being watched closely in capitals on the Continent and in London, where members of her cabinet have been fiercely divided over Britain\u2019s tortuous divorce from the bloc. The speech aimed to open the way to serious negotiations on what is commonly known as Brexit, and to a broader and more productive discussion about Britain\u2019s relationship with the bloc.However, while offering some concessions designed to do that, Mrs. May did not give any fresh insight into the type of ties she ultimately wants Britain to have to the bloc \u2014 a question that divides her cabinet and her Conservative, or Tory, Party.The European Union\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, issued a cautious response, saying in a statement that, \u201cWe look forward to the United Kingdom\u2019s negotiators explaining the concrete implications of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s speech. Our ambition is to find a rapid agreement on the conditions of the United Kingdom\u2019s orderly withdrawal, as well as on a possible transition period.\u201dAlthough Britain is scheduled to exit the European Union in 2019, there has been little progress in talks since March, when London formally announced its intention to leave. Brussels is insisting that Britain agree to the terms of the divorce before discussing future trade ties, while the British would like to do both simultaneously.Speaking in Florence on Friday, Mrs. May did not say precisely how much money Britain would continue to contribute to the European Union. But she made a significant promise that the British \u2014 who are big net contributors to the bloc \u2014 would not leave a hole in the union\u2019s budget in 2019 and 2020.\u201cI do not want our partners to fear that they will need to pay more or receive less over the remainder of the current budget plan as a result of our decision to leave,\u201d Mrs. May said.That would probably mean payments of around 20 billion euros, or about $24 billion, after Britain\u2019s departure. It would also effectively maintain the status quo for the duration of a two-year transition period, meaning that Britain would allow the free movement of European workers and accept rulings from the European Court of Justice.This alone is unlikely to be enough to satisfy the 27 other member nations, but Mrs. May hinted that she would be willing to go further and \u201chonor commitments we have made during the period of our membership.\u201dIn addition, Mrs. May proposed a security partnership with the European Union, stressing Britain\u2019s importance as a defense power, and also offered new legal safeguards to guarantee the rights of European Union citizens in Britain after Brexit.Over all, Mrs. May sought to stress the common interest London shares with continental European capitals in reaching an agreement and avoiding disruption to trade, wrapping her offer in dialogue that was more positive, and less antagonistic, than that of some previous interventions.European Union negotiators have refused to talk about post-Brexit ties until they judge that there is \u201csufficient progress\u201d on the issues they consider a priority: the status of European Union citizens in Britain after it leaves, the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland (which is a part of the United Kingdom) and Britain\u2019s financial commitments to the bloc.\u201cI think it is definitely a net plus in terms of moving it forward\u201d said Mats Persson, who was a special adviser to former Prime Minister David Cameron and is now head of international trade at the advisory firm EY. Mrs. May\u2019s language opened the possibility of a breakthrough over financial contributions, Mr. Persson said, though he expressed surprise at how little was new in Mrs. May\u2019s remarks about her hopes for the shape of the final Brexit deal.Mrs. May suggested that an arrangement like Norway\u2019s, which is part of Europe\u2019s single market, accepting its rules and the free movement of people, would not work for Britain. But she added that Britain could do better than a free trade deal of the type that Canada has negotiated with the European Union.Yet, there is little sign yet that the other 27 nations are prepared to grant Britain a bespoke agreement, and officials have warned London on numerous occasions that there would be no \u201ccherry picking\u201d of the parts of European Union membership it likes.The episode illustrated how the referendum last year on withdrawal, intended to end the Conservative Party\u2019s divisions over Europe, only sharpened them. To make matters worse, senior ministers are jockeying to succeed Mrs. May, who made a huge tactical mistake by calling a general election in June, in which her party lost its parliamentary majority.Mr. Johnson attended Mrs. May\u2019s speech in Florence alongside the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, who has led calls for a \u201csofter\u201d departure from the bloc that could afford greater protections for the economy.Afterward on Twitter, Mr. Johnson welcomed the speech and put his spin on its contents which he described as \u201cpositive, optimistic and dynamic.\u201dThat suggested that Mrs. May may succeed for now in reassuring most Brexit hard-liners that, when the all is said and done, Britain would not be bound by the bloc\u2019s economic, migration and legal rules.Not everyone was pleased with Mrs. May\u2019s speech. In a Twitter post, Manfred Weber, leader of the center-right group of political parties in the European Parliament, dismissed it as bringing \u201cno more clarity.\u201dIn Britain, Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party and a hard-line Brexit supporter, said that withdrawal had been \u201ckicked into the long grass.\u201dJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, described the speech as the \u201cproduct of the internal negotiation of the Tory Party rather than negotiations with the E.U.\u201dAnother opponent warned that this was just the first step on a long and costly road for Britain. The money that \u201cTheresa May is reportedly about to offer as the biggest divorce settlement in history would simply be the down payment,\u201d said Vince Cable, leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, who flatly oppose withdrawal. \u201cBrexit will cost a lot, lot more than this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Did Women Fare in China\u2019s Communist Revolution?", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRed CenturyBEIJING \u2014 My grandmother likes to tell stories from her career as a journalist in the early decades of the People\u2019s Republic of China. She recalls scrawling down Chairman Mao\u2019s latest pronouncements as they came through loudspeakers and talking with joyous peasants from the newly collectivized countryside. In what was her career highlight, she turned an anonymous candy salesman into a national labor hero with glowing praises for his service to the people.She had grown up in the central province of Hunan, where her father was a landlord. She talks about her mother as a glum housewife who resented her husband for taking a concubine after she had failed to give birth to a boy.\u201cThe Communists did many terrible things,\u201d my grandmother always says at the end of her reminiscences. \u201cBut they made women\u2019s lives much better.\u201dThat often-repeated dictum sums up the popular perception of Mao Zedong\u2019s legacy regarding women in China. As every Chinese schoolchild learns in history class, the Communists rescued peasant daughters from urban brothels and ushered cloistered wives into factories, liberating them from the oppression of Confucian patriarchy and imperialist threat.But the narrative of an across-the-board elevation of women\u2019s status under Mao contains crucial caveats.While the Communist revolution brought women more job opportunities, it also made their interests subordinate to collective goals. Stopping at the household doorstep, Mao\u2019s words and policies did little to alleviate women\u2019s domestic burdens like housework and child care. And by inundating society with rhetoric blithely celebrating its achievements, the revolution deprived women of the private language with which they might understand and articulate their personal experiences.When historians researched the collectivization of the Chinese countryside in the 1950s, an event believed to have empowered rural women by offering them employment, they discovered a complicated picture. While women indeed contributed enormously to collective farming, they rarely rose to positions of responsibility; they remained outsiders in communes organized around their husbands\u2019 family and village relationships. Studies also showed that women routinely performed physically demanding jobs but earned less than men, since the lighter, most valued tasks involving large animals or machinery were usually reserved for men.The urban workplace was hardly more inspiring. Women were shunted to collective neighborhood workshops with meager pay and dismal working conditions, while men were more commonly employed in comfortable big-industry and state-enterprise jobs. Party cadres\u2019 explanations for this reflected deeply entrenched gender prejudices: Women have a weaker constitution and gentler temper, rendering them unfit for the strenuous tasks of operating heavy equipment or manning factory floors.The party at times paid lip service to the equal sharing of domestic labor, but in practice it condoned women\u2019s continuing subordination in the home. In posters and speeches, female socialist icons were portrayed as \u201ciron women\u201d who labored heroically in front of steel furnaces while maintaining a harmonious family. But it was a cherry-picking approach that focused exclusively on bringing women into the work force and neglected their experiences in other realms.Visitors to rural areas saw peasant wives toiling around the clock: cooking, mending clothes and feeding livestock after finishing a day of work in the fields. Their plight shocked the urban youth who were sent down to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution, such that Naihua Zhang, a sociology professor at Florida Atlantic University who spent time in the countryside as a young woman in that era, equated rural marriage with a total erasure of women\u2019s identity.Researchers also observed that after marriage factory women often experienced slower career advancement than men as they became saddled with domestic responsibilities that left them with little time to learn new skills and take on extra work, both prerequisites for promotion. State services that promised to ease their burden, like public child care centers, were in reality few and far between. Unlike their counterparts in developed countries, Chinese women didn\u2019t have labor-saving household appliances, since Mao\u2019s economic policies prioritized heavy industry over the production of consumer products like washing machines and dishwashers.Some Western scholars have said these realities amounted to a \u201crevolution postponed.\u201d Yet the conclusions of researchers were contradicted by none other than Chinese women themselves.During her field study in China in 1970s, Margery Wolf, who was an anthropology professor at University of Iowa, was surprised by how effusive Chinese women were about the miracle of female emancipation in the very presence of their continued oppression.\u201cIt was easy to take gender equality \u2014 an ideal that was widely promoted \u2014 as the reality and regard problems as reminiscent of old systems and ideology that would erode with time,\u201d said Professor Zhang, the sociologist.The state rolled out propaganda campaigns aimed at not only enlisting women in the work force but also shaping their self-perception. Posters, textbooks and newspapers propagated images and narratives that, devoid of any particularities of personal experiences, depicted women as men\u2019s equal in outlook, value and achievement. For women in the workplace to adhere to this narrowly defined acceptable female image meant to see, understand and speak about their life not as it was, but as what it ought to be according to the party ideal.It is a measure of the campaign\u2019s success that women who publicly described their experiences in the Mao era did so exclusively in official rhetoric. Elisabeth Croll, an anthropologist specializing in Chinese women, observed that all published accounts of Chinese women\u2019s lives during the early decades of the People\u2019s Republic followed the standard narrative of their rise from mistreated wives and daughters to independent, socialist workers; it had become the story of practically every woman.Forty years after Mao\u2019s death, this aspect of his legacy is still understood through his famous pronouncement on gender equality, \u201cWomen hold up half the sky.\u201d It is a slogan my grandmother utters in the same breath as the chairman\u2019s other sins and deeds.She does not mention the arduous work of managing a household and raising three children amid tumultuous revolutionary campaigns. Nor does she complain about how she couldn\u2019t join the party because of her husband\u2019s unpopular political affiliations. She gives only a chuckle when she recalls the exhortations she once received from party superiors to marry just as her career was taking off.For all its flaws, the Communist revolution taught Chinese women to dream big. When it came to advice for my mother, my grandmother applauded her daughter\u2019s decision to go to graduate school and urged her to find a husband who would be supportive of her career. She still seems to think that the new market economy \u2014 with its meritocracy and freedom of choice \u2014 will finally allow women to be masters of their minds and actions.After all, she has always said to my mother, \u201cyou have more opportunities.\u201dHelen Gao is a social policy analyst at a research company and a contributing opinion writer.This is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of Communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Glow of De Blasio\u2019s Primary Victory Is Dimmed by a Cuomo Speech", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was not to be.Speaker after speaker praised Mr. Bloomberg, who had conceived of the tech campus when he was mayor and put the project in motion. But it was Mr. Cuomo who damned the current mayor with not even the faintest of praise.\u201cMike Bloomberg had the formula: vision plus confidence plus achievement equals progress,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cMike\u2019s formula was shared by my father Mario Cuomo, who called himself a pragmatic progressive. Think about it. A progressive who gets things done, and gets results.\u201dThe governor did not include Mr. de Blasio, who sees himself as a paragon of progressivism, in his commendations.In many ways, Mr. de Blasio has benefited from circumstance and luck. Since he entered City Hall in January 2014, the city\u2019s economy has steadily expanded and crime numbers have continued to drop. He has avoided, by and large, major crises.But although Mr. de Blasio is enjoying the fruits of incumbency, he will need to do more in his second term to carry his expected mandate outside City Hall, and expand it to Albany and beyond.Mr. de Blasio has shown little sign of being willing to change. And to judge by the primary results, where he got 74 percent of the vote and his nearest challenger, Sal F. Albanese, received 15 percent, what he has done so far seems to be working.He has delivered on many of his promises \u2014 notably universal prekindergarten classes and changes in policing that he says have contributed to a sharp drop in crime \u2014 and remains loyal to his base.\u201cOverall the vast majority of New Yorkers are satisfied,\u201d said Letitia James, the city\u2019s public advocate. That\u2019s true, she said, even of voters who do not like Mr. de Blasio. \u201cIn terms of their personal life and their personal affairs, they\u2019re not in a state of crisis.\u201dOn Wednesday, after the Cornell event, Mr. de Blasio strode into his Brooklyn campaign headquarters and hammered on those themes before a receptive audience of dozens of volunteers and staff who cheered and applauded him.He dismissed talk of low voter turnout \u2014 \u201cIt was higher turnout than 2009\u201d \u2014 and took aim at his Republican challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, when asked about her by a reporter. The general election, all of a sudden, was underway.\u201cIt\u2019s very simple: Assemblymember Malliotakis is a pro-Trump Republican, and the fact that she even has to wonder if she wants Donald Trump\u2019s support speaks volumes,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople of this city reject Donald Trump.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Malliotakis, newly protected by a police security detail provided to the Republican nominee, campaigned on Wednesday at three nursing homes in Queens. Arriving at a news conference outside a Catholic church in Ozone Park, she paused, struck by the number of video cameras (five) and reporters (more than a dozen).\u201cI thought it was going to be a much smaller crowd here,\u201d she said, before launching into an attack on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s record on homelessness, promises of new taxes and toxic relationship with Mr. Cuomo.She played down his primary victory, focused on low turnout that she said showed \u201capathy among his political base,\u201d and contrasted her campaign with Mr. Albanese\u2019s, saying she would have more money to get her message out.Part of that message has been reminding voters of the state and federal investigations into Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising \u2014 no charges were filed \u2014 and of the personal style of the Park Slope mayor ill-at-ease on the Upper West Side.He can be stiff and is not playful; he is often professorial; he doesn\u2019t play nice with reporters or with his Democratic colleagues. He talks down to his staff, and ignores advice not to his liking.But those attack lines have been tried before, by Mr. Albanese most recently. The primary election appeared to bear out the mayor\u2019s contention all along: None of that matters to the Democratic voters who dominate in New York.As if to drive that point home, on Tuesday, after he voted in Park Slope, he took off his suit, went to his gym in Brooklyn, and then went to his favorite pastry shop. He went again on Wednesday morning \u2014 a victory workout.\u201cI think what everyone\u2019s watching is whether or not he keeps an eye on City Hall or on a national agenda,\u201d said George Arzt, a veteran political consultant.More broadly, with incumbents like Ms. James re-elected across the board on Tuesday, New York may be seeing a new political normal where the city\u2019s term-limits law has given rise to two-term sinecures. Few politicians want to give up a guaranteed second term to challenge an incumbent mayor.It\u2019s the reality of New York City \u2014 a majority-minority city where the immigrant population has exploded \u2014 becoming truly a one-party Democratic town. Viable political opposition cannot really come from outside the party without a crisis, and is unlikely to come from inside the party when every politician bides his or her time rather than risking going after an incumbent, political observers said.\u201cYou\u2019ll have a massive number of people running in four years,\u201d Mr. Arzt said, anticipating 2021.In the meantime, Mr. de Blasio must contend with the same old drama that has been dogging him for years: He wants to tax millionaires, institute voting reforms and enact a range of measures that must originate in Albany. And Mr. Cuomo has not always seen himself as a partner in those efforts.After Mr. Cuomo spoke on Roosevelt Island, Mr. de Blasio also delivered a speech praising Mr. Bloomberg, after first saying that he was not known as a \u201csycophant\u201d of the former mayor. His remarks then turned into a campaign-style appeal, ticking off some of his accomplishments related to technology \u2014 expanding computer science classes in schools and creating a program to place workers in technology jobs.This time around, it was Mr. Bloomberg who received the praise, with Mr. de Blasio watching up close.Shortly after, surrounded by supporters at his campaign headquarters, Mr. de Blasio offered a revisionist view of the governor\u2019s comments.\u201cI am very proud to be in that tradition,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s reference to progressives who get things done. The mayor then dodged a question about whether the governor had been needling him. \u201cI don\u2019t spend a lot of time analyzing the governor\u2019s speeches.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unemployment Is So 2009: Labor Shortage Gives Workers an Edge", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIs a new golden age for the American worker around the corner?For the last couple of years, workers\u2019 median earnings have been rising on a sustained path not seen in years.This may come as a surprise after decades of wage stagnation, when the good jobs of an earlier industrial era \u2014 in which workers could go straight from high school to a lifelong place on the factory floor, with a pension on the other end \u2014 have largely disappeared, replaced in many cases by work with little security, uncertain hours and few if any benefits.Still, the wage picture is looking decidedly brighter. In 2008, in the midst of the recession, the average hourly pay of production and nonsupervisory workers tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 those who toil at a cash register or on a shop floor \u2014 was 10 percent below its 1973 peak after accounting for inflation. Since then, wages have regained virtually all of that ground. Median wages for all full-time workers are rising at a pace last achieved in the dot-com boom at the end of the Clinton administration.And with employers adding more than two million jobs a year, some economists suspect that American workers \u2014 after being pummeled by a furious mix of globalization and automation, strangled by monetary policy that has restrained economic activity in the name of low inflation, and slapped around by government hostility toward unions and labor regulations \u2014 may finally be in for a break.But even as they forecast a brighter future for the working class, these economists also worry that the new age of tight labor markets and rising wages will create a different sort of challenge. As Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton University economist who was the chief economic adviser to President Barack Obama, put it, \u201cWe are heading for a labor shortage.\u201dMark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, concurs. \u201cOur problem going forward isn\u2019t going to be unemployment,\u201d he told me. \u201cOver the next 20 to 25 years, a labor shortage is going to put a binding constraint on growth.\u201dConverging factors are at play, Mr. Zandi contended. The Federal Reserve is likely to allow the economy to run \u201con the hot side.\u201d Years of exceptionally low inflation have finally convinced the Fed to drop its overriding anti-inflationary bias, forged in the high-inflation era of President Jimmy Carter, and to put more weight on the impact that high interest rates have on employment.Manufacturing workers have probably already lost all the jobs to globalization that they were going to lose, Mr. Zandi said. Rather than \u201ctake\u201d more American jobs, hundreds of millions of Chinese workers who have joined the global middle class over the last two decades will instead \u201ccreate\u201d jobs in the United States by buying American-made goods and services.And even as demand for workers accelerates across the United States, employers must contend with the unflinching force of demography: a work force that is growing at its slowest pace in over a half-century, as baby boomers who joined the labor force from the 1960s to the 1980s now gradually age out of it.More than seven years after the recession ended and the job market began to bounce back, only 60 percent of Americans over the age of 16 are working, about 2.5 percentage points fewer than just before the economy took a dive.On average, Mr. Zandi pointed out, aging will slice about a quarter of a percentage point from the labor-force participation rate \u2014 the share of Americans either employed or looking for a job \u2014 over the next 10 years. By the end of that period, the labor force may even be shrinking.Policy makers who spent their careers pondering the lackluster demand for workers will have to turn their attention to a problem they have not had to fret about much in at least a generation: how to pull more able-bodied people into the work force to offset a wave of retirements.\u201cWe have had real wage growth, but the labor supply has been flat for the last two years,\u201d Professor Krueger said. \u201cWe get a very small number of workers back with higher wages, just enough to offset the people leaving the labor force because they are older.\u201d The critical question for policy is what other tools are available to draw them back.And the answer requires removing a roadblock standing in the way of this potential golden age: Even if demand for workers is rising, it may not be for the kind of workers on offer, those sitting on the sidelines of the labor force. \u201cThe jobs in demand are more skilled than the workers we have,\u201d Professor Krueger told me.The share of men in their prime working years \u2014 25 to 54 \u2014 who are in the labor force has declined steadily since the end of World War II. Workers without a college degree have clocked out at increasing rates, as imports and automation undercut their wages.For years, the economy hardly noticed because women were rushing to work in droves, offsetting the retreat among men. But that trend faded around the turn of the century. Since then, the labor-force participation rate of prime-age Americans has shrunk to nearly the lowest in the industrialized world.And, as Professor Krueger noted, once workers stop looking for a job, it is tough to draw them back in. \u201cAfter they leave the labor market,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople reorganize their lives.\u201dHow to get them back? In a coming study, Melissa Kearney and Katharine Abraham of the University of Maryland identify forces that have pushed workers out of the labor force before the retirement age of 65. Trade is at the top of the list, followed by technology \u2014 be it robots or other forms of automation \u2014 and disability insurance, which offers people some income in the absence of a job. Supply-side factors \u2014 incarceration, or the effect of the minimum wage on labor costs \u2014 are next.Professor Kearney and Professor Abraham also identify policies that might draw more workers back into jobs: Improving access to high-quality education, an elusive goal despite recent gains, is critical to equip students to navigate a changing workplace. So is access to child care, to lower barriers to women\u2019s participation in the work force. Expanding wage supports like the earned-income tax credit will be important to make work worthwhile for workers of lesser skills. On the supply side, Professor Kearney and Professor Abraham suggest that being cautious about raising the minimum wage, which could price some workers out of jobs, and reforming disability insurance to encourage recipients to seek jobs.There is more. Discouraging the overprescription of painkillers seems like an obvious choice, given Professor Krueger\u2019s findings. There is also a clear list of things not to be done.For instance, restricting immigration is not the smartest policy when workers are scarce. Raising barriers to imports \u2014 inviting retaliation from trading partners \u2014 is exactly the wrong approach, especially now that the workers in cheap labor markets that put such pressure on American jobs promise to become big consumers of things made in America.If the goal is to protect economic growth and to give American workers a shot at a new golden age of employment, closing the door on the world economy is not the solution.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Faces Mountain of Obstacles on the Road to Recovery", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA day after Hurricane Maria razed Puerto Rico, its ferocious winds smashing houses, hotels, cellphone towers and the island\u2019s entire electrical grid, the fear and frustration were pervasive on Thursday.Power was out everywhere. Cellphones were mostly useless, forcing panicked residents to scramble for news from far-flung relatives. Much of the island\u2019s water was undrinkable. Roads were carpeted in debris. And still the full scope of the damage was unknown. By day\u2019s end, Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, said there had been no contact with officials in 85 percent of the island.Late Thursday, Bernardo M\u00e1rquez, the mayor of Toa Baja, a town in northern Puerto Rico, told The New York Times that eight people had drowned there after flooding. That brought to at least 10 the number who have died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, a toll that is expected to climb. The storm has also been blamed for 15 deaths in Dominica and two in Guadeloupe.And unlike Texas and Florida, politically powerful states on the mainland, Puerto Rico is an impoverished, Spanish-speaking commonwealth. It is an island to boot, making aid delivery all the more cumbersome and expensive.\u201cThe irony is we\u2019re in crisis here, and go figure, a phenomenon like this one comes to destroy us,\u201d said Edwin Serrano, 37, a construction worker who lives in the historic district of Old San Juan. \u201cThis is going to be a long haul.\u201dOn Thursday, the island was declared a federal disaster zone, freeing up federal emergency money.The first major steps toward recovery will get underway Friday morning when an airport tarmac in San Juan, cleared of debris, will open to begin receiving three or four daily emergency planeloads of much-needed generators, water, tents, cots and other crucial supplies, said Alejandro de la Campa, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Puerto Rico. Both commercial and military planes will be used for the flights. Emergency teams will also start to fan out across the island to begin helping residents with their immediate needs, he added.A total of 3,200 federal workers were on the ground in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands to help with response and recovery, said Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting member of Congress.Planes will be dispatched Friday to survey remote regions, where Hurricane Maria\u2019s toll has been impossible to know. With most radio stations, television antennas and cellphone towers down, Governor Rossell\u00f3 said the government had no contact with local officials with knowledge of how much damage had been done.\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to reach my parents yet either,\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said. (His father is Pedro Rossell\u00f3, a former governor.)Re-establishing communications was a priority, the governor said, although the task would be gargantuan. The Federal Communications Commission estimated on Thursday that Puerto Rico had lost 95 percent of its wireless cell sites.\u201cIn the next 24 to 48 hours, the scene will become clearer,\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said.Also a major priority is reopening the ports in San Juan, Ponce and Mayag\u00fcez, key economic lifelines.Three emergency management teams mobilized Thursday, heading to the towns of Fajardo, Caguas and Humacao to start clearing roads and addressing urgent needs. With the rain and floodwaters still pounding the island, the danger was real. The authorities spent the day rescuing people stranded on roofs or at sea. In Utuado, three bedridden elderly sisters were missing after being buried by a landslide of mud that broke through the window of a cement house where they were riding out the storm, according to local news media reports.Complicating Puerto Rico\u2019s recovery is the island\u2019s devastated economy. The island has been mired in a deep recession for more than a decade and carries $74 billion in debt. With no way of repaying it, Puerto Rico declared a form of bankruptcy in May, the first time in history that an American state or territory had taken the extraordinary measure. The island\u2019s finances are also being overseen by a federal control board.If there is anything promising it is that, as a United States territory, Puerto Rico can receive money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That money is expected to provide the bulk of what Puerto Rico needs to rebuild critical infrastructure, which had been neglected and crumbling well before the hurricane, as well as houses and buildings.The hope now is that, as a result of disaster aid, Puerto Rico can modernize its electrical grid, roads and bridges. It is a goal the federal government shares.\u201cAt least 75 percent of the recovery money is going to come from FEMA,\u201d said David Merrick, the director of the Emergency Management and Homeland Security program at Florida State University. \u201cIt becomes \u2018how do I build back in a way that\u2019s better.\u2019 This is the time, unfortunately, to make those changes and not just blind duct-tape everything back together the way it was.\u201dBut the blow from Hurricane Maria is monumental.Piecing together Puerto Rico will be especially hard \u2014 and expensive \u2014 because it is an island. Everything must be flown or shipped in, requiring more time and money than if goods could be trucked in. The high uninsured or underinsured rate in Puerto Rico will also slow the process.Daily life will soon grow almost intolerable for all and dangerous for some, like the older and frail. Many parts of the hot and humid island are expected to go months without electricity, the governor said. Cooking will be onerous. Hot showers will be a memory. In some regions, clean water will be hard to access.Ricardo Ramos, the director of the beleaguered government-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, told CNN Thursday that the island\u2019s power infrastructure had been basically \u201cdestroyed\u201d and will take months to come back.Residents, Mr. Ramos said, would need to change the way they cook and cool off. For entertainment, old-school would be the best approach, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time for dads to buy a ball and a glove and change the way you entertain your children.\u201dBut with many businesses blown away, the post-storm landscape is expected to drive even more people out of Puerto Rico and into the arms of relatives and friends on the mainland, a scenario that will exacerbate the ongoing brain drain and further shrink the island\u2019s tax base.Representative Darren Soto, whose district includes Orlando, where many Puerto Ricans have landed as part of the island\u2019s exodus, said he is already talking with local and state officials to ready schools and assistance offices.\u201cWe are preparing in Central Florida for a huge influx from folks on the island seeking shelter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen tens of thousands relocated before the storm. We expect that to go up precipitously.\u201dJorge Duany, the director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University and an expert on Puerto Rican migration, said islanders who were torn about whether to stay or go will not hesitate to leave, even if for the short term. Elderly people who require regular medical attention could be the first to leave.\u201cGiven the gravity of the situation,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will see people leaving altogether.\u201dHurricane Maria is likely to set back investment on the island and, at least for a while, cripple the tourism industry, which had been one small bright spot in Puerto Rico\u2019s growth.The price tag for all this damage, here and elsewhere, will be monumental. But Mr. Soto, a Democrat, said that he expects Republicans in Congress to take a sensible and generous approach to rebuilding, not just in parts of Texas and Florida, but also in Puerto Rico.\u201cThere is always a concern for both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands because they don\u2019t have the same representation in Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are a lot of allies in Congress that will step up.\u201dLuis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed reported from San Juan and Lizette Alvarez and Frances Robles from Miami.

{"Headline": "North Korea\u2019s Trade Troubles Could Point to a Need for Cash", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDANDONG, China \u2014 After sunset, when American spy satellites can no longer see as well, the main bridge connecting China to North Korea comes to life.The data also suggests something else. The trucks are increasingly coming back empty. And that could present a potential weak point that the Trump administration and others could exploit, if China is willing to go along, as they look for ways to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.Even as China sells more goods to North Korea, it is buying less from there, according to trade data and experts on the relationship between the two. North Korea\u2019s finances are hidden by a veil of secrecy. But that worsening trade imbalance appears to be deepening North Korea\u2019s need for credit from China or for cold, hard cash from somewhere else.\u201cMy best guess is that North Korea is receiving trade credits from those providing it with goods and services \u2014 that is to say, China,\u201d said Steve Hanke, an economist at Johns Hopkins University who studies China\u2019s financing of rogue regimes like those in North Korea and Venezuela.\u201cAs neighbors, China and North Korea maintain normal trade,\u201d said Huang Songping, the spokesman of China\u2019s customs administration, at a briefing in July.Despite North Korea\u2019s estrangement from most of the rest of the world, it still needs foreign currencies to get by. North Korea has a currency (called the won, like South Korea\u2019s), but the money is worthless outside its borders.Even here in Dandong, within sight of North Korea, eight merchants said in separate interviews that they do not accept the North Korea currency. Foreign exchange windows at local banks refuse to handle it.That has left North Korea heavily dependent on its trade with China.For years, Chinese purchases of coal and other goods gave North Korea a steady source of money.That source no longer looks so steady. North Korea bought $2 worth of goods from China in July for each $1 of sales to China, as China has essentially halted purchases of North Korean coal since mid-February. For the first seven months of the year, North Korea ran a trade deficit with China of nearly $1 billion, almost four times the amount of a year ago.Some in Congress have begun talking about legislation that would target leading Chinese banks\u2019 use of dollar-based payments systems as a way to hit North Korean trade. But financial specialists say they worry about unforeseen payment difficulties, which were a big worry during the global financial crisis in 2008.\u201cWhat the legislators do not know, and it\u2019s a little scary, is what these restrictions would mean for China,\u201d said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former North Korea specialist at the United States Treasury who is now at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington research group.To avoid that, Chinese banks could simply lend extra money on easy terms to state-owned Chinese enterprises, which in turn could keep selling goods to North Korea without demanding payment.Continuing trade on credit may explain why North Korea shows few indications of a money pinch, such as surging prices for rice and other essentials.\u201cFrankly, you just haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said Kent Boydston, an analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.North Korea has other ways to get cash, though estimating those amounts is tricky work.It could attract foreign investment toward developing natural resources. But China shows few signs of making such big investments, and it supported United Nations sanctions in early August that would halt purchases of iron ore, coal and other assets.North Korea gets money from its citizens overseas, who must remit most of their paychecks to the government. But with the United Nations tightening that source as well, there has been little sign of a huge recent increase in these revenues, said Melanie Hart, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a Washington research group.Shoppers and shopkeepers in Dandong \u2014 who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of Chinese government reprisals \u2014 said North Korean workers were a common sight, though there had been little sign of an influx. One said many lounge singers and bar hostesses here are young women from North Korea. Their monthly pay is about 3,000 renminbi, or $460, but they keep only about a quarter of that.China\u2019s decision early last month to ban imports of North Korean seafood seems to be having an effect. At an open-air seafood market in Dandong, only one vendor in a row of four said she had North Korean merchandise: a handful of live crabs. Other vendors complained they had to buy more-expensive Chinese shellfish for sale instead.For now, the trucks continue to cross the World War II-era steel frame bridge here at night to North Korea.A nearby resident, looking at the trucks and the occasional young men who run up to drivers with packages to deliver to friends and family in North Korea, said the scene had not changed for a long time.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter: @KeithBradsher.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Strange Impotence of the Republican Party", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySuppose you\u2019re a Republican. Since you\u2019re reading The Times, suppose hard.So why is your party in such obvious disarray? Why can\u2019t it pass its signature bills? Why can\u2019t your congressional leaders control their caucuses? Why can\u2019t an incumbent Republican senator publicly endorsed by an incumbent Republican president win his primary battle against his nutty opponent?Maybe you\u2019re tempted to answer that all would be well if only the party hadn\u2019t been stabbed in the back by a handful of self-infatuated G.O.P. moderates \u2014 read John McCain and Susan Collins \u2014 supposedly more concerned about their reputation on the Sunday talk show circuit than with the welfare of their constituents back home. Welcome to the Dolchsto\u00dflegende, 2017 edition.Yet party \u201csaboteurs\u201d come in many colors, including the phony conservative purists Ted Cruz and Rand Paul as well as the genuine conservative crazies of the House Freedom Caucus. The basic test of any leader, Republican or Democratic, is to get a grip on the inevitably fissiparous elements of his political herd. Republican leaders \u2014 President Trump most of all \u2014 have thus far failed to get that grip.There\u2019s a simple explanation for this: They can\u2019t. Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have the parliamentary skills but not the political authority. Trump has the authority but not the skills. Probably not the desire, either: A tight-lipped numbers nerd like Ryan must be about as congenial to the president as a tax auditor in Mar-a-Lago. Their shotgun political marriage has all the sincerity, and passion, of Charles and Diana.Still, the G.O.P.\u2019s problems aren\u2019t mainly a matter of personality. They\u2019re a matter of mentality. And they\u2019re part of a pattern that\u2019s world-wide.We are living in an era of party failure, especially on the right. The Trumpkins sacked the G.O.P. The Brexiters humiliated the Tories over Europe. Marine Le Pen\u2019s fascists have supplanted the Gaullists as the face of the French right. Germany\u2019s own nasty alt-right, the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, humiliated Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats in last weekend\u2019s election.The high-toned explanation for these serial rebukes of the establishment by the base is that the former has failed to address the anxieties and disgruntlements of the latter: immigration and culture shocks; wage stagnation and the stresses of a globalized world.But globalization, immigration and changing social mores have been with us for a long time without producing awful political outcomes. What\u2019s new is the existence \u2014 and metastasis \u2014 of the fury factories of the right, from Fox News to Breitbart to Frontpage Mag.Should it be any wonder that a Republican Party with almost complete control of government has turned so fiercely on itself? Dominant parties often do that when they have little to fear politically from the nominal opposition party.Should it be any wonder, either, that in the intramural fights the Donald Trumps and Roy Moores of the party are winning? As in economics, so too in G.O.P. politics: Gresham\u2019s law applies. Bad money drives out good. Bad Republicans drive out good ones. When nastiness sells, the worst rise. Political gerrymandering doesn\u2019t help, but that\u2019s a separate column.The political paradox of 2017 is that a Republican Party that cannot seem to lose also cannot seem to govern. Anger is an excellent emotion for pushing ratings and winning elections and a terrible one for agreeing to compromises and crafting legislation. This won\u2019t end as long as Trump is in the White House. Whether it won\u2019t also be the end of the Republican Party as a functional institution is another question.Advertisement"}

But fewer and fewer young people see a future in agriculture, which offers lower, less steady pay than factories or menial jobs in towns and cities.\u201cIn recent years earnings from farming were low, everyone let land go fallow,\u201d said Tao Yongpan, an official at Mount Niangniang, a cluster of villages in the Liupanshui area of western Guizhou that served as an inspiration for policies promoted by Mr. Chen. \u201cSoil erosion was serious and farmland was left idle. Rural production was on the slide.\u201dSome economists have urged the Chinese government to privatize farmland, arguing that would encourage better land use and unleash market forces to lift productivity.But the party has been reluctant to shed its ideological commitment to collective ownership \u2014 in effect state control \u2014 of farmland. Officials and some experts also worry that privatizing the land would make farmers more vulnerable to exploitation and create kindling for social unrest.In Guizhou, Mr. Chen instead promoted a solution that has gained favor under Mr. Xi: merging small family fields into cooperatives that pool villagers\u2019 land, money and labor. Other provinces and politicians have for years experimented with this approach, which is meant to boost production through economies of scale. But Mr. Chen pushed it hard and gave it his own twist.Rural families became shareholders in the cooperatives, paying in by handing over some or all of their leased land. The cooperatives then used the larger acreage to produce commercial crops like tea and walnuts, paying villagers a share of returns and sometimes wages for farm work. Often local companies also invested in these enlarged farms, bringing finance and management experience, but also taking profits.\u201cBefore the land was all fragmented,\u201d said Huang Zhineng, a manager at Mount Niangniang. \u201cWith unified management, the same land can lift incomes. It\u2019s a great model for poverty eradication.\u201dIt is a policy that also fits into Mr. Xi\u2019s vision of entrenching the party\u2019s hold on power and restoring a spirit of socialist collectivism that harks back to Mao\u2019s era.But that same month, Mr. Xi also said he would participate in the coming leadership congress as a delegate from Guizhou, although he has no career links there. Officials in Guizhou celebrated the striking gesture of support for Mr. Chen.In villages in Guizhou, though, residents are waiting to see if Mr. Chen\u2019s policies can bring lasting profits. Many welcomed the changes. Others were wary.\u201cIt\u2019s a good way forward for us,\u201d said Qiu Shuixian, 37, a farmer in Zhongxin Village in the Liupanshui area, where one cooperative has pooled land to grow red rice, a local specialty, and another newer cooperative produces fruit, walnuts, flowers and honey.\u201cThere\u2019s no profit in farming the land ourselves,\u201d Mr. Qiu said.But others said it was risky to devote so much land to crops like walnuts or red rice, which might fail in bad years or not find buyers. Some said they felt pressured to sign over farmland to the cooperative. One resident recalled Mao\u2019s time, when peasants were forced into huge communes that failed and resulted in mass starvation.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to hand it over,\u201d Chen Wenzheng, 64, said of his family\u2019s plot. \u201cI wanted to grow some for myself as insurance. But then everyone handed theirs over, so what can you do?\u201dLuo Xiaopeng, a retired rural policy official who has long worked in antipoverty projects in Guizhou, said Mr. Chen\u2019s policies were designed to show quick results but could backfire. For example, farmers could be cajoled into risky, expensive ventures that take their land and fail after a few years. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is getting a grip of the fundamental problems in the Chinese countryside,\u201d he said.But Mr. Chen won\u2019t be around to see the long-term impact of his efforts. He has moved onto his next test.As the new party secretary in Chongqing, he has a tricky assignment.Bo Xilai, another party secretary of Chongqing seeking promotion, fell in scandal in 2012.

It\u2019s time to get people out.\u201dMessages sent to the power authority about the condition of the dam were not immediately returned.The National Guard has been activated in the area, the governor said.\u201cIt\u2019s been hard to see infrastructure deteriorate in Puerto Rico,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it has been harder to meet citizens who have lost it all.\u201dAccording to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Guajataca Dam is an earthen structure, 120 feet high and nearly 1,000 feet long. It was built in 1929 by the power authority.It lies across the Guajataca River, forming a reservoir that can hold about 11 billion gallons of water that is used for drinking, irrigation and power generation.Officials in Puerto Rico were corralling incoming aid as rescue and recovery efforts continued after the storm, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said on MSNBC on Friday.\u201cThere\u2019s still some rain and, of course, the soils are saturated, so it\u2019s still not safe to go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still on emergency protocol and our main objective right now is making sure people are safe.\u201dMr. Rossell\u00f3 said that the island was getting generators, mattresses, food and water from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and from others in the private sector.Officials have established a logistics center, which will receive all incoming aid and then distribute it to 12 zones throughout the island, he said.\u201cThe people of Puerto Rico are really being tremendous under these circumstances,\u201d he said.Some elderly residents had been found in rural areas without food and necessary medication, Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, said on CNN on Friday.\u201cMy biggest fear is that we don\u2019t get to those that need it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we get to an elderly home too late, the situation of care will be disastrous.\u201d\u201cIn the north, the situation is under control despite intermittent rains and moderate winds that have caused some trees to fall,\u201d said Julio Almonte, vice minister of tourism for the Dominican Republic\u2019s northern zone. \u201cWe have toured the area and can report that the hotel infrastructure has not suffered any damage and that electricity and water services are working.\u201dPunta Cana, La Romana and Saman\u00e1 El Catey airports reopened on Thursday evening.\u201cSo far, no significant damage is reported in the country\u2019s tourist destinations,\u201d said Joel Santos, president of the National Hotel and Tourism Association of the Dominican Republic. \u201cThere are cleaning and gardening crews operating to repair some of the things that wind and rain have affected, but fortunately there is nothing that the current protocols and established procedures have not helped us deal with.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the group that built the Guajataca Dam in Puerto Rico.

{"Headline": "Worried and Frustrated, \u2018Dreamers\u2019 Say They Won\u2019t Give Up", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Safir Wazed, a graduate student born in Bangladesh and raised in California, struggled to focus on his studies. Evelin Salgado, born in Mexico and raised in Tennessee, was ending plans to buy a house and wondering what would happen to her teaching job.And Basilisa Alonso did what thousands of other so-called Dreamers did on Tuesday: She marched in the streets to make her plight known.\u201cI\u2019m willing to take the risk for my family and for all the other DACA people out there,\u201d Ms. Alonso said, referring to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that she was marching to save. Minutes later, a New York City police officer moved in and placed her hand behind her back with plastic restraints. She was among several dozen people arrested after they blocked an intersection near Trump Tower at various times on Tuesday.About 800,000 undocumented young adults like them had endured weeks of nail-biting tension over the fate of DACA, which for the last five years has enabled them to legally live and work in the United States.\u201cI have been blessed with all the opportunities that DACA brought to my life,\u201d said Ms. Salgado, 23, who is now a teacher and was the first person in her family to graduate from college.Since receiving DACA status, Mr. Wazed, 27, has held a job and bought a car and a condominium. He is now a graduate student at the University of Southern California. \u201cAm I supposed to plan to reset my life in six months?\u201d he asked.\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Mr. Wazed said, \u201cand we\u2019re not going to be pushed out of our country in six months.\u201dIndeed, the decision has immediately reawakened a protest movement that helped lead to the program\u2019s creation.About a decade ago, leaders of undocumented young immigrants used activities like sit-ins and demonstrations to share their cause with the American public, until they reached the White House. Those efforts were repeated Tuesday in cities across the country, from New York to Washington to Denver to Los Angeles, now greatly amplified by social media and institutions \u2014 corporate boardrooms, colleges and religious organizations \u2014 that touch virtually all corners of society.The broad reaction illustrated not only how successful the Dreamers and their advocates had been in persuading the Obama administration to create the program, but how, after five years of living legally in the United States, they had become fully integrated into American colleges, workplaces and civic life. DACA gave immigrants who had been brought to the country illegally as children a reprieve from deportation and a work permit if they met certain conditions.So with the administration\u2019s decision looming, many Dreamers recently began contemplating a double loss, of their legal protection and the lives and careers they had begun with that protection.Last week, amid the uncertainty over the program, Ms. Salgado told her real estate agent that she had to scrap plans to buy a four-bedroom house in Fairview, Tenn., for her parents, with whom she lives.In New York, during the march down Fifth Avenue, some stopped and watched on their smartphones as Mr. Sessions made the news official. \u201cWe pay our taxes, follow the laws,\u201d said Dayana Arrue, 22, as she sobbed beneath her Ray-Ban sunglasses. She came from El Salvador when she was 6, is now a senior at Rutgers University, and was planning to go to graduate school for geoscience engineering. \u201cAll that talent that the U.S. is missing out on, it\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt kind of all ends.\u201dProtests continued throughout the day, and the New York Police Department said it had arrested more than 45 people, including some with DACA status. But they would not be fingerprinted if they followed court instructions, according to the police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill.That could protect them from being discovered by federal immigration authorities. Still, Mayor Bill de Blasio cautioned them during a news conference: \u201cObviously if someone is a DACA recipient, I would urge them to be careful about anything like civil disobedience.\u201dOn the campaign trail, Mr. Trump pledged to \u201cimmediately terminate\u201d the program. Once elected, he softened his stance, praising Dreamers as \u201cabsolutely incredible kids\u201d who deserve compassion.Feeling reassured, tens of thousands of young immigrants filed new or renewal applications. But the program\u2019s fate became uncertain after a group of conservative state attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, threatened to sue the administration unless it began to dismantle the program by Tuesday.Most DACA beneficiaries live in one of five states \u2014 California, Florida, Illinois, New York or Texas \u2014 and the largest share are from Mexico or Central America. But thousands hail from South Korea, the Philippines or India, among many other countries, and arrived with visas that their families overstayed.\u201cIn the coming days, weeks and months, many Americans will find out \u2014 for the first time \u2014 that they know someone with DACA,\u201d said Katharine Gin, executive director of Educators for Fair Consideration, a nonprofit in San Francisco that works with Dreamers. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s their child\u2019s teacher, or the nurse who takes care of their mother, or the young person they always sit next to at church.\u201dStill, some Dreamers noted there could be a silver lining in Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. The program had always been on infirm legal footing, as conservatives argued that former President Barack Obama did not have the power to create it without Congress. With the president now urging Congress to do something to replace DACA, it was not impossible to dream that a permanent solution was at hand.\u201cEnding DACA may be the only solution to Congress acting rapidly,\u201d said Monica Lazaro, a DACA recipient in Miami who is set to start a research job at a veterans\u2019 hospital later this month. \u201cWe will push Congress, and especially Paul Ryan. This is not the end, it is just the beginning.\u201dAs Mr. Sessions spoke, Marcela Zhou, a Dreamer and third-year medical student at the University of California, Los Angeles, paused between patients she was seeing at a clinic to watch the announcement.\u201cI have been anticipating this moment, but it is hard to fully mentally prepare for it,\u201d Ms. Zhou said.She added hopefully: \u201cThe future remains uncertain, but I am confident I will become a doctor one day. The road may be longer and bumpier, but we will get there.\u201dReporting was contributed by Liz Robbins, Jeffrey C. Mays, Luis Ferr\u00e9 and Laurie Goodstein from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Reason the U.S. Has Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareThe basic structure of the American health care system, in which most people have private insurance through their jobs, might seem historically inevitable, consistent with the capitalistic, individualist ethos of the nation.In truth, it was hardly preordained. In fact, the system is largely a result of one event, World War II, and the wage freezes and tax policy that emerged because of it. Unfortunately, what made sense then may not make as much right now.Most insurance in the first half of the 20th century was bought privately, but few people wanted it. Things changed during World War II.This froze wages. Businesses were not allowed to raise pay to attract workers.Businesses were smart, though, and instead they began to use benefits to compete. Specifically, to offer more, and more generous, health care insurance.After World War II, Europe was devastated. As countries began to regroup and decide how they might provide health care to their citizens, often government was the only entity capable of doing so, with businesses and economies in ruin. The United States was in a completely different situation. Its economy was booming, and industry was more than happy to provide health care.The tax break the family would get for insurance is worth over $6,200. That\u2019s far more than a similar-earning family would get in terms of a subsidy on the exchanges. The tax break alone could fund about two people on Medicaid. Moreover, the more one makes, the more one saves at the expense of more spending by the government. The less one makes, the less of a benefit one receives.Employers would not have provided insurance. They would have collected taxes from employees and passed these onto the government to pay for plans. Everyone, regardless of employment, would have qualified for standard deductions to help pay for insurance. Employers would have been required to increases wages over two years equal to what had been shunted into insurance. Those at the low end of the socio-economic spectrum would have qualified for further premium help.This isn\u2019t too different from the insurance exchanges we see now, writ large, for everyone. One can imagine that such a program could have also eventually replaced Medicaid and Medicare.It\u2019s important to point out that neither of these options has anything even close to bipartisan support.Without much pressure for change, it\u2019s likely the American employer-based system is here to stay. Even the Affordable Care Act did its best not to disrupt that market. While the system is far from ideal, Americans seem to prefer the devil they know to pretty much anything else.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Start-Up Slump Is a Drag on the Economy. Big Business May Be to Blame.", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment has fallen, and the stock market has soared. So why has the economic expansion since the recession been so tame, with sluggish productivity and, at least until recently, anemic wage growth?Economists say the answer, to some degree, can be found in a start-up slump \u2014 a decline in the creation of new businesses \u2014 and a growing understanding of what\u2019s behind it.\u201cWe\u2019re still in a start-up funk,\u201d said Robert Litan, an economist and antitrust lawyer who has studied the issue. \u201cObviously the recession had a lot to do with it, but then you\u2019re left with the conundrum: Why hasn\u2019t there been any recovery?\u201dMany economists say the answer could lie in the rising power of the biggest corporations, which they argue is stifling entrepreneurship by making it easier for incumbent businesses to swat away challengers \u2014 or else to swallow them before they become a serious threat.\u201cYou\u2019ve got rising market power,\u201d said Marshall Steinbaum, an economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank. \u201cIn general, that makes it hard for new businesses to compete with incumbents. Market power is the story that explains everything.\u201dThe start-up slump has far-reaching implications. Small businesses in general are often cited as an exemplar of economic dynamism. But it is start-ups \u2014 and particularly the small subset of companies that grow quickly \u2014 that are key drivers of job creation and innovation, and have historically been a ladder into the middle class for less-educated workers and immigrants.Perhaps most significant, start-ups play a critical role in making the economy as a whole more productive, as they invent new products and approaches, forcing existing businesses to compete or fall by the wayside.\u201cAcross the decades, young companies are really the heavy hitters and the consistent hitters in terms of job creation,\u201d said Arnobio Morelix, an economist at the Kauffman Foundation, a nonprofit in Kansas City, Mo., that studies and promotes entrepreneurship.The start-up decline might defy expectations in the age of Uber and \u201cShark Tank.\u201d But however counterintuitive, the trend is backed by multiple data sources and numerous economic studies.In 1980, according to the Census Bureau data, roughly one in eight companies had been founded in the past year; by 2015, that ratio had fallen to fewer than one in 12. The downward trend cuts across regions and industries and, at least since 2000, includes even the beating heart of American entrepreneurship, high tech.Although the overall slump dates back more than 30 years, economists are most concerned about a more recent trend. In the 1980s and 1990s, the entrepreneurial slowdown was concentrated in sectors such as retail, where corner stores and regional brands were being subsumed by national chains. That trend, though often painful for local communities, wasn\u2019t necessarily a drag on productivity more generally.\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of pieces now that say dynamism has gone down a lot since 2000,\u201d said John Haltiwanger, a University of Maryland economist who has done much of the pioneering work in the field. \u201cStart-ups have gone down a lot since 2000, especially in the high-tech sectors, and there are increasingly strong links to productivity.\u201dWhat is behind the decline in entrepreneurship is less clear. Economists and other experts have pointed to a range of possible explanations: The aging of the baby-boom generation has left fewer Americans in their prime business-starting years. The decline of community banks and the collapse of the market for home-equity loans may have made it harder for would-be entrepreneurs to get access to capital. Increased regulation, at both the state and federal levels, may be particularly burdensome for new businesses that lack well-staffed compliance departments. Those and other factors could well play a role, but none can fully explain the decline.More recently, economists \u2014 especially but not exclusively on the left \u2014 have begun pointing the finger at big business, and in particular at the handful of companies that increasingly dominate many industries.The evidence is largely circumstantial: The slump in entrepreneurship has coincided with a period of increasing concentration in nearly every major industry. Research from Mr. Haltiwanger and several co-authors has found that the most productive companies are growing more slowly than in the past, a hint that competitive pressures aren\u2019t forcing companies to react as quickly to new innovations.\u201cIf we\u2019re in an era of excessive profits, in competitive markets we would see record firm entry, but we see the opposite,\u201d said Ian Hathaway, an economist who has studied the issue. That, Mr. Hathaway said, suggests that the market is not truly competitive \u2014 that existing companies have found ways to block competitors.Experts also point to anecdotal examples that suggest that the rise of big businesses could be squelching competition. YouTube, Instagram and hundreds of lower-profile start-ups chose to sell out to industry heavyweights like Google and Facebook rather than try to take them on directly. The tech giants have likewise been accused of using the power of their platforms to favor their own offerings over those of competitors.\u201cWe\u2019re saying that it\u2019s O.K. that they shape how a city charges taxes?\u201d Mr. Morelix said. \u201cAnd what kind of regulations they have? That should be terrifying to anyone that wants a free market.\u201d\u201cEverybody loves entrepreneurship, but they\u2019re not aware it\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Mr. Dearie said. \u201cIf new businesses are the engine of net new job creation, and if new businesses are the engine of innovation, and new business creation is at 30-year lows, that\u2019s a national emergency.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We Can\u2019t Ignore It Now.", "Date": "2017-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPuerto Rico cannot vote for president and has no voting representatives in Congress. But its citizens are entitled to the same federal emergency funds and resources that Washington has been funneling to the far more politically powerful and economically resilient states of Texas and Florida in their hurricane miseries.This leaves no room for delay or debate about rushing federal help to the citizens and government of Puerto Rico and the stricken communities of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Emergency aid is their best hope for recovery from a natural disaster that has greatly compounded Puerto Rico\u2019s persistent agonies: overwhelming debt, government bankruptcy and a plummeting economy that has prompted a continuing exodus to mainland America.Diaspora Puerto Ricans, struggling to make contact with kin stranded on the island, are already preparing emergency shelter in their own homes and massing donations in mainland communities from New York to Florida. But the federal role will be paramount in rebuilding the island, which was suffering a poverty rate of 46 percent even before Maria raked communities from shore to shore, deflating a tourism industry that provided some economic lift.Before they were reduced to a primal struggle for food, water and escape, residents thought they had hit rock bottom when a financial control board took power last year under emergency federal law. The board has levied sweeping austerity measures and higher taxes to restructure $74 billion in debt and oversee critical infrastructure projects.Maria leaves a whole new level of recovery to be scaled. No one has yet estimated the full cost. Federal money will be the most critical factor, in the view of recovery specialists. They dare to hope the sweep of the hurricane\u2019s destruction may provide a theoretical, if bleak, spark for long overdue modernization on the island.All Americans should rally forcefully behind their fellow citizens left suffering on the island as it labors to recover. It is up to mainland leaders not to stint on aid for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, however lacking they may be in political clout in Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Nuclear Test Puts Pressure on China and Undercuts Xi", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 It was supposed to be Xi Jinping\u2019s moment to bask in global prestige, as the Chinese president hosted the leaders of some of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies at a summit meeting just weeks before a Communist Party leadership conference.Mr. Kim has timed his nuclear tests and missile launches with exquisite precision, apparently trying to create maximum embarrassment for China. And on Sunday, a gathering in southeast China of leaders from Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa, members of the so-called BRICS group, was immediately overshadowed by news of the test, which shook dwellings in China and revived fears of nuclear contamination in the country\u2019s northeast region.The confluence of North Korea\u2019s nuclear testing and Mr. Xi\u2019s important public appearances is not a coincidence, analysts said. It is intended to show that Mr. Kim, the leader of a small, rogue neighboring state, can diminish Mr. Xi\u2019s power and prestige as president of China, they said. In fact, some analysts contended that the latest test may have been primarily aimed at pressuring Mr. Xi, not President Trump.\u201cKim knows that Xi has the real power to affect the calculus in Washington,\u201d said Peter Hayes, the director of the Nautilus Institute, a research group that specializes in North Korea. \u201cHe\u2019s putting pressure on China to say to Trump: \u2018You have to sit down with Kim Jong-un.\u2019\u201dWhat Mr. Kim wants most, Mr. Hayes said, is talks with Washington that the North Korean leader hopes will result in a deal to reduce American troops in South Korea and leave him with nuclear weapons. And in Mr. Kim\u2019s calculation, China has the influence to make that negotiation happen.Even the North\u2019s claim that the weapon detonated was a hydrogen bomb that could be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile would probably not sway Mr. Xi, they said.\u201cThis sixth nuclear test should force China to do something radical; this will be a political test,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, a nuclear expert at Renmin University. \u201cBut the mood is not moving that way.\u201dChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry did express \u201cstrong condemnation\u201d of the test. But despite the North\u2019s repeated incitements, the Chinese leadership is likely to stick to its position that a nuclear-armed North Korea is less dangerous to China than the possibility of a political collapse in the North, Mr. Cheng said. That could result in a unified Korean Peninsula under the control of the United States and its ally, South Korea.China fears such an outcome if it uses its greatest economic leverage: cutting off the crude oil supplies that keep the North\u2019s rudimentary economy running.\u201cCutting off oil supplies could severely impact North Korean industries and undermine the regime\u2019s stability, a solution which China and Russia have serious qualms about,\u201d said Zhao Tong, a fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing.China has put forward a proposal that hinges on North Korea stopping its nuclear testing in exchange for an end to American military exercises around the Korean Peninsula.But Mr. Xi is consumed at the moment with domestic matters, Chinese analysts said. The political machinations surrounding the Communist Party\u2019s National Congress that will convene in Beijing in mid-October to select new members of the ruling elite are at the top of his agenda. Mr. Xi will be awarded his second five-year term at the meeting.China always aims for domestic calm in the period leading up to the secretive congress, and so it is unlikely to do anything before Oct. 19, the start of the conclave, Mr. Zhao said.The biggest concern for China\u2019s leadership is the possibility of North Korea turning on China, the country\u2019s only ally. \u201cIf cornered, North Korea could take military action against China, given the relationship has reached a historic low,\u201d Mr. Zhao said.China supplies more than 80 percent of the North\u2019s crude oil, and suspending delivery would be the ultimate economic sanction, more far-reaching than those imposed, with China\u2019s support, by the United Nations.Even The Global Times, the nationalist, state-run newspaper, said several months ago that China should consider cutting off its oil supplies to North Korea if Mr. Kim detonated a sixth nuclear bomb. But with the party congress looming, the paper modified its position Sunday.\u201cThe origin of the North Korean nuclear issue is the sense of uncertainty that is generated by the military actions of the U.S./South Korea military alliance,\u201d the paper said. \u201cChina should not be at the front of this sharp and complicated situation.\u201dThere were also some doubts whether severing oil supplies would make much a huge difference to the North Korean regime. \u201cThe economic effects will be substantial but not regime crippling,\u201d said Mr. Hayes of the Nautilus Institute, which specializes in the North\u2019s energy needs.The hardships, he said, would be most felt by ordinary people, with less food getting to market and fewer people able to travel between cities in buses.The North\u2019s army has oil stockpiles for routine nonwartime use for at least a year, Mr. Hayes said. \u201cThey can last for about a month before they run out of fuel in wartime, at best; likely much earlier,\u201d he said.Many residents in Yanji in Jilin Province, which borders the North, said they felt their apartments shake after the test. Some posted photos of stocks of food and drinks shattered on the floors of a grocery store. At first residents believed the cause was an earthquake, they said, and only later in the day heard the news from state-run media that North Korea had detonated a nuclear bomb.\u201cI was in my study when the earthquake began,\u201d said Sun Xingjie, an assistant professor at Jilin University in Changchun about 350 miles from the North Korean test site. Mr. Sun said he checked with friends on social media, and they determined from the location and the depth of the explosion that it was a nuclear test.Even though there is no evidence of any contamination from the test reaching China, it is a worry of residents, Mr. Sun said.\u201cWe are at the border region, so we have a sense of fear about leakage from the nuclear test,\u201d he said.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Harbin, China.Advertisement"}

It was only a few months after she\u2019d first touched the stained brown notebook containing the story, and now this rare artifact could be blown off the island entirely. \u201cI was really terrified,\u201d said Ms. Spanier, the general editor of the Hemingway Letters Project and an English professor at Penn State University.On Wednesday, Sept. 27, Mr. Chamberlin returned to the archive in Key West\u2019s Old Town neighborhood. He walked past fallen trees and debris lining the yards, sidewalks and streets. \u201cThe collection is in fine shape,\u201d Mr. Chamberlin reported. While the property lost several large trees, \u201cthere was no damage whatsoever to the building,\u201d he said.The notebook was there, unharmed, tucked inside a Ziploc freezer bag, with \u201cSep. 8, 1909,\u201d written in black marker.But how this notebook traveled from Hemingway\u2019s hometown in Oak Park, Ill., to storage in ammo boxes in Key West is another story. Hemingway was the best chronicler of his own life, or in modern terms: a hoarder. He kept not only photos and letters, but also receipts, ticket stubs, dental X-rays, school assignments, Spanish bullfighting magazines and other ephemera. By the time Hemingway died in 1961, he left scores of material scattered in places such as Key West, Oak Park, Cuba and his home in Ketchum, Idaho.The author\u2019s fourth wife, Mary Welsh Hemingway, spent years gathering letters, notebooks and Hemingway\u2019s unfinished manuscripts, including the memoir of his Paris years, \u201cA Moveable Feast.\u201d In the winter of 1962, she traveled to Key West to visit Betty and Telly Otto \u201cToby\u201d Bruce, who retrieved a pile of boxes left in a storeroom behind Sloppy Joe\u2019s Bar, Hemingway\u2019s favorite saloon. Bruce was a longtime confidant who had served as Hemingway\u2019s mechanic, handyman and sometime chauffeur.Mary took what she deemed important back to New York and gave the rest to the Bruces. With the exception of a few local exhibits and some scholarly collaboration, the archive has remained in family hands, under the control of Bruce\u2019s son, Benjamin \u201cDink\u201d Bruce.The collection also includes little-seen Hemingway photos, letters, a lock of the author\u2019s hair and 46 prints, a gift from the famous photographer Walker Evans. Only within the last 15 years has it begun to be properly cataloged, due largely to the efforts of Mr. Chamberlin, who wrote \u201cThe Hemingway Log,\u201d a timeline of the author\u2019s life and career.Hemingway\u2019s travelogue through Ireland and Scotland was written as letters to his parents and what seem to be diary entries, so it didn\u2019t seem significant. It was only when Ms. Spanier visited Mr. Chamberlin in May that they realized Hemingway never made this trip, as a child or as an adult. It was then that the full weight of the discovery hit them. \u201cOh my God, I thought, this is quite something. This is Hemingway\u2019s first attempt at fiction,\u201d Mr. Chamberlin recalled thinking.In one section of the notebook, young Hemingway tells the story of a dead man who returns once a year to rebuild Ross Castle in Ireland, and host a nighttime feast. \u201cWhen daylight comes the castle falls in ruins and O\u2019Donahue returns to his grave,\u201d wrote Hemingway in a spidery scrawl.Although Hemingway\u2019s penmanship wouldn\u2019t improve much, his writing would. The story foreshadows the writer to be, not only in terms of Hemingway\u2019s economy of language and use of landscape, but also in his mixing of reportage with fiction. This is a technique Hemingway would employ throughout his career to inject realism into his stories, to ground them with gravity of facts and experience.\u201cI thought this was really amazing; a real landmark piece of writing,\u201d Ms. Spanier said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we see Hemingway writing a sustained, imaginative narrative.\u201dThe young Hemingway goes on to describe a tour of Blarney Castle and the poverty of Ireland. He writes about a visit to a stone house with a thatched roof that \u201cis very dark inside\u201d and about a pig that \u201cruns under the table\u201d and \u201cthe people call him \u2018The little fellow that pays the rent.\u2019 \u201dThere are no grade marks on the piece, so it\u2019s unknown whether this was a draft of an English assignment, or if Hemingway was writing for his own amusement. He may have intended it for St. Nicholas Magazine, Ms. Spanier said. The children\u2019s magazine held a monthly literary contest that his older sister Marcelline had entered.\u201cMaybe he was inspired to write his fictional \u2014 and rather learned and literary \u2014 narrative by the prospect of being a published author at the age of 10,\u201d Ms. Spanier suggested.As for Dink Bruce, he couldn\u2019t be more surprised by the whole thing, although time and the recent hurricane have made him rethink the future of the archive.\u201cA tornado can take them out, but they are as safe as they can be right now,\u201d said Mr. Bruce, who splits his time between Key West and Livingston, Mont.He\u2019s considering selling the archive, so it can find a new home inside or outside of Florida.\u201cIt deserves to be in some place where it can be studied,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pressure Mounts on Iraqi Kurds to Cancel Independence Vote", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byERBIL, Iraq \u2014 In a region where few people concur on anything, adversaries and enemies in the Middle East find themselves agreeing on one goal: to stop Iraq\u2019s Kurds from forging ahead with a vote for independence on Monday.It is difficult to reconcile the fierce international objections with the euphoric flag-waving celebrations in Kurdish cities, where residents are convinced they will be voting for independence next week no matter what the world thinks.In Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, fireworks streak across night skies and young men cruise past in cars, honking horns and chanting Kurdish national slogans. Red-white-and-green Kurdish flags snap in the wind beside posters and banners that implore Kurds \u2013 in four languages \u2013 to vote \u201cyes\u201d to pursue independence.But almost every day for the past week, Kurds have been buffeted by jarring new demands from outside their autonomous enclave to cancel the vote.The White House has called the vote \u201cprovocative and destabilizing.\u201d Brett H. McGurk, the United States envoy to the region, has described it as \u201ca very risky process\u201d with \u201cno prospect for international legitimacy.\u201dThe United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has warned that the vote would undermine the fight against the Islamic State, where Kurdish fighters, known as pesh merga, and Iraqi army units are part of the American-led coalition.The Kurds\u2019 powerful neighbor, Turkey, is conducting tank drills on its border with Iraqi Kurdistan. Iran has vowed to block its border with the landlocked region if the vote proceeds. In response, some Iraqi Kurdish families have been stockpiling food and supplies.Both Turkey and Iran worry that an independence vote by Iraqi Kurds will stir unrest among their own Kurdish minorities.\u201cThe pressures are certainly escalating to try to pull this thing away from us,\u201d said Hoshyar Zebari, Iraq\u2019s former foreign minister and a leader of the referendum effort. \u201cWe are used to it.\u201dEven within Kurdistan, many Kurds are opposed.Political rivals of the region\u2019s president, Massoud Barzani, say they want independence but may vote no to avoid endorsing Mr. Barzani, the face of the referendum. Others say the referendum is the right idea at the wrong time. They contend that the Kurdistan Regional Government is corrupt and dysfunctional, and has not yet built the democratic framework necessary for an independent nation.\u201cWe\u2019re not a democratic state \u2013 we\u2019re a tribal state, and we\u2019re not ready for independence,\u201d said Rabbon Marof, a member of the Kurdish Parliament and a leader of the \u201cNo For Now\u201d movement.Mr. Marof said Mr. Barzani\u2019s government had tried to block the movement\u2019s rallies and posters, accusations the government denies. Mr. Marof pulled out his cellphone to display texts from referendum supporters threatening him or making vulgar references to his wife and sister.Mr. Barzani\u2019s rivals have accused him of using the referendum to distract Kurds from internal political strife and a sinking economy. Rocked by falling oil prices, the Kurdistan Regional Government is at least $20 billion in debt, according to analysts. Public employees say they have been paid only about 40 percent of their salaries since Iraq stopped sending budget payments in 2014.Alan M. Noory, a Kurd who teaches social science at American University of Iraq Sulaimani, said the vote would rupture relations with the United States and Baghdad at a critical moment. He favors independence, he said, but will boycott the vote.\u201cThis is not a real referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to the democracy we deserve.\u201dSo far, the Kurdish leadership has held fast, insisting that the referendum will proceed. But the Kurdish Regional Government says it is still talking to the United States and to Baghdad, seeking an ironclad guarantee of a future road map to independence.Peter W. Galbraith, a former American diplomat who is close to Kurdish leaders, said an 11th-hour deal was unlikely. \u201cFor the generation of leaders who were pesh merga, this is the end of their careers \u2013 this is their moment,\u201d he said.A central issue is the status of Kirkuk, an oil-rich city that provides Kurdistan its single biggest source of revenue. The pesh merga seized the city and its oil fields in 2014, after the Iraqi army fled an assault by Islamic State militants.Kurds in Kirkuk have provoked Baghdad by flying Kurdish flags and erecting a massive statue of a pesh merga fighter at the city gates, a Kalashnikov rifle on his shoulder. Kirkuk is home to Arabs, Kurds and Turkmens.Kirkuk is one of several Iraqi areas taken by Kurds in 2014, expanding their enclave by more than 40 percent. The Kurds have enraged Baghdad by including the disputed areas in the referendum.Asked whether Kurds might consider canceling the vote in contested areas, Mr. Zebari replied, \u201cWe are looking for options \u2013 we have not reached any final conclusions.\u201d\u201cBut of course,\u201d he added, \u201cwe would want something for it.\u201dThe Kurds, isolated and besieged for a century, have rejected a series of American proposals to drop the referendum and negotiate with Baghdad. The Kurdish leadership wants a sweeping public endorsement for independence before starting negotiations.\u201cHow can you not let the Kurdish people speak?\u201d asked Najmaldin Karim, the Kurdish governor of Kirkuk. \u201cEverything the U.S. and others are demanding we can do the very first day after the referendum.\u201dMr. Karim was fired by Baghdad last week, but remains stubbornly in office. The Iraqis cannot forcibly remove him with Kirkuk under pesh merga control.David L. Phillips, a former State Department adviser who has worked on Iraq for 30 years, said Mr. Barzani was unlikely to back down now, or to accept any guarantees from the United States or the international community. \u201cThe Kurds have learned from bitter experience that they can only rely on themselves,\u201d said Mr. Phillips, now at Columbia University.A yes vote would not mean immediate independence. But Mr. Zebari said the vote was binding on the Kurdistan Regional Government. Assuming it passes, the government will begin a formal breakaway process to include negotiations with Baghdad and a campaign for international recognition.The referendum dispute has left the pesh merga on the sidelines of a coalition assault that began Thursday against one the last Islamic State strongholds in Iraq, the town of Hawija, in Kirkuk province. Mr. Karim said there had been no recent military coordination with Baghdad in the province.The pesh merga and the Iraqi army, along with Shiite militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, fought together in the nine-month battle to liberate Mosul, which had been the largest city held by Islamic State.Despite the mounting pressure and isolation, Kurds continue to celebrate at raucous, flag-waving rallies. Many arrive in cars bearing Mr. Barzani\u2019s portrait. Others have pasted Kurdish flag decals over the word \u201cIraq\u201d on their license plates. Several Kurdish men have appeared on social media or live TV to burn their Iraqi passports.Mr. Zebari said there would be no turning back now.\u201cThat would be suicide,\u201d he said. \u201cThe end of the Kurdish dream.\u201dKamil Kakol contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Widespread Power Failures, Puerto Rico Is Cash Only", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFAJARDO, P.R. \u2014 Juan Jimenez squinted into the dark lobby of his bank early Friday, thinking about the paycheck sitting in his account, just behind the locked doors. If only he could get to it.With power failures and communications outages still widespread nine days after Hurricane Maria, much of Puerto Rico has become a cash-only island for Mr. Jimenez and others who desperately need to buy food, gasoline and ice from stores that cannot run credit cards, take phone payments or process electronic government benefits.\u201cYou\u2019re broke even if you have money,\u201d Mr. Jimenez, 40, said.Fewer than half of Puerto Rico\u2019s bank branches and cash machines are up and running, still crippled by diesel shortages, damaged roads and severed communications lines. Bank officials say they are struggling even to find employees who can get to work when there is no public transportation and gasoline is hard to find.Across the island, people who have spent their last dollars on an $8 bag of ice or $15 for gasoline are waiting for hours outside banks and A.T.M.s in hopes of withdrawing as much money as possible.The cash crunch offers a glimpse of how Puerto Rico\u2019s struggling economy, in which unemployment stood at 10 percent even before the storm, has ground to a near standstill across much of the island, as people with $11 in their pockets and no clue when they will return to work or restart their businesses now spend their days waiting for hours under parasols and the searing sun for basic supplies.As people wait, rumors swirl about cash shortages and strict limits on withdrawals \u2014 neither of which is true, banking officials said.Zoime Alvarez, vice president of the Association of Banks of Puerto Rico, said there was enough cash on Puerto Rico and more arriving to meet what the New York Federal Reserve called \u201cextraordinarily high demand.\u201dAnd banking officials said the $500 daily limit on A.T.M. withdrawals had not changed since the storm, though bank branches that were still offline were imposing $100 limits. About 90 banks and 200 A.T.M.s are working across the island, government officials said. But many are opening late and closing by 2 p.m. or 3 p.m.\u201cWe have been getting shipments of money,\u201d the governor, Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3, said. \u201cWe want to make sure people get access to the money that they need immediately, and recognizing that we are in an emergency situation.\u201dEnyoliz Parrilla, 35, has been rationing her cash as if it were a finite supply of water in a lifeboat. She had about $40 left, and as she pushed her cart through a reopened supermarket, she added up the cost of bread and milk. She wanted to keep the bill to $25.\u201cWe\u2019re just holding on,\u201d she said.She once had a thriving catering business serving birthday parties and weddings, but the storm and days without power had ruined her food and stopped any new business, she said. As their money dwindled, she and her husband were contemplating leaving for Orlando, where they have family.But some spots were islands of convenience. At a CVS drugstore in San Juan, the manager, Hector Juan, 37, said the chain\u2019s system for processing credit cards was intact, and the store was thrumming with customers who formed a line that snaked back among the partly empty shelves.In line was Juan Pou, 47, a mechanic, who had two, two-liter bottles of Coca-Cola and two packages of white bread in a basket. It was difficult, he said, to find fresh food, and he was eating a lot of grains.Mr. Pou said that chaos was to be expected in a world where everything, including transactions at the store, relied on an ephemeral network of ones and zeros. \u201cIn the modern world,\u201d he said, \u201ceverything\u2019s computers.\u201dMr. Jimenez, who waited in line outside Scotiabank, said the cash shortage forced him to get creative and tiptoe into the black market. Here in his eastern hometown, Fajardo, he was able to use his credit card to buy several packs of Newport cigarettes from a big-box retailer before the store ran out of diesel and had to shut down.He and his wife traversed their neighborhood, selling packs of cigarettes for $10 each. Mr. Jimenez said he was not trying to make money \u2014 just to stockpile cash to use at the gas stations and markets that now accepted nothing else.\u201cI\u2019m like a drug dealer,\u201d he joked.Like other people standing in line, Mr. Jimenez said he worried about draining his bank account while he was out of work indefinitely. He said he could not drive to work because he did not want to use his precious gasoline, could not call work because his phone had no signal, and did not know when he might go back. He estimated he had already spent $1,000 to live after the storm.A little way back in line, Yolanda Carrasquilla, 52, contemplated the risks of bringing so much money into her house at a time when she felt unsafe in her pitch-black neighborhood. Normally, she said, she \u201cnever ever\u201d keeps cash in the house, but said she needed it to buy groceries and supplies for her 13- and 22-year-old sons.\u201cI\u2019m worried that somebody will rob me,\u201d she said, but added that she keeps a pistol at home for protection.As the morning wore on, the line grew, wrapping around the building and spilling into the parking lot. As a manager unlocked the door and slipped inside, people in the crowd shouted, \u201cOpen up!\u201d and \u201cTurn on the generator!\u201d\u201cWhat are they doing in there?\u201d someone asked.After a few minutes, the manager emerged to tell the crowd that the bank would be able to open that morning if a shipment of diesel arrived to power the generator. A security guard began organizing the line, offering shady spots closer to the door to pregnant women and ailing customers.One man asked the manager, \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t get here, when will you open?\u201dThe manager did not know. After a few more announcements, she threaded her way through the crowd and back into the bank, locking the door behind her.Richard Fausset and Frances Robles contributed reporting from San Juan, P.R.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen and Cohn Said to Be on Shortlist to Lead Federal Reserve", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House has created a list of about a half-dozen candidates to be the next leader of the Federal Reserve, including its current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and the president\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, according to two administration officials and a third person with knowledge of the process.The list also includes Jerome H. Powell, a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor; and the Stanford University economist John B. Taylor, the officials said. Preliminary interviews with some candidates have already begun with an eye toward presenting finalists to President Trump later this year.Ms. Yellen, whose four-year term ends in February, has been unusually successful in achieving the Fed\u2019s goals of minimizing unemployment and moderating inflation. But Mr. Trump, while praising her performance, has said that he may decide not to reappoint her.\u201cI like her and I respect her, but I haven\u2019t made that decision yet,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters this month.Uncertainty about Mr. Trump\u2019s decision is already causing some unease in financial markets. Ms. Yellen has charted a steady course for monetary policy in the coming years: gradual increases in interest rates and a gradual reduction in the Fed\u2019s bond holdings. But some of the candidates Mr. Trump is considering, including Mr. Warsh and Mr. Taylor, have argued that the Fed should raise rates and reverse its postcrisis buildup of bonds more quickly.The Fed chairman also plays a leading role in financial regulation and will have to navigate calls by Republican leaders, including Mr. Trump, to roll back some of the rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Ms. Yellen was a principal architect of those more stringent regulations and has said the financial system is much stronger as a result. Mr. Trump has criticized many of the banking rules, saying they are excessive and impeding economic growth. The candidates to replace Ms. Yellen all share those concerns to varying degrees.Given the high stakes, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision has become a source of intrigue in political and economic circles this year. There is also a growing sense of urgency: Both Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, were nominated in October, leaving ample time for the Senate to hold confirmation hearings. Mr. Trump has said he does not plan to make a decision until later in the year, leaving little time for the Senate to act given the tight calendar. Aides say he is not yet focused on the search. Additional candidates could ultimately be considered.The administration officials and the other person with knowledge of the search requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the job in question. A White House spokeswoman had no immediate comment, and Mr. Cohn, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh did not respond to requests for comment. A Fed spokeswoman said Ms. Yellen and Mr. Powell declined to comment.The next Fed chairman is likely to begin the four-year term in an atmosphere of relative tranquillity during one of the longest economic expansions in American history. But the Fed is confronting a number of difficult issues. One question is whether it can do more to increase economic growth. Another is whether the Fed will be ready for the next economic downturn.Mr. Trump has deputized four officials to lead the selection process for the Fed\u2019s next chairman, said one person familiar with the search: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; two of Mr. Cohn\u2019s aides on the National Economic Council, Jeremy Katz and Andrew Olmem; and John DeStefano, the White House personnel director.Mr. Cohn, who initially participated in conversations about the potential nominees for Fed governor seats, has removed himself from the discussions about the central bank\u2019s next chairman, given that he is a potential candidate for the job, said several people with knowledge of his involvement.Mr. Cohn left the No. 2 position at Goldman Sachs to join Mr. Trump\u2019s administration as head of the National Economic Council. He quickly developed an easy rapport with the president, who is said to value Mr. Cohn\u2019s knowledge of markets and finance. Mr. Cohn has played a major role in the administration\u2019s push for a tax-cut bill; he also has been a moderating voice in internal debates on issues like restricting free trade.In a July interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump described Mr. Cohn and Ms. Yellen as candidates for the Fed job. The next month, Mr. Cohn publicly criticized the president\u2019s response to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, creating tension. But the two men have reestablished a comfort level, and Mr. Cohn remains a candidate.Mr. Cohn is a strong advocate for easing financial regulation, which he argues is unnecessarily impeding economic activity. But he has rarely spoken publicly about monetary policy; the other four candidates whose names are known all have significant experience with monetary policy.Mr. Warsh, who served on the Fed\u2019s board between 2006 and 2011, was a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory council and has informally advised him on a range of economic issues. That may be a significant advantage, given the president\u2019s demonstrated preference for people he knows and trusts. Mr. Warsh is married to Jane Lauder, the daughter of Ronald Lauder, a friend and occasional adviser to the president.Mr. Warsh is a lawyer by training and a banker by trade before entering public service in 2002 as a member of President George W. Bush\u2019s National Economic Council. After leaving the Fed, he joined the Hoover Institution, a public-policy think tank run by Stanford, as a visiting fellow. He has been a vocal critic of the Fed\u2019s economic stimulus campaign under both Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen, arguing it has been ineffective and may have dangerous side effects.At a Hoover conference in May, he said the Fed needs to be \u201caggressive and powerful\u201d in responding to financial crises, but remain \u201cmore traditional\u201d when the market is not in crisis.Mr. Taylor, a colleague of Mr. Warsh\u2019s at Hoover, has offered a similar critique of Fed policy. Mr. Taylor served in the Treasury Department during the Bush administration but he is best known as an academic economist. He wrote a formulaic approach to monetary policy, known as the \u201cTaylor Rule,\u201d which suggests that the Fed should be raising rates more quickly. He also has closely advised House Republicans on legislation that would require the Fed to adopt such a policy rule.Mr. Powell, the only Republican on the Fed\u2019s board, is regarded as a centrist voice on both monetary policy and regulatory issues. In internal discussions and public remarks, he has sometimes pushed back against the most ardent supporters of the Fed\u2019s postcrisis stimulus campaign. Similarly, he has sometimes raised questions about changes in financial regulation. But on both fronts he has consistently voted with the majority.A Treasury Department official under President George H.W. Bush, Mr. Powell then built a fortune as a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, before he was nominated to the Fed by President Obama in 2012. His experience at the Fed, and his connections both in the financial world and in the Republican Party, could make him an attractive candidate. But his track record suggests he may be less likely than some of the other candidates to press for dramatic changes in monetary and regulatory policies.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But is there anything you can do to prepare?That is not a philosophical question, or a theological one. And if it is a question that seems to beg any explication, you may stop reading now.But if you are among the swelling class of weekend paranoiacs of affluent means who are starting to mull fantasies of urban escape following the endless headlines about disasters, both natural and manufactured, you may be starting to see a different image in your mind when think \u201csurvivalist.\u201d You may no longer see the wild-eyed cave dweller in camouflage fatigues, hoarding canned goods. You may even see one in the mirror.These suddenly chic survival satchels, also known as go bags, are typically lightweight military-grade backpacks stocked with provisions for at least 72 hours. Ready-made bug-out bags containing staples like water purification tablets, a 20-hour body warmer and a multifunction shovel are available on Amazon for under $200.Unlike gold, which is hovering around $1,300 an ounce, these old silver coins come in small enough denominations to barter for a loaf of bread or a socket wrench in an economic \u201cMad Max\u201d scenario. Even so, some survivalists remain silver skeptics. \u201cFor $100, let\u2019s say you get five silver coins,\u201d said an urban preparedness expert who goes by the nom de guerre Selco. \u201cWhy not buy 100 cans of soup?\u201dImagine a true economic apocalypse, one that makes the German hyperinflation of the 1920s, with its wheelbarrows of near-worthless paper currency, look like a hiccup. To prepare for the worst worst-case scenario, some doomers prefer daily staples like tampons, vegetable seeds and cigarettes (that timeless prison medium of exchange) to silver or gold as an alt-currency.\u201cIf we look at examples of systematic social breakdowns, like Argentina in 2001, or the war in the Balkans, goods that people understood on an intrinsic level clearly carried the most value when trading \u2014 cans of food, gas, batteries, cheap Bic lighters,\u201d he said. \u201cA good rule of thumb: If you\u2019d find it useful in an emergency, you\u2019ll be able to find someone who will trade for it in an emergency.\u201dWhen President Trump issued his threat to North Korea at the United Nations, many preppers had an almost Pavlovian response: to check their nuclear survival kit. Ever since the backyard bomb shelter went the way of tail fins, survival in the face of mushroom clouds has seemed highly relative.Or people may just want to stock up on Snuggies, chocolate Easter bunnies, Hummel figurines or vintage Backstreet Boys paraphernalia, which will do about as much good in the event of a direct strike.Manhattanites face challenges unknown to their Western counterparts hunkering in remote desert bunkers. Their home turf, after all, is not only a prime target, but an island. In the event of a cataclysmic emergency, bridges and tunnels may be closed, or choked off by marauding mobs, forcing survivors to consider waterborne escape.Sure, there is the cost \u2014 about $250,000, which the company is hoping to bring down \u201cto the price of a luxury car.\u201d For now, just think of it as the survivalists\u2019 Maybach.The dome houses are so rugged, according the company\u2019s founder, Don Kubley, \u201cyou could buy one today and your grandkids will be playing in it.\u201d One can only hope.Should disaster not strike? They make a great man cave or backyard cabana.In normal times, this international historical-re-enactment organization seems like little more than a harmless bunch of Renaissance Faire types playing dress up on weekends and celebrating the arts, skills and costumes of pre-17th-century Europe.But should Armageddon arrive \u2014 say, in the form of a limited nuclear exchange, global pandemic or cyber mega-attack \u2014 these hobbies could mean your survival. In other words, chivalry may not be dead after all.There is bugging out, and then there is really bugging out. In a scorched-earth scenario where even a jet pack is not enough to escape harm\u2019s way, preppers with deep pockets and a taste for Arthur C. Clarke might consider the ultimate escape: launching their DNA into space.Who knows \u2014 some ultra-intelligent alien being may discover it in the future, and use your genetic code to reanimate a race of humans on a distant planet.

{"Headline": "U.S. Desire for North Korea Oil Cutoff Puts China in a Tight Spot", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 What the Chinese call the Friendship Pipeline runs for 20 miles, crossing under the Yalu River and spanning the border between North Korea and China. For more than half a century, it has been both a symbol of the two nations\u2019 alliance and a lifeline for the North\u2019s economy.But no previous American administration has pressed the case as an implicit choice between cutting off the fuel and potential military action.That puts President Xi Jinping of China in a particularly difficult position. With an important Communist Party leadership conference next month, he will not want to look weak in the face of American pressure. But a destabilizing war on the Korean Peninsula would be even less welcome.\u201cXi cannot afford to look like he is caving in under U.S. pressure,\u201d said Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. \u201cHe needs something back from the U.S. to make the Chinese cooperation less costly to its image and geopolitical interests.\u201dMr. Zhang said that if Mr. Trump agreed to a version of a strategy proposed by China to ease the crisis \u2014 a freeze of the North\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for suspending joint United States-South Korean military exercises \u2014 then Mr. Xi might be more amenable to an oil cutoff.But while Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis have raised the possibility of a diplomatic resolution, Mr. Trump has expressed little interest in talking to the North. \u201cTalking is not the answer,\u201d the president recently said on Twitter.On Tuesday, a North Korean diplomat hinted that more nuclear or missile tests were in store, promising what he called \u201cmore gift packages\u201d for the United States. The diplomat, Han Tae-song, said at a United Nations disarmament conference in Geneva that \u201cpressures or sanctions will never work\u201d on the North.China fears that putting too much pressure on North Korea could bring down the government of its leader, Kim Jong-un, perhaps resulting in large numbers of refugees crossing into China and leaving an American ally, South Korea, on its border. While Beijing often criticizes the North for its missile tests and nuclear detonations, it keeps the isolated country\u2019s economy alive with exports of energy, mainly crude oil.But that was a rare exception to China\u2019s usual policy. While Mr. Xi has been willing to impose some minor restrictions on China\u2019s energy supplies to North Korea, he has shown no signs of curbing the vital crude oil that keeps the North afloat.How much crude China sends through the Friendship Pipeline \u2014 which starts in Dandong, a trading hub in northeastern China, and travels under the Yalu River into North Korea \u2014 is not precisely known. China stopped reporting those figures several years ago.But given its recent economic growth, North Korea would be expected to import about 850,000 tons of crude oil this year, almost entirely from China, said Peter Hayes, the director of the Nautilus Institute, a think tank specializing in North Korean energy. Some other experts estimate a slightly lower amount \u2014 about 750,000 tons \u2014 for the year.Either figure would seem to reflect a substantial increase from a few years ago, though it is hard to be certain. In 2015, the China National Petroleum Corporation, which operates the pipeline to the North, said that the amount of oil sent through it had been kept at 520,000 tons. And China did report vastly reduced supplies of motor and aviation gasoline to North Korea in July \u2014 92 percent less than the July 2016 value, according to the General Administration of Customs.Even if China did cut off crude oil supplies, North Korea \u2014 particularly its military \u2014 would be able to operate for a while, Mr. Hayes said.The military, which he said uses about a third of the country\u2019s imported oil, has enough stockpiles for \u201ca year of routine, nonwartime usage \u2014 could be more, doubt it would be less.\u201d The military could fight for a month before running out of fuel, Mr. Hayes said.The brunt of a fuel cutoff would be felt by ordinary North Koreans, who would be \u201cforced to walk or not move at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be less light in households due to less kerosene.\u201dThe North Korean government already uses charcoal to make fuel for vehicles, Mr. Hayes said, so a side effect of an oil embargo could be more deforestation in the countryside as trees are felled to produce charcoal. That could lead to further erosion, floods and the potential for famine.An embargo would also reduce the supply of diesel used by farmers to pump water for rice fields and to process crops into food, Mr. Hayes said.Cheng Xiaohe, a Korea analyst at Renmin University, said that a decision by China to cut off oil to the North would signal a willingness to tolerate instability around Mr. Kim\u2019s government \u2014 a course that Mr. Cheng doubted the Chinese leader would take. \u201cAt the top, the North is not unified,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cThere are factions.\u201dThe editorial said that cutting off crude oil would lead to a conflict between China and North Korea and still fail to halt the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program.Besides the political considerations that China must weigh in considering an oil embargo, there are also practical concerns. China National Petroleum Corporation has said that stopping the flow of oil through the Friendship Pipeline might damage the pipeline. In 2011, engineers for the company wrote that wax in the crude oil could build up and block the pipe if the flow were stopped. They said it was safe to stop the flow for eight hours at most during summer, and for no more than two hours during winter.Mr. Hayes said that China was unlikely to agree to an oil cutoff, however strained its relationship with the North has become. \u201cThat would reduce whatever influence the Chinese have left in Pyongyang,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kenyans Celebrate Court\u2019s Ruling to Nullify Election", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 The chief justice of Kenya\u2019s Supreme Court, David Maraga, is a Seventh-day Adventist who refuses to preside over a court case on a Saturday. Once accused of corruption, he went on live television and swore on the Bible that he had never taken a bribe.Now Justice Maraga has become a household name almost overnight, with many calling him Kenya\u2019s national hero. Some even want to rename a street in Nairobi, the capital, with his name.On Friday his court invalidated last month\u2019s re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta, saying the vote had been tainted by \u201cirregularities and illegalities\u201d and sending the country back to the polls.The decision has become an unlikely unifying force for a country that had been deeply polarized in the weeks before and after the election. Much of the division had been stoked by the candidates, Mr. Kenyatta and his opponent, Raila Odinga, who were accused of stirring ethnic tensions for electoral gains.In Kenya, where courts have a long history of corruption and are often viewed as an extension of the government, the ruling was bold and stunning. It shocked even Mr. Kenyatta, who was so confident that the court would side with him that it was he who had urged Mr. Odinga to resolve the dispute by legal means and not in the streets.Trust in the justice system has been so low that before the ruling, Mr. Odinga said he had little hope that the court would make a fair decision. His petition to overturn the vote, he said, was more an opportunity to publicize the opposition\u2019s arguments that the election was a fraud.But four of the court\u2019s six justices voted to order a new election within 60 days.The ruling was the first of its kind in Africa and a powerful reminder for democracies elsewhere of the importance of independent institutions. Kenyans celebrated what they saw as a victory for the country\u2019s institutions, with many saying they were more interested in a clean and transparent process than in seeing their candidate win.\u201cWe\u2019re heading towards the right direction,\u201d said one Kenyatta supporter, David Kiema, 25, who nevertheless supported the court\u2019s decision. Kenya, he said, is \u201ca mirror\u201d for other countries to deal with similar controversies over elections. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Kenya has done it, why not us?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re one step ahead of others in Africa, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201dIn Venezuela, Turkey, the United States and other countries, some elected leaders have portrayed institutions like the press or the judiciary as enemies of the people. Even among some of the most established democracies like Britain, distrust of institutions is rising, weakening social cohesion.Kenya, East Africa\u2019s most vibrant economy, could be moving in the opposite direction, as part of a small but growing trend seen in the rest of Africa. Last year, Ghana held a fair and peaceful election. This year in Gambia, President Yahya Jammeh left the country after finally bowing to the result of an election that ended his 23-year rule.In 2015, Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most-populous country, experienced its first transfer of power from one civilian government to another since independence in 1960, a process widely applauded across the continent.Even in South Africa, a country where President Jacob Zuma\u2019s governing party has been accused of seeking to weaken checks and balances, institutions have fought back \u2014 both the court system and ombudsman have called Mr. Zuma to account on accusations of using state funds to upgrade his homestead.\u201cThere is a strong commitment among millions of Africans that they want to be able to elect their leaders and to participate in a democratic process,\u201d said Johnnie Carson, a former assistant secretary of state for the bureau of African affairs and a senior adviser at the Institute of Peace.\u201cThe march of a democracy across Africa is not uniform; it is not always smooth, linear or rapid, but it continues,\u201d Mr. Carson said.Justice Maraga blamed the electoral commission for irregularities and absolved Mr. Kenyatta of any misconduct, a decision that many Kenyans said was driven by the desire to prevent the kind of violence and ethnic clashes that erupted over elections in 2007 and 2013.Kenya\u2019s disputed presidential election in 2007 set off bloodshed that left at least 1,300 people dead and 600,000 displaced around the country.On Friday, the streets of Nairobi, were tranquil. People seemed to move at a more languid pace than normal, as if a big and tight balloon were being slowly deflated.\u201cHe\u2019s a hero, he\u2019s history,\u201d said Laban Busaka, 25, referring to Justice Maraga. \u201cNo one is above the law. That is the people\u2019s wish and the people\u2019s will.\u201dWhile there were some who were disappointed with the court\u2019s ruling, many Kenyans said that having an independent judiciary was far more important than seeing their candidate win.Caroline Wambugu, 23, who had voted for Mr. Kenyatta, applauded the court ruling even if that meant she had to stand in line again for hours on Election Day and face the possibility that her candidate could lose. \u201cNow you can trust the courts and their handling of future elections,\u201d she said.Despite the initial euphoria over the Supreme Court decision and its reflection of the growing maturity of Kenya\u2019s democracy, there were concerns that a new election could renew the possibility of postelection violence, some commentators said.There is also a worry that whoever wins could see the judiciary as a threat and try to curb its independence, said Patrick Gathara, a political commentator. \u201cWe saw this after 2003, after then-President Mwai Kibaki started to roll back the freedoms that allowed him to get elected,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s great that the court made a stand for its independence, but we need institutions to buttress it,\u201d Mr. Gathara said, adding that two of the judges who sided with Justice Maraga sat on the Supreme Court in 2013 and rejected a similar petition by Mr. Odinga.\u201cWith these reversals, you never know what happens five years from now,\u201d he said.In the days after the latest presidential election, Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s government tried to shut down civil society groups. Just hours after his re-election was annulled, Mr. Kenyatta expressed his anger toward the court, saying that \u201csix people\u201d had ruled \u201cagainst the will of the people.\u201d Speaking to his supporters, he called Justice Maraga and the other justices \u201cthugs\u201d who had been \u201cpaid by foreigners and other fools.\u201dDespite those inflammatory remarks, Mr. Kenyatta has respected the country\u2019s laws and not called on the security forces to thwart the court\u2019s ruling, said Patrick Lumumba, the lawyer representing Mr. Kenyatta in the latest Supreme Court case.\u201cUltimately it is his actions that should be given meaning,\u201d Mr. Lumumba said. Kenya is well past the point of using the military to settle electoral disputes, he said.\u201cThe Kenyan judiciary is maturing and continually doing things in the country\u2019s best interests,\u201d he said. \u201cThey make mistakes, so it will have its days that will appear to be politically serving, but that is a process of growth.\u201dBefore the election, the government accused Justice Maraga of siding with the opposition.At one point, Mr. Kenyatta tried to woo voters in Justice Maraga\u2019s hometown by saying the government had given \u201ctheir son\u201d a plum job as chief justice.To Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s surprise, Justice Maraga fought back, accusing the president of \u201cpeddling\u201d false claims. Those claims, the chief justice said, had a \u201ccorrosive effect on the perception of the independence of the judiciary.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It includes seven separate units, each \u201cowned solely and independently,\u201d said Fiona Gormley, the director of residential sales for Savills Aberdeen, which has the listing.This particular unit is 3,555 square feet and occupies three floors of the castle\u2019s south wing. The interior is mostly contemporary, though it retains some original details, including high ceilings, wood floors, paneled wood doors and tall windows.The large entrance hall is on the ground floor, along with a laundry room and stairs down to two vaulted stone cellars.The living room, dining room and kitchen are on the second floor. The living room has a fireplace and views of the southern grounds of the property, including an ice house and a dovecote, or pigeon house, dating to the 15th century, before the original castle was built. The formal dining room has a large window that also has southern views, and the kitchen has modern, fitted cabinets, period windows and room for a casual dining area.The four bedrooms, one of which is currently used as a study, are on the third floor. Three of them share a bathroom; the master bedroom has an en-suite bath.The home includes a private half-acre backyard and a two-car garage, and shares a central courtyard garden with another unit.MARKET OVERVIEWBefore 2014, sales had been robust and prices were rising 10 to 30 percent a year, agents said. There was often competition for homes, which sometimes sold for 10 to 15 percent over the asking price, Mr. Leith said. \u201cNow there are more sellers than buyers,\u201d he added, \u201cand prices are typically between 5 percent and 15 percent lower than valuations.\u201dBut last year, the market began to show signs of bottoming out, agents said, and in the second quarter of 2o17, there were 1,451 home sales in the Aberdeen area, a 14.3 percent increase compared to a year earlier, according to the Aberdeen Solicitors Property Centre, a local group that tracks the market. Even so, prices were down 4.2 percent in the same period, compared to a year earlier, according to the group\u2019s index.Homes in the center of the city that are priced below \u00a3300,000 (or about $395,500) are the most in demand, Mr. Leith said: \u201cAs prices have fallen, more people have opted to stay central and avoid a commute, when they can now buy an appropriately sized property closer to work.\u201dThe higher end of the market is \u201cwhere activity is most subdued,\u201d said Robert Davidson, a partner in Peterkins, a Scottish law firm. \u201cThe number of people in the area on larger salaries, most of which were paid to those employed in the oil and gas sector, have fallen significantly.\u201dApartments and smaller houses around Aberdeen\u2019s large universities are the properties most likely to sell, Mr. Davidson said. \u201cFlats can be attractive to parents looking for accommodation for their children while at university, coupled with an opportunity for investment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also a good time for first-time buyers to purchase, so cheaper properties are where most of the activity in the market is.\u201dWHO BUYS IN ABERDEENMost buyers are Scottish citizens taking advantage of the low prices to buy a home for the first time or to trade up to a bigger one, agents said. \u201cThere are virtually no vacation-home transactions, and very few investors active at the moment,\u201d Mr. Leith said.International buyers have virtually disappeared from the market since the decline of the energy sector, agents said.

{"Headline": "As Economy Grows, Fed Set to Shrink Bond Holdings", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve, which invested trillions of dollars to prop up the American economy after the 2008 financial crisis, is finally ready to take away the crutches.The Fed is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will gradually reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of United States Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, a move that would amount to a vote of confidence that the economy\u2019s slow-but-steady growth is likely to continue.The Fed, concerned about the reaction in financial markets, has tried to eliminate any suspense by publishing a detailed schedule and promising to move very slowly. But just as the Fed\u2019s bond purchases after the 2008 crisis were unprecedented, the retreat will again take the reserve banking system into uncharted territory. No one can be certain what will happen.\u201cWhat the Fed is going to do this week will not surprise anyone,\u201d said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities. \u201cAnd the models predict a slow and smooth adjustment. But there is always a risk of more volatility.\u201dTwo large and related questions also remain unanswered. The Fed has not said how large it would like its balance sheet to be, so there is no finish line for the retreat. Also, there is a good chance the Fed\u2019s current leadership will not complete the journey. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, ends a four-year term in early February, and President Trump has not announced whether he plans to nominate her for a second term.The Fed responded to the crisis that began a decade ago by cutting its benchmark interest rate nearly to zero, and by vacuuming up huge quantities of bonds. Both measures were designed to revive economic activity by reducing borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to car loans.The first round of bond-buying, often called \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d or QE, began during the crisis and there is broad agreement that it helped to bolster financial markets.The second and third rounds, which came after the crisis, remain controversial.Buying a bond is the same thing has lending money to the seller. Buyers compete by offering to accept lower rates. The Fed\u2019s massive purchases increased competition for available Treasuries and thus drove down interest rates.The Fed\u2019s purchases of mortgage bonds had a similar effect.Fed officials, and a wide range of independent economists, argue that the downward pressure on Treasury rates rippled outward to other kinds of borrowing costs, as private investors moved into other markets in search of better returns.These impacts, however, are difficult to measure, and some independent economists argue that any broad economic benefits were modest, at best.\u201cThere has been an explosion of research, dozens and dozens of papers, and almost all of them agree that QE lowered bond yields,\u201d said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThe financial market effects are very clear. Did that stimulate growth? Did that stimulate inflation? It\u2019s always impossible to prove, but all the models we have imply it should have helped.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s program was intended to encourage risk-taking by investors, but some critics warned it would create new asset bubbles. Those warnings have not yet been borne out.The Fed\u2019s retreat began two years ago, when the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the crisis. It now sits between 1 percent and 1.25 percent. The Fed is not expected to raise rates on Wednesday. Job growth has remained strong this year, but some officials are worried about the persistent weakness of inflation.The Fed plans to reduce its bond holdings with similar care. It plans to cut $10 billion a month for the first three months, divided 60-40 between Treasuries and mortgage bonds. It will then raise the pace by $10 billion every three months.Mr. Alexander, and other analysts, see a number of factors likely to limit the impact on interest rates, at least in the short term. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan continue to buy bonds, putting downward pressure on rates. And the Treasury is issuing less long-term debt at the moment, reducing the volume of new securities that markets must absorb.It is also not clear how much shrinking the Fed plans to do. It needs to hold about $1.5 trillion in bonds to meet demand for currency, which it puts into circulation by purchasing bonds. That number is projected to nearly double over the next decade.The Fed also needs to hold hundreds of billions of dollars in bonds to maintain its current system for controlling interest rates, which it adopted after the crisis.Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor, said earlier this year that the new system is working well and the balance sheet is unlikely to shrink much below $3 trillion.But maintaining a large balance sheet also means the Fed would remain a more prominent presence in short-term funding markets, where it has displaced some private activity. William Nelson, chief economist at The Clearing House, a trade group representing large banks, said the Fed should return to its pre-crisis operating procedures, which required a much smaller balance sheet.\u201cThe pre-crisis framework worked very well. The Fed had very good control of rates and economic activity,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. \u201cNobody was complaining that the Fed\u2019s control of interest rates pre-crisis was not precise enough.\u201dAnother open question is whether the Fed would buy bonds in responding to a future downturn. Fed officials predict the benchmark rate will not rise much above 3 percent. That\u2019s a problem because during the past nine recessions, the Fed has cut the rate by an average of 5.5 percentage points to stimulate the economy.But Mr. Trump could choose a Fed chairman who disagrees. Kevin Warsh, an adviser to Mr. Trump who is among the possible candidates, resigned as a Fed governor in 2011 in part because he opposed the Fed\u2019s second round of asset purchases.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: \u2018Shark Tank\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationWhen I was 10 or so, my mom took me to a Fourth of July barbecue so we could celebrate America in our traditional family way \u2014 at her Howard Zinn-reading grad-student friend\u2019s apartment, where most of the other guests were aspiring screenwriters. The America we celebrated was one that encouraged protest and strived for justice, peace and equality. My lasting memory of the party came after dark, after the fireworks, after the hot dogs, when the host brought out a tiny American flag and set fire to it. He handed it to me. I was mesmerized, enchanted. I held the small wooden pole and watched the sacred symbol of America burn. It was the mid-\u201980s, and Ronald Reagan was a hated capitalist pig in our household.Something happened in the intervening 30 years, because today, my favorite TV show is \u201cShark Tank.\u201d I think President Reagan would have loved it, too, for it is trickle-down economics if trickle-down economics actually worked, a Potemkin village dedicated to the wonders of capitalism. The premise of the tank is that small-business owners get an audience with investors \u2014 the \u201csharks,\u201d a crew of millionaires and billionaires that includes Mark Cuban, Daymond John and Lori Greiner, the \u201cqueen of QVC\u201d \u2014 in the hope of provoking a bidding war for a stake in the company. Sometimes the sharks dismiss the ideas outright, and they often do so cruelly, but in a satisfying, detailed way. You start to feel as if you could write your own business plan after watching a few episodes.Finding an episode of \u201cShark Tank\u201d is easy; it\u2019s basically always on. Reruns air on CNBC five nights a week, sometimes in seven-hour blocks. Watch enough episodes, and the segments begin to reveal a similar rhythm; seeing the pitch process repeated so many times in rapid succession, a viewer develops a sort of omniscience, that mixture of intimacy and superiority that is unique to reality TV. By Hour 2, I find myself thinking that Lori is crazy for not investing in a perfect QVC product or that Mark is a moron for passing up a product that could easily pair with his sports empire. Still, the outcomes hardly matter to me \u2014 I can play couch shark just as easily as I can play couch entrepreneur.The miracle of \u201cShark Tank\u201d is that it recasts a brutal economic system in its best light. The show dramatizes a romantic vision of our economy, depicting it as a bootstrap meritocracy. Most of the people appearing onstage are regular folks applying for patents and tinkering with plastic molds in their garages, dreaming of the sorts of modestly profitable businesses that no real venture capitalist would ever touch. They sell special brooms or gluten-free frosting or inventions like the Squatty Potty \u2014 a stool that claims to induce the \u201cbest poop of your life.\u201d On a recent segment, two potential entrepreneurs walked in with a live llama and pitched a GPS security gadget called the Guard Llama. The prop llama pooped in the middle of negotiations. Still, they got a deal.Part of the show\u2019s appeal is that it\u2019s an equal-opportunity forum \u2014 you don\u2019t have to know a Silicon Valley V.C. or even a banker to get your audience with the sharks. This is, to put it lightly, not at all how the actual venture-capital world works. For a year, I worked for a company founded by the daughter of a venture capitalist who notoriously and proudly boasted about his nepotism. During my job interview with him, he made his habit of investing in his children\u2019s companies clear. It was a savvy business strategy, he said, because his children were smart and he could get in on the ground floor. Why not trust those closest to you?This conversation confirmed for me everything I was taught when I was young \u2014 that American capitalism was a fallacy built on the concept of equality. The America I read about was founded on slavery, misogyny and genocidal brutality. Even when its elites proceed with the best intentions, the inequities of the system recreate themselves generation after generation. Any meritocratic veneer is belied by the way capital wends its way through our world. For example, venture capitalists tend to be white men, and they tend to invest in white men with software that destroys middle-class jobs, while sometimes reaping ungodly returns for their investors. And in this way, wealth begets wealth \u2014 except on \u201cShark Tank,\u201d where we witness a comforting, inclusive form of capitalism in action.I was so politically assertive as a kid because I wanted someone to respect my opinion, to value me. I wanted to be taken seriously. I think most kids feel this way, dismissed outright for being small. In the tank, no one is dismissed \u2014 the sharks start every segment with furrowed brows, ready to take notes and hear out pitches, no matter how preposterous. They begin the process with a clean slate every time. Somewhere deep down, I want all these deals to work, I want the enthusiasm that sharks feel to be genuine and I want the contestants to walk away with business plans ready to be set into motion. Even if \u201cShark Tank\u201d is propaganda \u2014 the selling and marketing of the American dream \u2014 the fantasy feels real. I get to imagine the country as it could be but never really was.Jaime Lowe is the author of \u201cMental,\u201d out Oct. 3 from Blue Rider Press.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Shifts Labor Policy Focus From Worker to Entrepreneur", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisEven by the standards of the Trump era, one of the more unusual departures from recent Washington practice came in June, in a case before the Supreme Court involving worker rights.\u201cWhat\u2019s pretty unprecedented is that they came to a different conclusion in the Supreme Court case,\u201d said M. Patricia Smith, the solicitor at the Labor Department under President Barack Obama.(A Justice Department spokesman said that every administration sometimes departs from the position of its predecessors in new Supreme Court cases.)It is one of a series of actions that have reversed course on rights and protections for workers.That a Republican administration would nonetheless pursue a business-friendly labor policy is not unexpected. But beyond partisan politics, its record on worker issues reflects a consistent Trump worldview: that entrepreneurship is the highest economic calling and the entrepreneur is the economic actor most deserving of respect.Allies say that despite criticism for his inattention to policy, he has set the tone for his administration on regulatory issues. \u201cThis is where Trump has been a master transmitting very clearly what his agenda is,\u201d said David French, a senior vice president at the National Retail Federation.In Mr. Trump\u2019s view of the world, it is entrepreneurs, and not rank-and-file workers, on which the health of the economy heavily depends.\u201cToday, too many people, young and old, are looking for jobs,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his 2011 book, \u201cMidas Touch: Why Some Entrepreneurs Get Rich \u2014 and Why Most Don\u2019t,\u201d written with the financial self-help guru Robert Kiyosaki. \u201cWe need more entrepreneurs who can create businesses and jobs.\u201dLawrence Glickman, a historian who studies free enterprise at Cornell University, said that such veneration of entrepreneurs arose as part of an early backlash to the New Deal. \u201cThe idea of work sort of drops out, and there\u2019s only the heroic entrepreneur,\u201d he said.In its purest form, the view is somewhat at odds with the Republican fondness for corporate managers, who, whatever their importance, are essentially employees.Mr. Trump himself has long elevated the entrepreneur above the business executive in his personal hierarchy. Reflecting on his decision to attend the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, \u201cHarvard Business School may produce a lot of C.E.O.s \u2014 guys who manage public companies \u2014 but the real entrepreneurs all seemed to go to Wharton.\u201dHis administration\u2019s actions have been consistent with that calculus of valuing entrepreneurship over employment.In withdrawing the interpretation, the Trump administration appeared to give more cover to the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who have been at the forefront of this debate in recent years.David Weil, the Obama administration official responsible for the issue, said he had met with start-up founders and observed that \u201cthere is buried a little bit in their view, \u2018Why are you bothering me with this employee stuff when I\u2019m actually giving people a chance to be entrepreneurs?\u2019\u201dThe second guidance had laid out when a company could be considered a so-called joint employer \u2014 meaning that it shared responsibility for a worker alongside a contractor, staffing agency or franchisee \u2014 and could therefore be held liable for infractions those other companies committed.Business advocacy groups have invoked entrepreneurship when arguing against what they say is a relatively expansive Obama-era view of who qualifies as a joint employer. According to Matt Haller, a senior official at the International Franchise Association, the Obama approach pressured many parent companies to exert a level of control over franchises that \u201cturns an owner into a middle manager.\u201d\u201cIt becomes a drag on upward mobility,\u201d Mr. Haller said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody \u2014 any successful franchisee \u2014 who hasn\u2019t put skin in the game, who doesn\u2019t want to be in control.\u201dA White House spokesman, Ninio Fetalvo, said, \u201cPresident Trump is committed to growing the economy and creating jobs through the entrepreneurial successes of America\u2019s small businesses.\u201dThe administration\u2019s entrepreneurial ethos is also reflected in its posture toward another rule: the requirement that employers pay workers a time-and-a-half rate for overtime if their salary falls below a certain threshold. The Obama administration extended overtime pay eligibility to millions of workers by raising this threshold to more than $47,000, from about $23,600, where it had stood for more than a decade.Mr. Trump has described his own employment as a stop on the way to greater ambitions \u2014 he worked for his father\u2019s real estate business before seeking his fortune in Manhattan \u2014 and his allies have invoked a similar logic when criticizing the overtime rule.Mr. Puzder eventually withdrew his nomination amid personal controversy, but the philosophy he spoke up for has gained a foothold nonetheless.At his confirmation hearing in March, Mr. Acosta suggested that the salary below which workers automatically become eligible for overtime should be substantially lower than the Obama standard \u2014 perhaps in the low $30,000s.Then, referring to the Obama policy, he added, \u201cBecause of the size of the increase, there are serious questions as to whether the secretary of labor even has the power to enact this in the first place.\u201dFollow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiberAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Houston\u2019s Growth Created the Perfect Flood Conditions", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "Advertisement\nAs floodwaters from Hurricane Harvey recede in Houston, one thing that\u2019s been revealed is that some of the damage \u2014 financial, physical, emotional \u2014 could have been avoided.Flood hazard maps by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, showing the 100-year floodplain, an area with a 1 percent risk for flooding in any given year, mark where homeowners are required to have federally sponsored flood insurance. This is one of the few early warning signals the United States has for flooding. For Houston, those maps were thoroughly inadequate. Early assessments show many homes were flooded even though they were located far from the designated floodplains. Many homes in what\u2019s known as the 500-year floodplain \u2014 with a 0.2 percent chance of flooding in a year \u2014 are also flooded.Areas surrounding the Katy Prairies, sprawling grasslands in western Harris County, provide one such example. The region has been heavily developed over the past 30 years, sometimes overlapping or abutting floodplains. Local officials did not do enough to preserve native grasses, set aside open spaces or improve drainage.Damage around Katy was not restricted to floodplains identified by FEMA.\u201cIt gives people a feeling of complacency if they are not required to buy insurance,\u201d said Howard Kunreuther, the co-director of the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He would like to see FEMA provide people the \"gradation of their risk.\"Less understandable is how often these flood maps were ignored in Houston, where policies encouraged development in flood-prone areas while reducing the region\u2019s natural defenses to flooding.And while the region has its own unique history, geography, economy and approach to growth, the lessons it will be learning in the coming weeks would apply to many other areas of the country.FEMA flood risk zonesBuilding Damage100-year500-yearOUTSIDE floodPLAINSSpringHockleyHOUSTONJersey Village12HighlandsKatyPasadenaBaytownEast Houston21Damaged buildingsoutside floodplainsSource: FEMA (building damage); Beyond Floods (floodplains)FEMA flood risk zonesBuilding Damage100-year500-yearOUTSIDE floodPLAINSHARRIS COUNTYSpringHockleyHOUSTONJersey Village1HighlandsKaty2PasadenaEast HoustonBaytown12Damaged buildingsoutside floodplainsSources: FEMA (building damage, through Sept. 2, 2017); Beyond Floods (floodplains)FEMA flood risk zones100-year500-yearBuilding DamageOUTSIDE floodplainsHARRIS COUNTYHOUSTONJersey Village1HighlandsKaty2PasadenaEast Houston1Damaged buildingsoutside floodplainsBaytown2Sources: FEMA (building damage, through Sept. 2,2017); Beyond Floods (floodplains)With Houston\u2019s economy booming, thanks in large part to oil and gas industries, residential and business development spread.

Both areas experienced heavy flooding during the hurricane.FEMA maps are updated infrequently because Congress has not appropriated enough money for the work. The maps do not take into account the future impact of climate change or the impact of likely real estate development in the area. In addition, FEMA has not created flood maps for the entire country, leaving some home buyers unaware of flooding risks, said Larry Larson, a senior policy advisor at the Association of State Floodplain Managers.A more nuanced view of flood risk may be possible.

{"Headline": "Building a Better Coral Reef", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "As reefs die off, researchers want to breed the world\u2019s hardiest corals in labs and return them to the sea to multiply. The effort raises scientific and ethical questions.Supported byON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF, off Australia \u2014 After a plunge beneath the crystal-clear water to inspect a coral reef, Neal Cantin pulled off his mask and shook his head.\u201cAll dead,\u201d he said.Yet even as he and his dive team of international scientists lamented the devastation that human recklessness has inflicted on the world\u2019s greatest system of reefs, they also found cause for hope.As they spent days working through a stretch of ocean off the Australian state of Queensland, Dr. Cantin and his colleagues surfaced with sample after sample of living coral that had somehow dodged a recent die-off: hardy survivors, clinging to life in a graveyard.The goal is not just to study them, but to find the ones with the best genes, multiply them in tanks on land and ultimately return them to the ocean where they can continue to breed. The hope is to create tougher reefs \u2014 to accelerate evolution, essentially \u2014 and slowly build an ecosystem capable of surviving global warming and other human-caused environmental assaults.The research here is part of a worldwide push that is growing increasingly urgent. After decades of accumulating damage, followed by a huge die-off in 2015 and 2016, some scientists say they believe half the coral reefs that existed in the early 20th century are gone.Instead of standing around watching the rest of them die, a vanguard of reef experts is determined to act.In Florida, they are pioneering techniques that may allow the rapid re-establishment of reefs killed by heat stress. In Hawaii, they are studying the biology of corals that somehow managed to cling to life as an earlier generation of people dumped raw sewage into a magnificent bay. In the Caribbean, countries are banding together to create a genetic storage bank for corals, a backup plan if today\u2019s reefs all die.This year is on track to be the third consecutive hottest year on record. Where does that heat go? The oceans, mostly.Yet this new push to aid the world\u2019s reefs comes with its own risks, and with many questions.A large-scale restoration effort could be expensive, and so far, governments have put up only modest sums, despite the hit that their multibillion-dollar tourism industries could take from continued deterioration of the reefs. Private philanthropists \u2014 including Paul G. Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft \u2014 are paying for much of the early work, spending millions. But will they ultimately commit billions?And while scientists are trying modest approaches first, the most effective strategy for saving reefs in the long run might be through genetic methods, including selective breeding or transferring heat-resistance genes into corals. That type of thing has been done for crops, but would it be ethical to do it in the wild?\u201cHow do you decide what interventions are right and when to intervene?\u201d said Madeleine van Oppen, a professor of marine biology at the University of Melbourne who is leading the experiments in Australia, aiming at what she calls the \u201cassisted evolution\u201d of coral reefs. \u201cThere\u2019s a long road ahead; that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting now.\u201dQuestions like these appear to be an inescapable part of the human future, and they go beyond coral reefs.Scientists first warned decades ago that coral reefs were particularly sensitive to heat stress and would be among the earliest victims of global warming if emissions were not brought under control.Extremely hot days are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades, potentially disrupting our everyday lives.They were ignored, and humanity continued burning fossil fuels with abandon \u2014 setting up an early test of whether the scientific predictions about global warming could be believed.Most of the heat trapped by those emissions has gone into the oceans, which have now warmed enough that just a bit of additional heat can cause massive coral die-offs. The extra jolt arrives during El Ni\u00f1o weather patterns that warm large parts of the tropics.The first global coral die-off began in 1982, and now they seem to be happening every few years. Along the Great Barrier Reef, the El Ni\u00f1o-related heat wave of 2015-16 left 35 to 50 percent of the corals dead along a 650-mile stretch of the Queensland coastline, a profound blow to what was the single most impressive reef on Earth.\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to be aggressive and make changes to preserve the reef of the future,\u201d Dr. Cantin said. But, he added, without a broad effort that includes tackling the emissions causing climate change, reefs could largely die within this century.Coral reefs are among the most beautiful sights on the planet, dubbed the \u201crain forests of the sea\u201d because, while occupying a tiny area, they harbor much of the variety of life in the ocean. The brightly hued corals attract equally vivid fish, as though the creatures had dressed to match their surroundings.Coral polyps are tiny animals that act a bit like farmers, raising even tinier plants \u2014 algae \u2014 that supply them with food. The corals excrete a hard substance that builds up into a reef, giving the coral polyps and many other creatures a place to live.The loss of coral reefs is not just an aesthetic disaster. A half-billion people depend on reef fish for food, and in some island nations, they are essentially the only source of protein. The continued destruction of reefs might well worsen global hunger. In wealthier nations, and especially in Australia, the reefs are a prime attraction in tourist economies worth billions.Dr. Cantin is among the many marine biologists who spent the past two years watching huge stretches of Australia\u2019s greatest natural wonder die from the heat.And yet, on a three-day trip in July to harvest coral samples, he repeatedly found himself surprised. The Rib Reef, where he was diving, had been healthy and vibrant only a year ago. But during his return visit, large sections were dead, covered in algae that looked like soot.The samples he collected \u2014 of the Pocillopora acuta species \u2014 were often the only healthy chunks of coral to be found among canyons of dead reefs.Near the end of their research trip, he and two other scientists dove for nearly an hour before finding just three samples, which they removed with a hammer and chisel and placed in a metal supermarket dish rack for transport to the surface.\u201cThis is probably a three-year-old coral,\u201d he said back on the boat, admiring a pinkish sample with a handful of healthy branches that made it look like a fist-size shrub. \u201cWe want to take the whole adult coral, collect its babies and then grow the larvae into adult coral.\u201dProfessor van Oppen, a senior scientist who oversees Dr. Cantin\u2019s research, said that part of what makes the Australian experiment stand out is the \u201csea simulator\u201d at the Townsville marine institute. It is a complex high technology laboratory where corals live in tanks with water temperatures that can be calibrated to a tenth of a degree and simulate seasonal patterns of warming events. Lighting systems replicate the moon cycles that corals use to time their spawning.Future generations of corals, the offspring of the those Dr. Cantin harvested, will be tested for resilience in this artificial environment, with warmer and more acidic water that mimics what scientists are predicting for the years 2050 and 2100.The strongest corals will then become parents again, with some crossbreeding of the same species from different sections of the reef and also crossbreeding of different species to create genetic hybrids.\u201cIf the speed of natural adaptation was fast enough to keep up with climate change, we wouldn\u2019t see the scale of loss we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Professor van Oppen said. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgent need to come up with ways to slow it down.\u201dOn a recent day at the lab, a manager, Jen Davidson, meticulously examined coral colonies growing in indoor tanks under artificial lights.Starting with hardy coral polyps that survived past environmental assaults in Kaneohe Bay, the Gates lab is trying to make them even hardier, crossbreeding the corals and testing offspring in water treated to mimic the hotter, more acidic conditions likely to prevail in a future ocean.Under normal conditions the animals grow and build their reefs only slowly, one of the factors that is stymying the effort to save them. \u201cWe can do all this work here, but can we scale it up enough to make an impact?\u201d Ms. Davidson asked.\u201cIt used to take us six years to produce 600 corals,\u201d Dr. Vaughan said in an interview. \u201cNow we can produce 600 corals in an afternoon, and be ready in a few months to plant them.\u201dFlorida\u2019s reefs have been badly damaged over the years, not just by climate change but by more direct human assaults, like overfishing that disturbs the ecological balance. Yet the Mote lab and other centers have already replanted thousands of small coral colonies.Though the risks remain unclear, the day may come when many of the reefs off Florida and Australia will be ones created by scientific intervention \u2014 a human effort, in other words, to repair the damage humans have done.\u201cWe\u2019ve shown that there is hope in all of this,\u201d said Kayla Ripple, manager of the science program at the Coral Restoration Foundation. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t just throw their hands in the air and say there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a photo caption with a previous version of this article gave the wrong name for the research center headed by Dr. Ruth Gates.

That\u2019s immediately where most people saw me,\u201d he recalled over breakfast earlier this month at the Soho Grand. Instead, he realized, \u201cI didn\u2019t have to go there. I could go weirder.\u201dHe took his time, experimented, collaborated and followed the ideas and instincts that led him to the release, this week, of his debut album, \u201cAromanticism.\u201d It\u2019s a musical reverie that has slow-motion R&B melting into folky tranquillity and undulating loops. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling I wanted to capture on this record,\u201d he said. \u201cThat moment as you\u2019re falling asleep, or right when you wake up, when you\u2019re still one foot in and one foot out of the dream world, and everything is really murky and you feel like you\u2019re floating.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been in love, in romantic love,\u201d Mr. Sumney elaborated. Tall, with mini-dreadlocks and chiseled features, he was dressed, as he often is, in black: a sleeveless mesh shirt, pleated trousers. \u201cI have experienced romantic attraction to varying degrees, and I have platonic love, and I obviously love music. But romantic love is its own genre, and that is something that I have never experienced full-blown.\u201dHe added, \u201cI was just bored with the love song, the idea of the love song as the archetype, and also the culture that suggests romantic love is the end-all and be-all of human existence. I wanted to question and challenge that on a personal level and on the social level \u2014 the personal is the social. I think I just felt alienated by the idea of pursuing romantic love. And I never fully saw myself in love songs, although I enjoy them. But I was wondering, what else is there?\u201dMr. Sumney, 27, was born in San Bernardino, Calif.; both his parents were Christian pastors from Ghana. His family moved to Accra, Ghana\u2019s capital, to start churches when he was 10. Already shy, he was even more of a misfit in a place where he spoke the local language, Twi, with an American accent. He began writing songs when he was 12, but kept them to himself.After the family moved back to California, he joined the high school choir: \u201cThat\u2019s when I learned what harmony was,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t, and doesn\u2019t, read music. \u201cWhen I play the guitar I just go wherever my ear suggests. I don\u2019t know the names of any of the chords and I don\u2019t know any of the keys my songs are in,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that helps to be adventurous, the freedom of not knowing where it\u2019s supposed to go.\u201dHe moved to Los Angeles to enroll at U.C.L.A., where he majored in creative writing and began to play guitar. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t have any musical training, I couldn\u2019t apply to the music school,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I figured I would just study writing and apply what I learned there to songwriting. Economy was a huge thing that I learned, and observation. It\u2019s all about observation, really.\u201dWhen King got a monthlong residency at the Bootleg Theater in Los Angeles, it chose Mr. Sumney for the opening act. Suddenly, he was noticed.\u201cI knew that he had his own voice and his own calling,\u201d Mr. Sitek said by telephone from his studio in Los Angeles. \u201cI just felt lucky to be listening, and that is a super rare feeling. It\u2019s a sense of wonder. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s around every corner.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Sumney was recording what would become \u201cAromanticism,\u201d mostly in home studios around Los Angeles, moving from cassette to computer and enlisting string arrangers, horns and a rhythm section to waft in and out of the songs.But he\u2019s equally determined to probe sociopolitical tensions. \u201cQuarrel,\u201d a ballad that suggests both the sinuous synthesizer constructions of Stevie Wonder and the airy harmonies of the Beach Boys, concludes: \u201cWe cannot be lovers/Long as I\u2019m the other.\u201d\u201cThat song is about two people from different backgrounds in an entanglement, in a relationship, romantic or otherwise,\u201d Mr. Sumney explained. \u201cOne is in some sort of minority status \u2014 though when I wrote it I was thinking a lot about class, actually.

{"Headline": "What Trump Can Do to Prevent the Next Crash", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by The Federal Reserve arguably has more influence on the daily lives of Americans than any other government agency. In the coming year President Trump has a chance to appoint or replace five of the central bank\u2019s seven governors, including the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, and possibly the chairwoman, Janet Yellen.Few presidents have had so many seats to fill this quickly, and it\u2019s time to pay attention to how Mr. Trump will use the opportunity. The heavy hitters vying for seats are talking \u2014 often vaguely \u2014 about reforming the Fed, which has been praised for preventing a depression after the financial crisis of 2008, but questioned for failing to anticipate the crisis itself.The Fed missed the crisis in part because it has a dual mandate to keep unemployment and consumer price inflation low \u2014 and both were low before 2008. Real reform would add a third mandate: maintaining financial stability, and in particular stabilizing prices for assets like houses and stocks, which are not counted as \u201cconsumer prices\u201d but now have a bigger influence on the economy.Consumer price inflation has largely disappeared, in part because central bankers have been fighting it effectively since the 1970s, and in part because heightened global competition began restraining prices for consumer goods from TVs to toys. Meanwhile, asset prices are getting pushed in the opposite direction.To ease the Great Recession after 2008, central banks adopted zero to negative interest rates and provided huge amounts of cash, effectively giving investors free money. In a world with few barriers to the flow of capital across borders, this is spurring buying sprees, and thus bidding up prices for stocks, bonds and real estate in markets from New York to Shanghai.Today, global financial assets (including just stocks and bonds) are worth over $250 trillion and amount to about 330 percent of global gross domestic product, up from $12 trillion and just 110 percent in 1980. Traditionally, economists have looked for trouble in the economy to cause trouble in the markets. But the ocean of money in financial markets is now so large, it\u2019s possible that ripples on its surface could trigger the next big downturn.Since 1990, every major economic shock has been preceded by a collapse in prices for houses, stocks or both, including Japan\u2019s crash in 1990, the Asian crisis of the late 1990s, the dot-com crash of 2000-01, and the global financial crisis of 2008.The Fed has changed with the world before. After the Great Depression, it focused on fighting unemployment. Amid crippling consumer price inflation in the 1970s, it shifted its focus to fighting this scourge. Now, amid looming market bubbles from China to Norway, central bankers are tentatively starting to recognize that they can\u2019t ignore asset price inflation. At the Federal Open Market Committee, its key policy-making body, financial stability rarely came up before 2012 but has come up at 27 of 39 meetings since.Of course, even market insiders can\u2019t spot when asset prices are ready to crash, so skeptics say the Fed can\u2019t be expected to either. Better to let bubbles pop and \u201cmop up\u201d after. However, the painfully slow recovery from 2008 shows how ineffective mess-mopping can be: Losses after the crash tend to be much bigger than gains on the way up. The Fed need not try to predict the market\u2019s peak; it needs only to identify signals of crises, so that it can act early to forestall them, controlling asset price inflation by raising rates or reducing cash infusions into the economy.At least equally telling is the pace of increase in debt. When asset prices collapse, the owners suffer instant pain. But when debt used to buy those assets collapses, the resulting defaults ripple through banks and become a drag on the economy. The longest and deepest recessions tend to follow real estate busts, because homes are almost always purchased on credit, and during booms, so many buyers are tempted to borrow excessively for that dream house.Nonetheless most economists \u2014 even conservative deficit hawks who worry about the Fed \u201cblowing bubbles\u201d \u2014 still look mainly for economic threats to the financial markets, rather than the threat that overgrown markets pose.They thus don\u2019t recognize fully that the world has changed, and the tail now wags the dog. Many mainstream economists still argue that the economy can\u2019t be overheating if consumer price inflation is quiet, and they want to keep rates lower for longer, hoping that easy money will stoke growth in the economy, and jobs, for the poor and the working class.However, since 2008, easy money has produced an unusually weak economic recovery alongside an unusually long and strong run-up in prices for stocks, bonds and housing. The rich own the fattest share of these assets, so wealth inequality is increasing. In addition, easy money is fueling monopoly power by helping entrenched companies borrow.Liberals who question the value of promoting monopolies and the superrich might also question their fondness for easy money. Instead, to stabilize financial markets, most favor upholding tough post-2008 regulations \u2014 but regulation alone can\u2019t contain the ocean of money in financial assets. From Australia to Canada to Sweden, central banks are keeping rates low because consumer price inflation is weak, thus fueling housing bubbles. Regulatory attempts to contain those bubbles are failing.Central bankers are starting to recognize that when loose monetary policy is driving up asset prices to potentially unstable levels, it sows the seeds of a recession and hurts everyone. But only a minority are prepared to lean against the wind now. Asset prices from stocks to real estate have never been this expensive simultaneously.In general, government agencies, including the Fed, change their ways only after crises. The big threat is that the Fed will fully commit to preserving financial stability only after instability in the markets has triggered the next crisis. Mr. Trump should be looking for governors who are willing to commit now.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s the U.S.\u2019s Best Chance With North Korea? Russia", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMOSCOW \u2014 Russia is usually seen as relatively unimportant to most discussions about the North Korea nuclear crisis, yet it is in a unique position to help de-escalate it.Russia, in other words, is not simply the spoiler it has often been described as in recent years. It plays its hand with Washington much more subtly than that \u2014 often adopting an adversarial pose, especially of late, but sometimes a cooperative one. And it has good reason to help with North Korea.In any discussion of how to handle the increasing belligerence of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, attention usually turns to China. Beijing and Pyongyang have long been allies, and China is North Korea\u2019s main trade partner. But for a host of strategic reasons, there are inherent limits to what Beijing will do. It is wary of the fallout it would suffer if North Korea imploded, and it wants to preserve a buffer between itself and the United States forces based in South Korea.Russia is both like and unlike China in just the ways that could make it an effective broker with Pyongyang.Russia is not among the countries most directly or most intimately affected by North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, such as the United States, South Korea or China. And unlike China, Russia never was an imperial overlord on the Korean Peninsula. Moscow may have less direct influence with Pyongyang than does Beijing, but it evokes far less nationalistic resentment and suspicion among North Koreans.Russia also has a clear and immediate interest in helping de-escalate the current crisis. Vladivostok, its gateway to the Asia-Pacific region, the headquarters of its Pacific Fleet and a hub for its energy trade, is just a couple hundred miles away from several of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile sites. Any malfunction or other mishap with North Korea\u2019s nuclear tests or missile launches could mean contamination in Russia itself. The Russian government is also eager to curb the further deployment of American missile-defense systems in South Korea and Japan, which both those countries are pursuing to protect themselves against North Korea.North Korea will not denuclearize; it\u2019s too late for that. Neither will it ever formally be recognized as a nuclear power. But it will eventually have crude nuclear weapons with which to strike United States territory.This is not to say that sanctions are a mistake. They remain a valuable expression of collective condemnation and reassert the goal of nuclear nonproliferation. But they will not halt North Korea\u2019s nuclearization.A total blockade of the country might, but it is too risky to even attempt. It could push North Korea to start a war or cause the country\u2019s collapse, a prospect that China, for one, cannot tolerate.And so the only viable strategy left is to convince the North Korean leadership that it already has the deterrent it needs, and that going beyond that \u2014 by developing more nuclear weapons and longer-range missiles \u2014 would only be counterproductive.This is where Russia comes in: It can help nudge Pyongyang toward strategic restraint, and help defuse tensions in the meantime, by offering it new economic prospects.Washington and Pyongyang will eventually need to resume direct talks. With neither party ready for that yet, at first secret contacts will have to be organized in third countries. In the meantime, de-escalation is the order of the day, and Russia one of its unlikely brokers.Dmitri Trenin is director of the Carnegie Moscow Center and a member of the Russian International Affairs Council.Advertisement"}

Sanctions Are Causing \u2018Colossal\u2019 Damage", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea said on Friday that American-led international sanctions were causing \u201ccolossal\u201d damage in the impoverished country, but added that it would be foolish for Washington to think the sanctions would stop the country\u2019s nuclear weapons programs.North Korean officials recently set up a committee to investigate the damage that the sanctions have caused on the country\u2019s economy and the well-being of the population. The committee\u2019s work was designed to draw international sympathy by highlighting the suffering of North Korean children, women and elderly people, analysts said.The sanctions are \u201ca brutal criminal act that indiscriminately infringes upon the right to existence of the peaceful civilians,\u201d said a spokesman of the Sanctions Damage Investigation Committee in a statement carried by the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency on Friday. \u201cThe colossal amount of damage caused by these sanctions to the development of our state and the people\u2019s livelihood is beyond anyone\u2019s calculation.\u201dOn Thursday, China said it would close business joint ventures with North Korea within 120 days, in accordance with the latest United Nations sanctions.North Korea has endured sanctions for decades, devising ways to circumvent them.The unidentified North Korean spokesman said on Friday that it was \u201ca foolish dream to hope that the sanctions could work\u201d on North Korea after they had failed to stop it from becoming a nuclear weapons state.\u201cWe call on all countries to join us in cutting all trade and financial ties with North Korea,\u201d acting Assistant Secretary Susan A. Thornton told a Senate committee on Thursday.Ms. Thornton said the United States had \u201cno desire to inflict harm on the long-suffering North Korean people, whom we view as distinct from the hostile regime in Pyongyang.\u201d But she said sanctions were working and urged the world to rigorously enforce them.In its two recent rounds of sanctions adopted on Aug. 5 and Sept. 11, respectively, the United Nations Security Council sought to ban critical North Korean exports, like textiles, coal, iron and seafood.Poland is the only country in Europe still hosting significant numbers of North Korean workers, she said, while the vast majority of North Korean laborers remaining outside of North Korea are in either China or Russia.China accounts for 90 percent of North Korea\u2019s external trade. Experts say the sanctions won\u2019t work without Chinese support, which Ms. Thornton called \u201cgrowing, if uneven.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Caribbean, Rebuilding Nations \u2014 and the Tourism Industry", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUSTAVIA, St. Barth\u00e9lemy \u2014 The pace is frantic. Residents with shovels clean the streets. Dump trucks laden with the stumps of storm-ravaged trees rumble back and forth along narrow streets. Construction crews clear downed telephone poles and debris from houses and businesses in a race to restore the lifeblood of this small Caribbean island \u2014 tourism.Those who live on St. Barth\u00e9lemy \u2014 working in its restaurants, building its homes, fishing its seas \u2014 know there is nothing without it. And Hurricane Irma, which plowed through this part of the Caribbean, killing more than two dozen people and seriously damaging or destroying the majority of structures on some islands, also struck a devastating blow to the industry so many rely on.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d said Jordan Laplace, a fisherman whose family has lived on the island for generations. \u201cTourism is the only way to live. We don\u2019t have anything else.\u201dThe storm leveled hotels, eroded beaches and turned marinas into graveyards for scuttled yachts. Islands that were hit are still trying to assess the hurricane\u2019s economic impact, wondering how and even if they will be able to restore the islands to the former magnets they were before Irma.There\u2019s a lot at stake. Travel and tourism accounts for a higher share of the Caribbean region\u2019s gross domestic product than it does in any other region in the world, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council, supporting more than 2.3 million jobs.The areas of greatest concern, industry officials said, included Anguilla, the British and United States Virgin Islands, and St. Martin, all of which have robust tourism economies and suffered extensive damage.It will be a long road for some, even years. An estimated 95 percent of the structures on the island of Barbuda were seriously damaged or destroyed. Entire stretches of St. Martin and Anguilla are practically uninhabitable, not only because of the roofs peeled back like tin cans and porches smashed to splinters, but because of shortages of food and water.An estimated 90 percent of the St. Martin economy depends either directly or indirectly on tourism, said J\u00e9nov\u00e9fa Eche, who works in the St. Martin tourism office in Paris. The destruction, she said, is estimated at $1.43 billion.\u201cThis will take months, years, before we are at all close to our normal appearance,\u201d she said.But before the rebuilding of the tourism industry could begin, officials said, there were many immediate emergencies to attend to, like restoring telephone and electricity service, providing safe drinking water and medical treatment, and reopening the port and the airport.Barbuda, with about 100 hotel rooms, has been a small contributor to the region\u2019s overall tourism economy. But the businesspeople and workers who have depended on that trickle of tourists now face an uncertain future.\u201cAll the hotels have been damaged significantly,\u201d Trevor Walker, a former member of Parliament, said Monday. \u201cThis is going to take years. We have to rebuild an island, rebuild an economy.\u201dIn Cuba, the long-term implications could be even worse. The hardest-hit parts of the islands contain a significant share of its tourist infrastructure and bring in precious foreign currency for the communist nation. Without that, the country loses one of its primary sources of income to purchase items on the global market, including the construction materials it will need to repair the damaged infrastructure.The storm badly damaged dozens of hotels on Cayo Coco and Cayo Romero, small islands off the north coast of Cuba. The airport that served these islands was destroyed.On Monday, President Ra\u00fal Castro recognized the importance of resorts to the Cuban economy and promised they would be rebuilt before the start of the peak season, which runs from December to April. The target is ambitious, but with Venezuela, the island\u2019s main economic partner, racked by its own crises, Cuba can\u2019t afford to miss it. The Cuban government announced on Monday that 10 people had died as a result of the storm, bringing the death toll in the Caribbean to at least 37.The hurricane\u2019s impact was felt broadly across all economic sectors. While the Bahamas generally avoided the worst of the destruction, the Morton Salt company, on Inagua, suffered significant damage to its production plant, where it employs 145 workers and is the main economic driver.Theresa Lewis, 50, who has worked as a security guard at the plant for more than a decade, fled Inagua last week with her entire family and holed up in a shelter in Nassau. She fears she may be out of work for months.\u201cIf things are closed down for long, I will have to depend on what I can make from the little arts and crafts that I sell \u2014 bags, jewelry, slippers \u2014 until the plant reopens,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cI just finished building my house a couple of months ago, and I have no idea what I will meet when I get there or when I will work again.\u201dFrank J. Comito, chief executive officer of the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association, said the region would need \u201csustained participation\u201d by both the public and private sector to ensure a complete recovery. His group has partnered with Tourism Cares, a nonprofit, to raise relief and rebuilding assistance from the hotel chains, credit card companies and any other enterprises involved in the Caribbean tourism industry.The well-being of employees whose livelihoods are now threatened is of particular concern.\u201cHow do we get our tourism product back up and running?\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we make sure our employees get involved in the industry again and get employed?\u201dGiles Cadman, a businessman who divides his time between Canada and the British Virgin Islands, said people were doing what they could to bring aid to the affected communities in Tortola, the largest island in the British territory. While the islands are known as playgrounds for the wealthy, he said, there are many residents who survive there on modest incomes from cleaning boats, serving food and working in shops.\u201cWe have a lot of ordinary people and expats from small islands who earn under $8 an hour,\u201d Mr. Cadman said. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s the others who live here \u2014 the people who clean boats and houses, who work in the service sector \u2014 that we need to worry about.\u201dOn St. Barth\u00e9lemy, there is an ambitious plan, shared by nearly everyone on the island: restore the hotels, shops and restaurants fast enough to catch at least part of the winter high season. There is the will, the scale \u2014 the island covers only eight square miles \u2014 and undoubtedly the money; the island has been called the \u201cSt. Moritz of the Caribbean.\u201dBruno Magras, the president of the local government, said the largest impact was on private homes and public infrastructure, like the fire station and government offices. Hotel capacity also has been hit.\u201cObviously that will have an economic impact,\u201d he said. \u201cTourism is everything to us. It\u2019s the only economic activity we have. We import everything and export nothing.\u201dThe president has asked every hotel and villa on the island to give him a timeline for repairing their facilities. By Tuesday, he expects the island\u2019s steep and winding roads to be fully cleared of debris, and trash collection to begin once more.Azam Ahmed reported from Gustavia and Kirk Semple from Mexico City.

{"Headline": "Can a Giant Science Fair Transform Kazakhstan\u2019s Economy?", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byASTANA, Kazakhstan \u2014 By day, the huge and gleaming sphere looks like the spaceship of aliens who may not have come in peace. At night, it blinks out a playful pattern of colors and boosterish slogans on its high-tech outer skin \u2014 a few parts light show, a few parts bumper sticker.Known officially as the Nur Alem, the imposing silver globe is the symbol and centerpiece of Kazakhstan\u2019s latest attempt at an \u201cOpen For Business\u201d sign. Five years ago, the country won the rights to stage what is essentially the world\u2019s largest science fair. More than 100 nations built pavilions on a once-empty corner of this capital city. The Kazakh government chipped in a reported $3 billion, and, after an 11th-hour, all-hands push, met a June 10 deadline to open Expo 2017.The theme of the fair, which closes on Sunday, is \u201cFuture Energy.\u201d That may sound like a stab at humor given that oil, gas and metals are the lifeblood of the country. But guided by the hand of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the first and, so far, only president of this former Soviet Republic, Kazakhstan is trying for a dramatic economic makeover.The country does not want to merely sell off state-owned assets. The goal is to wean the nation from a dependence on natural resources and to transform it into a financial hub, the Dubai of Central Asia. There are plans for a new stock exchange overseen by an independent judicial system. Tech start-ups will get the come-hither, too, with the hope of giving rise to Kazakhstan\u2019s own version of Silicon Valley.Experts say that, despite talk of reform and transparency, Kazakhstan is still quietly controlled by shifting alliances among elites, all of them angling for prestige and riches in a soap opera scripted by the president. \u201cYou have to carefully assess who your Kazakh partners are and where they fit into the elite structure,\u201d said Livia Paggi, a director at GPW, a political risk firm. \u201cThey can be bright and well connected, but if they fall out of political favor and lose their status, your business is at serious risk. In the worst case scenario, your asset could be seized.\u201d\u201cBut I could do nothing,\u201d he said, during an Orwellian press conference at the time. \u201cIf I had intervened, I would have looked undemocratic, right?\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Nazarbayev has devoted much of his political life to expanding Kazakhstan\u2019s middle class, which has grown from just 9 percent of the population in the mid-2000s to 33 percent in 2014, according to the World Bank. To his people and to investors, he offers both opportunity and stability \u2014 at least for now. He has never articulated a plan of succession, a pressing matter given what the actuarial tables would say about a man who toiled for years as a steelworker in Ukraine, breathing dust and gas near a blast furnace.Then there is Kazakhstan\u2019s branding problem. Although it is wedged between China and Russia and has a land mass roughly four times the state of Texas, few outside the commodities business could pin it on a map. It is forever lumped with the other \u201cstans\u201d in the neighborhood, which are repressive by comparison. Kazakhstan\u2019s big international breakout moment came as the butt of jokes by comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who played Borat, a bigoted and clueless Kazakh, in a 2006 mockumentary.Much is riding on the event. Too much, perhaps, given that it is in a city as remote and singular as Astana and devoted to a subject as bland as \u201cfuture energy.\u201d How many Westerners packed up their families and said, \u201cLet\u2019s fly to Kazakhstan and learn about biomass fuel\u201d?Very few, judging from three days spent walking the grounds not long ago.Most people enter Expo through the Mega Silk Way, a 1.5 million-square-foot mall. It is filled with Kazakhstan\u2019s answers to Western staples: a restaurant that looks like Applebee\u2019s, a computer retailer that resembles an Apple store. Anyone yearning for local flavor can dine at Rumi, with traditional decorations on the walls and horse meat on the menu.The fairgrounds look pristine, and touring the premises is like strolling through an updated United Nations as reimagined by a big box retailer. Many countries used their pavilions for elaborate, multimedia infomercials. Vietnam promoted its economy, Georgia extolled its wine and Belarus went for a hard-core real estate spiel, pitching a huge industrial park it is building with the Chinese.In an effort to appear environmentally minded, Saudi Arabia showed a film on an IMAX-size screen with a montage that included men drinking bottled water and the words, \u201cWe sustain.\u201d Thailand highlighted the energy uses of animal waste, with the life-size rear end of an animatronic elephant, complete with a waggling tail, hovering over a convincing reproduction of a large dung patty.\u201cNo step,\u201d an unnecessary sign nearby said.For sheer production values, Russia\u2019s pavilion was hard to beat, although it was essentially a long claim to the rights to mine natural resources in the Arctic \u2014 something that seemed wildly tin-eared in this setting. The country even displayed a block of \u201cold arctic ice,\u201d which, after watching films of melting floes all over Expo, made you want to yell, \u201cPut it back!\u201dThe true ambitions behind Expo will only become apparent after it ends. The plan is to transform several of the buildings into Kazakhstan\u2019s Wall Street. The main attraction of the Astana International Financial Centre will be a stock exchange, created in partnership with Nasdaq, and a legal center for addressing financial disputes, to be governed by British common law.The financial center goes beyond what has been tried here before. But Kazakhstan already has a stock exchange, and it has talked about selling off a greater share of state-owned assets in the past. To foreign investors, this new plan sounds very familiar. What has changed, government officials say, is the context.\u201cWhen the price of oil was $100 a barrel, it was difficult to convince anyone to think another way,\u201d said Kairat Kelimbetov, governor of the financial center. \u201cThe price of oil is $50 a barrel, and we don\u2019t think it is ever coming back. Now is the time to wake up.\u201dFor years, Kazakhstan had a terrible case of the resource curse, Mr. Kelimbetov said, referring to the paradoxical plague of the easy money that can come to any country with fortunes that are simply buried in the ground. But the curse is over here, and so far, that has brought only new curses.A series of sudden drops in the value of the Kazakh currency, the tenge, helped drive the inflation rate to 14 percent last year and added to the pain. The worst of the drops occurred in 2015, after the country\u2019s central bank introduced a free floating exchange rate. The tenge fell 25 percent against the dollar in a single day.The case looked, to all the world, like a crackdown, and proof that Mr. Nazarbayev would no longer tolerate impropriety, even by insiders. But little about Kazakhstan\u2019s gilded clans is straightforward.Vera Kobalia, Expo\u2019s former deputy chairwoman, said in an interview that the public account of Mr. Ermegiyayev\u2019s fall was a charade. Reached by phone at her new job in Indonesia, she said that Mr. Ermegiyayev\u2019s troubles began when an executive from a music channel in Russia asked Expo to advertise and sponsor an awards show.Nyet, said Expo staff members. The marketing budget had already been entirely allocated.So the Russian executive called a member of the president\u2019s inner circle, who then called Expo employees, Ms. Kobalia said. Mr. Ermegiyayev had no choice. The twist is that the deal with the music channel was used against Mr. Ermegiyayev at his embezzlement trial.\u201cErmegiyayev was really a scapegoat to write off the funds that disappeared during the first phase of construction of Expo,\u201d said Ms. Kobalia, a former minister of the economy in Georgia, who quit her job at Expo after little more than a month. \u201cI personally told him to speak openly in the court or to journalists about everything he knew, but he believed until the last minute that the president would save him.\u201dThe bold, attention-seeking gesture that is Expo is actually dwarfed by the bold, attention-seeking city where Expo is being held. Astana is Mr. Nazarbayev\u2019s most improbable creation. In 1994, he announced that the nation\u2019s capital would move 755 miles north from its original seat, Almaty, a city dense with history, culture and people.The decision seemed ludicrous at first. Before bureaucrats started to relocate in droves, Astana was a crumbling outpost in the middle of the windswept steppe, swarming with mosquitoes in the summer and a tormenting 20 degrees below zero for much of the winter. There was one hotel and one restaurant.Construction has yet to end, and clearly, the subtle charm of a walkable metropolis is not to Mr. Nazarbayev\u2019s taste. He likes his streets wide and his buildings striking, ornate and spread around like they fell off a Monopoly board. Some look like they have been collected, souvenir-style, from all over the world. You drive down a street and think: That looks just like the home of the Bolshoi Ballet.\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it is,\u201d a guide explains.More specifically, it is a rendering of the original in Moscow, repurposed for the nearly 700,000-square-foot Astana Opera House. Moscow also inspired the neo-Stalinist Triumph Astana, home to offices, shops and apartments and a dead ringer for the Triumph Palace in Moscow.Elsewhere, there are structures fashioned after Chinese pagodas, Indian mausoleums, Ottoman mosques and the pyramids of Egypt. The white marble presidential palace looks like the White House, if the White House had a blue dome and were set in an industrial park.For sheer quirkiness, nothing touches the 350-foot Bayterek Tower, which local residents have nicknamed Chupa Chups because of its resemblance to a lollipop. It offers a panoramic view of Astana and a podium where visitors can place a hand over a golden mold of Mr. Nazarbayev\u2019s meaty palm. For a time, upon contact, Kazakhstan\u2019s national anthem would suddenly blast from loudspeakers, at a volume loud enough to make people wonder if they had been punked.Astana is what you get when a city builder with money to spare tries desperately to wow through novelty and scale. Or maybe it is an effort to compensate for Kazakhstan\u2019s years of obscurity, when the czars of Imperial Russia, and then the premiers of the Soviet Union, all but sealed this place off from the world.A few of the empire\u2019s most famous undesirables spent part of their exile here: Fyodor Dostoyevsky after he ticked offNicholas I, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn after he ticked off Stalin. When it wasn\u2019t used for state-mandated timeouts, Kazakhstan was the Soviet Union\u2019s location of choice for outsize Cold War projects. Most lethally, it was where nuclear weapons were tested by the dozens, with shockingly little regard for basic safeguards, like evacuating residents.When Kazakhstan achieved independence, in 1991, it aspired to create a presidential democracy based on the French model. But Mr. Nazarbayev, who rose to power through the Soviet ranks, has always seemed to have one foot in the system that created him and another in a system he hopes to create.On the positive side, the Nazarbayev era has been relatively free of ethnic or religious strife. About 70 percent of Kazakhs are Muslims, and there are gorgeous mosques all over Astana. But the country is officially secular. A high premium is placed here on tolerance.The influence of the Soviet system shines through in discussions about who will govern next, understandably a topic of constant speculation. Occasionally, names of potential successors are floated in the newspaper: A daughter! A nephew! A mayor! Whether these are legitimate candidates or people being backstabbed by rivals is unclear. It is no secret that Mr. Nazarbayev punishes anyone he believes is vying for his chair.He has also nurtured the sort of cult of personality that crops up only around despots. If that cult has a headquarters it is the Museum of the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, a building stuffed with more than 40,000 objects from Mr. Nazarbayev\u2019s life. One room is devoted to his nomadic, horseback riding ancestors. Less is said about his father, a shepherd.Plenty of Kazakhs roll their eyes at all of this. But the question here is always, \u201cCompared to what?\u201d Compared to Turkmenistan, this country is free and prosperous. Compared to France, it is not.To Westerners, the economy has long seemed like a casino where the games are mostly rigged. Ten to 20 alliances control every financial venture worth backing. The trick is getting their attention.\u201cThis is a country where everything is possible,\u201d veterans of business here like to say, \u201cand everything is impossible.\u201dWhile tourists traipsed through pavilions, a parallel Expo was unfolding above their heads. The second floor of many of the buildings were hosting panel discussions that doubled as schmoozing opportunities. An event titled \u201cTransforming the Financial Services of Kazakhstan\u201d was held one afternoon in a conference room above Britain\u2019s pavilion. An audience of about 20 men and women in suits listened to upbeat projections about how Kazakhstan could become the financial technology center of a new Silk Road.The only skeptical note came from an earnest young man named Bekarys Nurumbetov, who is leads the marketing department of Kazakhtelecom, the nation\u2019s phone and broadband goliath. After the session, he explained why he was not buying all the happy talk.\u201cThere are no financial tech companies entering Kazakhstan,\u201d he said, sipping bottled water over a plate of canap\u00e9s. \u201cThey\u2019re not interested in a business with low margins and high cost and competing with banks that are supported by the government.\u201dThe problem is not corruption. \u201cThe government is O.K. with the way things are now,\u201d Mr. Nurumbetov explained. \u201cAnd the banks don\u2019t want change because they don\u2019t want to lose market share.\u201dBanks don\u2019t trust consumers, he continued, and consumers don\u2019t trust credit cards. So e-commerce companies, for example, face high and baffling hurdles.Consider the case of Lamoda, a website that sells high-end fashion. When Alexios Shaw helped start it in 2011, he did not need just good-quality clothing and an efficient warehouse. He needed 100 couriers across the country to deliver products \u2014 and to make change.\u201cIt was a cash on delivery business,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cInstead of paying in advance with a credit card, everyone paid with cash. You can\u2019t use FedEx or the post office and leave a box at the door.\u201dDelivering pants the same way that Domino\u2019s delivers pizza is a challenge. Couriers end up with thousands of dollars worth of bills at day\u2019s end, a logistical hassle beyond the issue of trust. Just as bad, customers try on clothing while couriers wait and hand back what they don\u2019t want. That is not simply time consuming.\u201cThe biggest problem was having a ton of goods out of stock,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cA lot of inventory was just sort of flying around Siberia.\u201dSeveral conversations like this reveal the vast gap between the country as it is now marketed and the country as it actually functions. Which is why Expo brings to mind another of the Soviet Union\u2019s grandiose schemes for Kazakhstan: the Virgin Lands Campaign.It began in the mid-1950s, when Nikita Khrushchev decided the steppe here could produce enough corn and wheat to match the production of the United States. Millions of acres were sown by hundreds of thousands of workers who poured in from Russia and Ukraine.Kazakhs could have told their maximum leader that his dreams were doomed. This northern region of Kazakhstan has long been called Akmola, which translates to \u201cwhite grave,\u201d a reference to the hard and chalky ground beneath the earth\u2019s crust.The Virgin Lands Campaign found Kazakhstan\u2019s agrarian limits. Expo and its aftermath promise to do the same for capitalism. It will be a challenge, say foreigners here, as tough as the soil.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facing Months in the Dark, Ordinary Life in Puerto Rico Is \u2018Beyond Reach\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 Two days after Hurricane Maria flattened this island of 3.5 million people, knocking out all its power and much of its water, the rebuilding of the services and structures needed for people to resume some semblance of ordinary life was looking more complicated by the day.All or part of three towns in the northwestern part of the island \u2014 Isabela, San Sebasti\u00e1n and Quebradillas \u2014 were being evacuated Friday because of fears about structural damage to the nearby Guajataca Dam. Close to 70,000 people could be affected if the 90-year-old dam, which is 120-feet high and can hold about 11 billion gallons of water, collapsed, said Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3.And with everyone from the governor of Puerto Rico to the mayor of San Juan predicting that it could take four to six months to resume electrical service, people were contemplating empty refrigerators, campfire cooking, bathing in their own sweat and perhaps wrangling for fresh water on an island accustomed to hard times but nothing like what the future may bring.\u201cIt\u2019s been hard to see infrastructure deteriorate in Puerto Rico, but it has been harder to meet citizens who have lost it all,\u201d Governor Rossell\u00f3 said.The most immediate danger was from the dam, which suffered structural damage. And finding gasoline was already a big problem. Lines for ice and gas stretched for blocks. Generators needed diesel or regular gas to work, and supplies at gas stations were quickly dwindling.\u201cPeople will start going nuts pretty soon,\u201d said Miguel A. Soto-Class, president of the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan research organization. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be 'Mad Max,\u2019 but people will be looking for diesel and gasoline, more than water even.\u201dThe water supply was also becoming a problem. Even in San Juan, people need electricity to access water, and water is also critical to running some air-conditioning systems. At Centro Medico, a major hospital outside San Juan in R\u00edo Piedras, the emergency unit was treating patients but had no air-conditioning, said Dr. Johnny Rull\u00e1n, a physician.But the biggest long-term obstacle was the prospect of months without power.Puerto Ricans are the first to say they can improvise \u2014 resolver \u2014 when a drought dries them up or a terrible storm knocks them down. But the idea of grappling long term without power hung like a pall over the island.\u201cThis is really affecting me,\u201d said Nina Rodriguez, a human resources manager in San Juan. \u201cI have four children and the youngest is 6 months old. We are preparing for six months, maybe even a year without power.\u201dShe added: \u201cAll the infrastructure has collapsed. Everything we had before the hurricane is beyond reach.\u201d\u201cOur plants look like the cars in Cuba,\u201d said Eduardo Bhatia, a Puerto Rican senator. They could produce power before the hurricane, but not efficiently and not cheaply.Even though Hurricane Irma spared Puerto Rico, brushing it lightly as it whirled west two weeks ago, almost 70 percent of the island lost power. Some residents were still waiting for electricity when Hurricane Maria hit the island.Eugenio Toro and his wife Cristina Bernal lost power Sept. 6. As a result, they felt ill prepared for Hurricane Maria. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t freeze things,\u201d Mr. Toro said. \u201cWe never got the light back. We did go buy a generator but there is little gas and we can only use it a few hours a day.\u201dSo much of the damage still needs to be assessed that it is possible the power situation may turn out to be less dire than feared. On Friday, Prepa\u2019s chief executive, Ricardo Ramos, said on CNBC that he was hopeful that the power plants \u2014 as opposed to the power lines, pylons, substations and transformers \u2014 may be intact.\u201cWe\u2019ve lost probably 80 percent of the transmission and distribution infrastructure,\u201d he said, adding that crews had completed only about a third of an island-wide survey of the damage and would have more information in two days.He also said that important buildings on the island, including Centro Medico and a convention center now being used by emergency workers, would have their power back in two or three days.Mr. Ramos said he shortened estimates for how long power would be out after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York arrived Friday with teams to help restore electricity. \u201cWe expect three to four months at most,\u201d for the whole island, he said.Getting power back to Puerto Rico will be daunting and expensive. Transformers, poles and power lines snake from coastal areas across hard-to-access mountains. In some cases, the poles have to be maneuvered in place with helicopters.And yet it gets worse. Puerto Rico is an island, which means the tons of much-needed supplies \u2014 trucks, poles, cables, tools, spare parts, helicopters \u2014 must be shipped into Caribbean ports, making the process infinitely more cumbersome. Trained electrical workers by the hundreds will also have to be flown into Puerto Rico, where they will have to find places to stay, not an uncomplicated task.So every relief delivery can be a major event.Mr. Cuomo and a delegation from New York arrived Friday morning with supplies that included more than 34,000 bottles of water, 500 flashlights, 1,400 cots and blankets and, perhaps most important, 10 generators.Mr. Soto-Class said Prepa has been plagued by bungling and more recently a debt it cannot pay, a shortage of cash, and layoffs. Some of its infrastructure dates back to the 1970s, or earlier.\u201cWhen the electric power authority had the money, they mismanaged it and didn\u2019t invest,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there is less money to run the authority with. This compounds it all, one on top of the other.\u201dThe lack of electricity also affects the water supply in certain areas. Some towns need electricity to get their water pumped in.For now, generators are the saving grace for the lucky few who have them to crank up their refrigerator and a few fans. Some restaurants, hotels and many hospitals have operating generators. But the vast majority of Puerto Ricans on the impoverished island cannot afford them.For older residents, the lack of power could be dangerous.Ermerita Rosa Perez, 83, sat on her porch in San Juan praying the rosary and worrying not just about comfort but about survival.\u201cFour to six months without electricity?! Oh no, no, no, no, we will die,\u201d Ms. Rosa said. \u201cUs old people can\u2019t make it that long. Just today, I was looking at this flooded mess and I was thinking of mopping. I said, \u2018No, I can\u2019t. I need to rest.\u2019 I will take a cold water bath \u2014 which I\u2019m not supposed to do, because I have arthritis \u2014 and rest.\u201dShe worried about her health. \u201cI am diabetic. I have high blood pressure. It\u2019s so hot I can\u2019t take it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m an old lady, hauling pots to my carport to cook on a gas stove? It\u2019s too much. So I sit here on my porch, trying to catch a breeze, praying to God to bring things back to normal.\u201dHer son, Hilberto Caban, was less panicked. He said the authorities were probably exaggerating how long the lights would be out.\u201cThat way if it takes three weeks or a month, we\u2019ll all say, \u2018Great! Look how hard they worked!\u201d he said.Frances Robles reported from San Juan, Lizette Alvarez from Miami and Mary Williams Walsh from New York.

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Rejects Study Showing Positive Impact of Refugees", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Trump administration officials, under pressure from the White House to provide a rationale for reducing the number of refugees allowed into the United States next year, rejected a study by the Department of Health and Human Services that found that refugees brought in $63 billion more in government revenues over the past decade than they cost.Advocates of the program inside and outside the administration say refugees are a major benefit to the United States, paying more in taxes than they consume in public benefits, and filling jobs in service industries that others will not. But research documenting their fiscal upside \u2014 prepared for a report mandated by Mr. Trump in a March presidential memorandum implementing his travel ban \u2014 never made its way to the White House. Some of those proponents believe the report was suppressed.The internal study, which was completed in late July but never publicly released, found that refugees \u201ccontributed an estimated $269.1 billion in revenues to all levels of government\u201d between 2005 and 2014 through the payment of federal, state and local taxes. \u201cOverall, this report estimated that the net fiscal impact of refugees was positive over the 10-year period, at $63 billion.\u201dBut White House officials said those conclusions were illegitimate and politically motivated, and were disproved by the final report issued by the agency, which asserts that the per-capita cost of a refugee is higher than that of an American.\u201cThis leak was delivered by someone with an ideological agenda, not someone looking at hard data,\u201d said Raj Shah, a White House spokesman. \u201cThe actual report pursuant to the presidential memorandum shows that refugees with few skills coming from war-torn countries take more government benefits from the Department of Health and Human Services than the average population, and are not a net benefit to the U.S. economy.\u201dA draft of a study rejected by Trump administration officials that found that refugees brought in $63 billion more in government revenues over the past decade than they cost.John Graham, the acting assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the health department, said: \u201cWe do not comment on allegedly leaked documents\u201d and that no report had been finalized. He noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s memorandum \u201cseeks an analysis related to the cost of refugee programs. Therefore, the only analysis in the scope of H.H.S.\u2019s response to the memo would be on refugee-related expenditures from data within H.H.S. programs.\u201dThe three-page report the agency ultimately submitted, dated Sept. 5, does just that, using government data to compare the costs of refugees to Americans and making no mention of revenues contributed by refugees.\u201cIn an average year over the 10-year period, per-capita refugee costs for major H.H.S. programs totaled $3,300,\u201d it says. \u201cPer-person costs for the U.S. population were lower, at $2,500, reflecting a greater participation of refugees in H.H.S. programs, especially during their first four years\u201d in the United States.It was not clear who in the administration decided to keep the information out of the final report. An internal email, dated Sept. 5 and sent among officials from government agencies involved in refugee issues, said that \u201csenior leadership is questioning the assumptions used to produce the report.\u201d A separate email said that Mr. Miller had requested a meeting to discuss the report. The Times was shown the emails on condition that the sender not be identified. Mr. Miller personally intervened in the discussions on the refugee cap to ensure that only the costs \u2014 not any fiscal benefit \u2014 of the program were considered, according to two people familiar with the talks.He has also played a crucial role in the internal discussions over refugee admissions, which are capped by an annual presidential determination that is usually coordinated by the National Security Council and led in large part by the State Department.This year, officials at the State Department as well as the Department of Defense have argued vociferously that the United States should admit no fewer than the 50,000-refugee cap that Mr. Trump imposed in January as part of the travel ban, but Mr. Miller has advocated for a much lower number \u2014 half or less, according to people familiar with the internal talks who described them on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to detail them. The Department of Homeland Security last week proposed a cap of 40,000. The limits being debated would be the lowest in more than three decades.\u201cWe see an administration that\u2019s running a program that it\u2019s intent on destroying,\u201d said Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, one of nine refugee resettlement agencies opposing the cut in admissions. \u201cWe do have champions in the White House and in the administration, but they\u2019re not being given a voice in this.\u201dThe issue is coming to a head as Mr. Trump attends the United Nations General Assembly this week for the first time as president. The United Nations has repeatedly appealed to nations to resettle 1.2 million refugees fleeing war and persecution from all over the world, and former President Barack Obama used the gathering last year to tout his goal of admitting 110,000 refugees in the fiscal year that ends this month, and to pressure other countries to follow the lead of the United States in embracing more displaced people.Mr. Trump, by contrast, has highlighted his goal of radically cutting refugee admissions. The president moved swiftly after taking office to crack down on refugees, issuing his original ban against travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries only a week after taking office.It would be less costly, it argued, if there were fewer refugees, since \u201ceach refugee admitted into the United States comes at the expense of helping a potentially greater number out of country.\u201d Inside the administration, those who espouse this view argue that any research purporting to illustrate fiscal benefits of refugees is flawed and reflects only wishful thinking.As Mr. Trump deliberates privately about the issue, a coalition of human rights and religious groups as well as former national security officials in both parties has formed to encourage him not to allow the refugee cap to plummet.\u201cFrom a national security standpoint, while we can\u2019t take an unlimited number of refugees, we need to show our friends and allies that we stand with them and this is a shared burden,\u201d said Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security under George W. Bush.\u201cThey\u2019ve generated a lot of economic value,\u201d Mr. Chertoff added in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think refugees are coming to take American jobs.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Somini Sengupta from New York.Advertisement"}

I think we need to take a tough line with North Korea. I believe the nuclear deal with Iran was a bad one and should be renegotiated. And I\u2019m glad to hear an American president speak publicly about the horror unfolding in Venezuela.Problem is, that president is Trump. And I have a hard time believing that behind the rhetoric there is a strategy, much less the ability to execute it.Besides, as the old line goes, it\u2019s worse than a crime; it\u2019s a mistake. Trump just lifted Colin Kaepernick\u2019s star, gave N.F.L. players and owners no choice but to rally round him, and then expanded his losing fight to the N.B.A. as well. Not smart!I\u2019m guessing we agree on this. Let\u2019s talk about health care instead. Susan Collins says she going to vote \u201cNo\u201d on Graham-Cassidy.The Graham-Cassidy bill is a disaster, unless your only goal is to take money away from states that worked hard to implement health care reform and give it to the states that didn\u2019t bother.We haven\u2019t discussed this but can I tell you that I\u2019ve always disliked Lindsey Graham? He\u2019s one of those Senators Who Can Talk to Reporters, but that doesn\u2019t make him any less terrible.Key line: \u201cAny national health care system that assumes one party will control Washington for all eternity is doomed to fail. New Yorkers would have much less to fear about a Trump presidency if the president didn\u2019t control agencies that set policies for the entire country.\u201dI bet that by the time this presidency is over, your favorite amendment is going to be the 10th.I\u2019m very cynical about states\u2019 rights arguments. Everybody \u2014 my side included \u2014 uses it whenever the federal government does something they don\u2019t like and drops it whenever the federal government does something they love. And the founding fathers who got so wrapped up in local control were usually worried about protecting slavery.Graham\u2019s bill is just an attempt to get under the no-filibuster wire with Obamacare repeal. Totally cynical.I also think that there\u2019s a bit of sneakiness on the Democratic side, too. Isn\u2019t it true that many progressives and liberals see the A.C.A. as just a way station on the road to single payer?That would seem to be the most conservative position in the world. You have to take responsibility for yourself; otherwise if something bad happens you\u2019ll probably end up in a hospital receiving extremely expensive taxpayer-funded treatment.Yet the requirement drives Republicans nuts.

{"Headline": "Senate Unveils Budget Blueprint Allowing $1.5 Trillion in Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Budget Committee unveiled a 2018 budget blueprint on Friday that would open the door for a $1.5 trillion tax cut, even as an independent analysis concluded that the plan as offered would far exceed that price tag and overwhelmingly benefit corporations and the rich.The budget resolution could also pave the way to opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling, a hot-button Republican proposal that has languished for decades.Passing a budget resolution would be a critical step for President Trump and Republican lawmakers in moving forward with their plan to overhaul the tax code. The parliamentary language in the resolution would allow Republicans to pass tax cuts that cost as much as $1.5 trillion over the next decade with only 50 votes in the Senate, not the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. Republican leaders concede that without a budget, there will be no tax cut.But the analysis released on Friday by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center could change the politics of tax cutting and make even 50 votes a struggle in a Senate with 52 Republicans. The report estimated that the tax cuts that Republicans are considering would cost the government $2.4 trillion over 10 years \u2014 which would worsen budget deficits by considerably more than $1.5 trillion \u2014 while showering benefits on the wealthy.In the first detailed assessment of the plan\u2019s financial impact, the analysis found that the average tax bill for all income groups would decline by nearly $1,600 in 2018, boosting after-tax incomes by 2.1 percent. Those in the top 1 percent \u2014 with incomes above about $730,000 \u2014 would receive about half the total tax benefit. They would see an average tax cut of $129,000, increasing after-tax incomes by 8.5 percent.Those with incomes between about $49,000 and $86,000 would see an average tax cut of $660, raising their after-tax income by 1.2 percent.The analysis said the Republican plan also would provide enormous benefits to corporate America, with a $2.6 trillion cut in business taxes over the next decade. Individual income tax revenue would actually increase by $470 billion over that period, largely as a result of changes in personal deductions and exemptions as well as an increase in the bottom tax rate to 12 percent from 10 percent.\u201cTax collections would shift dramatically from businesses to individuals,\u201d said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center.The loss of deductions would hit the upper middle class the most, and more than a third of the taxpayers who earn $150,000 to $300,000 would see their taxes go up next year, the report found. They would be hit particularly hard by the repeal of the state and local tax deduction.The major findings in a preliminary analysis of the House Republican tax plan.And all of that would have to be squeezed into a $1.5 trillion budget hole, forcing lawmakers either to scale back cuts, phase them in, find more loopholes to close or identify other taxes to raise.The budget resolution released on Friday does foresee a balanced budget within 10 years \u2014 but only by assuming trillions of dollars in unspecified spending cuts and projecting higher economic growth than is forecast by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Republicans are counting on a surge of economic growth to pay for their tax plan, and the Tax Policy Center analysis does not account for those \u201cdynamic\u201d effects. The group\u2019s analysts said that they planned to release another report soon that does account for growth, but that they expected those results to be similar.In a preview of the partisan battles over the tax legislation to come, Democrats seized the analysis as evidence that talk of populism from Republicans is not to be trusted.\u201cThis report on Trump\u2019s tax scam is more hard evidence that the president and his out-of-touch millionaire advisers are executing a middle-class con job,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cWhile this administration continues to peddle false claim after false claim, nothing can hide the truth that the only individuals benefiting from this plan are the president, his family and his highflier friends.\u201d\u201cThis analysis is based on guesswork and biased assumptions designed to promote the authors\u2019 point of view \u2014 rather actual detail from a bill that has not yet been written by the committees,\u201d said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.The budget resolution, essentially a blueprint for federal revenues and spending for the 2018 fiscal year that begins on Sunday and beyond, lays the groundwork for approving a tax bill using special procedures that would shield it from a Democratic filibuster. Republicans used the same strategy in their failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Budget Committee, called the budget resolution \u201cthe first important step in providing Congress with the tools it needs to enact tax reform that will grow America\u2019s economy and strengthen hardworking families and small businesses.\u201dDemocrats cast the plan as fiscally irresponsible and harmful to the middle class.\u201cThe Senate Republican budget is the clearest sign yet that Republicans are intent on pursuing a tax plan that would blow a huge hole in the deficit and stack up debt, leading to cuts in programs that middle-class Americans rely on,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cThis budget would green-light a tax scheme that could very well put Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid on the chopping block.\u201dSenator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and the Budget Committee\u2019s ranking member, denounced the blueprint as \u201cone of the most destructive budgets in modern American history.\u201d\u201cThis budget is the Robin Hood principle in reverse,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cAt a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the Republican budget takes from the middle class and those in need, and gives huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country.\u201dThe budget resolution instructs the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee to develop the tax legislation by Nov. 13.The resolution also instructs two other panels, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee, to draft legislation by that date that would reduce the deficit by at least $1 billion over the next 10 years.That language would free up the chairwoman of the Senate panel, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, to pursue her long-sought goal of opening of the Arctic wildlife refuge to oil exploration.Republicans and Democrats have battled for decades over the refuge. But with a supportive president and unified Republican control of Congress, the budget instructions could finally break the stalemate, with the drilling language tacked on to the tax bill.\u201cThis provides an excellent opportunity for our committee to raise $1 billion in federal revenues while creating jobs and strengthening our nation\u2019s long-term energy security,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said in a statement that did not mention drilling.Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a longtime opponent of opening the refuge, was less circumspect.\u201cThere is bipartisan opposition to drilling in our nation\u2019s most pristine wildlife refuge,\u201d he said, \u201cand any effort to include it in the tax package would only further imperil the legislation as a whole.\u201dIn order to pass legislation using the procedures that would protect it from a filibuster, both the House and the Senate will need to agree on a budget resolution for the 2018 fiscal year.The House Budget Committee approved its own budget resolution in July, and although it had been stalled, the full House is expected to vote on it next week. The House budget calls for a tax overhaul that would not add to the deficit, and it instructs congressional committees to come up with at least about $200 billion in savings.The Senate Budget Committee plans to consider its budget resolution next week as well.Lisa Friedman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

A wheelchair is not great on a mountain.Do you have any advice for travelers in wheelchairs?Where would you like to travel yet?I would love to cross the Atlantic Ocean on a sailboat.

I think Alaska would be amazing for heli-skiing.What\u2019s most rewarding about travel?For me, life is about seeing new things and getting perspective. I was in Afghanistan this summer. We met disabled children to see how their lives are.A lot of these disabled kids had been tied up or shamed in their houses, not because their parents were evil but mostly because their parents didn\u2019t know what to do. At the same time, they thought it was a punishment from God. It was one of the most difficult travel experiences, but also one that I cherish the most. I\u2019m superprivileged. I\u2019m in a wheelchair, but so what? With travel, you can see what things can be like. At the same time, you can visit the most beautiful places on earth. I appreciate both.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Germany, the Center Holds", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSunday was a dark day for Germany. For the first time in its postwar history, a far-right party won enough votes to enter the Bundestag. And not by a hair, either \u2014 the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, won 12.6 percent, ahead of stalwart parties like the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats, making it the third-largest caucus among the seven represented in the Parliament. It\u2019s shocking. It\u2019s a catastrophe.And yet Sunday was also a great day for Germany. It was a demonstration of the stability and health of the country\u2019s postwar democracy. It was proof that its system is resilient in a crisis. It was a demonstration of Germany\u2019s serenity and maturity.I will try to explain why both can be true at the same time.It\u2019s a sad day because some 5.8 million Germans cast their vote for the AfD. Founded in 2013 by a m\u00e9lange of ultra-conservatives, right-wing economists and assorted fringe groups who were concerned about Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s adamant commitment to the euro, the party adopted an anti-immigrant stance, galvanized by the 2015-16 refugee crisis.In both its platform and the public statements by AfD representatives, the party increasingly used racist language. The AfD regards the German people as a coherent biological body under threat to be \u201cdestroyed\u201d by immigration. It strives to protect Germany\u2019s \u201cendemic\u201d culture against immigrant cultures, which it regards as inferior.Alexander Gauland, one of the party\u2019s two front-runners, recently demanded that Aydan Ozogus, a policy maker of Turkish descent, be \u201cdisposed of\u201d in Turkey. He also said that Germany could be proud of \u201cthe achievements of German soldiers in two world wars.\u201d In a statement after the election results, Mr. Gauland said \u201cWe will take back our country and our people.\u201d The AfD will receive about 94 out of approximately 709 seats in the new parliament, meaning many even more obscure figures than Mr. Gauland will sweep into the Bundestag, people sympathizing with extremist groups and conspiracy theorists.No matter what the AfD tried to argue during the closing weeks of the race, the past year and a half tells a story of national unity rather than of national agony.Given the relatively staid nature of German politics, it may be hard for outsiders to grasp just how contentious the past two years have been. In January 2016, just after the Cologne attacks, the atmosphere in Germany was close to ignition. Trust in the government sharply dropped, and so did Mrs. Merkel\u2019s poll numbers. Some polls put the AfD as high as 15 percent.But then the governing coalition of center-left Social Democrats and center-right Christian Democrats changed its policy. The Bundestag passed a series of laws restricting immigration, and it gave enhanced powers to police and intelligence services. Mrs. Merkel, a Christian Democrat, pushed an agreement with Turkey to hold back refugees in exchange for financial support.Not all these policies are smart. Some will hinder the integration of refugees and other immigrants who are in Germany to stay. But many are reasonable and necessary, and none undermine the coalition government\u2019s basic commitment to help refugees. And they shored up public support for Mrs. Merkel, for the government and for the country\u2019s refugee policy.If you look at democracy as a marketplace of ideas and positions, Germany\u2019s political economy has actually worked extremely well over the past year. The AfD surged because of a market gap for stricter immigration laws \u2014 and when the established parties adopted policies to fill this gap, the extremists were robbed of their fuel. Today, according to one poll, only 50 percent of Germans consider refugees an \u201cimportant problem.\u201d In this week\u2019s election, people cared deeply about education, about elderly care, about North Korea. Refugee policy was one important topic, but not the dominant one.Sixty percent said they voted for the AfD because they were dissatisfied with the established parties. But even that response is a good sign; it shows that we do not necessarily have five million racists living among us. This was a belated act of protest, not a shift in the country\u2019s ideological landscape.Many Germans have nagged their way through this campaign \u2014 too dull, they said, too boring, not confrontational enough. I found that annoying: What sort of election did they want? The kind that features a candidate who calls his opponent \u201ccrooked\u201d?On Sunday, Germans had the option of two capable and experienced major candidates, and many more in a variety of smaller parties, representing pretty much every political viewpoint. For the most part, these are people who really care about the country, and have a deep knowledge of the most important issues. Two thirds of all eligible voters actually went to vote. Most of them voted for liberal democracy. The headlines on Monday were ominous. But we should not forget what a lucky bunch we are.Anna Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Loneliness and the College Experience", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Yes, loneliness is a campus scourge. Two Septembers ago, I arrived early outside the class where I was to teach first-year writing at U.C.L.A., only to find my students each standing alone and staring at their phones.I recalled for them my college experience of making friends outside my classes, and I asked how they make friends. One student said, \u201cWe don\u2019t.\u201d Later, I learned that another student was eating her meals in her room because she hated being alone in the crowded dining hall.A third student wrote about how social media undermines the very goals it proposes to achieve, linking her library research to her experience of loneliness.Since then, I\u2019ve designed some group assignments. I\u2019ve added an informal meeting space; running into one another there may let them form friendships through proximity.To the Editor:In our world of instant gratification and a head-spinning news cycle, we forget that friendships take time to develop. The first friends you make in college are often friends of convenience \u2014 I\u2019ll be your friend if you\u2019ll be mine so I don\u2019t have to stand here looking like a deer in the headlights. The next set of friends you make are those that develop out of shared interests: classes, clubs, etc. Finally, there are the friends you make and keep who stand the test of time \u2014 you go through the good and the bad with them and still they remain your friends.I have come to this realization having grown up as an immigrant in this country, changing schools with each new phase of life, and, as an adult, moving to new cities with each new job. I developed an inner resilience from each experience that gave me strength to face life\u2019s challenges. So, hang in there, kids!To the Editor:The \u201ccampus scourge\u201d \u2014 loneliness \u2014 described by Frank Bruni would be more aptly described as campus pathos. What else do college freshmen, most of them ostensibly adults, expect?To overcome the discomfort of loneliness, college students might think of their 18-year-old contemporaries on sundry military bases or in battlefields abroad, scolded by their sergeants, who always pretend that these young ones cannot do anything right.After such contemplation the students may take comfort from the fact that they are among the most pampered and highly privileged human beings on the planet. Using loneliness as an excuse for binge drinking is just pathetic.Alas, the most likely response among college boards of trustees and administrators will be to load just one more layer of comfort-providing deans onto the payroll to provide succor to the young people when they are lonely.Before applying to college, every candidate should be required to spend one to two years in a tough job in the real world. They would enter that job as adolescents and emerge from it as adults capable of better appreciating what a privilege a college education is.The writer is a professor of political economy at Princeton.To the Editor:I just sent Frank Bruni\u2019s great column to my nieces and nephews who are just starting college. So many of us judge our internal feelings by the standards of others\u2019 well-curated social media lives. If you looked at my Facebook feed, you would think that I spent every day at the beach this summer. I did not. No one posts about the boring, sad parts of our lives.Going away to college is a very lonely experience. I was very unhappy freshman year, and my parents wanted me to transfer to a college close to home so I could live with them. I am glad I stuck it out. I made lifelong friends in college. I met my husband sophomore year. Equally important, I learned resilience.ELIZABETH WATERS, SAN DIEGOTo the Editor:This \u201ccampus scourge\u201d might reflect the growing number of young people who haven\u2019t had any chance to be lonely, or even rely on their own resources, as they arrive at university from lives filled with activities and little \u201cdown time\u201d without television, social media or other distractions.To the Editor:Thank you, Frank Bruni, for writing that student loneliness on campus is \u201cnormal, survivable and shared by many.\u201dIn my life, I have been especially lonely numerous times, including when I went to college, got my first job, attended graduate school at night, made a career change, moved across the country for my fianc\u00e9e, divorced years later and then moved to try build a new life (twice) to new locations.Each experience presented its own reward, none of which I would have discovered if I had avoided their inherent loneliness.As a society, we\u2019ve coddled ourselves into believing that negative experiences are somehow inferior and should be avoided, when the opposite is true. Learning how to experience negative emotions constructively \u2014 including loneliness \u2014 is essential to anyone planning on having any experiences at all.To the Editor:As Frank Bruni points out, friendship with physically present peers is essential for undergraduate emotional survival and academic success.Chris Takacs and I discovered in research for our book \u201cHow College Works\u201d that face-to-face relationships with other students and caring adults are powerful drivers of engaged learning. Without them, students are all too likely to simply give up and quit.That explains why the best freshman residence halls are the ones often dreaded and reviled by prospective students. They are the ones with shared bathrooms, long, open hallways, centrally located common areas and multistudent rooms, requiring students to meet other students, like it or not.It\u2019s for their own good. The fad at some colleges for \u201capartment-style dorms,\u201d by contrast, lead newcomers to be isolated just when they most need connections. Too often, young people realize too late what may be in their best interest.The writer is a professor of sociology at Hamilton College.To the Editor:My nephew recently began his first year at Purdue University. It has an elaborate orientation program that includes teams of 12 to 15 students. The teams stay together throughout the orientation, including eating meals together. Not all the teams bond, but my nephew\u2019s did. He has instant community. They already had a party together, go rock climbing and swimming together, eat together and watched a movie together. We, his family, are grateful for his connection with new friends.MARY CAPRON, TITUSVILLE, N.J.To the Editor:Having been dropped off at a college 1,800 miles from home, I remember the terror that seized me as I looked around my dorm room. But it was 1965 and you couldn\u2019t even phone home without costing your parents an arm and a leg, let alone FaceTime your best friend from high school.But immersion really worked, and I remember the rush of happiness and confidence I felt as I realized I could overcome my fear and loneliness and make new connections, new loves, new friends. I never thought about how today\u2019s technologies facilitate an unanticipated and involuntary clinging.WROE A. CLARK, DENVERAdvertisement"}

It also repaid the $182 billion in bailout money it received from the government.In an effort to prevent a repeat of the crisis, the Dodd-Frank law of 2010 empowered regulators to designate certain nonbank financial institutions as \u201csystemically important\u201d and subject them to more intensive supervision. A.I.G. and other companies that received the label have fought to shed it, arguing that they aren\u2019t big or interconnected enough to imperil the broader financial system if they run into problems.A.I.G. was one of four nonbank institutions classified as systemically important. Under Dodd-Frank, banks with more than $50 billion in assets are automatically subject to similar levels of heightened regulation.The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of regulators led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, voted 6 to 3 to release A.I.G. from the designation. A two-thirds majority of the council\u2019s voting members is required to remove the label.Among those supporting the change were Mr. Mnuchin and Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve. Three regulators who were appointed by President Barack Obama voted against relieving A.I.G. of the systemically important designation.Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement that the removal of A.I.G.\u2019s \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label \u201cdemonstrates our commitment to act decisively to remove any designation if a company does not pose a threat to financial stability.\u201dAfter Friday\u2019s vote, Prudential Financial, an insurance company, is the only nonbank to carry the \u201csystemically important\u201d label.Brian Duperreault, A.I.G.\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a statement: \u201cThe council\u2019s decision reflects the substantial and successful de-risking that A.I.G.\u2019s employees have achieved since 2008.\u201dIn a statement, Prudential called on Friday for the government to \u201crescind our designation\u201d as systemically important, saying the current situation creates \u201can unbalanced playing field.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019ve got other things to do.\u201dCarl Thayer, an emeritus professor of politics at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, Australia, said the Cambodian government seemed to be using laws as weapons to bring down the opposition before the elections.\u201cThe current crackdown is far more extensive than \u2018normal\u2019 repression under the Hun Sen regime,\u201d he said.Although Cambodia is nominally a democracy that holds regular elections, it has been led for 32 years by Hun Sen, a self-proclaimed \u201cstrongman\u201d who has methodically consolidated his power.Mr. Thayer noted that the Cambodian economy had grown rapidly over the past decade, and that aid from Western nations could soon dry up \u2014 along with conditions the donors attach, which generally include adherence to democratic norms.The Cambodia National Rescue Party is relatively new, having been formed in 2012, but it stunned the government by nearly winning parliamentary elections a year later, with support from a generation of youths seeking greater political and social freedom.On Sunday, hours after Mr. Kem Sokha\u2019s arrest, the prime minister said in a speech that it had become clear that the United States was the \u201cthird hand\u201d interfering in Cambodian politics.In it, he describes taking advice from American experts on his political career, including a suggestion that he take a break from politics to set up the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, which still receives funding from the United States government although he left the group in 2007.His daughter, Ms. Kem Monovithya, called the charge of treason \u201cridiculous.\u201d\u201cWhy else would you be in opposition politics if you don\u2019t want to change policies through changing the government?\u201d she asked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daniel Yankelovich, Master of Public Opinion Research, Dies at 92", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDaniel Yankelovich, the pollster, author and public opinion analyst who for a half-century mirrored the perceptions of generations of Americans about politics, consumer products, social changes and, not least, themselves, died on Friday morning at his home in the La Jolla section of San Diego. He was 92.His daughter, Nicole Yankelovich Mordecai, said the cause was kidney failure.Until the late 1950s, market research, when done at all, was a relatively crude way of trying to figure out whether a new soap or a set of kickable tires would go over with the American public. Often it was just guesswork. No corporation today would risk introducing a product without knowing, in advance, how well it is likely to sell, what it should look like, what to call it, and how to package, advertise and distribute it.Mr. Yankelovich (pronounced yank-el-OH-vich), an ebullient man with a passion for research, was part of a coterie of pollsters who changed all that. He came along at the right time with the idea that all kinds of academic discipline \u2014 psychology, sociology, statistical analysis and other offerings from the course catalogs \u2014 could be harnessed to the service of business, government and the masses.One of the nation\u2019s most respected social researchers, Mr. Yankelovich devised innovative surveys of small representative groups not only to track American preferences in cars and toothpaste, but also to understand the values and goals of ordinary people \u2014 what made them feel moral, happy or fulfilled, or miserable and marginalized in an affluent but impersonal society.Unlike the pioneering pollsters George Gallup, Elmo Roper and Louis Harris, Mr. Yankelovich did not stress election results, though he accurately called some presidential races, and his work helped national leaders, including Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, shape political agendas and domestic and foreign policies.He focused more on detailing, and explaining, shifting trends in American life: the \u201cgeneration gap\u201d of the 1960s, the rise of the women\u2019s movement in the 1970s, the neoconservatism of many young people in the 1980s, the emergence of a \u201cme first\u201d self-indulgence in the 1990s, and in recent years a widespread feeling that Americans have no voice in the decisions that affect their lives.\u201cPeople feel they don\u2019t have that voice, that they are not consulted, they\u2019re not listened to, their views don\u2019t really count,\u201d Mr. Yankelovich told Bill Moyers in a 2002 PBS interview. But he offered a suggestion:\u201cWe find when we bring average Americans together that they listen to one another, that they can contribute and that they can build, develop a vision of what they want our society to be like. And it\u2019s really inspiring.\u201dThe author of a dozen books and many articles for newspapers, magazines and academic journals, Mr. Yankelovich lectured at Harvard, the New School in New York, the University of California at San Diego and other universities, and was on the boards of corporations and cultural organizations.In the 1970s, he began The New York Times/Yankelovich poll and developed many survey techniques that The Times and CBS News later jointly used in their coverage of politics and public opinion polling.In 1975, Mr. Yankelovich and Cyrus R. Vance, who was later President Carter\u2019s secretary of state, founded Public Agenda, a nonprofit foundation that used opinion research and town-hall meetings to engage public officials, educators and citizens on questions of foreign and domestic policy.While Mr. Yankelovich was not a doctrinaire liberal, he expressed dismay at what he saw as the decline of progressive traditions, and often called for greater social responsibility on the part of government and corporate America. But he also sounded conservative themes in speeches and interviews, praising the work ethic, calling for welfare reforms and lamenting a loss of old-fashioned respect.He was highly regarded by colleagues for his professional ethics, his imaginative and well-documented polling surveys and the quality of his statistical analyses. But critics sometimes faulted him, saying he worked too fast on complex data, used too much social-scientific jargon in his writing and expressed a habitual optimism that bordered on Pollyanna-ism.Some of his books were extended arguments, often exhortatory, for self-improvement or for conflict resolution; others were expressions of confidence in democracy or the virtue of ethics in business affairs. The titles reflected his hopeful outlook: \u201cNew Rules: Searching for Self-Fulfillment in a World Turned Upside Down\u201d (1981), \u201cComing to Public Judgment: Making Democracy Work in a Complex World\u201d (1991), \u201cThe Magic of Dialogue: Transforming Conflict Into Cooperation\u201d (1999), and \u201cProfit With Honor: The New Shape of Market Capitalism\u201d (2006).In 2012, Mr. Yankelovich founded the Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research at the University of California at San Diego. He later endowed the center with a multimillion-dollar bequest.Daniel Yankelovich was born in Boston on Dec. 29, 1924, one of two children of Frederick Yankelovich and the former Sadie Mostow. His mother died when he was a boy, and his father, a real estate salesman, became a house painter during the Great Depression.He graduated from Boston Latin School and enrolled at Harvard, but left for Army service in World War II. Returning to Harvard, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1946 and a master\u2019s in 1950.After two years in Paris studying at the Sorbonne, he returned without a doctorate and went to work for a market research firm in Connecticut. He spent six years learning the ropes.Opinion polling was still unsophisticated at the time: Interviewees were not necessarily representative, poll questions contained hidden biases, the data was muddled. Political polls often got it right, but research on consumer preferences and public policy was trickier. Mr. Yankelovich had some new ideas.In 1958 he founded Daniel Yankelovich Inc. in New York, which made his reputation. One of his first projects was a poll of 300 carefully selected consumers in four regions about imported goods, an idea prompted by the opening in 1959 of the St. Lawrence Seaway, which made it possible to ship directly to the Midwest at lower costs. He found wide interest in imports and cited \u201can unprecedented opportunity for foreign producers to build up greater consumer acceptance for their goods\u201d in this country.In 1959, Mr. Yankelovich married Hasmieg Kaboolian. The couple had one daughter, Nicole, and were divorced. In 1991, he married a researcher, Mary Komarnicki. She was killed in 1995 in a car accident in San Diego in which Mr. Yankelovich was injured. He later married Barbara Lee; they were separated at his death. In recent years he lived with his companion, Dr. Laura Nathanson, at White Sands La Jolla, a retirement community.Besides his daughter, Nicole, and Dr. Nathanson, his immediate survivors include a granddaughter and a sister, Libby Schenkman.The survey on imported goods was widely publicized, and the Yankelovich agency was soon flourishing. By 1963, he was measuring the effectiveness of television advertising. Volunteers watched commercials; were given money to shop in a mock supermarket, either buying advertised products or keeping the money; and were then questioned about their choices. This provided data on sales and on the rationale behind purchases.He was among the first, in the 1960s, to refer to the postwar generation as \u201cbaby boomers,\u201d and he tracked their lives \u2014 from hula-hoops, coonskin caps and Barbie dolls to their rise to success in educated two-earner families and beyond. In their mature years, he found a \u201cnameless yearning\u201d for deeper meaning, which he called \u201csubmerged idealism,\u201d lying \u201cjust below the surface of the pragmatism and calculation.\u201dMr. Yankelovich developed the concept of segmenting test markets by lifestyle rather than by demographics alone. He also expanded his analyses to include social and cultural trends and began publishing annual surveys that tracked such changes.His studies of American youths became the basis for a 1969 CBS television news special, \u201cGenerations Apart.\u201d Later surveys focused on college students\u2019 attitudes and drug use.By 1970, Yankelovich had become one of the largest market-research companies in the country, with a client list that included CBS, The New York Times, Fortune magazine, AT&T, General Electric, I.B.M., General Motors, Procter & Gamble, RCA, Volkswagen of America and the United States government.The company became Yankelovich, Skelly & White in 1974, in recognition of the contributions by the executive vice presidents Florence Skelly and Arthur White. Saatchi & Saatchi, the advertising agency, later bought the company, but Mr. Yankelovich remained chairman until 1986, when he formed a new firm, Daniel Yankelovich Group.Conducting research for President Clinton in the 1990s, Mr. Yankelovich helped him begin a \u201creinventing government\u201d project that was intended to make government leaner and more relevant to citizens. The approach stole a march on Republicans, who had painted the Democrats as the party of big government.With I. M. Destler he edited a collection of essays, \u201cBeyond the Beltway: Engaging the Public in U.S. Foreign Policy\u201d (1994).During George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, Mr. Yankelovich tracked a long decline in public confidence in Washington\u2019s ability to achieve goals in Iraq and Afghanistan, hunt terrorists, protect American borders and safeguard jobs in a troubled economy. In the administration\u2019s waning days, he found that 85 percent of Americans believed the nation was on the wrong track.In a speech at the Drucker Institute in Claremont, Calif., in late 2008, Mr. Yankelovich enumerated overwhelming national problems \u2014 the financial meltdown, the soaring debt, lost standing in the world, runaway health and education costs \u2014 and, typically, offered his vision of a way out of the mess. He called it \u201cThe New Pragmatism,\u201d and insisted that it would soon spread across America.\u201cIt\u2019s going to occur,\u201d he said, certitude rising in his New England accent, \u201cthrough entrepreneurship and innovative thinking at all levels of society: individual, commercial, public, nonprofit, private, institutional, and all of these in interlocking, interacting ways.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated Mr. Yankelovich\u2019s status in his family as child. As the obituary noted elsewhere, he had a sister; he was not an only child.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Big Business Got Brazil Hooked on Junk Food", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "FORTALEZA, Brazil \u2014 Children\u2019s squeals rang through the muggy morning air as a woman pushed a gleaming white cart along pitted, trash-strewn streets. She was making deliveries to some of the poorest households in this seaside city, bringing pudding, cookies and other packaged foods to the customers on her sales route.As she dropped off variety packs of Chandelle pudding, Kit-Kats and Mucilon infant cereal, there was something striking about her customers: Many were visibly overweight, even small children.She gestured to a home along her route and shook her head, recalling how its patriarch, a morbidly obese man, died the previous week. \u201cHe ate a piece of cake and died in his sleep,\u201d she said.Mrs. da Silva, who herself weighs more than 200 pounds, recently discovered that she had high blood pressure, a condition she acknowledges is probably tied to her weakness for fried chicken and the Coca-Cola she drinks with every meal, breakfast included.A New York Times examination of corporate records, epidemiological studies and government reports \u2014 as well as interviews with scores of nutritionists and health experts around the world \u2014 reveals a sea change in the way food is produced, distributed and advertised across much of the globe. The shift, many public health experts say, is contributing to a new epidemic of diabetes and heart disease, chronic illnesses that are fed by soaring rates of obesity in places that struggled with hunger and malnutrition just a generation ago.The new reality is captured by a single, stark fact: Across the world, more people are now obese than underweight. At the same time, scientists say, the growing availability of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods is generating a new type of malnutrition, one in which a growing number of people are both overweight and undernourished.\u201cThe prevailing story is that this is the best of all possible worlds \u2014 cheap food, widely available. If you don\u2019t think about it too hard, it makes sense,\u201d said Anthony Winson, who studies the political economics of nutrition at the University of Guelph in Ontario. A closer look, however, reveals a much different story, he said. \u201cTo put it in stark terms: The diet is killing us.\u201dEven critics of processed food acknowledge that there are multiple factors in the rise of obesity, including genetics, urbanization, growing incomes and more sedentary lives. Nestl\u00e9 executives say their products have helped alleviate hunger, provided crucial nutrients, and that the company has squeezed salt, fat and sugar from thousands of items to make them healthier. But Sean Westcott, head of food research and development at Nestl\u00e9, conceded obesity has been an unexpected side effect of making inexpensive processed food more widely available.\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect what the impact would be,\u201d he said.Part of the problem, he added, is a natural tendency for people to overeat as they can afford more food. Nestl\u00e9, he said, strives to educate consumers about proper portion size and to make and market foods that balance \u201cpleasure and nutrition.\u201dObesity rates in the United States, the South Pacific and the Persian Gulf are among the highest in the world \u2014 more than one in four Americans is obese. But over the last 35 years, obesity, defined as having a body mass index over 30, has grown the fastest in countries throughout Latin America, Africa and Asia.By Audrey Carlsen | Source: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Data not available for French Guiana and Western Sahara.In places as distant as China, South Africa and Colombia, the rising clout of big food companies also translates into political influence, stymieing public health officials seeking soda taxes or legislation aimed at curbing the health impacts of processed food.The same trends are mirrored with fast food, which grew 30 percent worldwide from 2011 to 2016, compared with 21 percent in the United States, according to Euromonitor. Take, for example, Domino\u2019s Pizza, which in 2016 added 1,281 stores \u2014 one \u201cevery seven hours,\u201d noted its annual report \u2014 all but 171 of them overseas.\u201cAt a time when some of the growth is more subdued in established economies, I think that strong emerging-market posture is going to be a winning position,\u201d Mark Schneider, chief executive of Nestl\u00e9, recently told investors. Developing markets now provide the company with 42 percent of its sales.For some companies, that can mean specifically focusing on young people, as Ahmet Bozer, president of Coca-Cola International, described to investors in 2014. \u201cHalf the world\u2019s population has not had a Coke in the last 30 days,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s 600 million teenagers who have not had a Coke in the last week. So the opportunity for that is huge.\u201dIndustry defenders say that processed foods are essential to feed a growing, urbanizing world of people, many of them with rising incomes, demanding convenience.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get rid of all factories and go back to growing all grain. It\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s not going to work,\u201d said Mike Gibney, a professor emeritus of food and health at University College Dublin and a consultant to Nestl\u00e9. \u201cIf I ask 100 Brazilian families to stop eating processed food, I have to ask myself: What will they eat? Who will feed them? How much will it cost?\u201dIn many ways, Brazil is a microcosm of how growing incomes and government policies have led to longer, better lives and largely eradicated hunger. But now the country faces a stark new nutrition challenge: over the last decade, the country\u2019s obesity rate has nearly doubled to 20 percent, and the portion of people who are overweight has nearly tripled to 58 percent. Each year, 300,000 people are diagnosed with Type II diabetes, a condition with strong links to obesity.Brazil also highlights the food industry\u2019s political prowess. In 2010, a coalition of Brazilian food and beverage companies torpedoed a raft of measures that sought to limit junk food ads aimed at children. The latest challenge has come from the country\u2019s president, Michel Temer, a business-friendly centrist whose conservative allies in Congress are now seeking to chip away at the handful of regulations and laws intended to encourage healthy eating.\u201cWhat we have is a war between two food systems, a traditional diet of real food once produced by the farmers around you and the producers of ultra-processed food designed to be over-consumed and which in some cases are addictive,\u201d said Carlos A. Monteiro, a professor of nutrition and public health at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cIt\u2019s a war,\u201d he said, \u201cbut one food system has disproportionately more power than the other.\u201dMrs. da Silva reaches customers in Fortaleza\u2019s slums, many of whom don\u2019t have ready access to a supermarket. She champions the product she sells, exulting in the nutritional claims on the labels that boast of added vitamins and minerals.\u201cEveryone here knows that Nestl\u00e9 products are good for you,\u201d she said, gesturing to cans of Mucilon, the infant cereal whose label says it is \u201cpacked with calcium and niacin,\u201d but also Nescau 2.0, a sugar-laden chocolate powder.She became a Nestl\u00e9 vendor two years ago, when her family of five was struggling to get by. Though her husband is still unemployed, things are looking up. With the $185 a month she earns selling Nestl\u00e9 products, she was able to buy a new refrigerator, a television and a gas stove for the family\u2019s three-room home at the edge of a fetid tidal marsh.He said sagging incomes among poor and working-class Brazilians had actually been a boon for direct sales. That\u2019s because unlike most food retailers, Nestl\u00e9 gives customers a full month to pay for their purchases. It also helps that saleswomen \u2014 the program employs only women \u2014 know when their customers receive Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, a monthly government subsidy for low-income households.\u201cThe essence of our program is to reach the poor,\u201d Mr. Barbosa said. \u201cWhat makes it work is the personal connection between the vendor and the customer.\u201dNestl\u00e9 increasingly also portrays itself as a leader in its commitment to community and health. Two decades ago, it anointed itself a \u201cnutrition health and wellness company.\u201d Over the years, the company says it has reformulated nearly 9,000 products to reduce salt, sugar and fat, and it has delivered billions of servings fortified with vitamins and minerals. It emphasizes food safety and the reduction of food waste, and it works with nearly 400,000 farmers around the world to promote sustainable farming.In an interview at Nestl\u00e9\u2019s new $50 million campus in suburban Cleveland, Mr. Westcott, head of food research and development, said the door-to-door sales program reflected another of the company\u2019s slogans: \u201cCreating shared values.\u201d\u201cWe create shared value by creating micro-entrepreneurs \u2014 people that can build their own businesses,\u201d he said. A company like Nestl\u00e9 can bolster the well-being of entire communities \u201cby actually sending positive messages around nutrition,\u201d he said.Nestl\u00e9\u2019s portfolio of foods is vast and different from that of some snack companies, which make little effort to focus on healthy offerings. They include Nesfit, a whole-grain cereal; low-fat yogurts like Molico that contain a relatively modest amount of sugar (six grams); and a range of infant cereals, served with milk or water, that are fortified with vitamins, iron and probiotics.Dr. Gibney, the nutritionist and Nestl\u00e9 consultant, said the company deserved credit for reformulating healthier products.But of the 800 products that Nestl\u00e9 says are available through its vendors, Mrs. da Silva says her customers are mostly interested in only about two dozen of them, virtually all sugar-sweetened items like Kit-Kats; Nestl\u00e9 Greek Red Berry, a 3.5-ounce cup of yogurt with 17 grams of sugar; and Chandelle Pacoca, a peanut-flavored pudding in a container the same size as the yogurt that has 20 grams of sugar \u2014 nearly the entire World Health Organization\u2019s recommended daily limit.Dr. Popkin finds the door-to-door marketing emblematic of an insidious new era in which companies seek to reach every doorstep in an effort to grow and become central to communities in the developing world. \u201cThey\u2019re not leaving an inch of country left aside,\u201d he said.On the streets of Fortaleza, where Nestl\u00e9 is admired for its Swiss pedigree and perceived high quality, negative sentiments about the company are rarely heard.The home of Joana D\u2019arc de Vasconcellos, 53, another vendor, is filled with Nestl\u00e9-branded stuffed animals and embossed certificates she earned at nutrition classes sponsored by Nestl\u00e9. In her living room, pride of place is given to framed photographs of her children at age 2, each posed before a pyramid of empty Nestl\u00e9 infant formula cans. As her son and daughter grew up, she switched to other Nestl\u00e9 products for children: Nido Kinder, a toddler milk powder; Chocapic, a chocolate-flavored cereal; and the chocolate milk powder Nescau.\u201cWhen he was a baby, my son didn\u2019t like to eat \u2014 until I started giving him Nestl\u00e9 foods,\u201d she said proudly.Ms. de Vasconcellos has diabetes and high blood pressure. Her 17-year-old daughter, who weighs more than 250 pounds, has hypertension and polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder strongly linked to obesity. Many other relatives have one or more ailments often associated with poor diets: her mother and two sisters (diabetes and hypertension), and her husband (hypertension.) Her father died three years ago after losing his feet to gangrene, a complication of diabetes.\u201cEvery time I go to the public health clinic, the line for diabetics is out the door,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find a family here that doesn\u2019t have it.\u201dMs. de Vasconcellos previously tried selling Tupperware and Avon products door to door, but many customers failed to pay. Six years ago, after a friend told her about Nestl\u00e9\u2019s direct sales program, Ms. Vasconcellos jumped at the chance.She says her customers have never failed to pay her.\u201cPeople have to eat,\u201d she said.In May 2000, Denise Coitinho, then director of nutrition for the Ministry of Health, was at a Mother\u2019s Day party at her children\u2019s school when her mobile phone rang. It was Nestl\u00e9\u2019s chief of government relations. \u201cHe was really upset,\u201d she recalled.The source of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s concern was a new policy that Brazil had adopted and was pushing at the World Health Organization. If adopted, the policy would have recommended that children around the world breast-feed for six months, rather than the previous recommendation of four to six months, she said.It is hard to overstate the economic power and political access enjoyed by food and beverage conglomerates in Brazil, which are responsible for 10 percent of the nation\u2019s economic output and employ 1.6 million people.In 2014, food companies donated $158 million to members of Brazil\u2019s National Congress, a threefold increase over 2010, according to Transpar\u00eancia Brasil. A study the organization released last year found that more than half of Brazil\u2019s current federal legislators had been elected with donations from the food industry \u2013 before the Supreme Court banned corporate contributions in 2015.The single largest donor to congressional candidates was the Brazilian meat giant JBS, which gave candidates $112 million in 2014; Coca-Cola gave $6.5 million in campaign contributions that year, and McDonald\u2019s donated $561,000.So the stage was set for a mammoth political battle when, in 2006, the government sought to enact far-reaching food-industry regulations to curb obesity and disease. The measures, growing out of the earlier breast-feeding policy, included advertising alerts to warn consumers about foods high in sugar, salt and saturated fats, as well as marketing restrictions to dampen the lure of highly processed foods and sugary beverages, especially those aimed at children.Taking a page from the government\u2019s successful efforts to limit tobacco marketing, the new rules would have barred brands like Pepsi and KFC from sponsoring sports and cultural events.\u201cWe thought that Brazil could be a model for the rest of the world, a country that puts the well-being of its citizens above all else,\u201d said Dirceu Raposo de Mello, then director of the government\u2019s health surveillance agency, widely known by the Portuguese acronym Anvisa. \u201cUnfortunately, the food industry did not feel the same way.\u201dThe food companies took a low profile, mustering behind the Brazilian Association of Food Industries, a lobbying group whose board of vice presidents included executives from Nestl\u00e9; the American meat giant Cargill; and Unilever, the European food conglomerate that owns brands like Hellmann\u2019s, Mazola oil and Ben & Jerry\u2019s. The association declined to comment for this article.During the early days of public hearings, the industry seemed to be negotiating the rules in good faith but behind the scenes, health advocates say corporate lawyers and lobbyists were quietly waging a multipronged campaign to derail the process.Industry-financed academics began appearing on TV to assail the rules as economically ruinous. Other experts wrote newspaper editorial pieces suggesting that exercise and stricter parenting might be more effective than regulations aimed at fighting childhood obesity.The industry\u2019s most potent rallying cry, analysts say, was its strident denunciation of the proposed advertising restrictions as censorship. The accusation had particular resonance given the nearly two decades of military dictatorship that ended in 1985.At one meeting, a representative from the food industry accused Anvisa of trying to subvert parental authority, saying mothers had the right to decide what to feed their children, recalled Vanessa Schottz, a nutrition advocate. In another meeting, she said, a toy industry representative stood up and assailed the proposed marketing rules, saying they would deprive Brazilian children of the toys that sometimes accompany fast-food meals. \u201cHe said we were killing the dreams of children,\u201d Ms. Schottz recalled. \u201cWe were dumbfounded.\u201dChastened by the industry criticism, Anvisa in late 2010 withdrew most of the proposed restrictions. What remained was a single proposal requiring that ads include a warning about unhealthy food and beverages.Then came the lawsuits.Over the course of several months, a disparate collection of industry groups filed 11 lawsuits against Anvisa. The plaintiffs included the national association of biscuit manufacturers, the corn growers lobby and an alliance of chocolate, cocoa and candy companies. Some of the lawsuits claimed that the regulations violated constitutional protections on free speech, while others said the agency did not have the standing to regulate the food and advertising industries.Mr. Raposo de Mello, the former Anvisa president, says he was stunned by Mr. Adam\u2019s change of heart, given the attorney general office\u2019s longstanding support for Anvisa. Seven years later, with most of the 11 lawsuits still unresolved, the regulations remain frozen.\u201cThe industry,\u201d Mr. Raposo de Mello said, \u201cdid an end run around the system.\u201dIn the meantime, the food and beverage industry became more aggressive as it sought to neutralize Anvisa, which it viewed as its greatest adversary.In 2010, in the midst of the battle against the agency\u2019s proposed regulations, a group of 156 business executives took its grievances to the campaign of Dilma Rousseff, who was running for president.Marcello Fragano Baird, a political scientist in S\u00e3o Paulo who has studied the food lobby\u2019s campaign against the nutrition regulations, said Ms. Rousseff assured the executives she would shake up Anvisa. \u201cShe promised them she would \u2018clean house\u2019 once elected,\u201d he said, adding that he learned about the encounter through interviews with participants.Ms. Rouseff won, and soon after her inauguration, she replaced Mr. Raposo de Mello with Jaime C\u00e9sar de Moura Oliveira, a longtime political ally and a former lawyer for the Brazilian subsidiary of the food giant Unilever.A spokesman for Ms. Rouseff declined to make her available for an interview.In 2012, Anvisa hosted a traveling anti-obesity exhibit at its offices. Titled \u201cLose Weight Brazil,\u201d the exhibit extolled exercise and moderation as the keys to tackling obesity, but largely ignored mainstream scientific evidence about the dangers of consuming too much sugar, soda and processed food.The exhibition\u2019s sponsor? Coca-Cola.More than 1,000 miles south of Fortaleza, the effects of changing eating habits are evident at a brightly painted day care center in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city. Each day, more than a hundred children pack classrooms, singing the alphabet, playing and taking group naps.When it was started in the early 1990s, the program, run by a Brazilian nonprofit group, had a straightforward mission: to alleviate undernutrition among children who were not getting enough to eat in the city\u2019s most impoverished neighborhoods.These days many of those who attend are noticeably pudgy and, the staff nutritionists note, some are worryingly short for their age, the result of diets heavy in salt, fat and sugar but lacking in the nourishment needed for healthy development.\u201cWe are even getting babies, which is something we never saw before,\u201d said Giuliano Giovanetti, who does outreach and communications for the center. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis for our society because we are producing a generation of children with impaired cognitive abilities who will not reach their full potential.\u201dNearly 9 percent of Brazilian children were obese in 2015, more than a 270 percent increase since 1980, according to a recent study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. That puts it in striking distance of the United States, where 12.7 percent of children were obese in 2015.The figures are even more alarming in the communities served by the center: In some neighborhoods, 30 percent of the children are obese and another 30 percent malnourished, according to the organization\u2019s own data, which found that 6 percent of obese children were also malnourished.The rising obesity rates are largely associated with improved economics, as families with increasing incomes embrace the convenience, status and flavors offered by packaged foods.Busy parents ply their toddlers with instant noodles and frozen chicken nuggets, meals that are often accompanied by soda. Rice, beans, salad and grilled meats \u2014 building blocks of the traditional Brazilian diet \u2014 are falling by the wayside, studies have found.Compounding the problem is the rampant street violence that keeps young children cooped up indoors.\u201cIt\u2019s just too dangerous to let my kids play outside, so they spend all their free time sitting on the couch playing video games and watching TV,\u201d said Elaine Pereira dos Santos, 35, the mother of two children, 9 and 4 years old, both overweight.Isaac, the 9-year-old, weighs 138 pounds and can wear only clothing intended for adolescents. Ms. dos Santos, who works at a hospital pharmacy, shortens the pants legs for him.Like many Brazilian mothers, she was pleased when Isaac began to gain weight as a toddler, not long after he tasted his first McDonald\u2019s French fry. \u201cI always thought fatter is better when it comes to babies,\u201d she said. She happily indulged his eating habits, which included frequent trips to fast-food outlets and almost no fruits and vegetables.But when he began having trouble running and complained about achy knees, Ms. dos Santos knew something was wrong. \u201cThe hardest part is the ridicule he gets from other children,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we go out shopping, even adults point and stare\u201d or call him gordinho, roughly translated to \u201clittle fatty.\u201dAt the S\u00e3o Paulo nursery, health care workers keep tabs on the children\u2019s physical and cognitive development, while nutritionists teach parents how to prepare inexpensive, healthy meals.

{"Headline": "Trump Proposes the Most Sweeping Tax Overhaul in Decades", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday began an ambitious push to slash taxes and salvage what remains of his embattled legislative agenda in Congress this year, proposing a politically challenging array of tax cuts for individuals and businesses that would constitute the most sweeping changes to the federal tax code in decades.Mr. Trump, smarting from the latest defeat this week of his efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, cast the tax plan as an economic imperative and the fulfillment of a promise to his working-class supporters to deliver benefits in the form of lower taxes, better jobs and higher wages.\u201cThis is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor and as wages start going up at levels that you haven\u2019t seen in many years,\u201d Mr. Trump told hundreds of supporters in a speech at the Indiana State Fair Grounds.But the president offered no measure of the plan\u2019s cost and scant detail about how working people would benefit from a proposal that has explicit and substantial rewards for wealthy people and corporations, including the elimination of taxes on large inheritances and deep reductions in the rates paid by businesses large and small.After months of secret talks among Republicans, the nine-page proposal produced by the so-called Big Six working group prompts as many questions as it provides answers. Without more details, it is difficult to show how middle-income families will see the most benefit from the tax overhaul \u2014 or if it will favor the richest Americans.On the individual side, the plan would collapse the tax brackets from seven to three, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, the president said. The current top rate is 39.6 percent and the lowest rate is 10 percent. The framework also gives Congress the option of creating a higher, fourth, rate above 35 percent in the tax plan to ensure that the wealthy are paying their fair share.The plan aims to simplify and cut taxes for the middle class by doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. That would allow people to avoid a complicated process of itemizing their taxes to claim various credits and deductions. It would increase the child tax credit from $1,000 to an unspecified amount, and create a new $500 tax credit for non-child dependents, such as the elderly.Provisions such as the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax, a levy on inherited wealth that Mr. Trump has derided for years, would be gone under the Republican proposal.The proposal calls for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, a shift that supporters say is needed to make American companies more competitive with their counterparts around the world.The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.\u201cThis will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and midsize businesses in this country in more than 80 years,\u201d Mr. Trump said.While Republican leaders claim to be united on the tax plan, they must now sell it to lawmakers who have been deeply divided this year. The push began at a House Republican retreat on Wednesday at Fort McNair in Washington, where Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, walked members through the blueprint and talked about the importance of coming together to fix the tax code.Later, in a hopeful sign for Republican leaders fretting privately about keeping their rank and file together, the conservative Freedom Caucus, whose members have derailed the party\u2019s initiatives with hard-line demands, issued a statement of support calling the plan \u201cforward looking\u201d and pledging to back the party\u2019s budget designed to ensure its passage.The political stakes are high for a president who is desperate to score a legislative win before his first year in office draws to a close. Mr. Trump, who has eschewed the advocacy tours that his predecessors have used to build support for their top domestic priorities, made a rare direct appeal to voters during his speech, imploring them to call their representatives and senators and demand action on the tax proposal. \u201cLet them know you\u2019re watching,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cLet them know you\u2019re waiting.\u201dIn an apparent nod to the harsh political realities the tax plan faces, Mr. Trump made an explicit overture to Democrats to support the plan.\u201cDemocrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people,\u201d Mr. Trump said.But behind the scenes, Republican congressional leaders and senior White House officials have discussed bypassing Democrats and using special budget rules that would allow them to get the bill through Congress on a simple majority vote. And Mr. Trump paired his scripted talk of bipartisanship with an impromptu threat to Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, saying he would personally work to defeat the senator\u2019s re-election bid next year if he does not fall into line on the tax plan.\u201cIf Senator Donnelly doesn\u2019t approve it \u2014 because, you know, he\u2019s on the other side \u2014 we will come here, we will campaign against him like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Mr. Trump said as Mr. Donnelly looked on from the audience.Conservatives cheered the plan as a bold and long-awaited step to spur economic growth, while Democratic leaders condemned it as an irresponsible boon to the rich. And some budget watchdogs expressed worry about the long-term impact of a plan they said could cost more than $2 trillion over a decade.The New York Times on Wednesday obtained the Trump administration's proposed tax framework that includes what would be the most sweeping changes to the tax code in decades.Mr. Trump, who has broken with precedent for modern American presidents by refusing to release his tax returns, insisted that wealthy people like him would not benefit \u2014 an assertion that seemed improbable for a man who runs a family-owned real estate empire and whose children stand to inherit vast sums.\u201cTax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d Mr. Trump said, framing a proposal that would affect hundreds of millions of Americans in terms of his own self-interest. \u201cI\u2019m doing the right thing, and it\u2019s not good for me, believe me.\u201dDemocrats scoffed. \u201cIf this framework is all about the middle class, then Trump Tower is middle-class housing,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cIt violates Trump\u2019s tax pledge that the rich would not gain at all under his plan by offering sweetheart deals for powerful C.E.O.s, giveaways for campaign coffers and a new way to cheat taxes for Mar-a-Lago\u2019s loyal members.\u201dAs with the individual side, some of the thornier business tax issues remain unaddressed. It will be left to Congress to create safeguards that prevent wealthy individuals from incorporating as pass-through businesses, which would tax their income at a lower rate.Most itemized deductions, including those widely used for state and local tax expenses, would also be eliminated, along with most of the tax credits that businesses use. However, the plan would preserve the deductions for mortgage interest expenses and charitable giving and keep incentives for education and retirement savings plans, as well as preserve the tax credits for research and development and low-income-housing on the business side.Another big change for companies would be a limitation of the deductibility for corporate interest expenses, in exchange for the opportunity to immediately expense business investments. The ability to immediately write off these expenses would last only five years, and the limitations for deducting interest have yet to be determined.Perhaps the most significant, yet murky, shift is the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system for multinational corporations. In theory, this means that companies would not be taxed on their overseas earnings. But to prevent erosion of the tax base, Republicans plan to impose some form of tax on foreign profits. The transition to the new system would also include a one-time repatriation tax at yet-to-be-determined rates to encourage companies to bring offshore profits back home.Administration officials did not provide a cost estimate for the plan. Members of the Senate Budget Committee have agreed on a budget resolution that would allow for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years. Studies of similar plans produced by Mr. Trump and House Republicans have been projected to cost $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade.Republicans say economic growth will compensate for lost revenue. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who sits on the Finance Committee, said he was confident that a growing economy would pay for the tax cuts.\u201cThis tax plan will be deficit reducing,\u201d Mr. Toomey said.Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Indianapolis, and Alan Rappeport from Washington.

{"Headline": "Going Local: Is It Possible, as a Foreigner, to Experience a Country as Its People Do?", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnless you didn\u2019t know any better and happened to book a room at such a hotel, as I did one year, in the Mediterranean village of Kalkan. By then I had been living in Istanbul for several years and had grown accustomed to Turkey\u2019s traditional breakfast: kaymak (clotted cream) and honey, gozleme and simit (the Turkish bagel), tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, cheese \u2014 all arranged in dozens of tiny, perfect plates and bowls (clearly as part of a conspiracy to keep women engaged in heavy kitchen labor). Turks have wonderfully high standards for the freshness and quality of their food. It\u2019s not easy to eat poorly in Turkey. But one morning at this Kalkan resort, a regular on the Exclusive Escapes circuit, I was surprised to find myself among tourists from the British Isles all enjoying elements of traditional English breakfasts \u2014 beans, fried eggs, mushrooms and the like \u2014 as well as wilting Turkish cheeses and olives, arranged like cheap garnishes around the main fare. I am not being a snob; honestly, I don\u2019t know where you find crummy olives in Turkey. The jams came in plastic store-bought packages. The dinner menu included spaghetti. The rest stops for buses on Anatolian highways serve better food than that hidden hotel did. I took that as evidence that the entire town \u2014 maybe even a culture \u2014 had been destroyed by foreign tourism. I quickly decamped for a seaside village I would rather not name.Exclusive Escapes went bust in 2015, when foreigners began to fear that even \u201cspecialists\u201d couldn\u2019t protect them from Turkey\u2019s unstable political situation. Because that was their reason for being, right? Their existence suggested an enduring prejudice against the Turks and the Middle East, wild, unpredictable places where the locals ate weird food. An authentic \u201cexperience\u201d was promised \u2014 but also protection from the experience of actually being in Turkey. Kalkan had one main commercial street, and it seemed as genuine as a theater set: men hanging around in doorways, hawking carpets and baubles, crowded together in some fantasia of Middle Eastern life. The shopkeepers and restaurant owners \u2014 the Turks \u2014 trapped in this fake Turkey pretending to be authentic Turkey looked as depressed as you would expect of people who have been forced to imitate themselves for the sake of strangers.Authenticity in travel, taking in a culture on its own terms, has become an increasingly implausible endeavor, but it\u2019s still a popular aspiration. Ostensibly brave and sophisticated travelers dream of vacationing like the locals; travel magazines cater to this dream by reporting on locales where there will be no foreigners, where you can sip your raki with, and like, the natives. These travelers want to be protected not necessarily from the scarier versions of a foreign land but from other tourists. (\u201cExclusive\u201d escapes indeed.)In Turkey, my home for more than a decade now, I still enjoy this form of voyeurism, too. The country is a place of many subcultures, one of which is rooted in coastal living, along the Aegean and Mediterranean. Turks from Istanbul have long migrated down the Aegean coast in the summer months, where many of them, both the wealthy and middle class, own homes. Here, unlike the stiffer, more conservative interior of Anatolia, the country\u2019s laid-back Greek influence is evident: love for the heat, the sun, the sea, sitting outdoors around a table for hours, multiple generations of family eating meze and drinking beer or raki. More conservative families might seek out expensive Muslim-friendly resorts, \u201chalal tourism\u201d or \u201ctesettur hotels,\u201d where the dining options are free of alcohol and pork and private sections of beach are set aside for women.For many Turks who were born outside of the major cities, it\u2019s also a summer ritual to drive, fly or take the bus to their memleket, or hometown. In the mid-20th century, millions of Turks migrated to Ankara and Istanbul; many now make summer returns to see family, to attend to their hazelnut farms or orange trees, to get some fresh air, to reconnect to a simpler life. If you are a foreigner living in Turkey, you have no doubt benefited from these excursions; the gifts from returning friends come in the form of delicious, unfamiliar cheeses, startlingly sweet tomatoes, buttery olive oil.Those who remain near Istanbul for the season drive to the Black Sea coasts to swim or take ferries to one of the many islands in the Sea of Marmara, which laps up against the city. A century ago, the other side of the Bosporus counted as a popular place for vacation homes. This past summer, I was invited to Sedef, one of the Princes Islands in the Sea of Marmara that few people visit. I assumed it was so sparsely populated and tiny that day-trippers had no way of getting there. For a day and night I stayed in a home that had been designed by a relative of one of Turkey\u2019s greatest poets, heard only Turkish on the stony beaches, watched brave kids jump off rocks into a body of water that somehow seemed exotic precisely because it was not. On Sedef, the forests were still lush, the homes modest, the people longtime Istanbul families; it was a snapshot of the less ostentatious, early Republican era. But even here there remained the same problem as you would have in Kalkan: Was I seeing Turks in their native land as they saw themselves, or was I seeing what I wanted to see?This question has always been central to photography. As the critic Teju Cole has asked in these pages, when it comes to capturing another, can \u201cthe truth of a given community ... only be delivered by an insider?\u201d He goes on: \u201cSympathy is often not enough. It can be condescending. But taking on the identity of others, appropriating what is theirs, is invasive and frequently violent. ... Combined with intuition, scrupulous context and moral intelligence, it has a chance to become truth.\u201d For this fall\u2019s Voyages issue, whose theme is families and friends vacationing in their homelands, some of the photographers charged with capturing them this summer were foreigners, some were countrymen. Is there a difference in the way they \u2014 or we \u2014 see their subjects? In some posed portraits, like those by Mark Neville in Odessa and Mamadi Doumbouya in Guinea, the subjects seem to present themselves as they would like to be seen by the world; traces of pride, even defensiveness, can be read into many of their faces. In others, like those by Newsha Tavakolian in Iran or Moises Saman in Japan, the effect is the opposite: a glimpse of a trip that otherwise would have been enjoyed privately.Implicit in the thrill we get from our peek into this personal experience is the mystery of choice: Of all the places in the country that people know best, what motivated the Italian or Chinese or Iranian vacationer to choose this particular place? Was it a spiritual, aesthetic or economic decision \u2014 or any kind of choice at all? The photographer Massimo Vitali, whose settings are Italian riverbanks, says, \u201cIn the past few years, particularly with the economic crisis facing the country and much of Europe, many Italians, particularly locals, have started to steer away from the beach and seek refuge and a bit of quiet in the hidden natural treasures of the Apuan Alps and the Apennine Mountains.\u201d Sim Chi Yin\u2019s subjects told her that they went to a giant water park with a \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d theme because it was close to their sweltering, landlocked city, Chongqing, where many never get to see the sea.Almost all the photos, however, share at least one theme: family. One of Neville\u2019s Ukrainian subjects said something revealing: \u201cWe usually go to Lanzheron beach every day. We live in a village called Velykodolynske, near Odessa, and when my husband drives to work, he takes us to the beach with our daughter. I love to be there. I love to watch people, how they behave and what they do. I love to watch how my daughter learns to communicate. When I was a child, my parents were taking me to the sea every day, and I am trying to do the same with my daughter.\u201dThat reminds me of something I noticed when I visited the United States recently and was invited to a friend\u2019s house on the North Fork of Long Island. She grew up going there as a child, and she now went with her own children. All sorts of rituals were involved, including, of course, the very basic one of leaving New York City to go out to the beach together. It was a living tradition and not a restrictive one that was endured more than embraced, which is how I always thought of tradition. Instead, this was about something that becomes more important as you get older: preserving the memories of childhood, of easier times.For a long time, I never understood why so many of the people I grew up with at the Jersey Shore never left the Jersey Shore. In our youth, once we were old enough to work, we participated in its tourist economy: lifeguarding, checking beach badges, serving French fries at the corner burger place. On our few days off during the summer, what was our greatest pleasure? Going right back to the beach as beachgoers. That wide, white sand beach \u2014 coveted by many a North Jersey and New York native with funny accents and wearing too many clothes \u2014 eventually became part of the landscape to me; I never thought of it as a special place. But so many of the kids from my childhood still go there, now with their own families, and it is only after being away for two decades that I realize that the pull of the Jersey Shore is as much about remembering and retasting the unfettered past as it is the quality of the sand or the beauty of the water; it\u2019s about romance and innocence.Vacationing in your own country, with your own people, with your own family, is often a means of maintaining a connection to your youth \u2014 an attraction I expect has long been felt by people all over the world. These days, every vacation seems like a different kind of escape as well, from the terrorizing headlines of the news: climate-change-driven weather catastrophes, terrorism, reckless world leaders, the feeling that you are somehow living in every scary corner of the globe simultaneously. Getting away while staying close to home \u2014 vacationing local \u2014 surely brings with it a higher level of comfort. You can see it in the pictures on these pages: the delight and the whimsy, the silliness and unguardedness. The lack of concern, however brief, about the fate of the world extends to how others might see them. I was especially struck by this in Vitali\u2019s photographs of Italians retreating into the countryside, portraits of hard-earned intimacy and, in a country besieged by tourists, privacy.This summer in Turkey, many of the wealthy escaped to Greece or Cuba, but many others ventured only as far as Ayvalik or Kilyos. Come fall, everyone will be back in Istanbul, and the vacations will be smaller. What has always enchanted me about this global city \u2014 and amused me when visiting friends from abroad asked me where they should go to avoid the tourists \u2014 is that in a place as grand as Istanbul, there seems to be little difference between the two. Turks like to drink tea on the Galata Bridge as much as tourists do. I doubt any of them ever get sick of looking at the Hagia Sofia. Fathers take their young children on the Bosporus cruise as their fathers probably once did before them, not because they want to be tourists, but because some places in the world are so magical that, if you can just quiet the worry in your mind for a few blissful seconds, your own home can feel like a fantastic voyage \u2014 your authentic habitat; your real life, only better.Advertisement"}

This week Trump ignored them and went ahead with his plan to undo DACA anyway, which prompted a lot of impassioned outrage from the tech companies.And yet, there was a kind of kabuki aspect to the whole thing \u2014 a feeling that all this was all going according to what has become a kind of script for Trump-tech relations. Trump does something, the tech industry condemns it, Trump ignores them, then we all move on to the next thing. For some of the most powerful companies in the world, the tech giants sure do seem powerless to get the president to do what they want, don\u2019t they?But I see a related big issue here for the tech industry: trust in the data economy.It seems to me the fate of the DACA database will not only give us clues about whether the Trump administration intends to use data as a weapon to further disenfranchise the already disenfranchised. It could also impact consumers\u2019 trust in the popular online services that are stockpiling their personal data.What this all means is pretty hazy. It could be that these ads were part of a Russian influence campaign aimed at changing votes during the election. Facebook is cooperating with investigators, so we may learn more at some point in the future. But this could all be disconnected from any alleged Russian plan to get Trump elected. For one thing, the ad buy is pretty small, and some of the ads were purchased even before Trump was in the running. Who knows?To me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we\u2019re learning about it 10 months after the election. Facebook was at the center of the postelection controversy over \u201cfake news\u201d and other shenanigans meant to monkey with the vote. So why did it take the company so long to figure this out? And should we take that to mean there\u2019s a lot more icky that happened on Facebook around the election that it still hasn\u2019t found?But back to your question on why it took Facebook so long to figure out that a Kremlin-linked group had bought ads on the social network.Is the latest news on the Russian ad buy indicative of a larger problem of weak Facebook oversight of its advertising system?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Law Firm Sees Britain as Hunting Ground for U.S. Whistle-Blower Cases", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When federal prosecutors recently charged a little-known British luxury knitwear company with evading custom duties, few knew the role a small New York law firm played in the case.The firm, Constantine Cannon, founded by Lloyd Constantine, the former chief of the New York attorney general\u2019s antitrust unit, had first alerted federal prosecutors in Maine to the cashmere sweater company\u2019s practices a year ago. A partner at the firm was tipped off by a former employee of the knitwear company in Harrogate, in northern England.Now, emboldened by its success in this case and others in the works, Constantine Cannon has started a whistle-blower practice in London. The firm\u2019s aim is to build cases in the United States with the help of whistle-blowers in Britain and Europe.The knitwear case, for instance, was brought under the False Claims Act, an American law, even though it involved a British company and was assembled with the assistance of a British whistle-blower. Under the False Claims Act, whistle-blowers can collect 15 to 30 percent of the amount the federal government recovers.For years, Constantine Cannon sought to persuade the British authorities to offer rewards to whistle-blowers, but the idea never gained traction. Britons simply disliked the concept of rewarding individuals for reporting wrongdoing.Undeterred, Constantine Cannon took a gamble: It began quietly mining for cases in Britain and Europe that could be eligible for whistle-blower rewards in the United States. Another American law firm, Phillips & Cohen, also looks overseas for such cases, renting shared office space in London for lawyers from the United States to meet with potential whistle-blowers.Unlike in Britain and the Continent, whistle-blower cases can net big money in the United States \u2014 both for the government and the individuals who expose wrongdoing.In fiscal year 2016, the Justice Department recovered more than $4.7 billion \u2014 the third-highest amount recovered in a single year \u2014 for civil fraud and false claims cases. Whistle-blowers propel the majority of false claims cases.The ability of British citizens to avail themselves of American whistle-blower laws \u201cis a great example of how the global economy opens up opportunities for whistle-blowers from around the world to point out fraud against the U.S. government,\u201d said Mary Inman, who arrived in London in July to start Constantine Cannon\u2019s whistle-blower practice in Europe.For more than a year, Ms. Inman, 49, had been traveling from San Francisco, scouting for tips of illegal practices that her firm could develop into cases in the United States.The knitwear company case \u201cwill be a wake-up call to British people,\u201d sending the message \u201cyou can also do this and pick up a tidy sum,\u201d Ms. Inman said.They may also discover that the Justice Department is not the only United States government entity offering rich bounties for whistle-blowers. In 2015, Congress created the Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act, whereby a tipster can collect rewards of up to 30 percent of monetary sanctions that the government collects based on information that the whistle-blower provides. And the Securities and Exchange Commission, as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, has a whistle-blower program.Since the program\u2019s inception in 2011, the securities regulator has paid out about $158 million in rewards to 46 whistle-blowers. The largest whistle-blower bounty paid out to date by the agency was more than $30 million; it went to an individual living in a foreign country.And the securities regulator notes on its website that individuals in 95 foreign countries have submitted whistle-blower tips between the 2011 and 2015 fiscal years, with the largest number coming from Britain.The knitwear case got its start in October 2015, when Richard Pike, a partner in Constantine Cannon\u2019s office overlooking Paternoster Square in London, received a call.Andrew Patrick, who like Mr. Pike hailed from the north of England, had been trawling the internet and was calling lawyers in London about an employment dispute with his current employer. Mr. Pike couldn\u2019t help him with the labor issue, but his interest was piqued when Mr. Patrick mentioned what his former employer, Pure Collection Ltd., was doing to avoid paying customs duty.As Mr. Patrick relayed the story, Pure Collection, where he worked until October 2014, avoided duties on the luxury sweaters it shipped to the United States by splitting up orders from customers.Until March 9, 2016, packages containing merchandise with a total retail value of $200 or less could lawfully enter the United States duty-free, so the company would divvy up single orders for American customers into multiple packages and ship the parcels separately, according to the complaint filed in late July by federal prosecutors in Maine.The company has not responded to the complaint. Pure Collection did not respond to requests for comment.The assistant United States attorney in Maine, Andrew K. Lizotte, declined to comment on whether the company and prosecutors were in settlement talks.Both in his role first as a customer service adviser and later as a warehouse operative at Pure Collection, Mr. Patrick said he was told to split orders exceeding $400 into separate smaller orders.The government\u2019s lawsuit cites an email in which Pure Collection\u2019s chief executive told the company\u2019s co-founder that \u201cwe are still splitting parcels and avoiding duty \u2026 I am nervous about the potential duty implications this may have for us \u2026 (because) U.S. customs could come after us at any point,\u201d the complaint states, quoting from an email.By finding a way around the customs duties, Pure Collection put itself in the \u201csame favorable domestic pricing position as its American competitors,\u201d the Maine complaint alleges.Before calling Mr. Pike, Mr. Patrick, 54, had contacted the Internal Revenue Service and sent a package to the United States Embassy in London with some documents on the order-splitting. But he heard nothing back.He then called a lawyer, who told him his firm wouldn\u2019t take the case because the United States government already knew of it. (At that point, however, no government agency had taken it up.)\u201cThere was nobody interested,\u201d Mr. Patrick recalled. \u201cIt was difficult. I felt like a bloody idiot.\u201dBefore Constantine Cannon took on Mr. Patrick\u2019s allegations, it had a customer in Maine, from where Ms. Inman hails, order $937 in cashmere sweaters \u2014 to show that Maine was an appropriate venue in which to bring the case. Seven cashmere sweaters arrived in three packages over the course of three days.At one point, Maine prosecutors wanted Mr. Patrick to fly to the United States, but he was reluctant. \u201cI am not some jet-set,\u201d he said.Mr. Patrick asked Molly Knobler, an associate in Constantine Cannon\u2019s Washington office, if they could use Skype to talk instead. When she suggested the idea to Maine prosecutors, they agreed.For now, the size of Mr. Patrick\u2019s reward is unclear. The government\u2019s complaint alleged that between 2010 and 2016 goods worth a little over $121 million were sent to customers in the United States via standard delivery methods like the United States Postal Service. Although not all shipments were split to avoid customs duty, the scale of sales suggests that whistle-blowing could change Mr. Patrick\u2019s life appreciably.Mr. Patrick said the first thing he would do with his reward would be to give some money to his 77-year-old mother and quit his job as a pallbearer at funerals.\u201cIf it is a reasonable amount, I would go for a \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000 car,\u201d he said. \u201cI have lived on \u00a3250 cars for 20 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Since when is it anyone\u2019s business how much money other people have? It\u2019s everyone\u2019s business if they cheated or got it illegally, but what if they just worked hard? To the commenters, get a grip. You are not entitled to have any of their money!The guilt over money expressed here and the conclusions of the author seem based on what nonrich folks want to believe, rather than reality. Who hires a nanny and then feels accountable to the nanny for the cost of furniture? She works for you. She\u2019s an employee, not your mother. If you can afford a nanny and also buy furniture, then bravo for you. And, by the way, where do you get expensive high-end furniture that is shipped with a price tag hanging on it?The essay seemed a bit wrongheaded and \u2014 like the message of a certain president \u2014 geared toward stirring up people who feel sorry for themselves and think their problems are other people\u2019s fault.To the Editor:I just read Rachel Sherman\u2019s essay about wealthy people who feel guilty because of their spending. May I suggest that they pay their nanny a real living wage, donate very generously to charities they believe in, and offer scholarships at their children\u2019s private school or for the children of their servants (maybe anonymously)? There is real need everywhere if one just looks around.As for guilt about buying $6 bread, perhaps ask the shop if you can pick up the unsold bread every day and take it to a food pantry. Then yours will taste lots better. You could also buy your nanny a loaf when you get yours, asking her what kind she prefers. There are endless things one can do to be part of the solution; no need to feel guilty.Let your children see how you care for others, and there will be no worry that they will grow up selfish and out of touch with the real world.To the Editor:Rachel Sherman draws just the right lesson from her fascinating interviews with spectacularly rich New Yorkers who just want to be seen as not so different from regular, normal, hard-working folk. She says this desire diverts their attention from the much more important issue, which is why we permit astronomical levels of inequality, and how we can change this.The fair tax system they envision raises their own taxes, a logical direction for these \u201ctraitors to their class,\u201d as they call themselves \u2014 and a constructive way to help rectify the unfairness of contemporary American inequality.The writer is a professor of philosophy at the University of Massachusetts Boston.To the Editor:Rachel Sherman writes that \u201cit is hard to know what they, as individuals, can do to change things.\u201d Are you kidding? How about giving all your excess away to provide direct care in the communities you live. Nothing is stopping you but you.\u201cBut I give to charity!\u201d That\u2019s not enough. That you live the way do while homelessness persists indicates a level of insincerity and selfishness that is hard to comprehend.Here\u2019s another solution: Use your money to lobby for higher personal income taxes solely on the rich that would be funneled into housing homeless populations, or providing infrastructure and services in poor neighborhoods.Try valuing something more than your acquisitive self-interests. Otherwise, \u201csocially liberal\u201d or not, you\u2019re greedy, plain and simple.JUSTIN WEBB, LOS ANGELESTo the Editor:One question conspicuously absent from this article\u2019s interviews is: What do you pay your nanny? Your driver? Your housekeeper? Your husband\u2019s assistant? Those interviewed don\u2019t hide the price tags from their household staff because they want to think of themselves as \u201cnormal\u201d \u2014 they do it because it keeps relevant data from their employees who might ask for a raise.Most Americans don\u2019t want the rich to make less \u2014 they want the poor and middle class to make more. They want public services (particularly education and health) to be adequately and fully funded. If that can happen without the 1 percent making any less, great. But if doing that means one less $5 million penthouse or private jet, so be it.If the 1 percent backed a $15 minimum wage in record numbers or free college tuition for all Americans, the stigma for this group would lessen greatly.In the meantime, please don\u2019t fill your column inches with the self-serving justifications of the selfish.To the Editor:Today, as Resource Generation\u2019s executive director, I work with an expansive, multiracial community of millennials in the top 10 percent of the economy. Our members have protested in the streets, spoken out at city council meetings, led their family\u2019s foundations, founded donor networks, and moved millions of dollars into organizations led by working-class and poor communities and people of color.Hiding or staying silent about our wealth and class empowers a deeply unjust and racist economic system. Don\u2019t be silent.IIMAY HO, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Rachel Sherman explores the reluctance of the affluent to discuss their wealth and suggests that some of this secrecy serves to hide the immorally large gap in wealth in this country. I agree. If, as she reports, the wealthy have debilitating anxiety surrounding their wealth, why not help them by leveling the playing field?I found that those who earned their money spent it freely and enjoyed it as a perk of their hard work. There was no pretense or gamesmanship. In comparison, those who inherited their wealth seemed to have an awkward relationship with it. They appeared to not enjoy spending it, and they were always pretending to be less well off.I believe that much of their discomfort comes from fear. Many of those who inherit lack the confidence that they are able to, or know how to, make money. Maybe we\u2019d have a greater chance of bridging the gap and redistributing wealth if we gave the extremely wealthy some assurance that they would be able to maintain an adequate lifestyle. If we can give everyone the peace of mind that comes with not having to worry about money, maybe we could inch toward bridging the gap.To the Editor:One phrase in this piece scared me: \u201cWhen we evaluate people\u2019s moral worth on the basis of where and how they live and work, we reinforce the idea that what matters is what people do, not what they have.\u201dIt was not that long ago in human history when the norm was to evaluate people\u2019s moral worth on the basis of what they have and not what they do. Those in possession of good names and fortunes were seen as morally good and the others (the poor, mostly) as somehow morally corrupt. I sincerely hope the author is not suggesting a return to that system, even if the labels are reversed (that is, poor = good, wealthy = bad).And yes, \u201cbeing astronomically wealthy\u201d is acceptable as long as that wealth was acquired honestly \u2014 no lying, cheating, robbing or otherwise abusing anyone. And some of those \u201castronomically wealthy\u201d got that way by inventing things that have improved millions of lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fall\u2019s Most Fascinating Art Show? The Met Trying to Fix Itself", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookMr. Campbell was neither. While a widely respected scholar of European tapestries, he was tasked by the Met\u2019s board with greatly increasing the museum\u2019s involvement with modern and contemporary art \u2014 which interested Mr. de Montebello not at all \u2014 and with expanding its audience and its digital presence. He fulfilled the trustees\u2019 desire for a director who came from inside the museum, as had several of his predecessors.On his watch, attendance soared and he was able to get the Met Breuer open and running, if not exactly at full creative capacity. But in the end, he seemed the victim of both his own misjudgments and those of the trustees, who approved his decisions and deserve much more of the blame for the debacle than they have so far been allotted.The Met, through Kenneth Weine, its spokesman, said a new director is expected to be named next year. For the moment the museum seems to be heading into smoother waters under the guidance of Daniel H. Weiss, 60, who became the museum\u2019s president in 2015, and, after a restructuring in June, its chief executive \u2014 meaning that the new director will report to him.This power shift has led many to assert that the best candidates won\u2019t be interested in the Met job. Dividing the responsibilities of the director, who sets a museum\u2019s curatorial mission, from those of the chief executive, who controls the purse strings, was a fashion in the 1980s and early \u201990s. But nearly everywhere it was set up, the director ultimately managed to consolidate authority \u2014 including Mr. de Montebello at the Met. Tales of miserable museum directors and philistine presidents still echo through the profession, like war stories.This is not the \u201990s; Mr. Weiss has the advantage of being trained in art history, which is rare among museum presidents, and big museums have long had too many moving parts for the top job not to be shared. But the museum professionals I spoke with were unanimous in the view that directors should have ultimate control of both mission and budget.While Mr. de Montebello viewed the splitting of the chief executive and director as generally \u201cnot right,\u201d he praised Mr. Weiss; he said he was certain that he would work well with anyone the trustees anointed and would know when to step back \u2014 and also when to bow out and leave the Met. Mr. de Montebello framed the whole process as a dignified rite of passage for the incoming director, even though it took him two-thirds of his own directorship to secure the chief executive title.Mr. Weiss seems to be restoring some financial sense to the Met, but he has helped hatch one really bad idea: a proposal that, if approved by the city, would allow the Met to charge out-of-state visitors a fixed $25 entrance fee instead of letting them pay what they wish, like everyone else.This could be a logistical nightmare. Those who retain the privilege of paying what they wish will still have to have their papers to get in \u2014 which papers has not been worked out. The jobs of ticket sellers and others at the museum\u2019s entrances will become more complicated and stressful; they will in all likelihood sometimes end up functioning a bit like border guards, adjudicating who has proper New York identification and who doesn\u2019t.The whole idea seems greedy and inappropriate. The museum already gets around $39 million a year from its gate \u2014 equal to the entire annual budget of the Brooklyn Museum \u2014 and tourists are one of the main bases of the city\u2019s economy. At a time of flagrant income inequality, it is especially unseemly for museums to view their audiences merely as income streams, and it seems out of character for a sanctuary city during a national rise in xenophobia. Mayor Bill de Blasio said of the proposal: \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Russian oligarchs paying more to get into the Met,\u201d as if all tourists were megawealthy.They are not. In 2015 the average overseas visitor to New York City had a household income of $82,400, according to NYC & Company, the city\u2019s official destination marketing arm. The average American visitor to New York City was a bit better off, with a household income of $118,800 in 2016. (Billionaires, by the way, rarely pay to visit museums: They get private tours that begin with their being swept past the ticket desk by a curatorial assistant.)The Met declined to comment. Norman Keyes, a Philadelphia Museum spokesman and friend of Ms. d\u2019Harnoncourt, said in an emailed statement: \u201cIt would come as no surprise that Anne d\u2019Harnoncourt might have been considered for this position. However, we have had no knowledge that such an offer was actually made and would be surprised in any case if she would have taken it. She was deeply committed to Philadelphia, and proved this time and again over a period of many years.\u201dThe larger point is that the Met could very well set out to appoint a woman and find a qualified one, just as, with Mr. Campbell, it seems to have set out to hire from within.Manhattan\u2019s four biggest, most prominent museums are due for a \u201csea change,\u201d as one observer said to me. Women already head several of the city\u2019s smaller institutions, including the Jewish Museum, the New Museum, the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Queens Museum, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and the not-so-small Brooklyn Museum.So now the Met\u2019s director chair is empty. Over the next five or so years, those at the Modern, the Guggenheim and the Whitney will also be opening up as their current occupants approach retirement age.If at least two of these four jobs do not go to a woman, this city will be shamed by its backwardness. The Modern, the Guggenheim and the Whitney, which were virtually willed into existence by women, have a chance to live up to their histories. The Met has a chance to lead the way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trapped by Their Own Lies", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt takes a truly terrible proposal to elicit such eloquent unanimity from organizations that are usually cautious to the point of stodginess. So how did Republicans come up with something that bad, and how did that bad thing get so close to becoming law? Indeed, it still has a chance of being enacted despite John McCain\u2019s \u201cno.\u201dThe answer is that Republicans have spent years routinely lying for the sake of political advantage. And now \u2014 not just on health care, but across the board \u2014 they are trapped by their own lies, forced into trying to enact policies they know won\u2019t work.Yet Republicans never had any idea how to fulfill that promise and meet that test, or indeed how to repeal the A.C.A. without taking insurance away from tens of millions. That is, they were lying about health care all along.And the base, both the grass roots and the big money, believed the lies. Hence the trap in which Republicans find themselves.The thing is, health care isn\u2019t the only issue on which lies are coming back to bite the liars. The same story is playing out on other issues \u2014 in fact, on almost every substantive policy issue the U.S. faces.The next big item on the G.O.P. agenda is taxes. Now, cutting taxes on corporations and the wealthy may be an easier political lift than taking health insurance away from 30 million Americans. But Republicans still have a problem, because they\u2019ve spent years posing as the party of fiscal responsibility, and they have no idea how to cut taxes without blowing up the deficit.As with health care, the party has masked its lack of good ideas with lies, claiming that it would offset lower tax rates and even reduce the deficit by eliminating unnamed loopholes and slashing unnamed wasteful spending. But as with health care, these lies will be revealed once actual legislation is unveiled. It\u2019s telling that Republicans are already invoking voodoo economics to justify their as-yet-unspecified tax plans, insisting that tax cuts will pay for themselves by leading to higher economic growth.At this point, however, few people believe them. The Bush tax cuts didn\u2019t create a boom; neither did the Kansas tax-cut \u201cexperiment.\u201d Conversely, the U.S. economy did fine after the 2013 Obama tax hike, as has the California economy since Jerry Brown raised state taxes. Party apparatchiks will no doubt engage in an orgy of Reaganolatry, but the broader public probably won\u2019t be moved by (false) claims about the wondrous results of tax cuts 36 years ago.So tax policy, like health care, will be hobbled by a legacy of lies.Wait, there\u2019s more.Foreign policy isn\u2019t usually a central concern for voters. Still, past lies have put the Trump administration in a box over things like the Iran nuclear deal: Canceling the deal would create huge problems, yet not canceling it would amount to an admission that the criticisms were dishonest.And soon the G.O.P. may even start to pay a price for lying about climate change. As hurricanes get ever more severe \u2014 just as climate scientists predicted \u2014 climate denial is looking increasingly out of touch. Yet donors and the base would react with fury to any admission that the threat is real, after all.The bottom line is that the bill for cynicism seems to be coming due. For years, flat-out lies about policy served Republicans well, helping them win back control of Congress and, eventually, the White House. But those same lies now leave them unable to govern.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$8 Million to Aid Poor North Koreans? South Korea and Japan Disagree", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Moon Jae-in of South Korea and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, talked on the phone on Friday, sharing their condemnation of North Korea\u2019s latest missile test and vowing to work together to bring about more sanctions against the country, Mr. Moon\u2019s office said.But Mr. Abe took issue with South Korea\u2019s plan to donate $8 million to two United Nations humanitarian programs in North Korea. He asked Mr. Moon to reconsider the timing of the aid, Mr. Moon\u2019s office said.On Thursday, South Korea announced plans to donate $4.5 million to help the World Food Program provide nutrition-rich supplies to North Korean hospitals and day care centers. It also plans to donate $3.5 million to United Nations Children\u2019s Fund projects that supply vaccines, medicine and malnutrition treatment to children and pregnant women.Yoshihide Suga, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, said on Thursday that providing aid for North Korea could undermine international efforts to pressure Pyongyang. But hours after the North\u2019s missile launch on Friday, South Korea reconfirmed its humanitarian aid plans.\u201cWe began considering humanitarian aid upon requests from the World Food Program and Unicef,\u201d Mr. Moon was quoted in a statement from his office as saying to Mr. Abe. \u201cIn principle, giving support for infants and small children and pregnant women should be handled separately from politics.\u201dRelations between South Korea and Japan are often tense and include historical disputes rooted in Japan\u2019s colonization of Korea. But under Washington\u2019s urging, the countries have worked together to address the growing military threats from North Korea, and recently signed an agreement to share military intelligence.Still, the approach of the new liberal South Korean leader differs from that of the conservative Japanese prime minister. When Mr. Moon took office in May, promising to push for dialogue with the North, there were concerns about clashes with Mr. Abe, who is widely considered a hawk on North Korea.As North Korea accelerated its nuclear and missile programs with a spate of tests in recent months, Mr. Moon joined President Trump and Mr. Abe in advocating tougher sanctions. But he also insists that the crisis must be resolved through negotiations.Mr. Trump has often cast doubt on Mr. Moon\u2019s approach. On Aug. 30, he said that \u201ctalking is not the answer\u201d in dealing with North Korea. Hours after the North conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, on Sept. 3, he criticized South Korea\u2019s \u201ctalk of appeasement with North Korea.\u201dJapan has been particularly alarmed by the last two missile tests because the projectiles flew over northern Japan before landing in the Pacific Ocean. The Japanese were told to take cover indoors or underground in case the missiles malfunctioned and crashed.On Saturday, North Korea confirmed that the missile was the Hwasong-12, the same intermediate-range ballistic missile it launched in its previous missile test, conducted on Aug. 29.Trump administration officials suggested Friday that their patience had worn thin over the North\u2019s repeated defiance of Security Council resolutions on missile and bomb testing.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is, they are continuing to be provocative, they are continuing to be reckless and at that point there\u2019s not a whole lot the Security Council is going to be able to do from there, when you\u2019ve cut 90 percent of the trade and 30 percent of the oil,\u201d Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters at a White House briefing.Later Friday at the United Nations Security Council, the 15 members held consultations on the Thursday missile launch and issued a statement that denounced it as \u201chighly provocative,\u201d but they took no further action.The latest sanctions would further isolate North Korea\u2019s economy, making more vulnerable its malnourished classes, including children, nursing mothers and older people, said Lee Eugene, a spokeswoman for South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Unification. South Korea plans to complete the timing and details of its humanitarian aid package next week.\u201cThey are for providing cereals and vaccines for these vulnerable classes,\u201d Ms. Lee said, referring to the United Nations aid programs. \u201cI don\u2019t think this violates the spirit of the United Nations.\u201dSuch an attitude differs sharply from that of South Korea\u2019s previous conservative governments, which drastically curtailed humanitarian aid for North Korea, accusing its government of squandering on nuclear weapons programs the resources it should spend on its impoverished people. But supporters of humanitarian aid say that United Nations\u2019 and other penalties were hurting poor North Koreans more than the country\u2019s leaders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Siemens and Alstom Form European Train Giant to Beat Chinese Competition", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Once, the merger of two iconic European companies might well have been derailed by regional political rivalries. But in the case of a deal between Siemens and Alstom, those concerns have receded in the face of a larger threat: China.The proposed merger of Europe\u2019s two largest train makers, one German and one French, demonstrated on Wednesday that economic imperatives are pushing the Continent together even as populist politicians try to pull it apart.The new company, to be called Siemens Alstom, is a response to intensifying competition from China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation, the state-backed train maker that has been winning contracts in the United States and emerging markets where mass transit is a fast-growing business.The company\u2019s success is emblematic of China\u2019s increasing economic power, which, combined with a more isolationist American foreign policy, is forcing European leaders to violate old taboos in order to improve the functioning of the European Union and its economy.\u201cThe message of this merger is that the European spirit is alive,\u201d Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of Siemens, said at a news conference in Paris on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s a powerful message in times that are marked by populism and nationalism and social and political divides.\u201dCompetition from China has already been a factor in other big European mergers. Last week, the German steel giant ThyssenKrupp said it would merge its European steel operations into a joint venture with Tata Steel. And last year, Nokia of Finland acquired Alcatel-Lucent, a French maker of telecommunications equipment, in part to address intense competition from China\u2019s Huawei.Other sectors, like shipbuilding or semiconductors, could also be ripe for mergers.The French president and other European leaders have grown increasingly alarmed that the E.U. is ceding control of advanced technology to China. In a recent speech in Athens, Mr. Macron called for strengthening the bloc into a \u201cpower that can face the U.S. and China.\u201dJust weeks ago, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany tightened rules to limit takeovers of German strategic assets, a move aimed at Beijing.Chinese competition was a driving factor in Mr. Macron\u2019s backing to seal a deal between Alstom and Siemens, despite outcries from political opponents in France that he was handing over a French icon to the Germans.\u201cThe big story here is the French willingness to let this happen,\u201d said Mikko Huotari, director of the international relations program at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. \u201cAlstom is one of the crown jewels of French industry.\u201dThe Siemens-Alstom deal is in part a bid that being bigger may be a better way to counter China Railway Rolling Stock, known as CRRC, which has grown into the world\u2019s largest and most competitive maker of railway equipment. The European company could yet grow further: Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s announcement, there had been speculation that Siemens could link up with Bombardier of Canada. On Wednesday, Mr. Kaeser of Siemens did not rule out that Bombardier could later become part of the combined company.Still, with sales of over $33 billion last year and 180,000 employees worldwide, CRRC is bigger than the train businesses of Siemens, Alstom and Bombardier combined.\u201cOf course CRRC is extremely strong, and has changed a little bit the picture of the market,\u201d Henri Poupart-Lafarge, the chief executive of Alstom, told reporters Wednesday.Mr. Poupart-Lafarge will be chief executive of the new company, which will have its headquarters in Paris. The Mobility Solutions unit of Siemens Alstom, which provides systems to control rail traffic and is more profitable than the unit that makes trains and streetcars, will be based in Berlin.The new company will have annual revenue of \u20ac15.3 billion, an order backlog valued at \u20ac61.2 billion and more than 62,000 employees worldwide.Alstom in particular is a symbol of national technological might for the French, with high-speed TGV trains racing across the countryside, and Eurostar trains connecting Paris to London in just over two hours through the Eurotunnel.While populist parties such as the National Front are hostile to closer political ties in the European Union, they are less likely to oppose corporate mergers that protect European companies from foreign competition.Pro-European political leaders like Mr. Macron have themselves not been averse to government intervention to protect jobs at home.As France\u2019s economy minister, he pushed through a government plan last year to order \u20ac630 million worth of new TGV trains \u2014 most of which were not calibrated to run on faster tracks \u2014 from an Alstom factory in the eastern town of Belfort to prevent hundreds of jobs there from moving to another plant.The Alstom deal with Siemens also reflects, however, a willingness to be flexible to protect broader French interests.On Tuesday, the country\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the French government welcomed the deal with Siemens, characterizing it as one that protected French jobs at Alstom.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Liz Alderman from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kim Jong-un and the Art of Tyranny", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "Supported byUnlike your father Kim Jong-il, who took the throne in late middle age and died 17 years later, you came to it before your 30th birthday. Yours is the longer, harder road, albeit with the same constant aim: to rule for life and die comfortably in your bed.Nothing strange in this. Tyranny is an art, the foremost requirement of which is to instill the appropriate sense of dread and awe. You \u2014 the fat kid with the boarding-school education and the basketball mania \u2014 had no chance of living without immediately demonstrating a relish for killing. Political murder in regimes like yours is always performance art.Another lesson for tyrants: You do not subjugate a people by taking everything from them. You subjugate them by giving them something they know you can take away. Desperate people aren\u2019t always obedient. Dependent people usually are.Similar logic applies to your foreign policy. The Americans hoped you would be one of two things when you came to power: the modernizer who had seen enough of the world to know how backward your own corner of it is; or the boy king whose incompetence would spell his own \u2014 and hopefully the regime\u2019s \u2014 demise.You\u2019ve proved them wrong on the first count. As for the second, it depends on how well you play your nuclear card. Your dad used a cycle of crisis and negotiation, cheat-and-repeat, to wheedle economic and diplomatic concessions and play for time \u2014 time that, in his case, was in short supply.But that\u2019s not an option for you. You need a 50-year solution to your strategic dilemmas, not just another set of piecemeal concessions from Seoul or Washington. That requires changing the game in East Asia by nudging America out. Whoever is helping you make such astonishing progress in your missile and nuclear programs clearly wants to use you to change the game, too.The tactics are straightforward. Persuade Americans you\u2019re capable of anything. Field missiles and warheads that can hold American cities at risk. Foment a sense of nonstop, apocalyptic, unsolvable crisis that, in time, exhausts American endurance and leverages isolationist instincts in the Trump administration. Drive every wedge you can between Washington and Seoul. Some you get for free: Who else but Donald Trump would think to start a trade war with Seoul in the midst of a nuclear crisis with Pyongyang?The man\u2019s a gift.Can it work? The Americans are pushing for more sanctions at the United Nations, but the Russians and Chinese seem to want to have none of it. An American retreat from Northeast Asia might eventually induce South Korea and Japan to acquire nuclear arsenals, but even then both countries would be likelier to mollify you with bribes than risk war over this or that crisis. Washington could try to impose stiff sanctions on Beijing for providing you with oil, but there\u2019s a limit to how effective sanctions can be against an economy the size of China\u2019s.Besides, you have ears. Behind Trump\u2019s \u201cfire and fury\u201d bluster you hear his secretary of defense underscore the perils of war, and his secretary of state disavow any interest in regime change for the North. Even in this administration, nobody knows how to do \u201ccrazy\u201d the way you do. They sound desperate for a deal.A troubling thought for you: What if the Americans really did succeed in pressuring the Chinese to cut you off? Or what if somebody found a Stuxnet-type solution to cripple your only operational refinery or blow up the pipeline through which you import crude from China?Your retaliatory options are few. You can\u2019t simply level Seoul with artillery: that would mean full-scale war and your prompt destruction. When you get down to it, you\u2019re making up in gumption what you lack in nearly every other resource.Banish your fears. Washington wouldn\u2019t dare. You\u2019re too useful to Beijing.

The Florida Keys, for instance, are not quite ready for tourism, though they are moving closer. Highway repairs have been made, and residents have returned to the islands. Puerto Rico, on the other hand, dodged Irma only to be undone by Maria.Below, a look at how the islands are faring.Puerto RicoThe United States territory, which has been in a recession for more than a decade, has looked to tourism as something of a bright spot. In the last year, the island has seen record numbers of cruise ship visitors, as well as record hotel occupancy rates. But Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 of Puerto Rico is predicting a long period of recovery. Cruise ports are currently closed, but, according to the tourism authority, most airlines are aiming to resume operations at the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport tomorrow (Sept. 23).Antigua and BarbudaBarbuda\u2019s hotels were also damaged, but because there were fewer than 100 rooms on the island, the overall effect on tourism is minimal, the Caribbean Tourism Organization said.Barbuda\u2019s population is much smaller than Antigua\u2019s, though its unspoiled land made it an attractive getaway. The actor Robert De Niro and James Packer, the Australian businessman, were in the process of transforming the island\u2019s former K Club Resort into the Paradise Found Nobu Resort when the hurricane struck.U.S. Virgin IslandsTourism, particularly from cruise ships, is an economic mainstay here. In a statement today, Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp called for \u201call hands on deck\u201d to speed up recovery efforts. St. John and St. Thomas took a beating from Irma, while St. Croix was largely untouched. Its Henry E. Rohlsen Airport was open, seaports were operational, and hotels said they were ready for guests. But then came Maria, and St. Croix was pummeled, especially the western and southwestern portions of the island. Power has been significantly damaged. The airport is still being assessed. And a 24-hour curfew is in place (with the exception of a few hours on Friday, so that people can pick up supplies from distribution centers).According to Central Intelligence Agency data, the economy of the Virgin Islands, while reliant on tourism, is a bit more diverse than other Caribbean islands. Additional sources of income include rum exports, trade and services. But first, the islands must rebuild.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long road to recovery,\u201d Gov. Mapp said. \u201cWe have to prepare ourselves mentally, manage our expectations realistically and we will get through it.\u201dBritish Virgin IslandsThese 60 islands east of Puerto Rico, which include Tortola, are also extremely dependent on tourism and benefit from visitors from the nearby United States Virgin Islands. That\u2019s unlikely to happen with St. Thomas and St. John in shambles. And the British Virgin Islands were themselves walloped by the storms. Sharon Flax-Brutus, the director of tourism, said in a statement that there are many homes without roofs, power outages and downed cellphone towers.AnguillaLuxury tourism is essential for this British dependency. However, some 90 percent of the electricity infrastructure was damaged, along with the main water supply, according to the Caribbean Tourism Organization. Humanitarian aid experts from the United Kingdom are assessing the situation. The chief minister, the Honorable Victor Banks, said the island plans to open for business before the all-important Christmas season.St. Kitts and NevisSt. Barth\u00e9lemySt. Martin / Sint MaartenTurks and Caicos IslandsCubaIrma was yet another setback for the Communist nation, where the burgeoning tourism industry has provided much-needed income. North-central Cuba, home to a number of resorts, suffered severe damage.\u201cThe storm hit some of our principal tourist destinations but the damage will be repaired before the high season,\u201d President Ra\u00fal Castro wrote in a public message, according to The Associated Press.Florida KeysThe island chain is temporarily closed to visitors as infrastructure repairs are being made. The first cruise ship port call is expected on Sept. 24 or Sept. 26. And American, Delta and Silver Airways have resumed commercial air service into Key West International Airport. Nonetheless, government officials are asking overnight visitors to postpone immediate vacation plans. There are curfews in place. Some residents are still without power. And the Key West International Airport and Florida Keys Marathon International Airport are being used as staging areas for relief supplies and personnel.An earlier version of this article, using information from the Caribbean Tourism Organization, misstated the reopening date of the Gansevoort Turks & Caicos hotel. It is scheduled to reopen Oct. 5, not Nov. 1.A picture caption on Sept. 24 with an article about Hurricane Irma\u2019s effect on Caribbean tourism, using information from The Associated Press, misidentified the area shown. It is a section of the British Virgin Islands, not the United States Virgin Islands.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Here Are the 10 National Monuments the Interior Department Wants to Shrink or Modify", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "Advertisement\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke has proposed that President Trump make changes to 10 national monuments, including Bears Ears in southern Utah, according to a memo addressed to the White House.The broad outlines of the document were confirmed on Monday by two Republican strategists who said they had been in discussions with the Interior Department about the recommendations. They spoke on the condition of anonymity.Mr. Zinke\u2019s recommendations are the latest development in a longstanding fight between those who view these sites as threats to economic development and those who see them as critical pieces of the country\u2019s conservation legacy.Here are the monuments designated for changes under Mr. Zinke\u2019s proposal.\n\tCurrent size: 1.35 million acres | \n\tDesignated by Barack Obama, 2016\nBears Ears, designated by President Barack Obama in December, has been particularly controversial because of its size. While it is supported by several tribal governments in and around Utah, including the Navajo Nation, it is opposed by state lawmakers who have fought for years to wrestle land from federal control.Mr. Zinke\u2019s report also recommends that Mr. Trump allow unspecified \u201ctraditional use\u201d of the land, which could include activities like drilling and mining. Native American tribes who lobbied for years to protect Bears Ears have vowed to fight the decision.Mr. Zinke also calls on Congress to declare a group of tribes as co-managers of the monument.\n\tCurrent size: 296,937 acres | \n\tDesignated by Barack Obama, 2016\nThe secretary recommends revising the monument\u2019s boundaries \u201cto protect historic water rights\u201d but does not specify new borders. He also recommends changing management to allow for \u201ctraditional use,\u201d which could include mining, drilling and increased grazing.\n\tCurrent size: 1.88 million acres | \n\tDesignated by Bill Clinton, 1996\nThe secretary suggests the president alter the boundaries of Grand Staircase-Escalante, an area protected by President Bill Clinton in 1996. The designation was particularly controversial because it halted a coal mine project that could have provided jobs and revenue in an impoverished part of the state. In Utah, many people trace the anger over Bears Ears back to the designation of Grand Staircase.In the report, Mr. Zinke says that monument rules have limited cattle grazing and access to recreation, and he recommends changes to allow for \u201ctraditional use.\u201d\n\tCurrent size: 112,000 acres | \n\tDesignated by Bill Clinton, 2000 | Enlarged by Barack Obama, 2017\nThis monument should be made smaller by removing land that could be farmed for timber, according to Mr. Zinke\u2019s recommendations.The Interior Department report says the monument designation has limited cattle grazing and would reduce federal timber revenue. It recommends the president allow for uses that could include timber harvesting and increased grazing.\n\tCurrent size: 316.9 million acres | \n\tDesignated by George W. Bush, 2009 | Enlarged by Barack Obama, 2014\nMr. Zinke recommends changing this marine monument to allow for commercial fishing.The monument was later greatly expanded by Mr. Obama.\n\tCurrent size: 8.61 million acres | \n\tDesignated by George W. Bush, 2009\nAccording to Mr. Zinke, this marine monument should also have its boundaries or proclamation changed to allow for commercial fishing. His report notes that fishing in this area is important to the economy of American Samoa.\n\tCurrent size: 87,563 acres | \n\tDesignated by Barack Obama, 2016\nMr. Zinke recommends changing this region\u2019s plans to protect future harvesting of timber.In June, Mr. Zinke signaled his support for the monument, despite vocal opposition to it from the state\u2019s Republican governor, Paul R. LePage.\n\tCurrent size: 496,330 acres | \n\tDesignated by Barack Obama, 2014\nThe Interior Department report notes that the monument\u2019s current management could prevent ranchers from running livestock in the region, and suggests altering it to protect \u201ctraditional use,\u201d which could include cattle grazing.\n\tCurrent size: 242,555 acres | \n\tDesignated by Barack Obama, 2013\nMr. Zinke suggests changes to protect \u201ctraditional use,\u201d and the report notes that road closures have discouraged ranchers from renewing their grazing permits within the monument. The report also suggests that Congress should authorize tribal management of designated areas within the monument.\n\tCurrent size: 3.14 million acres | \n\tDesignated by Barack Obama, 2016\nMr. Zinke calls on the president to alter the monument\u2019s proclamation to allow for commercial fishing. Current management prohibits this, with the exception of red crab and American lobster fisheries.\u201cThese habitats,\u201d he noted, \u201care extremely sensitive to disturbance from extractive activities.\u201dIt is not clear what Mr. Trump will do with Mr. Zinke\u2019s recommendations.If the president decides to shrink any of the monuments, that decision is likely to be met with lawsuits from environmental groups.Additional reporting by Lisa Friedman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Did You Read, Watch or Listen to in The Times This Week?", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationWhat got your attention in The Times this week?_________Many, many people work their whole life to get into a good college. If this was you, think back to those years of your life. If it wasn\u2019t, imagine it. Laboring away late at night. Stressing out for years about upcoming tests, homework that is due soon and the grades you will get for it. Things that don\u2019t really matter. Hours upon hours of extracurricular activities that were done just for a college application. And then you do it. You get into a good college. You accept. You go out to celebrate. Your life is finally falling into place.And then, the unimaginable happens. Your offer gets taken back, rescinded, and you\u2019ve already rejected other offers. Everything you\u2019ve worked for. Everything you\u2019ve struggled for. It\u2019s all just gone. Every puzzle piece that had already clicked into place fell out again. And than you ask yourself one question. Over and over and over again. \u201cWhy?\u201dIrvine clearly should have been aware of the numbers of students accepted, instead of making hard working students distraught. Every time something like this happens, colleges, which are meant to be the path of a good career, are just tearing apart a student\u2019s hope that they had and replacing it with anguish.\u201dWhen I\u2019m rich ...\u201d is a phrase I spent a lot of my childhood repeating. It was usually followed by the amount of houses I would have, what brands of cars would be in the garage and how many millions I would be making. So isn\u2019t it ironic that once some of us do make that money that we\u2019ve dreamed of earning, we feel some sort of shame for it?... If we stop bashing people about being upper-class or \u2018privileged\u2019, maybe they\u2019ll become less alienated and more open to sharing their wealth with those who have had fewer opportunities in life. I dislike that the word \u2018privilege\u2019 is increasingly used in a negative manner ... In a capitalist economy, there are always going to be sizable inequalities in income. I feel that we should accept this, and try to reduce how taboo the topic of money is in general, so we can work together to create a better society._________Getting rid of Dreamers would not only damage America\u2019s moral high ground in the world, but it would adversely impact the economy and create misery.The institution of the Deferred action for Childhood Arrivals program or DACA, by President Obama in 2012 was an action that showed that the U.S. is a country that respects and loves its immigrants. Its rollback is a black mark on our country\u2019s history, and one we have to erase soon. The beneficiaries of the DACA program pose no threat or harm to otherwise legal citizens. Only 0.0026 percent of beneficiaries have a criminal record. However removing DACA and therefore their work permits hurts many state economies. $11.6 billion of California\u2019s G.D.P. are generated by people given work permits by the DACA. Taking these permits away damages the U.S. economy greatly. DACA was a good program that should have been expanded into law. Sadly fear mongering and hate pose a serious challenge to the lives of those who only wish to make a better life for themselves.I find it ironic that America, a country built from immigrants, wants to remove them from it\u2019s borders ... These people aren\u2019t just \u201cimmigrants.\u201d They are real people who contribute to the American society, culture and work force, and deserve to be treated as so.Being Mexican, my family members show more love and great fullness for this country than most Americans do because we had to fight and work to be able to stay in this country, and for the U.S. to make us scared of being deported is sad ... What makes this topic tough is that the white and foreign eyes will never see each other because [many] have not seen the other side of having to work night and day in a hot field, earning low wages [under] horrible living arrangements. But they do all that to get their family to a better place.While I am opposed to the mass deportation of people solely because their parents made a mistake, I have to say that these types of radical measures are only being brought to the table because Democrats supported blanket amnesty for many illegal immigrants, including those that have committed violent crimes. We need to have tougher border security, and that includes building a wall, but I think that bringing an end to \u201cDreamers\u201d is the wrong start.Ending DACA might not be best solution but DACA wasn\u2019t a good solution either. ...Those under DACA currently could be grandfathered in, and a new program specifically for them could be put in place where they could take classes and get actual citizenship.\u201cI wonder how long I have to sit here before somebody remembers to give me a treat?\u201d.... (sigh.) .... \u201cI wonder if anybody knows I like pizza?\u201d .... (sigh.) \u201cPepperoni, sausage and extra cheese would be fine. But no onions, artichokes, mushrooms or anchovies, please.\u201d .... (sigh.) ..... \u201cO.K., I am willing to compromise on the anchovies....\u201dI\u2019m gonna be SO good. SO good. They\u2019re gonna be SO proud of me.What a bore, this headband makes me look so \u201870s..._________Marileidy 4D:My summer was emotionally difficult since I got the news that I could not graduate because of a point that I missed on the Regents [exam] ... I used to see the good side of the things, but this time I felt that all my world was coming down. I could not move on at the same time that all my classmates were ... The summer taught me that things are not always going to be how I want, and that hard work does pay off.Andrea 4D:This summer was the summer that I moved to Brooklyn [from Spain]. Sometimes I feel very alone here, but then I think how many things I have learned to do by myself in this city and I feel so proud of me.Robert 4D:This summer I taught how to be responsible. I got a job this summer and had to be prepared, on time, and know how to speak with customers. One day I made a mistake with a client, and he started to scream at me. Then I felt stressed and I got angry. After that I left that job. This summer I learned that I cannot control my emotions when I get angry.Kerly 4D:For first time I applied for a job in this country, as a cashier at McDonalds, and grandly, they called me for the job. When that happened, I had too much mixed feelings. I was nervous, anxious, happy, and excited, because this job will be my first experience as a worker.Mohammed 4DI worked at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts 25 hours a week. It was very difficult for me because I was a new employee and I was so frustrated that I didn\u2019t know what to do. But as days passed I started learning little by little.This summer I had the experience of going to a music camp at the University of Michigan. It was a month long and very intensive. We practiced our instruments for most of the day and there was rarely time for fun activities. However, I still had a lot of fun because everyone in the camp lived in the same hallway of a dorm so it was like a community. There were a lot of interesting and funny people there, and after about a week we all seemed like best friends. Also, we only got our phones at night, and while that sounds bad, it helped me realize that I can be more productive and have more fun without a phone. Overall, it was a great summer experience._________Here are some excerpts from comments we found especially thoughtful:Tatianna Rodriguez:I\u2019m horrible at doing anything that involves being an \u201cadult\u201d, causing fear to erupt in me because I don\u2019t know how to cook anything without it tasting like complete feces and thinking that\u2019ll just die from starvation due to me being completely insensible about cookery.The scariest part about becoming an adult to me is that I have no idea if I want to go to college or not.For my age and state in life, I\u2019d say I\u2019m particularly emotionally competent. One of my strongest skills is knowing myself and how I feel, and I\u2019m good at communicating these feelings to others. My social skills are fairly decent as well.On the other hand, I have very much dealt with anxiety and social anxiety, so it is really hard for me to do basic \u201cadult\u201d things at times. I\u2019ve struggled with the simplest actions such as asking somebody in a restaurant where the bathroom is.As a high school senior, I\u2019ve noticed that social anxiety is very common with my peers. From something as big as talking to the entire class to something as little as a group project, people tend to keep quiet when all eyes are on them ...I myself am worried that I\u2019ll be judged by those listening so I tend to not speak out so often. I used to always have my parents order for me in restaurants and have found myself facing my fears because I know no one will really focus on my mistakes as much as I do.I realize a lot of these tasks would make me anxious and I already know of my anxiety being very apparent and obvious with some of the things I do. I am a sophomore in high school and I find that I feel I lack in self-confidence and I have a hard time speaking my mind in front of people (excluding my close friends).Being a senior in high school makes you feel like you\u2019re becoming an adult and personally I feel like I have many of the skills to become one, but I\u2019m more mentally afraid of growing up...Becoming an adult has so many responsibilities connected with it I'm just not sure I can handle at age 17. For example, getting your paycheck and figuring out what you need to buy and pay such has food, car payments, housing and just having spending money.Lists, guidelines, and other norms of being a socially acceptable definition of an adult are things that in my opinion just make adulthood seem more foreboding or more mysteriously detrimental than it really is.I am definitely ready for adulthood. I don\u2019t really rely on anyone else but myself anymore. I go and buy my own things, I pay my own insurance, I don\u2019t ask my parents for money, I work by myself doing construction, part owner in a landscaping and lawn mowing company, and I plow my own driveways in the winter. I didn\u2019t rely on my parents to pay for my truck and I didn\u2019t rely on them to buy the plow that I got for my truck.I hate being babied and shown everything, I like to figure out things for myself. I am good with my finances, I don\u2019t spend my money on stupid things or when I feel pressured to. I am in no way a perfectionist but I know that I have the ability to get things done and get them done well. Due to these reasons I believe that I am ready to enter life as an adult.I would\u2019ve added a good amount of personality traits that you need to be a successful adult to this list. For instance, humility; If you aren\u2019t humble, your chances of a strong social life will be slim. If you lack the willingness to be taught you\u2019ll never improve as a person, and if you lack open-mindedness toward the opinions of others you\u2019ll never see outside of the box you\u2019ve created for yourself._________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quake Threatens to Cause Flight From Mexico City\u2019s Hip Neighborhoods", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 When Fernando Bustos moved to Mexico City years ago, he had no doubt about where to live. The Roma and Condesa neighborhoods \u2013 sidewalk cafes, hip restaurants, thriving art and music, storied architecture \u2013 had captured his imagination.But the earthquake last Tuesday revived that reality. Once again Roma and Condesa were among the hardest hit, and now Mr. Bustos, 34, is reluctantly planning to move from the area he adores.\u201cIt\u2019s terrible to realize that everything was destroyed where you live,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite how much we love this area, it\u2019s not secure.\u201dRoma and Condesa, neighboring bastions of Mexican stylishness, are once again in an existential crisis, and residents are pondering whether living in them is worth the risk.Some of the biggest fans of Roma and Condesa worry that the Tuesday earthquake, which killed at least 286 people in Mexico, could slow if not reverse the ascendant popularity of the neighborhoods.\u201cNow and the next couple of years, it\u2019s going to be a factor,\u201d said Eduardo Aizenman, co-owner of El P\u00e9ndulo bookstore and cafe, which became an engine of Condesa\u2019s post-1985 renaissance. \u201cI am sure many people will be putting their properties in the market.\u201dRoma and Condesa were largely developed in the early 20th century for the city\u2019s elite, who luxuriated in grand villas built along tree-lined boulevards. By midcentury, the area\u2019s popularity among the wealthy had begun to wane, with many residents moving to increasingly fashionable areas, like Polanco and Las Lomas, or to newly developed suburbs, like Ciudad Sat\u00e9lite.The 1985 earthquake accelerated this flight. Businesses closed, property values plunged, crime jumped.Mr. Aizenman, 52, moved to Condesa in 1991, drawn to the cheap rents and atmosphere of possibility, even if it was an entertainment wasteland. \u201cThere was nothing here,\u201d he recalled.He opened El P\u00e9ndulo two years later. Restaurants, bars, art galleries and boutiques followed. Notable properties were restored. Real estate values leapt. Condesa was back on top.While Mexico City\u2019s older central districts are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes because they sit on the soft ground of a residual lake bed, Roma and Condesa are no more at risk than other central neighborhoods, said Gerardo Su\u00e1rez, a senior researcher in the Seismology Department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.And, indeed, other areas in the city were also badly hit.Still, the memories of 1985 combined with this week\u2019s trauma have shaken the once-unbridled love of the two neighborhoods.\u201cMany residents feel a big distrust because it\u2019s evident that it\u2019s not a safe place to live,\u201d said Mr. Bustos, a philosophy professor at An\u00e1huac University, whose apartment building was damaged enough to force the evacuation of all the residents.This feeling is not new to Javier Carmona, 71. He was born and raised in Roma and lived there until the 1985 earthquake, when, horrified by the destruction around him, he fled the neighborhood.He moved back in 2004 to be closer to relatives. But Tuesday\u2019s earthquake reawakened old emotions.\u201cIt scared me a lot, it was terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe house suffered only minor damage, but we definitely want to get out of here. I no longer want to live here anymore.\u201dEven Mr. Aizenman, who still lives in Condesa and has his offices there, is weighing the relative merits of different neighborhoods in light of the earthquake. The tremors on Tuesday caused such damage to the building that houses his offices that he evacuated his staff and is now looking for new office space.\u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d he said of the earthquake. \u201cWhen you\u2019re here to experience the earth\u2019s shaking,\u201d he continued, pausing as he recalled the experience, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dBut he also wondered aloud whether the neighborhood had too much momentum for the earthquake to reverse its popularity.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any turning around,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much to give up: the walkability, the sharing of creativity, the creative industries, people who are doing things. Foreigners love living here.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re in awe of the opportunities,\u201d he said, \u201cand that kind of puts aside the risks.\u201dMany other residents and business owners have made a similar calculation and redoubled their commitment to the neighborhoods.\u201cI\u2019m from here, I\u2019m staying here, I\u2019m dying here,\u201d he declared.The threat of earthquakes was part of making a home in such an ideal location, said Lorena del Rayo, an astrologer who has lived in Roma Norte since she was a teenager and has no intention of leaving.On Thursday, she was visiting her mother, who still lives in the house she bought when property values plunged after the 1985 earthquake. The roof of the century-old house partly collapsed during Tuesday\u2019s earthquake, and rubble and broken furniture were heaped on the sidewalk.\u201cIt\u2019s the duality,\u201d Ms. del Rayo, 40, explained.She held out cupped hands, as if weighing two objects.\u201cWe live close to everything, the economy is good,\u201d she said, gesturing with her right palm. Then she nodded to her left palm and lowered her voice: \u201cBut the earthquakes.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Operation Car Wash Is Exposing Political Crime in Brazil", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld ReviewBrazil, a nation rich in natural resources, fertile lands and cultural diversity, has struggled for decades with underdevelopment. Some blame it on the \u201ccusto Brasil,\u201d or \u201cBrazil cost\u201d \u2014 the accumulated price, in cash, time and other resources, of doing business here \u2014 pointing to the weight of bureaucracy, high taxes and poor investment. Others cite insufficient investments in infrastructure, science, technology and education.The root cause of our struggle, however, is a decay of democracy in the face of systemic, institutional corruption. Our representative system has been so far removed from its raison d\u2019\u00eatre that the will to govern has been replaced by the goal of remaining in power.Our governmental structure is coalition-based, which makes it vulnerable to corruption. With dozens of parties vying to form a majority in Congress, elections are bloated and prohibitively expensive. Gaining power allows a political party the chance to appoint executives at state-run companies. Executives receive kickbacks from contractors, and some of that cash is funneled back to the party.It is a self-perpetuating cycle: Fraudulent elections generate public administrations that promote corruption, and are operated by politicians who create electoral reforms to grant themselves more and more power, resources and control. As a result, Brazil\u2019s main political parties, which have taken uninterrupted turns in authority for decades, are focused not on governing the country, but on building alliances to stay in power.Ministers, advisers, senators, representatives and even members of the judicial branch collaborate with private interests to make decisions about public investments and push for the approval of bills that disproportionately benefit those in power.Some of Brazil\u2019s largest economic groups are, in fact, artificial empires built on tax exemptions and loans from the Brazilian Development Bank, and their failures have shaken the foundations of the country\u2019s economy.Development resources intended to improve quality of life and reduce social inequality have been drained to enrich certain groups and companies that have been hailed as \u201cnational champions,\u201d and to finance the political party system. Through misguided economic policy and the misappropriation of public resources, they have cost more than 14 million people their jobs.Operation Car Wash also serves as a warning for the business sector and its deep-rooted practice of influencing government decisions. Businesses engaged in corruption can now be dealt with by the justice system, which will free us up to create an environment in which competition can promote efficiency and adequate public works and services.This tsunami sweeping Brazil will allow space for a new political paradigm founded on the principle that justice means justice for all. We\u2019re not there yet, but operation Car Wash is working, as evidenced by the reaction of the political establishment along the entire ideological spectrum.A significant number of political, party and business leaders are using all their assets to keep things as they are. There are alliances between former opponents aimed at stopping the investigation, and there are attempts to impose rules for the 2018 general election that would guarantee continuity for those currently in power. Operation Car Wash\u2019s main task force was even shut down in July, leaving the investigation to be absorbed by a larger anti-corruption division with a more limited scope.Our hope of seeing Brazil rejuvenated remains in the hands of the press, the judicial branch and the people. With a lot of pain, we are learning how to create effective laws and institutions. The first big test will be the 2018 elections, when voters will be able to conduct the biggest \u201cwash\u201d ever seen in Brazilian politics \u2014 when they will have a chance to clean out corruption and open the door to a reconstruction of the country\u2019s institutions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Aren\u2019t Paychecks Growing? A Burger-Joint Clause Offers a Clue", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 The American fast food industry is built on two pillars: cheap hamburgers, and cheap labor.As economists try to understand why wages have stagnated across the country\u2019s economy, they are examining the cheap labor part of the equation closely. A few have zeroed in on an obscure clause buried in many fast-food franchise agreements as a possible contributor to the problem.Some of fast-food\u2019s biggest names, including Burger King, Carl\u2019s Jr., Pizza Hut and, until recently, McDonald\u2019s, prohibited franchisees from hiring workers away from one another, preventing, for example, one Pizza Hut from hiring employees from another.The restrictions do not appear in a contract that employees sign, or even see. They are typically included in a paragraph buried in lengthy contracts that owners of fast-food outlets sign with corporate headquarters.Yet the provisions can keep employees tied to one spot, unable to switch jobs or negotiate higher pay. A lack of worker mobility has long been viewed as contributing to wage stagnation because switching jobs is one of the most reliable ways to get a raise.Defenders of the practice argue that the restaurants spend time and money training workers and want to protect their investment. But two lawsuits, filed this year against McDonald\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr.\u2019s parent company, CKE Restaurants Holdings, contend that such no-hire rules violate antitrust and labor laws.McDonald\u2019s said its policies did not violate any laws. The company recently removed the language from its contract, and declined to say whether the lawsuits had played a role in that decision. CKE declined to comment.The no-hire rules affect more than 70,000 restaurants \u2014 or more than a quarter of the fast-food outlets in the United States \u2014 according to Alan B. Krueger, an economist at Princeton University and a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration who examined agreements for 40 of the nation\u2019s largest fast-food companies.The provisions, he said, were \u201cubiquitous\u201d among the companies and appeared to exist mainly to limit both competition and turnover, which can keep labor costs low.The restrictions are different from what are known as noncompete agreements \u2014 clauses in employee contracts that keep an employee from jumping to a rival. Such agreements are typically described as a means of preventing employees from bringing trade secrets to a competitor.\u201cI think it\u2019s very hard to make the argument that noncompetitive agreements are necessary for low-educated, low-wage workers because they have trade secrets,\u201d Professor Krueger said. \u201cThis practice does have the potential to restrict competition and significantly influence pay.\u201dThe fast-food industry has been one of the biggest sources of job growth since the recession. More than 4.3 million people are now dipping fryer baskets and flipping hamburgers, a 28 percent increase since 2010 that is almost double the increase in the overall labor market, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.But the average fast-food worker takes home just $300 a week before taxes, about a third of what the average private sector worker earns.Other industries also forbid franchisees from hiring one another\u2019s workers. The practice is more common when turnover rates are high, according to research by Professor Krueger and Orley C. Ashenfelter, who is also a professor at Princeton and, like Professor Krueger, a well-known labor economist. Health and fitness companies like Curves or Anytime Fitness, and maintenance services like Jiffy Lube have similar rules.Representatives for Curves and Jiffy Lube did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Anytime Fitness said in an email that employees \u201cfrequently move from one gym to another when professional growth opportunities arise and it has not created undue challenges or resentment\u201d among its franchisees.Professor Krueger and Professor Ashenfelter examined 156 companies in 21 industries, selecting businesses with more than 500 franchise stores in the United States. More than half of the companies imposed some kind of restriction, according to their 2016 franchise disclosure documents, an annual financial filing.The policies were most common in the fast-food industry: Of the 40 such companies covered in the report, 32 imposed some kind of hiring restriction, including Burger King, Domino\u2019s and Pizza Hut. Workers were often not allowed to take new positions without their bosses\u2019 written permission. (Several of the companies surveyed restricted only hiring between franchiser and franchisee.)Domino\u2019s declined to comment. Burger King and Pizza Hut did not respond to requests for comment.The report\u2019s tally also included McDonald\u2019s, which for at least 30 years had prohibited franchisees from hiring one another\u2019s workers. That changed in March, a spokeswoman said, when the company informed the owners of its more than 11,000 franchise locations that it would no longer enforce the rule.The rules have attracted more scrutiny as a result of the two suits challenging their legality.The McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman, Andrea Abate, said in an email, \u201cWe are confident that the terms of our franchise agreements, past and present, are appropriate and legal.\u201dMcDonald\u2019s abandoned the rule a month after CKE was sued over its version of the provision. But several fast-food experts said the timing could be coincidental because restaurant companies often try to distance themselves from their franchisees to avoid joint liability if the franchisees are sued.The suit against McDonald\u2019s was filed later on behalf of an employee who worked at a franchise in Apopka, Fla., during the time when the rule was in effect.Andrew Puzder, the former CKE chief executive who was President Trump\u2019s original pick for labor secretary, once told Congress that franchisees are \u201cnot a division, subsidiary or alter ego of CKE, but are truly independent small businessmen and businesswoman.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re either going to have to say, \u2018We are separate from our franchisees,\u2019 or \u2018We\u2019re one integrated entity,\u2019\u201d said Michael Rubin, a lawyer for former McDonald\u2019s workers who are suing the company separately over accusations of wage violations.The suits against CKE and McDonald\u2019s, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and Illinois District Court, seek class-action status on behalf of tens of thousands of workers like Leinani Deslandes, the plaintiff in the case against McDonald\u2019s. She worked at a McDonald\u2019s in Apopka, Fla., from 2009 to 2016.In a recent interview at a Panera Bread in Altamonte Springs, Fla., she described her employment experience at McDonald\u2019s and the reasons for the suit.When her shift as a manager ran so late that she missed the last bus home, Ms. Deslandes said, she would walk the five miles home thinking about the next day\u2019s tasks \u2014 getting her children ready for school and helping her husband get off to work on time \u2014 and daydreaming about what she wanted for her own life: a smartphone that could play music as she walked, or, better yet, a car.She said she thought she was on track for a promotion, and imagined that one day she might own her own franchise.\u201cSomebody that could be doing your fries tomorrow, in 10 years, they could be running six or seven McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Deslandes said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I stayed so long.\u201dShe was promoted to department manager, she said, and the next step would have been for her to fly to Illinois to attend \u201cHamburger University,\u201d where McDonald\u2019s runs its management-training programs. But the training was canceled when she got pregnant, she said in her suit, and the promotion never came.She was frustrated, she said, and tried to take a job at a different McDonald\u2019s, but was blocked because of the no-hiring rule. \u201cThat\u2019s what hurt the most,\u201d she said.Ms. Abate, the McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman, said the company disputed the accusations in the suit, but declined to answer specific questions about it.Representatives for the franchisee of the outlet where Ms. Deslandes worked, Bam-B Enterprises, declined to comment on the details of her suit. Bam-B is not named as a defendant in the case.Turnover rates are high in the industry, and maintaining a talented work force requires investing in training and recruitment. Prohibiting franchisees from hiring one another\u2019s workers protects that investment, said Stuart Hershman, a lawyer with the firm DLA Piper. He estimated that he had drafted hundreds of franchise agreements, many of which contained some kind of recruitment prohibition.\u201cThere has never been, ever, any intention, by drafting this type of provision, to restrict employee mobility, restrict wage competition, or suppress employee pay,\u201d Mr. Hershman said.There is no good measure for how often workers are restricted from changing jobs, and some franchisees interviewed by The New York Times were not aware that their ability to hire was restricted. It is also difficult to gauge what impact the hiring rule has on wages. But the prevalence of no-hiring agreements in franchise contracts suggests that \u201cmany employers do try to combine to restrict competition in the labor market,\u201d Professor Krueger and Professor Ashenfelter wrote.\u201cIt might help explain a recent puzzle in the U.S. job market,\u201d the two wrote in their report. \u201cUnemployment has reached a 16-year low and job openings are at an all-time high, yet wage growth has remained surprisingly sluggish.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Talks Tough on China and Mexico, but Trade Actions Hit Canada", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 While President Trump has reserved his harshest words on trade for Mexico and China, Canada, one of America\u2019s closest allies, has emerged as a major pressure point on trade, with the countries\u2019 leaders trading barbs over lumber, dairy products, airplanes, and even magazine paper.The focus on Canada reflects the complexities that Mr. Trump faces in remaking the global rules of trade.He has threatened punitive tariffs on imported goods and vowed to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. He has promised to level the playing field with China and Mexico.But aggressively targeting China could disrupt the global supply chain, raising costs for American manufacturers. It could also inflame geopolitical tensions at a time when Washington needs Beijing\u2019s help in dealing with North Korea.Relations with Mexico are already beleaguered over clashes on immigration, while taking on trade often means taking on exports from plants owned by American corporations.The sheer volume of trade with Canada makes it an easy target for actions against individual companies or industries. And the economy\u2019s relatively small size, along with its economic and military dependence on the United States, gives Canada little strength for punching back.The Bombardier case is just one in a long series of trade-related actions. Canada is rehashing the North American Free Trade Agreement, throwing the future of its businesses and workers into flux. The United States has imposed duties on softwood lumber, one of Canada\u2019s most iconic exports, while weighing measures that would clamp down on Canadian exports of steel, aluminum and solar panels.\u201cCanadians view this as poking Canada in the eye,\u201d said Jerry Dias, the head of Unifor, the country\u2019s large private sector union, which represents some Bombardier workers. \u201cCanadians who view the U.S. as our natural ally are now wondering what\u2019s going on.\u201dThe trade case against Bombardier, which was brought by the American aerospace giant Boeing, is typically a dry and routine affair. It centers on government subsidies and accusations of unfairly low sales prices.But now trade is politically charged.Speaking from the conclusion of the talks, Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister and the lead minister on the Nafta talks, said the country would \u201cfight very, very hard\u201d when it came to Bombardier. Ms. Freeland said she had raised the issue with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative.\u201cI do want to remind Canadians that aggressive actions and aggressive decisions by commerce are nothing new,\u201d she added, a reference to the United States Commerce Department, which imposed the tariff on the Bombardier aircraft. \u201cThey are certainly familiar to us from the softwood lumber dispute.\u201dAfter an official visit to China, Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, told a group of reporters in Hong Kong on Wednesday that Boeing had initiated the case, not the Trump administration. But he nonetheless emphasized that it was emblematic of the president\u2019s aggressive posture on trade.Mr. Ross said the administration had been \u201cmuch more enforcement oriented\u201d than its predecessors. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that trend continues,\u201d he said.For Bombardier, the decision to impose tariffs of more than 200 percent on the CSeries aircraft creates huge uncertainty for a company that was betting on the product to improve its fortunes.The duties could be increased or ultimately eliminated in a series of rulings in the coming months. But they go into force immediately, tripling the jet\u2019s price in the United States and most likely chilling future sales in the market it was meant to serve.Such trade actions could have a spillover effect. Bombardier estimates that work related to the new airliner will eventually create 22,000 jobs at American suppliers, in states like Kansas and West Virginia. The company employs 4,300 aerospace workers in Northern Ireland and 17,000 in Canada.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they are doing what they are doing in the United States, but I\u2019m worried that it might hit us here,\u201d said Nathalie Leclerc, a bartender in Montreal, Bombardier\u2019s hometown. \u201cBombardier might cut jobs and production.\u201dWhile international trade rules limit Canada\u2019s ability to retaliate, Mr. Trudeau has been trying to use a military deal to influence Boeing. The prime minister has repeatedly suggested that Canada would not close a 6.4 billion Canadian dollar ($5.2 billion) deal to buy F-18 fighter jets from Boeing if it continued with its Bombardier complaint.There are currently no active trade cases in Canada involving American imports. But the United States administration is considering a range of actions that could ensnare Canadian exports.Along with cases against Canadian lumber and Bombardier, the United States has imposed tariffs for illegal subsidies on magazine paper. It is also weighing sweeping restrictions on Canadian exports of steel and aluminum, as well as solar products.The Bombardier ruling heightened tensions at the Nafta talks. Even before the decision, Canadian officials already appeared frustrated by American negotiators\u2019 failure to put forward specific text on some of the president\u2019s proposals.\u201cWithout a formal position tabled, we can\u2019t respond to it,\u201d Ms. Freeland said.Mr. Lighthizer said that the United States had discussed all of its goals with Canada and Mexico and was preparing in the next round to propose specific wording on more difficult topics, like requiring more goods to be made in the United States.Chad Bown, a trade analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the Trump administration may see conflicts like those over airplanes and softwood lumber as additional points to be traded away at the negotiating table.\u201cThe Trump administration may see this as a type of leverage in Nafta,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they have a potential bargaining chip that they didn\u2019t have before to try to extract something from Canada.\u201dBut the disputes combined with Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist approach may be prompting questions in Canada about the value of trade deals.The frustrations go back decades.When Canada entered a trade agreement with the United States in 1989 that was expanded later into Nafta, the lumber dispute was also active. The Conservative government at the time promised that the deal would free Canada from such trade cases. It ended up with a system known in Nafta as Chapter 19, which allows parties to appeal the type of duties that were imposed on Bombardier.As part of the current negotiations, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that measure. Given the Bombardier outcome, Canada\u2019s opposition is likely to become more entrenched.At the restaurant in a Husky gas station in Williams Lake, British Columbia, a lumber town, there was resignation and irritation about going through the trade dispute all over again.\u201cThe softwood lumber deal? That\u2019s a Trump thing,\u201d said Charlie Grover, who drives a lumber truck. \u201cWe know that they won\u2019t win in court. So eventually we\u2019ll be back to no tariff.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of aerospace workers who work for Bombardier in Canada. It is 17,000, not 24,340. An earlier correction in this space also misidentified that work force\u2019s company. It is Bombardier, not Boeing.Reporting was contributed by Zachary Kamel from Montreal, Dan Levin from New York, Dene Moore from Williams Lake, British Columbia, and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

Trump talked tough on China, accusing the world\u2019s second-largest economy of stealing jobs from Americans. On Wednesday, Wilbur Ross, his commerce secretary, echoed that sentiment, calling for a dramatic shift in the countries\u2019 trade relationship.Mr. Ross was speaking after a visit to Beijing, where he met with Premier Li Keqiang and other finance and economic officials, as part of an effort to lay the diplomatic foundations for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to China this year.\u201cWe do need major change, and I hope and I believe that we\u2019ve made that clear to the Chinese government, because the relationship is too lopsided at present,\u201d Mr. Ross said in a media briefing.During his meetings with officials in Beijing, Mr. Ross said he raised concerns about the imbalance of trade and investment relations, the need to protect intellectual property and lower tariffs.\u201cThe most important thing is better market access both for companies operating there physically and for companies exporting there,\u201d Mr. Ross said on Wednesday. He added that the Trump administration wanted to see less protectionist behavior, calling China \u201cone of the most protectionist\u201d countries in the world.\u201cWe can understand that they would desire self-sufficiency and if the way they get there is through a free and open level playing field, and it\u2019s a fair match, we\u2019re fine with that,\u201d Mr. Ross said on Wednesday. But, he added, the Trump administration would object to American companies\u2019 being forced to transfer technological know-how in exchange for market access.In closed-door conversations with United States officials, the Chinese have expressed concerns over a broad inquiry by the Trump administration into China trade practices that has focused on potential violations of intellectual policy. Officials have also complained about the United States\u2019 export controls.This year, the United States signed a deal with China to give American companies greater access to the Chinese market in several areas, including agriculture, banking and finance. Mr. Ross referred to the deal as \u201crelatively low-hanging fruit.\u201d\u201cNow we\u2019re moving into harder things, bigger things, more serious things, and hopefully the good will that\u2019s been built up between President Xi and President Trump will help to change the atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Ross, referring to Xi Jinping, told an audience at a Forbes conference in Hong Kong on Tuesday evening.But tensions remain between the two leaders. Last week, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to strengthen sanctions against North Korea; the new measures named Chinese entities.On Wednesday, Mr. Ross said that although the executive order \u201cdid name some Chinese individuals, it was not particularly aimed at China,\u201d adding that other nations have also done business with North Korea. He also praised China\u2019s central bank for directing its banking institutions not to facilitate trade with North Korea, saying it was \u201can important step.\u201dHe also struck a cautious note in ending his meeting with reporters on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give the impression that we made any concessions on the trip,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not, nor did the Chinese side.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Will Be Trump\u2019s Pick to Lead the Fed? We Asked Experts to Rate the Odds", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ContendersThe most important job in global economics is up for grabs in a mere four months. And it looks to be a wide-open race to fill the job.Janet Yellen\u2019s term leading the Federal Reserve ends Feb. 3, and President Trump has offered few indications of his plans either to nominate a successor or to reappoint Ms. Yellen to a second four-year term as chairwoman.So far, not even a credible list of the finalists has leaked from the White House. But given the impact Mr. Trump\u2019s choice will have on the world\u2019s economy, we\u2019ve asked a panel of experts to give their best guess.Specifically, we asked the panelists (they are listed at bottom) to give their odds on a list of people whose names have been publicly discussed for the post, in addition to a \u201crest of field\u201d category to encompass names that have not yet surfaced. We averaged their answers to generate consensus odds.Ms. Yellen has a possibility of being renominated, according to this consensus, but it is only 22 percent; experts think that Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor with deep Republican ties, has a slightly better chance at 23 percent.But those two top contenders combine for lower than 50 percent odds in our expert survey \u2014 meaning that our panelists thought there was a better-than-even chance that the appointment will be one of many contenders with individually modest but collectively high chances of rising to the top of the president\u2019s list.Using our expert survey \u2014 and comments from some of the participants in it \u2014 here\u2019s a guide to President Trump\u2019s options as he makes perhaps the single most consequential economic decision of his first year in office.There\u2019s a tradition of reappointing Fed chairmen who were originally appointed by a member of the opposite party. President Obama did so with Ben Bernanke; Bill Clinton with Alan Greenspan; and Ronald Reagan with Paul Volcker.That tradition has helped keep the Fed, with its vast power over the economy and financial system, insulated a bit from politics, but President Trump has no obligation to follow it.The case for renominating Ms. Yellen is straightforward.She has presided over four years of steady economic expansion and rising financial markets. She moved cautiously toward raising interest rates even though the economy seemed to be approaching full employment. By contrast, some more conservative contenders for the job have indicated they want to raise rates more quickly, which could endanger the economy as President Trump approaches midterm elections in 2018 and a potential re-election battle in 2020.After criticizing her during his campaign, President Trump has had some kind words for her, saying in July that he liked her and that \u201cshe\u2019s done a good job.\u201dMoreover, as President Trump dabbles in making deals with Democrats, reappointing Ms. Yellen could serve as an expression of good faith to Democratic senators. As administration officials focus on tax legislation and other priorities on Capitol Hill, it might be helpful to them to nominate someone who might sail through confirmation, rather than demand a bruising, time-consuming battle.\u201cShe\u2019s a known quantity, and there is less risk of disrupting the financial markets if the president renominates Dr. Yellen,\u201d said Brian Gardner, managing director of Washington Research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, and one of the panelists. \u201cAlthough President Trump is unorthodox in many ways, every president wants calm financial markets.\u201dOur experts\u2019 consensus was that Mr. Warsh has slightly better odds than Ms. Yellen. He was a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, and was a member of Mr. Bernanke\u2019s inner circle in shaping the Fed\u2019s extraordinary (and often extraordinarily unpopular) actions to battle the global financial crisis.He is well connected in conservative political circles and is now a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. Before joining the Fed, where he was the youngest governor in the institution\u2019s history, he worked in the George W. Bush White House and at Morgan Stanley. He has a law degree, but no advanced degree in economics.Mr. Warsh has been a skeptic of the Fed\u2019s efforts to boost the economy through quantitative easing and has advocated raising interest rates more quickly. He also has a regulatory philosophy more in line with the administration\u2019s.If Mr. Warsh is nominated, expect significant blowback during the confirmation process from Democrats, who are likely to accuse the 47-year-old Mr. Warsh of being underqualified, of being responsible for the 2008 bank bailouts and inclined to regulate banks too lightly now, and of being too overtly political for the traditionally nonpartisan Fed chairmanship.Not long ago, Gary Cohn, the head of the White House National Economic Council, looked like the leading candidate to be the next Fed chairman. In late July, his odds were 46 percent on PredictIt. But now our panel puts those odds at 12 percent, and PredictIt\u2019s odds were about the same.A former No. 2 at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Cohn has been reported to have swung out of favor with Mr. Trump after criticizing his response to racially motivated violence in Charlottesville, Va. But there were some reasons to be skeptical of Mr. Cohn\u2019s appointment to the Fed chairmanship even before that.Mr. Cohn has a hard-charging style that would be an unusual fit for an agency that is run more like an academic department. The last businessman to become Fed chairman, G. William Miller, was appointed by President Jimmy Carter and lasted only 18 months in the job.And given his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mr. Cohn\u2019s nomination would surely set off a heated confirmation battle. Democrats would be eager to criticize the administration for naming a recent top executive at Goldman Sachs to be the nation\u2019s most powerful financial regulator. Some populist Republicans might join them.Still, given the way people move in and out of Mr. Trump\u2019s favor, and his preference for appointees with business experience, a Cohn appointment can\u2019t be ruled out.The expert consensus is that there is about a one-in-three chance collectively for the other possible nominees, even as each of them individually is viewed as having single-digit odds. Foremost among them are several of the names we would probably be hearing about if a conventional Republican president were in the White House.John B. Taylor is a respected economist at Stanford who worked in the George W. Bush administration and has been an influential voice among congressional Republicans who want to see the Fed bound by stricter rules governing its actions.Glenn Hubbard was a top economic adviser to Mr. Bush who is dean of Columbia Business School.Larry Lindsey was another top adviser to Mr. Bush and a former Fed governor with an economics doctorate from Harvard.Our panel\u2019s consensus odds for the three were 8, 7 and 6 percent, respectively. Their doctorates and affiliations with top universities may actually be downsides in an administration that has shown disdain for academic expertise.Another intriguing possibility is Jerome Powell, known as Jay, a current Fed governor who served in the George H.W. Bush Treasury Department and was a partner at the Carlyle Group, the private equity firm. If Mr. Trump wanted a nominee who would probably maintain continuity with current Fed policy but was more conservative and business-minded than Ms. Yellen, Mr. Powell would be a below-the-radar option. The panel rates his odds of ending up in the job at 5 percent.A range of other names has emerged in various reports, including the F.D.I.C. vice chairman Thomas Hoenig and John Allison, the former chief executive of BB&T bank, but our panel assigns them only long-shot odds.Mr. Trump loves a surprise. In his search for a secretary of state, for example, he considered numerous prominent options before going with Exxon\u2019s chief executive, Rex Tillerson, a bit of an out-of-left-field choice.As he focuses on the choice for Fed chief, a similar pattern could reappear, and a less conventional choice could emerge. That\u2019s why the consensus of our panel is that there\u2019s a 10 percent chance the nominee is not on this list at all.Then again, in another appointment that has some similarities to the Fed chairmanship, the selection of a Supreme Court nominee, Mr. Trump went with a respected conservative jurist in Neil Gorsuch.As Mr. Trump starts focusing on the Fed chief decision in the months ahead, that may be the biggest decision of them all: whether to look at conventional qualifications, or go with a surprise. Either way, with Ms. Yellen\u2019s term coming to a close and a crowded calendar of Senate business that could stand in the way of a confirmation vote, the clock is ticking.ABOUT OUR PANEL: The odds listed here are based on a survey of 11 savvy observers of the Fed and economic policy making who were asked to offer a probability on each of the potential nominees listed. Their probabilities were to add to 100 percent, including the odds on \u201crest of field,\u201d or another nominee emerging. Those odds were then averaged to create a consensus probability of each selection.The participants were: Shehriyar Antia of Macro Insight Group; Tony Fratto of Hamilton Place Strategies; Brian Gardner of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods; Krishna Guha of Evercore I.S.I.; Roberto Perli of Cornerstone Macro; Douglas Rediker of International Capital Strategies; Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute; Phillip Swagel of the University of Maryland; Diane Swonk of DS Economics; Eric Winograd of AllianceBernstein; and Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics.Top images, from left: Will Oliver/European Pressphoto Agency; Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press; Alex Brandon/Associated Press; Ted S.

It was like opening a window and letting fresh air into a house that smelled of mustiness. The currently ruling Law and Justice party gained momentum when it started scaring people with terrorism and some diseases and parasites that refugees supposedly carry. They won the elections. They have divided Poland into two camps \u2014 those who want to help the war victims, and those who scream \u2018Poland for Poles.\u2019 Once again, I started smelling something musty and stale in the air.\u201d\u2014 Malgorzata Samplawska, 60, a retired teacher in Trzciniec, Poland.\u201cI was born in Poland, but my family is bilingual, as my father is Italian. That is why I have always had multilevel identity \u2014 not a fully Italian one, not fully Polish either. When Poland entered the E.U. in 2004, I realized these two did not have to be mutually conflictive. I benefited in what I myself define as \u2018normalization\u2019 of an identity like mine. When Poland entered the E.U., people understood I could belong both here and in Italy.\u201d\u2014 Mateusz Mazzini, 27, Wroclaw, Poland, a doctoral candidate in sociology at the Polish Academy of Sciences.\u201cThe European Union only knows one kind of democracy, the kind that helped its leaders to power. It rejects all other views and electoral decisions, labeling them antidemocratic. Decisions made by Hungarian or Polish voters are no less democratic than those by French or German voters, and the E.U. still wants to punish governments elected in this way.\u201d\u201cAfter our entry, funds were made available for E.U. objectives, but the immense bureaucracy they entail has spread to the Hungarian administration. On top of that, we are only applying to get our contributions back, not for projects we need, but those determined by the E.U. That\u2019s how many small towns that still have unpaved streets have received colorful fountains. The Orban government is not threatening democracy. It is trying to improve the dysfunctions in the administration and to investigate and punish anomalies.\u201d\u201cA requirement for receiving E.U. money is one that many people in Poland can understand. At the same time, other E.U. countries, including old E.U. members, are suffering from issues of their own (e.g., corruption in Italy and France), and the argument on morals should be used with caution.\u201d\u2014 Helena Chmielewska-Szlajfer, 34, an assistant professor at Kozminski University in Warsaw. \u201cThe government dominates the news media, which is quite depressing. It\u2019s impossible to even argue because there is no news, no information. We are constantly confronted with enemy figures, keeping with \u2018panem et circenses.\u2019 \u201d\u2014 Istvan Bende, 32, a conductor of the choir at the National Theater of Pecs, in Pecs, Hungary. \u201cWe used to be enslaved; we used to get orders from Moscow, and we don\u2019t want to get them from Brussels now.

Also, what many Westerners may not realize is that we all expected our standard of living to rise to the level of at least that of Spain or Italy. This has not happened, and there is a genuine disappointment and resentment present in our society.\u201d\u201cWe have many friends and relatives who work in the E.U., so we are aware of the prices and wages there. Unfortunately, wages in Hungary are far behind those in the rest of the E.U. I manage 200 people directly and receive around 670 euros [nearly $800] monthly at a state company.

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Finances Add to Vulnerability in Hurricane", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPuerto Ricans have ample experience with hurricanes, but the storm approaching on Wednesday brought an added level of anxiety. The island\u2019s dire financial straits have left essential public works, from power plants to retaining walls, weakened by years of scrimping on maintenance.\u201cThis is not an event that is occurring in the Netherlands, where they\u2019re ready for it and they have a strong economy,\u201d said Miguel A. Soto-Class, president of the Center for a New Economy, a research group on the island. \u201cThis is an event happening on a very poor island that\u2019s been in a depression for the last 10 years.\u201dUnder Promesa, Puerto Rico\u2019s finances must be supervised by a federal board until its house is back in order, a process that is expected to take years. Relations between the board and the elected government of Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 were contentious even before Hurricane Irma, with the governor first agreeing to a five-year austerity plan, then reversing course and threatening to go to prison rather than accepting the entire package.In particular, the governor has refused to furlough government workers, and to reduce the pensions of retired government employees by an average 10 percent. The fiscal oversight board has sued the governor, asking the court to order him to carry out the entire austerity plan. The furloughs were supposed to have begun on Sept. 1.Despite the legal dispute, the board\u2019s executive director, Natalie Jaresko, said in a statement Wednesday that the board was \u201cworking closely with Governor Rossell\u00f3 to coordinate support for Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the storm.\u201d\u201cWe have also reached out to the federal government to activate Title V of Promesa, which allows the board to work with agencies to accelerate the deployment of grants and loans following a disaster,\u201d she said.On Tuesday, Governor Rossell\u00f3 urged residents to move into hurricane shelters, and began evacuations on the island\u2019s eastern and northern coasts, which are prone to flooding. Shopkeepers on the island said they were sold out of essential provisions and had never seen residents prepare so thoroughly for a storm.To the east of Puerto Rico, another financially challenged jurisdiction, the United States Virgin Islands, was also battening down. Gov. Kenneth Mapp ordered a 36-hour curfew to reduce the risk of injuries and looting.President Trump declared a state of emergency in both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, giving the Federal Emergency Management Agency the authority to deploy personnel and resources for relief. The declaration also means the federal government will pay 75 percent of the cost of providing public safety services and clearing away debris.The prospect of additional federal aid in the aftermath of the storm could also lift the islands\u2019 economies and ease their financial distress, at least temporarily.In San Juan, Mr. Soto-Class said that more than 300,000 Puerto Ricans were already without electrical power by early Wednesday afternoon, even before the arrival of the hurricane, and while he had a generator to provide backup power, most of the island\u2019s 3.4 million people do not.\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible downward spiral,\u201d he said of the deterioration of public works. \u201cWhen the power goes out, the water goes out, because the water authority is the No. 1 client of the power authority. They have a few of their own generators, but eventually you\u2019ll have a second utility that will go down. And you can lose communications,\u201d because cellular phone providers on the island run on the public electrical grid.He said that the power grid was especially at risk because tree pruning had been scaled back to save money, and branches were falling on the wires.But as jockeying continues over how much the island must ultimately pay its creditors, the storm could add a new complication.The debt of Puerto Rico\u2019s huge power authority, known as Prepa, may make the best example of how some creditors see the risk. Its bondholders were dismayed in the days before the hurricane when Prepa\u2019s executive director, Ricardo Ramos, went on television and said that some parts of the island could be without power for as long as four months. Mr. Ramos also said that Prepa\u2019s power plants were vulnerable because of a chronic lack of spending on maintenance.For bondholders, this was an alarming statement. Under the terms of Prepa\u2019s $9 billion of revenue bonds, the utility\u2019s power plants and other assets are not supposed to be idled for months at a time; they are to produce and distribute electricity, generating revenue that serves as collateral for the debt. Letting the plants lie fallow could be seen as impairing pledged collateral. Some now wonder if damage from the storm could be used to justify retiring all the plants, as part of a sweeping privatization plan that would eliminate their collateral and leave them empty-handed.Prepa recently took one power plant out of service, saying it was too old and decrepit to be viable. The added load on the remaining plants knocked another partly out of service. Officials have already said many times that an all-new, recapitalized electric authority \u2014 the largest of its kind in the United States \u2014 could be a godsend to the Puerto Rican economy.The bondholders have already given Prepa three years\u2019 worth of debt relief. Last month, they asked Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is handling the Promesa proceedings in the United States District Court in San Juan, to let Prepa\u2019s case be shifted to a different court, where, perhaps, its operations could be placed in the hands of a receiver. A receiver would presumably allow current operations to continue and the debt to be repaid, even if that meant a politically unpopular rate increase.It is not clear how damage from the hurricane might affect either side\u2019s arguments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Liberia: A Vacation Paradise", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe kid had already been spoiled shamelessly during our two-week stay. He had cleared Mamba Point\u2019s sushi restaurant of all its edamame, and had devoured, by my count, more than 65 eggs, scrambled carefully for him every morning by the breakfast chef Leroy Blehsue, (one morning he consumed eight).This was over the holidays, and the hotel was empty since tourists don\u2019t go to Liberia. For Cooper, that meant a huge edifice to explore. He swam in the new pool. He explored the corners of the hotel casino. He sprawled on the couch in the bar playing Minecraft on his mom\u2019s iPad. He heckled the doormen by running in front of them to open doors for ladies as they came in, before saying between giggles: \u201cI\u2019m doing your job.\u201dI would not have blamed them if they had shooed him away. But they didn\u2019t. \u201cHi Cooper,\u201d Edward Quad, the second-floor doorman said, grinning as Cooper invaded his turf.In fact, \u201cHi, Cooper,\u201d had become the refrain for my family\u2019s big trip, and for all of my inner grumbling, I was ecstatic. This was the first time my entire family \u2014 from my mom to my two other nephews to my brother-in-law to my sisters all the way to Cooper, were all together back in Liberia, the land of my birth. Cooper had never before been to Africa and, let\u2019s face it, Liberia is Africa on steroids.I had fretted for months before about the trip, having come up with the idea that, after the years of civil war, capped off by the 2014 Ebola pandemic, it was time to see if Liberia was ready to be a travel destination.\u201cWe\u2019ll be tourists!\u201d I had cajoled. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the beach, we\u2019ll go to Kpatawee waterfalls, we\u2019ll go to Sapo National Park. And think of the food!\u201dThe mention of the food had eroded their initial dubiousness. Liberian food is \u201csweeeeeeet\u201d \u2014 Liberian English for \u201cso delicious you want to cry.\u201d We boarded the flight home with thoughts of palm butter, bitterleaf, fufu and proper Liberian jollof rice, in our heads.The central question, though, was: Could we really spend two weeks in Liberia as tourists? Liberia had long been that fantastically beautiful place that had never seemed able to deliver on its travel destination potential: sandy white empty beaches, but with no roads leading to them; lush tropical rain forests but with no place to go to the bathroom; an open people who love foreigners but few flights to link them.The video, set to highlife music, was enticing yet real at the same time. \u201cExperience our Children!\u201d a bunch of adorable uniformed schoolchildren said, laughing into the camera, which nonetheless captured the dirt roads these children walked on every day. \u201cExperience our Culture!\u201d was followed by a clip of a pekin (Liberian English for frisky child) with no shoes doing a complicated dance involving wide leg sweeps, accompanied by drummers. \u201cExperience our Natural Beauty!\u201d had a wide gorgeous smile from a Liberian park ranger showing off peaceful rain forest lagoons, tented lodges on the beach and real-life Liberian surfers cresting waves. Whoever put the video together hadn\u2019t shied away from the tattiness of the capital city of Monrovia, which was featured in all of its dilapidated glory.This trip was Cooper\u2019s first visit to the Third World, and I was eager to see how he would do. In the back seat of the car as we navigated Monrovia\u2019s traffic, Cooper was glued to the window: Market women with baskets of oranges on their heads and babies on their backs battled with young boys selling small plastic bags of ice water. At major intersections, all manner of bushmeat, fish and poultry were available for purchase by car passengers too lazy to pull over and walk to the side of the road. So sellers came to them. One guy thrusted what looked like an aardvark at us.\u201cBucket,\u201d Cooper said, quietly to himself, at one point, when we passed a woman balancing a bucket on her head. He seemed particularly fascinated by the size and weight of what the Liberian women carried on their heads, plugging into the image that more than anything else, tells the story of the continent of Africa as a whole. \u201cLook, she\u2019s carrying two things on top of each other!\u201d he exclaimed.He struggled with the heat at first \u2014 on Day 1, at a party a friend of mine had for children who had lost their parents to Ebola, Cooper, fascinated by the traditional Liberian dance and the drummer Emmanuel Lavelah, shuttled back and forth from the band to the porch to stand directly in front of the fan with a glass of ice water, looking pitiful and torn.But I knew \u201cExperience our Beaches!\u201d would help that. The next day, we headed on an overnight trip to Libassa, an eco-resort outside Monrovia that came with thatched rondavels, multiple terraced swimming pools, a lagoon, and a \u201clazy river.\u201d All of this was set to the backdrop of the Atlantic Ocean.The calm remains until around early afternoon, when the secluded oasis turns into a water park, as families show up to play in the lazy river, letting the current jets do the swimming for them. It\u2019s a total scene, amplified by Liberia\u2019s strange breed of cultural quirks: We generally don\u2019t swim well (maybe because the country\u2019s tropical coastal location gives the ocean a fierce undertow), so Libassa\u2019s lazy river was full of young Liberian couples on dates in which guys were supposedly teaching young women how to swim.When we were there, the floating deck on the lagoon that had been so peaceful in the morning was crammed by afternoon with Lebanese expats smoking hookahs in gender-segregated groups. We even got to see a fight, when a group of Lebanese women started demanding loudly of their men why they were in Liberia for Christmas instead of Rabat or Casablanca. Then the women got up en masse and stomped back up to the resort\u2019s restaurant area.Still, my quest to experience Liberia as a tourist was going well. What to hit next?\u201cExperience our wildlife!\u201d O.K., so about that. Listen, this is West Africa, not East Africa. So instead of lions and cheetahs,we\u2019ve got Monkey Island! Actually, we have six of them. And surely six islands, inhabited solely by chimpanzees (which does not stop Liberians from calling the islands Monkey Island) is something.The Monkey Island story is typically Liberian \u2014 foreign exploitation, war, disease, redemption, all rolled into one. For 30 years, the New York Blood Center used a colony of chimpanzees in Liberia for medical research. That finally ended in 2005, and the chimps and their children were given free rein on the islands, on the Farmington River just outside Monrovia. In 2015 the blood center said they wouldn\u2019t pay to feed and care for the chimps anymore. A public furor ensued, and eventually the Humane Society and other donors stepped in to continue the feeding and care program.The chimpanzees now live on the six islands on the river. There are around 50 of them altogether. One morning we paid some local fishermen $25 to paddle us an hour each way through mangrove forests to the islands. We saw the chimpanzees\u2019 caretaker toss them bananas from his canoe. (Because people don\u2019t set foot on Monkey Island, it\u2019s solely for the chimps.) The most famous one, Bullet, was shot in the arm during the civil war so only has the use of three appendages, but he, like his Liberian compatriots, has proved himself pretty resilient and is one of the dominant chimps. There are no organized tours, but going with the local oarsmen is a great way to help the local economy.For Experience our Natural Beauty! day, we headed to Robertsport, in my opinion the coolest of all of Liberia\u2019s, um, resort towns. Robertsport is where the ship the Harriett landed, carrying my great-great-great-great grandfather Randolph Cooper and his four brothers, all freed American blacks who boarded in Norfolk, Virginia, back in 1829. They and other black people were sent to settlements in West Africa that became Liberia as part of an effort by the American Colonization Society to rid the United States of black freemen. A lot of Liberia\u2019s recent political turmoil, including the civil war, can be traced back to its tortured history that is rooted in American slavery.The city of Robertsport still has some of the historic zinc settler houses from the 1800s, some of them still occupied by generations of the same families. The town \u2014 nestled between the lush, green Grand Cape Mount and the mouth of the 40-square-mile, drop-dead gorgeous Lake Piso \u2014 oozes with this tatty yet genteel civility, inhabited by people and ruins. The remnants of Bethany Hall at St. John\u2019s Episcopal High School tower sit at the edge of a hill overlooking the sea, slowly being reclaimed by nature.The ruin has a stunning view of the cove where the freed blacks who arrived on the Harriett carved their names onto a cottonwood tree on the beach.That tree sits on one of the best beaches in the country. Unlike the beaches closer to Monrovia, the beach at Nana\u2019s Lodge, a surf retreat in Robertsport with Robinson Crusoe-like lodges on stilts for overnight guests, doesn\u2019t have killer \u2014 I mean this literally \u2014 waves and fierce undertow that beat you black and blue before dragging you out to sea. Instead, the angle of the coastline creates ocean swells from the south that make waves as high as 20 feet peel along the coast rather than just dumping straight on. If you surf, these are waves you can ride forever. They are so long and gentle that even I kind of learned how to surf there, even though I was never quite able to stand up.Cooper had stayed in the water all day, coming out only to eat and to take his obligatory picture by the cottonwood tree signed by his ancestor.Cooper would certainly Experience our Culture!, pursuing every redheaded lizard he came across, chasing after a ball on the beach with local children, learning Liberian English via the \u201cTell Your Ma Say I Here\u201d song that was popular on the radio stations. This all culminated that last night, when his new friends at Mamba Point Hotel presented him with a gorgeous wooden locket and armband with his name engraved.By that last night, we all thought we had answered the question of whether we could be tourists in our homeland with a resounding yes.But as I watched the waves lapping at Nana\u2019s Lodge beach in Robertsport while my nephew played in the water, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if I had cheated a little. A D.J. was playing an upbeat Barry White. Pretty 20-somethings were playing \u201cCorn Hole,\u201d the American college game. At a plastic table next to us, a group of Liberians and Lebanese were drinking Club Beer while a stray dog padded around the table looking for scraps.Barry White was singing \u201cI know\u2026there\u2019s only\u2026only one like you; There\u2019s no way\u2026they could have made two,\u201d and everyone around me was just, well, chill. There\u2019s no other word for it. And I realized there was nowhere I would rather be, than with my family on this beach, standing a few feet from the tree that had greeted my great-great-great-great-great granddaddy when he first landed from America.Can Liberia be a travel destination? Maybe.Can Liberia be a travel destination for me?Yes, definitely.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Trump Can Harness the U.S. Energy Boom", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe new energy abundance in the United States has given President Trump a historic opportunity not just to expand the country\u2019s economy at home, but also to expand its leadership globally. To maximize this opportunity, he should think about energy as more than a driver of economic growth, overcome the powerful political forces favoring isolationism and retrenchment, and rein in his tendency to alienate countries that should be energy allies of the United States.The embrace of new technologies to extract oil and natural gas at an unprecedented rate has transformed one of America\u2019s enduring vulnerabilities into a strategic asset. Thanks largely to fracking \u2014 hydraulic fracturing of rock \u2014 the United States is now the largest producer of oil and gas combined in the world. America consumes large quantities of energy, so this expanded production has not yet made the country energy independent. But it has greatly decreased its dependence on foreign energy: About a decade ago, the United States imported nearly two-thirds of the oil it consumed; that percentage is now closer to one-fifth. America is now the largest exporter of refined petroleum products and, in the past year, has also become an exporter of crude oil and liquefied natural gas.The benefits of this surge in production go well beyond cheaper gasoline, an improved trade balance and a stronger economy. The boom has also improved the country\u2019s sources of soft power, in part by underscoring America\u2019s enduring edge in innovation and ingenuity.The new output has forced changes in the structure of energy markets in ways that are favorable to the United States. American producers of oil from shale rock have introduced a new business model to the scene: Small investments in exploration and production can bring oil to the market quickly. This weakens OPEC, by making it more difficult for its production cuts to result in sustained increases in oil prices. For the first time in more than a century, the market determines the price of oil with much less influence from any cartel, commission or band of big oil companies.New supplies of natural gas \u2014 and ever cheaper technologies for liquefying it and transporting it \u2014 have helped integrate formerly fractured natural gas markets and made them more efficient. These changes have empowered the consumer of natural gas over the producer \u2014 a big reversal from recent years.The energy boom has also weakened many of America\u2019s competitors, particularly Russia, by both decreasing its revenues and reducing its ability to use its energy resources as a political cudgel. The boom also expands opportunities for the United States to forge new partnerships. For instance, given China\u2019s growing dependence, and America\u2019s waning reliance, on Middle Eastern oil, Beijing may be more likely to work with the United States to stabilize that part of the world. Such changes put America in a stronger position to reinforce the international order.Domestically, Mr. Trump has made energy a centerpiece of his efforts to strengthen our economy and create jobs, but he needs to do more than loosen restrictions on oil and gas production: Many non-energy policies of the Trump administration undermine the energy boom and all its potential advantages.President Trump\u2019s protectionist impulses, for instance, do not square neatly with a booming energy sector. Pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, renegotiating Nafta under the threat of withdrawal and the questioning of the free-trade agreement with South Korea weaken the strong links between trade, global growth and rising energy demand; flagging global energy demand will hurt prospects for American exports of oil and gas.On climate, Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement could also hurt the American energy boom. Natural gas stands to gain as the world takes strides to tackle climate change: As countries transition to more sustainable energy, they often move away from coal to natural gas. American natural gas exports could benefit from this transition \u2014 but not if countries like China and India also weaken their commitment to tackling climate change and drag their heels in curbing coal consumption.Similarly, Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of retrenchment overseas has made friends and foes nervous about America\u2019s willingness to continue to use its vast sea power to maintain open shipping lanes. Over half of the world\u2019s oil supply and a growing percentage of the natural gas it consumes is transported through these waterways.The Trump administration clearly recognizes that America\u2019s energy position is a huge asset to it. But if it wants to fully embrace the opportunity at hand, it needs to integrate its welcome passion for America\u2019s energy revolution into its broader thinking on foreign policy \u2014 and make sure that it is not undercutting the strategic value of the boom with its non-energy policies.Meghan L. O\u2019Sullivan, a professor at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School, is the author of \u201cWindfall: How the New Energy Abundance Upends Global Politics and Strengthens America\u2019s Power\u201d and was a deputy national security adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan for President George W.

{"Headline": "Shinzo Abe of Japan Calls Early Election, as a Rival Party Forms", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Seizing on anxiety over tensions about North Korea and the opposition\u2019s weakness, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan called Monday for an early election next month.In announcing plans to dissolve the lower chamber of Parliament, the House of Representatives, and call for a snap election next month, Mr. Abe said that an aging society and a tense situation with North Korea were the country\u2019s biggest problems. \u201cTo respond to the problems as leader of the nation, that\u2019s my mission as prime minister,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cAlthough it will be a difficult election, in order to overcome these national problems, I have to listen to the people\u2019s voice.\u201dMr. Abe is taking advantage of his rising public approval ratings, which have recovered from a nadir reached over the summer. After his Liberal Democratic Party lost to Ms. Koike\u2019s party, Tomin First, in Tokyo elections in July, Mr. Abe appeared at risk of losing the chance to become Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister.\u201cHe thought politically this is the right time to call the election,\u201d said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington, \u201cbecause his party had some problems, but the other party\u2019s problems are a lot bigger.\u201dYet with 42 percent of those surveyed still undecided, Ms. Koike\u2019s wild card of a party is likely to capture some of these voters. The governor herself will not be running for a lower house seat, but she will use her popularity to campaign for her party\u2019s candidates.In announcing the new party, which will be called Kibou no To \u2014 Party of Hope \u2014 Ms. Koike said that she wanted to increase female participation in society and work toward an energy policy that eliminated nuclear power and reduced carbon emissions to zero. She said she wanted to debate the revision of the Constitution, but she questioned the wisdom of focusing exclusively on the pacifist clause that is at the center of Mr. Abe\u2019s ambitions.Ms. Koike called into question Mr. Abe\u2019s timing in calling for an election. \u201cI see a big question mark on calling an election in the midst of the North Korean situation being so critical,\u201d she said during a news conference on Monday. \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s appropriate in terms of crisis management for the country.\u201dKoichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo, said Mr. Abe was taking advantage of the North Korean crisis. \u201cHe is using the North Korean card to his advantage to call an unnecessary snap election just because it suits him,\u201d Mr. Nakano said.\u201cNorth Korea helped Abe raise his support rate, giving the impression to people that Abe is the only man who can deal with the threat from North Korea,\u201d said Harumi Arima, an independent political analyst.Editorials in several mainstream newspapers accused Mr. Abe of cynical timing and of trying to avoid answering tough questions about a pair of influence-peddling scandals in which he is accused of giving favors to friends in the education sector.But some analysts said such criticism could backfire if opponents did not present credible campaign platforms. \u201cElections are the place where lawmakers should talk about their ideas about Japan\u2019s future,\u201d Mr. Arima said. \u201cThere is no use if they only complain or grumble.\u201dStill, Mr. Abe\u2019s call for an early election is not without risk. The Liberal Democrats currently hold two-thirds of the seats in the lower house, so even if they win a majority, they could still lose seats. Such losses could jeopardize Mr. Abe\u2019s desire to serve a third term.\u201cIf they lose more than a couple of seats, then in some ways the door is going to slam shut on Abe,\u201d said Tobias Harris, a Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy based in New York. \u201cAnd even if he serves out the rest of his term, the criticism that he called an election to solidify his personal status \u2014 and in the process cost the party a few seats \u2014 will be a lot more intense, and there will be a major question about whether he deserves another term.\u201dIt is not clear whether Ms. Koike\u2019s party would hurt Mr. Abe\u2019s political fortunes or whether it could become a coalition partner for the Liberal Democrats.So far, four members of the Democratic Party and one from the Liberal Democrats have announced their intention to join the new party, along with a handful of independents.Those who have said they will join the new party are in favor of revising the pacifist Constitution. If Mr. Abe aligned with the new party, \u201che could claim that there is more and broader support for his proposals,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors.In a bow to the sensitivity of the constitutional issue, Mr. Abe did not mention it during his election announcement.Mr. Okubo said that Mr. Abe would benefit from the recent stabilization of Japan\u2019s economy. Mr. Abe has also vowed to use a consumption tax increase to pay for child care and free university and college tuition.At a meeting with economic policy advisers on Monday, Mr. Abe said he would develop a 2 trillion yen, or $17.8 billion, plan to help improve preschool education and other social services.The official campaign will begin Oct. 10, and voting will take place on Oct. 22.Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The tools of filmmaking may have changed profoundly since King Kong swatted his first toy airplane \u2014 along with the expectations of viewers, who now have their own editing software in their pockets. But the designer\u2019s central task \u2014 to make the world within the work feel both irresistible and invisible, both unimagined and instantly imaginable \u2014 has not.You might argue that in an image-obsessed \u2014 and, as importantly, image-savvy \u2014 culture, production designers are, more than ever, the soul of a film. Today\u2019s designer needs to stay one step ahead of an audience that already lives in a predesigned world, both on screen and in real life, and whose primary visual references for places often come from the movies. (We see Manhattan and think of \u2018\u2018Manhattan\u2019\u2019; we see Vienna and remember \u2018\u2018Before Sunrise.\u2019\u2019) To be alive now is to be in a constant state of visual d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. So what do we want from movies? Not curation but creation \u2014 the invention of images above all. Actors come and go (and might one day disappear entirely). Writing and plot are necessary but never sufficient. But production designers are the essential makers of the movie; they use tools ancient and modern, glaringly obvious or masterfully hidden, to compel us to look at something new. They are artists who shape what we imagine and, therefore, how we see.9 PhotosThen there\u2019s the difficulty of making one place look like another, relying on the sense that the way we see or remember a famous location often comes down to a few small visual elements. Judy Becker \u2014 who was responsible for the production design of Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u2018\u2018Feud\u2019\u2019 and is now working on the director\u2019s \u2018\u2018American Crime Story\u2019\u2019 season \u2014 tends to alter just one or two key details: placing neon signs atop an L.A. boulevard\u2019s median strip to make it resemble New York City through a wet diner window, for example, or adding a security gate and a rolling safety ladder to a window to make the interior of a Hancock Park mansion look like Geraldine Page\u2019s Manhattan flat. There\u2019s a science to the art of this particular fakery, the way the brain builds a gestalt world around selected details. Digital tricks help Becker and others in postproduction, but not until she\u2019s figured out a way to nudge the audience into willing belief. No special effect could replace her understanding of how accordion gates or blurred neon light up our \u2018\u2018old Manhattan\u2019\u2019 neurons; in order to manipulate the eye, you must first have an understanding of our associative visual vocabulary, and in order to take advantage of a well-known reference, you must first be able to identify it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Tax Plan Benefits Wealthy, Including Trump", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 The tax plan that the Trump administration outlined on Wednesday is a potentially huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans. It would not directly benefit the bottom third of the population. As for the middle class, the benefits appear to be modest.The administration and its congressional allies are proposing to sharply reduce taxation of business income, primarily benefiting the small share of the population that owns the vast majority of corporate equity. President Trump said on Wednesday that the cuts would increase investment and spur growth, creating broader prosperity. But experts say the upside is limited, not least because the economy is already expanding.The plan would also benefit Mr. Trump and other affluent Americans by eliminating the estate tax, which affects just a few thousand uber-wealthy families each year, and the alternative minimum tax, a safety net designed to prevent tax avoidance.Mr. Trump has also pledged repeatedly that the plan would reduce the taxes paid by middle-class families, but he has not provided enough details to evaluate that claim. While some households would probably get tax cuts, others could end up paying more.The plan would not benefit lower-income households that do not pay federal income taxes. The president is not proposing measures like a reduction in payroll taxes, which are paid by a much larger share of workers, nor an increase in the earned-income tax credit, which would expand wage support for the working poor.\u201cIt\u2019s time to take care of our people, to rebuild our nation and to fight for our great American workers,\u201d Mr. Trump told a crowd in Indianapolis.At the time of the earlier cuts, the federal debt was considerably smaller. The public portion of the debt equaled 24 percent of the gross domestic product in 1981, and 31 percent in 2001. In June, the debt equaled 75 percent of economic output.The Trump administration insists that its tax cut will catalyze such an economic boom that money will flow into the federal coffers and the debt will not rise. The Reagan and Bush administrations made similar claims. The debt soared in both instances.Mr. Trump wants to cut taxes while revenues are close to an average level.Since 1981, federal revenue has averaged 17.1 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, while federal spending has averaged 20.3 percent.Last year\u2019s numbers were close to the long-term trend: Federal revenue was 17.5 percent of gross domestic product; spending was 20.7 percent.The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.Martin Feldstein, a Harvard University economics professor and a longtime adviser to Republican presidents, said that the moment was not perfect, but that Mr. Trump should nevertheless press ahead because the changes would be valuable.\u201cThe debt is moving in the wrong direction,\u201d Mr. Feldstein said. \u201cBut the tax reform is moving in the right direction.\u201dProponents of the plan assert that the largest benefits are indirect. In particular, they argue that cutting corporate taxes will unleash economic growth.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan is more focused on business tax cuts than the Reagan and Bush plans, and economists agree that this makes economic gains more likely.The key elements are large reductions in the tax rates for business income: To 20 percent for corporations, and to 25 percent for \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses, a broad category that includes everything from mom-and-pop neighborhood shops to giant investment partnerships, law firms \u2014 and real estate developers.The plan also lets businesses immediately deduct the full cost of new investments.\u201cYou\u2019re going to get a boost in investment,\u201d said William Gale, co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue that there won\u2019t be a positive effect.\u201dBut Mr. Gale added that there are reasons to think it would be modest.The most important is that the economy is already growing at a faster pace than the Fed considers sustainable. \u201cEconomy roaring,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday.Also, interest rates are low, and nonfinancial companies are sitting on $1.84 trillion that they don\u2019t want to spend. \u201cIt\u2019s not lack of funds that\u2019s stopping companies from investing,\u201d Mr. Gale said.And the stimulus would come at the cost of increased federal borrowing. Interest rates might not rise if foreigners provide the necessary money, as happened in the 1980s and the 2000s, but that means some of the benefits also end up abroad.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan also continues a long-term march away from progressive taxation. The federal income tax is the centerpiece of a longstanding bipartisan consensus that wealthy Americans should pay an outsize share of the cost of government.But successive rounds of tax cuts have eroded that premise, according to research by the economists Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics and Emmanuel Saez of the University of California at Berkeley. In 1980, the wealthiest Americans paid 59 percent of their income in taxes while the middle 20 percent of Americans paid 24.5 percent. After the Bush tax cuts, the wealthiest Americans paid 34.7 percent of their income in taxes, while Americans in the middle income brackets paid 16.1 percent.Under President Barack Obama, Congress increased taxation of upper-income households. Mr. Trump is seeking to resume the long-term trend toward flattening the curve. Upper-income households would get large tax cuts; lower-income households would get none.The exact impact on the middle class is not yet clear. The outline released Wednesday proposes new tax brackets but does not specify income thresholds. It also proposes to replace the current tax deduction for each dependent with a child tax credit \u2014 but the administration did not propose a dollar amount for that new credit.The administration said Wednesday that it was committed \u201cto ensure that the reformed tax code is at least as progressive as the existing tax code.\u201d That language, however, applies only to personal income taxes. The proposed reduction of business taxes and the elimination of the estate tax would both disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to justify this as a progressive proposal,\u201d said Lily Batchelder, a law professor at New York University who served as deputy director of Mr. Obama\u2019s National Economic Council. \u201cIn broad brush strokes, they\u2019re doing nothing for the bottom 35 percent, they\u2019re doing very little and possibly raising taxes on the middle class, and they\u2019ve specified tax cuts for the wealthy.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

They also said the agreement made it \u201cvery likely that any possible future effort by Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, even a clandestine program, would be detected promptly.\u201dMr. Trump has repeatedly assailed the agreement \u2014 a signature achievement of his predecessor \u2014 describing it as \u201ca terrible deal\u201d and a giveaway to Iran.The accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, severely limited Iran\u2019s nuclear activities in return for ending or easing many sanctions that were hurting the Iranian economy.Under an American law, Mr. Trump must recertify every 90 days that Iran is complying with the nuclear accord, or the American sanctions that were lifted could be reinstated. The next 90-day deadline is in mid-October.When he reluctantly signed the last recertification in July, Mr. Trump said, \u201cIf it was up to me, I would have had them noncompliant 180 days ago.\u201dThe possibility that Mr. Trump may find a reason to declare Iran noncompliant, regardless of the merits, alarmed the nonproliferation experts.They warned in their statement that \u201cunilateral action by the United States, especially on the basis of unsupported contentions of Iranian cheating, would isolate the United States.\u201dIranian officials have said that any resumption of the nuclear-related sanctions by the United States would violate the deal.The signers of the statement urging Mr. Trump to respect the agreement are experts in nuclear nonproliferation diplomacy from around the world.The statement was organized by the Arms Control Association, a disarmament advocacy group based in Washington.The Trump administration\u2019s concerns with Iran have come as the United Nations Security Council, prodded by the United States, has ratcheted up pressure on North Korea to stop its nuclear and missile testing and resume disarmament talks.Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, expressed worry that if the administration abandoned the Iran agreement, any possibility of inducing North Korea to negotiate would be lost.\u201cGiven that we are already struggling to contain the North Korean nuclear and missile crisis, it would be extremely unwise for the president to initiate steps that could unravel the highly successful 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which would create a second major nonproliferation crisis,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly at one point to the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, The director, Kelsey Davenport, is a woman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do Republicans Really Care About the Deficit?", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThough America really doesn\u2019t need a tax cut \u2014 demographic pressures alone suggest the need for more, not less, future revenues \u2014 President Trump and the Republican majority want one. But they don\u2019t want to pay for it, which means the budget deficit is going to rise. Based on what we\u2019ve seen so far, the increase in the deficit could be at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years.Perhaps this surprises you, as you\u2019ve long heard Republicans cry about deficits and debt. But any such tears are of the crocodile variety. When it comes to increasing the budget deficit, the impact of this tax plan is no different from any of their others.That, of course, is crazy. I don\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad economics, or lousy fiscal policy. I mean it\u2019s disconnected from reality, or more precisely, from arithmetic. You can, and they do, make arguments about how growth effects will make up the difference, despite the complete lack of empirical evidence to support such claims. Indeed, rumor is that Mr. Trump has his economics team ginning up a \u201cdynamic growth model\u201d that will spit out phony growth effects offsetting much of the cost of their tax cut.Don\u2019t believe it. Our fiscal history on this point is clear: Cutting taxes loses revenues, which, unless offset by higher taxes elsewhere or spending cuts, increases the budget deficit, which in turn raises the debt. (The debt is the sum of all past deficits minus past surpluses.)In fact, the Republican budget hawk is a rare bird. There are, instead, flocks of chicken hawks who use the deficit argument to block spending, promote fiscal austerity, and small government, conveniently tossing deficit concerns aside when it comes to tax cuts.But deficits don\u2019t seem to hurt the economy. So, what\u2019s the problem?The pattern isn\u2019t surprising when you consider how much the Federal Reserve has been in the mix, holding its benchmark interest rate near zero for most of the last 10 years (it now stands at 1.25 percent). In addition, global financial flows have accelerated in recent years, and the United States has been a prime destination for that money. That\u2019s increased the supply of loanable funds and pushed down rates regardless of the magnitude of the federal budget deficit. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve been experiencing \u201csecular stagnation\u201d \u2014 persistently weak demand, even in recoveries like the one we\u2019ve seen over the last several years \u2014 which is associated with higher savings, less investment (think of firms sitting on their earnings or buying back shares versus reinvesting) and lower interest rates.Do these forces mean deficits don\u2019t matter? Not at all. The problem with structural deficits \u2014 ones that go up even in good times \u2014 is that they reveal that we\u2019re unwilling to raise the necessary revenues to support the government we want and need. This enables those who whose goal is to shrink government to point to deficits and debt as their proof that we can\u2019t afford it, whatever \u201cit\u201d is, except when \u201cit\u201d is tax cuts.Such faux hawks don\u2019t hate budget deficits at all. To the contrary, they quite like them, because they provide scary-sounding numbers they can point to as the reason government can\u2019t afford to shore up Social Security and Medicare. \u201cInvest in kids, infrastructure, human capital?\u201d they say. \u201cBelieve me, I wish we could. But have you seen the deficit?\u201dThis is a big part of their whole tax cut play. When the offsetting growth effects fail to appear, the tax cutters are not going to apologize for their shortsightedness and agree to raise taxes back to at least where they were. They\u2019ll argue that in the face of these unforeseen deficits, our only course of action is to cut spending.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Abbie Hoffman of the Right: Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has to be admitted that Donald Trump is doing exactly what he was elected to do.He was not elected to be a legislative president. He never showed any real interest in policy during the campaign. He was elected to be a cultural president. He was elected to shred the dominant American culture and to give voice to those who felt voiceless in that culture. He\u2019s doing that every day.What\u2019s troubling to me is that those who are the targets of his assaults seem to have no clue about what is going on. When they feel the most righteous, like this past weekend, they are actually losing and in the most peril.Let me try to explain what I think is happening:After World War II the Protestant establishment dominated the high ground of American culture and politics. That establishment eventually failed. It tolerated segregation and sexism, led the nation into war in Vietnam and became stultifying.So in the late 1960s along came a group of provocateurs like Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and the rest of the counterculture to upend the Protestant establishment. People like Hoffman were buffoons, but also masters of political theater.They never attracted majority support for their antics, but they didn\u2019t have to. All they had to do was provoke, offend the crew-cut crowd, generate outrage and set off a cycle that ripped apart the cultural consensus.The late 1960s were a time of intense cultural conflict, which left a lot of wreckage in its wake. But eventually a new establishment came into being, which we will call the meritocratic establishment.These were the tame heirs to Hoffman and Rubin. They were well educated. They cut their moral teeth on the civil rights and feminist movements. They embraced economic, social and moral individualism. They came to dominate the institutions of American society on both left and right.Hillary Clinton is part of this more educated cohort. So are parts of the conservative establishment. If you\u2019re reading this newspaper, you probably are, too, as am I.This establishment, too, has had its failures. It created an economy that benefits itself and leaves everybody else out. It led America into war in Iraq and sent the working class off to fight it. It has developed its own brand of cultural snobbery. Its media, film and music industries make members of the working class feel invisible and disrespected.So in 2016, members of the outraged working class elected their own Abbie Hoffman as president. Trump is not good at much, but he is wickedly good at sticking his thumb in the eye of the educated elites. He doesn\u2019t have to build a new culture, or even attract a majority. He just has to tear down the old one.That\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing. Donald Trump came into a segmenting culture and he is further tearing apart every fissure. He has a nose for every wound in the body politic and day after day he sticks a red-hot poker in one wound or another and rips it open.Day by day Trump is turning us into a nation of different planets. Each planet feels more righteous about itself and is more isolated from and offended by the other planets.The members of the educated class saw this past weekend\u2019s N.F.L. fracas as a fight over racism. They felt mobilized and unified in that fight and full of righteous energy. Members of the working class saw the fracas as a fight about American identity. They saw Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin try to dissuade Alejandro Villanueva, a three-time combat veteran, from celebrating the flag he risked his life for. Members of this class also felt mobilized, unified and full of righteous energy.I don\u2019t know which planet is bigger, or which would win an election, but that frankly doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is that Trump is shredding the culture and ending the dominance of the meritocratic establishment.He continually goes after racial matters in part because he\u2019s a bigot but also in part because multiculturalism is the theology of the educated class and it\u2019s the leverage point he can most effectively use to isolate the educated class from everyone else.He is so destructive because his enemies help him. He ramps up the aggression. His enemies ramp it up more, to preserve their own dignity. But the ensuing cultural violence only serves Trump\u2019s long-term destructive purpose. America is seeing nearly as much cultural conflict as it did in the late 1960s. It\u2019s quite possible that after four years of this Trump will have effectively destroyed the prevailing culture. The reign of the meritocratic establishment will be just as over as the reign of the Protestant establishment now is.Of course Donald Trump is a buffoon. Buffoonery is his most effective weapon. Because of him, a new culture will have to be built, new values promulgated and a new social fabric will have to be woven, one that brings the different planets back into relation with one another.That\u2019s the work of the next 20 years.Advertisement"}

Bloomberg said in an interview. \u201cYou see that in Silicon Valley. Here was a chance to get a bunch of people educated and create the economy of the future for New York City.\u201dTo create that economy, Cornell Tech will offer about a dozen masters and Ph.D. programs in fields like information science and electrical and computer engineering. It has been operating out of the Google building in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan since 2012. This will be the first academic year the institution, which now has about 300 students and 30 faculty members, will have its own home.On the inside, the building looks in some ways like a contemporary office tower, with open seating plans for Ph.D. candidates and faculty. The rooms are dotted with soundproof enclosures that serve as 21st-century phone booths, a Cornell official said, in that they have no phones, but offer privacy, a place to sit down and little shelf for a laptop. A collection of small meeting rooms are dominated by large art installations, an idea that Cornell said was borrowed from Pixar.\u201cI was particularly pleased with the academic building, which I was able to name for my daughters,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said. \u201cWhen we went over to take pictures, I was pleased that they were pleased,\u201d he laughed. \u201cYou never know!\u201dThe final building, the Bridge, will host work spaces and classrooms for Cornell Tech in about 30 percent of the building, while the rest will be leased to companies by the building\u2019s owner, Forest City New York. The roof of the Bridge is speckled with solar panels and a planted area.\u201cAcademic excellence here is necessary, but not sufficient,\u201d Dr. Huttenlocher said. \u201cYou also need to be engaged with the commercial or societal aspect of your work.\u201dRoosevelt Island is a bit of an anomaly in New York City.

Your site was a penitentiary!\u2019\u201d The penitentiary was so corrupt, Ms. Berdy said, that city officials decided the only way to fix it was to shut it down and start all over again, which they did by building on Rikers Island.The island\u2019s remove now offers Cornell Tech something unusual. It is in the city, but not of it. Though the campus is only about one-third built \u2014 two other major phases of construction are to follow by the year 2037, by agreement with the city \u2014 it has the nascent feel of its own little community, as well as a grassy green where students can sprawl, and impressive views.Beautiful as it is, being surrounded by water is taking on an increasingly ominous cast. Dr. Huttenlocher said that with potential flooding in mind, masonry from the Goldwater hospital building was ground up and the site was raised by almost seven feet, putting the height of the building entrances two feet above the 500-year flood level.\u201cNow, of course, with changing sea levels, those numbers are likely to change,\u201d Dr. Huttenlocher said. \u201cBut the other way to think about it is most of Manhattan south of 34th Street is actually lower than the entrances to these buildings.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Two Sentences in Tax Plan May Help Unleash $1 Billion in Lobbying", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The sweeping tax rewrite unveiled by President Trump and Republican lawmakers this past week leaves many of the details to Congress, but two sentences in the nine-page framework have Washington lobbyists salivating over a payday that some industry experts predict could top $1 billion.Tucked away on Page 8, the sentences refer vaguely to plans to repeal or roll back \u201cnumerous\u201d exclusions and deductions, and to \u201cmodernize\u201d tax rules affecting specific industries \u201cto ensure that the tax code better reflects economic reality and that such rules provide little opportunity for tax avoidance.\u201dAnd those fears are being stoked by lobbyists, who are urging clients and prospective clients to get out in front of any changes that could eliminate or weaken sections of the tax code that benefit them.\u201cYou\u2019re either going to be at the table, or you\u2019re going to be on the table,\u201d said Thomas M. Reynolds, a former Republican congressman from New York who served on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and is now a lobbyist at Holland & Knight focusing on tax issues. Most businesses that could be affected by the tax overhaul \u201cwill not have to be encouraged to engage,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said.\u201cEverybody is beginning to pay attention, and there is going to be a flurry of people looking for representation,\u201d he added.\u201cPeople have been expecting this all year. But the feeling that specific provisions could be put in play is now more real, and all of those provisions have a constituency and a lobbyist,\u201d said Randolf H. Hardock, a tax lobbyist at Davis & Harman. \u201cSome of it is just keeping clients informed, even if they don\u2019t ultimately engage, because there are issues that could come up right at the end, where if you\u2019re not paying attention, you could miss them.\u201dLobbying has expanded and evolved drastically since then: It\u2019s now a $3 billion industry with a sophisticated war-room approach that goes beyond simply buttonholing lawmakers to include comprehensive marketing and pressure campaigns.Those costly campaigns can pay off, as they did for those fighting a proposed tax on imports championed by many Republicans, including the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. A coalition of major retailers such as Wal-Mart, retail trade associations and manufacturers including Koch Industries banded together earlier this year with the single goal of killing the so-called border adjustment tax.But while the tax on imports was a clear target, the paucity of details in the new blueprint has created anxiety in corporate suites across the country, despite the overwhelming support in the business community for its proposed reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.Lobbyists are potentially facing two rounds of business-development opportunities: one in which they capitalize on the fear of getting attacked, and another when specific industries come under attack.Meanwhile, the details revealed so far are creating fissures within industries, such as real estate, as trade groups battle one another in an effort to strip out or protect various provisions under consideration.The National Association of Realtors is already out in force, criticizing aspects of the plan as dealing a devastating blow to the housing market and United States economy. While the framework specifically protects the mortgage interest deduction, real estate agents say the proposal to double the standard deduction and eliminate the state and local tax deduction would make buying a home less valuable.The National Association of Home Builders, by contrast, has come out in favor of the framework, saying the lower corporate tax rate, a new 25 percent tax rate for \u201cpass through\u201d businesses, and protection of the low-income housing tax credit will help builders, whose businesses benefit from both renters and home buyers.\u201cBy lowering the pass-through rate, the plan will reduce the tax bill of thousands of small businesses and help to spur job and economic growth,\u201d the chairman of the home builders association, Granger MacDonald, said in a statement. \u201cMore importantly, the blueprint maintains the low-income housing tax credit, the most indispensable tool to help produce affordable rental housing.\u201dMeredith McGehee, the chief of policy at Issue One, a nonprofit group that works to reduce the influence of deep-pocketed special interests in politics and government, said that \u201cthe estimate of $1 billion in lobbying expenditures is probably conservative.\u201dMs. McGehee, who has been both tracking lobbying and actually lobbying since 1987, predicted that many of the efforts to influence the details of the tax overhaul would not be disclosed under congressional lobbying rules because they would fall outside the scope of the direct contacts with federal government officials that prompt disclosure requirements.Several tax lobbyists said businesses and trade groups concerned about whether they could be in jeopardy as the plan develops should look to a tax reform bill released in 2014 by the House Ways and Means Committee under its then-chairman, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, a Republican who retired in 2015. That bill proposed ending all manner of loopholes and credits, including for insurance companies and research and experimentation.\u201cYou have to be out there working to make the case now, because everybody knows what the menu includes,\u201d said James Gould, a tax lobbyist who worked as a Senate tax aide during the 1986 reform effort.But Mr. Hardock said there might be some benefit in trying to stay out of the debate for companies or trade groups in industries that aren\u2019t being openly discussed as targets for revenue generation.\u201cThere are some industries that probably don\u2019t want to put their heads too far up, because that might draw unwelcome notice,\u201d he said.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Bike-Sharing Brings Out Bad Manners, China Asks, What\u2019s Wrong With Us?", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Liu Lijing, a mechanic in Beijing, does not usually pay much attention to manners. He does not mind when people blast loud music, and he strolls the alleyways near his home in a tank top stained with grease. But when a stranger recently ditched a bicycle in the bushes outside his door, Mr. Liu was irate.Start-ups have flooded the city with shared bikes, he complained, and people have been leaving them all over the place without thinking about other residents. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of decency anymore,\u201d he muttered, picking up the discarded bike and heaving it into the air in anger. \u201cWe treat each other like enemies.\u201dThere are now more than 16 million shared bicycles on the road in China\u2019s traffic-clogged cities, thanks to a fierce battle for market share among 70-plus companies backed by a total of more than $1 billion in financing. These start-ups have reshaped the urban landscape, putting bikes equipped with GPS and digital locks on almost every street corner in a way that Silicon Valley can only dream of.Such problems have raised questions about the sustainability of China\u2019s bike-share boom. But the debacle has also led many Chinese to look for deeper explanations and ask if bike-sharing has revealed essential flaws in the national character, prompting a far-reaching debate about social decay and the decline of decorum and morality in the country.In many cities, the supply of bicycles far exceeds demand, bringing chaos to sidewalks, bus stops and intersections and prompting grumbles that excessive competitiveness \u2014 seen as a national trait \u2014 is spoiling a good thing. In Shanghai, where officials have struggled to maintain order, there is now one shared bike for every 16 people, according to government statistics.In some places, the authorities have confiscated tens of thousands of bicycles and imposed parking restrictions. News outlets have documented the waste with astounding images of mountains of candy-colored bicycles, each hue representing a different bike-share company.\u201cIt\u2019s a battle every day,\u201d said Ke Jin, a security guard at a residential compound in northeast Beijing, as he cleared a path that had been blocked by a tangled heap of blue and yellow bikes. \u201cIt\u2019s human nature not to care.\u201dOn social media and in conversation, it is common to hear people describe bike-sharing as a \u201cmonster-revealing mirror\u201d that has exposed the true nature of the Chinese people. In that sense, it is the latest chapter in a line of critical introspection that stretches back before the Communist Revolution, when the famed writer Lu Xun assailed Chinese culture as selfish, boastful, servile and cruel.Technology executives who work in the so-called sharing economy and depend on good behavior for profit are now among the more prominent critics.One start-up, 3V Bike, was forced to shut down in June after nearly all its 1,000 bicycles were stolen from the streets of small cities. In interviews with Chinese news outlets, the company\u2019s founder, Wu Shenghua, blamed the public\u2019s \u201cpoor suzhi\u201d in part for driving the company out of business.Others have argued that theft and vandalism of bicycles had been overstated, that some disorder was to be expected with innovation and that misbehavior would be worse in other countries.Hu Weiwei, founder and president of Mobike, one of the most popular bike-sharing apps in China, said the benefits of shared bicycles far outweighed any inconvenience, noting reductions in carbon emissions and improvements in traffic.\u201cPublic properties are seen as having no owner,\u201d he said, \u201ctherefore people believe they can take advantage of them.\u201dBut Mr. Yan said the overall success of bike sharing suggested that mutual trust was growing in China.Some citizens have formed volunteer groups to take up the cause of promoting the common good.Zhao Qi, 23, an architect, spends much of his free time as a \u201cbike hunter,\u201d roaming the streets of Beijing looking for vandalized bikes and misbehaving riders.Mr. Zhao said he was motivated partly by patriotism. China has been pushing for years to develop technology products that catch fire overseas. Many now see promise in bike-sharing, with the domestic news media hailing it as one of China\u2019s four great modern inventions, drawing a comparison with the ancient inventions of gunpowder, paper, printing and the compass.\u201cThis is a symbol of national pride \u2014 a gift from China to the world,\u201d Mr. Zhao said. \u201cWe can\u2019t mess it up.\u201dAnother volunteer, Cheng Xiaofeng, 46, who works for a state-owned investment company, said she had reported more than 4,000 improperly parked bicycles since April.\u201cI believe that people are kind, and that human nature is good,\u201d she said. \u201cBut sometimes they fall under bad influences and need to be corrected.\u201dOn a recent evening, Ms. Cheng came upon a woman trying to park a bicycle inside a residential compound near the Lama Temple, in Beijing, in violation of rules set by bike-sharing companies. Ms. Cheng tried to persuade her to reconsider. The woman gave a confused look, left the bike and walked away.Yang Xiong contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Confident Fed Sets Stage for December Rate Increase", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Nearly a decade after the Federal Reserve embarked on an unprecedented effort to shore up the collapsing American economy, the central bank said on Wednesday that it would begin withdrawing some of the trillions of dollars it invested in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.The decision, while widely expected, is nevertheless a significant sign that the Fed is confident that economic growth and low unemployment will continue. In other words, the central bank believes that the American economy has emerged safely from the crisis.\u201cThe basic message here is U.S. economic performance has been good,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said at a news conference following a two-day meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy committee.The Fed\u2019s retreat from its post-crisis stimulus campaign will be slow but steady as the central bank looks to shrink the enormous $4 trillion portfolio it amassed through a bond-buying spree.Those efforts, known as quantitative easing, plunged the Fed into uncharted waters as it tried to navigate the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The Fed came under stiff criticism for the program, prompting many Republican lawmakers to question whether the Fed should remain independent.The Fed, which stopped its buying spree in 2014, is now preparing to pare back its holdings by about $10 billion per month initially. That is likely to raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, but only very slowly. Indeed, since the Fed ended its bond-buying, countervailing factors have actually reduced some borrowing costs, like the average interest rate on 30-year mortgages.Investors are watching warily, but so far there is little sign that the Fed\u2019s retreat is tightening financial conditions. Stock prices fell modestly after the Fed\u2019s 2 p.m. policy announcement, but bounced back by the end of the trading day. The S&P 500 index rose 1.59 points, closing at 2,508.24.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury also rose 0.02 percentage points, closing at 2.27 percent.\u201cThe Fed did an extremely good job of preparing us for commencing the balance sheet rundown,\u201d said Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cThat\u2019s happening with a whimper, but handled differently, it could have been a big event.\u201dThe Fed, which has raised its benchmark interest rate twice this year, left that rate unchanged Wednesday, but indicated that it plans a third rate increase later this year as economic conditions continue to strengthen. The Fed said it expects the labor market to continue strengthening and the economy to expand at a moderate pace.Twelve of the 16 officials on the Federal Open Market Committee predicted another rate increase this year, the same number as in the Fed\u2019s last round of forecasts in June.The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate now sits in a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent, a level most Fed officials regard as providing modest encouragement for borrowing.The Fed\u2019s next meeting is scheduled for Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, but the Fed is unlikely to raise rates any sooner than its final meeting of the year, in mid-December.Some economic indicators suggest that higher rates are warranted: The unemployment rate, at 4.4 percent in August, is below the level most officials regard as sustainable. Moreover, Fed officials predicted that the rate would fall to 4.1 percent next year.But other economic measures paint a contrasting picture. Job growth remains strong, suggesting that the work force is still expanding; wage growth is modest, suggesting employers are still able to find workers with relative ease; and inflation weakened in recent months, puzzling Fed officials and economists who had predicted that prices would begin to rise more quickly as labor market conditions tightened.The Fed\u2019s preferred measure of price inflation increased by just 1.4 percent during the 12 months ending in July, the most recent available data. The Fed is likely to undershoot its target of 2 percent annual inflation for the sixth consecutive year. That has caused consternation among some economists and Fed officials, who are wary of raising rates given the Fed\u2019s inability so far to achieve its inflation objectives.\u201cI can\u2019t say this year that I can easily point to a sufficient set of factors\u201d to explain low inflation, Ms. Yellen said Wednesday. She added, however, that low inflation this year did not imply low inflation next year. \u201cWhat we need to do is figure out whether the factors that have lowered inflation are going to prove persistent,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen said that weak inflation readings earlier this year \u201creflect developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions.\u201d Similarly, she said that the Fed expected the impact of hurricanes on gas prices to increase inflation temporarily. So far, the Fed\u2019s assessment of underlying conditions remains unchanged: Ms. Yellen and her colleagues expect inflation to stabilize at its target of 2 percent a year.The Fed wants to use its benchmark rate to manage economic conditions while gradually draining its investment portfolio in the background. When Ms. Yellen described the Fed\u2019s plans in June, she expressed hope that the process would be like \u201cwatching paint dry.\u201dThe Fed holds about $4.2 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, which it accumulated to put downward pressure on interest rates. It must regularly replenish its holdings as bonds mature. Beginning in October, it plans to withhold $10 billion a month from the reinvestment process \u2014 in effect causing that much money to disappear.It will then increase the pace by $10 billion each quarter until reaching a monthly rate of $50 billion, and then maintain that pace until it reaches an unspecified finishing line.Ms. Yellen emphasized that the Fed did not plan to adjust that schedule, although she added, \u201cunless we think that the threat to the economy is sufficiently great.\u201dStill, questions remain, both about the market\u2019s reaction and about the goal. Before the crisis, the Fed held less than $900 billion in assets, and most analysts expect the Fed to maintain a significantly larger balance sheet going forward \u2014 both because the financial system has grown and because the Fed has expanded its role in maintaining the system.The Fed\u2019s slow pace also means it will take years to rebuild its ability to respond to crises. It does not expect its benchmark rate to reach 2.8 percent for three years, and it expects to take even longer to reduce its balance sheet.\u201cIf we get a severe adverse shock in the next couple of years and interest rates are still pretty low and the balance sheet is still pretty big, what in the world are we going to do?\u201d asked Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College professor of economics.Ms. Yellen paused when she was asked that question on Wednesday.\u201cWe have a certain amount of room now,\u201d she finally said.She noted that the Fed could buy more bonds. It could also engage in \u201cforward guidance,\u201d or promising keep rates at a low level for a specified period.\u201cHurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have devastated many communities, inflicting severe hardship,\u201d the Fed said. \u201cStorm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.\u201dTiffany Hsu contributed reporting from New York.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Can\u2019t We Get Cities Right?", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe waters are receding in Houston, and so, inevitably, is national interest. But Harvey will leave a huge amount of wreckage behind, some of it invisible. In particular, we don\u2019t yet know just how much poison has been released by flooding of chemical plants, waste dumps, and more. But it\u2019s a good bet that more people will eventually die from the toxins Harvey leaves behind than were killed during the storm itself.Anyway, Harvey was an epic disaster. And it was a disaster brought on, in large part, by bad policy. As many have pointed out, what made Houston so vulnerable to flooding was rampant, unregulated development. Put it this way: Greater Houston still has less than a third as many people as greater New York, but it covers roughly the same area, and probably has a smaller percentage of land that hasn\u2019t been paved or built on.Houston\u2019s sprawl gave the city terrible traffic and an outsized pollution footprint even before the hurricane. When the rains came, the vast paved-over area meant that rising waters had nowhere to go.So is Houston\u2019s disaster a lesson in the importance of urban land-use regulation, of not letting developers build whatever they want, wherever they want? Yes, but.To understand that \u201cbut,\u201d consider the different kind of disaster taking place in San Francisco. Where Houston has long been famous for its virtual absence of regulations on building, greater San Francisco is famous for its NIMBYism \u2014 that is, the power of \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d sentiment to prevent new housing construction. The Bay Area economy has boomed in recent years, mainly thanks to Silicon Valley; but very few new housing units have been added.And while geography \u2014 the constraint imposed by water and mountains \u2014 is often offered as an excuse for the Bay Area\u2019s failure to build more housing, there\u2019s no good reason it couldn\u2019t build up. San Francisco housing is now quite a lot more expensive than New York housing, so why not have more tall buildings?Houston and San Francisco are extreme cases, but not that extreme. It turns out that America\u2019s big metropolitan areas are pretty sharply divided between Sunbelt cities where anything goes, like Houston or Atlanta, and those on the East or West Coast where nothing goes, like San Francisco or, to a lesser extent, New York. (Chicago is a huge city with dense development but relatively low housing prices; maybe it has some lessons to teach the rest of us?)The point is that this is one policy area where \u201cboth sides get it wrong\u201d \u2014 a claim I usually despise \u2014 turns out to be right. NIMBYism is bad for working families and the U.S. economy as a whole, strangling growth precisely where workers are most productive. But unrestricted development imposes large costs in the form of traffic congestion, pollution, and, as we\u2019ve just seen, vulnerability to disaster.Why can\u2019t we get urban policy right? It\u2019s not hard to see what we should be doing. We should have regulation that prevents clear hazards, like exploding chemical plants in the middle of residential neighborhoods, preserves a fair amount of open land, but allows housing construction.In particular, we should encourage construction that takes advantage of the most effective mass transit technology yet devised: the elevator.In practice, however, policy all too often ends up being captured by interest groups. In sprawling cities, real-estate developers exert outsized influence, and the more these cities sprawl, the more powerful the developers get. In NIMBY cities, soaring prices make affluent homeowners even less willing to let newcomers in.Can America break out of these political traps? Maybe. In blue states where cities build too little, there\u2019s a growing political movement calling for more housing supply. Until now, there\u2019s been much less evidence of second thoughts about unmanaged development in red states, but Harvey may serve as a wake-up call.One thing is clear: How we manage urban land is a really important issue, with huge impacts on American lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Immigrants Shouldn\u2019t Have to Be \u2018Talented\u2019 to Be Welcome", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe terms of the debate over President Trump\u2019s decision to revoke the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program are familiar, as are the terms of the larger conversation about immigration in this country: On one side are hardworking immigrants; on the other are politicians who wrongly claim that these immigrants harm the economic interests of native-born Americans.As protests broke out across the United States in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s move, reporters and immigrant advocates stressed that the administration\u2019s actions will hurt achievers \u2014 people who have graduated from college, people who have bought houses, people who work for high-tech companies.But something goes awry when this becomes the dominant story told about immigrants in America. This has been happening for a number of years: The good people of America talk about immigrants as hard workers who conscientiously contribute to the economy. (I myself have made it onto a few lists of exemplary immigrant success stories.) In fact, DACA was designed to reward achievement: to qualify for the program, an applicant had to be in school or hold a high school diploma or equivalent, or have been honorably discharged from the armed forces. Those who hadn\u2019t been able or lucky to meet those requirements were apparently deemed unworthy of staying in the country where they had lived since they were children.These arguments usually begin by stating that America is a \u201cland of immigrants.\u201d This not only is an insult to Native Americans and the descendants of those who were brought to this country against their will but also constitutes a sort of sleight of hand. It turns the stories of individual immigrants into the \u201cstory of America.\u201d It\u2019s one thing for individuals to base their sense of self-worth on their contribution to the American economy. It\u2019s quite another to claim that America values immigrants because of this contribution: This paves the way to thinking that America should make decisions about immigrants based on whether they benefit the economy. It can even reframe giving safe haven to the persecuted as giving jobs to the well qualified.But what\u2019s wrong with the decision to discontinue DACA is that people \u2014 not workers \u2014 will be deported. Lives \u2014 not careers \u2014 will be shattered. The problem is that it\u2019s inhumane. As long as politicians consider it necessary to qualify the victims as \u201chardworking\u201d or \u201ctalented,\u201d they fail to stand up to the administration\u2019s fundamentally hateful immigration agenda.The reform package backed by Mr. Trump last month also claims to pursue economic aims. Neither Democrats nor Republicans \u2014 nor critics in the news media \u2014 have taken issue with this underlying premise: They have largely argued that the package proposes the wrong means for reaching economic ends. The plan would limit immigration to the young, highly educated and highly qualified. It would effectively stop immigrants from being able to bring family members to the United States. If an immigrant is but a cog in the economic machine, then what do parents, grown children and siblings matter? The logic is dehumanizing but hardly new or unique to the Republican Party. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign plank argued for preserving family-based visas in the following terms: \u201cFamily is integral to a worker\u2019s pursuit of happiness and economic productivity.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s platform made the barest mention of refugees. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s published program made none. Mr. Trump, of course, wanted to drastically reduce the already small number of refugees that the United States accepts.If immigration is debated only in terms of whether it benefits the economy, politicians begin to divide people into two categories: \u201cvaluable\u201d and \u201cillegal.\u201d When countries make people illegal, the world comes apart. When we agree to talk about people as cogs, we lose our humanity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why We Need Political Parties", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld ReviewIn less than a decade, the world went from worrying about financial crashes to worrying about crashing democracies.Starting in 2008, we were distressed over which economy would topple next, or whether the next banking crisis would wipe out people\u2019s savings. Yet the Great Recession was not as prolonged as we feared \u2014 the hardest-hit economies have recovered, or are in the process of doing so.What has not returned to precrisis mode is politics. Today political parties \u2014 essential to strong democratic systems \u2014 are becoming something of an endangered species.Surprisingly, even emerging markets with fast-growing economies and stellar records of lifting people out of poverty, like Brazil, faced challenges from angry populations disappointed with their governments and empowered by social media and other new technologies.In developing countries, it is common for people\u2019s expectations to grow at a faster pace than the capacity of the state to meet them. Money is always short, and public institutions are often ineffective. So even though the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Latin America and Africa are improving, that doesn\u2019t mean that people are content. And it has become clear that economic progress and prosperity do not always buy political stability.The global wave of political anger sweeping many rich and poor countries alike is also fed by a newfound impatience with corruption.In the last decade, societies in which corruption used to be treated as a fact of life developed a strong intolerance to official thievery and ousted once-untouchable politicians. In Brazil and India, Russia and Spain, people took to the streets to denounce corruption by the powerful.And too often those in power were also leaders of traditional political parties. When such leaders are caught stealing, it becomes another stain on parties, whose prestige and allure have been steadily waning. These days, political parties are seen not as natural habitats for idealists but for fast-talking and often hypocritical opportunists and careerists.These days, calls for a new political order usually require the ouster of political parties and elected leaders, and in many cases that is the correct call. Corrupt and ineffectual organizations need to be replaced by effective ones.Yet many activists harbor the misconception that the answer lies in nongovernmental organizations, or in loose, nonhierarchical movements.Democracies, however, need political parties. We need permanent organizations that earn political power and govern, that are forced to articulate disparate interests and viewpoints, that can recruit and develop future government leaders and that monitor those already in power.Political leaders need to have a stance on preschool education and nuclear weapons, health care and agriculture, and have well-articulated views on fighting terrorism and regulating banks, among myriad other policy issues. And political parties are the training camps of these leaders.To survive, political parties must regain the ability to inspire and mobilize people \u2014 especially the young \u2014 who might otherwise disdain politics or prefer to channel whatever political energy they have through single-issue groups. Parties must be willing to overhaul their structures, mind-sets and methods to adapt to a new world. We also need to bring party renewal to the foreground in any discussion of contemporary politics.In the decade since the financial crisis, almost everything we do \u2014 eating, reading, shopping, dating, traveling and communicating \u2014 was disrupted by new technologies and innovation. Everything, that is, except the way we govern ourselves.We need a disruptive innovation that pulls democratic parties into the 21st century.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Wisconsin, Foxconn Vowed Big Spending in Brazil. Few Jobs Have Come.", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a news conference in Brazil, Foxconn officials unveiled plans to invest billions of dollars and build one of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturing hubs in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. The government had high expectations that the project would yield 100,000 jobs.Six years later, Brazil is still waiting for most of those jobs to materialize.\u201cThe area where Foxconn said it would build a plant is totally abandoned,\u201d said Guilherme Gazzola, the mayor of Itu, one of the cities that hoped to benefit from the project. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even expressed an interest in meeting us.\u201dFoxconn\u2019s experience in Brazil and other parts of the world illustrates how difficult it has been for it to replicate its enormously successful Chinese manufacturing model elsewhere.But the model does not translate easily to other countries, where Foxconn must navigate different social, political and labor conditions.In Brazil, Foxconn\u2019s plans unraveled quickly. The administration that had wooed the company was soon swept from power amid corruption allegations and an impeachment vote. Some of the tax breaks that had been promised were reduced or abandoned, as economic growth and consumer spending slumped.Today, Foxconn employs only about 2,800 workers in Brazil.Foxconn does the \u201cbig song and dance, bringing out the Chinese dragon dancers, ribbon cuttings, toasts and signature of the usual boilerplate agreements,\u201d said Alberto Moel, an investor and adviser to early-stage tech companies who until recently was a technology analyst at the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cThen, when it gets down to brass tacks, something way smaller materializes.\u201dFoxconn said in a statement that it was committed to investing billions of dollars in building facilities outside China. But the company also said it had been forced to adapt to changing conditions in markets like Brazil, where the economy had stagnated.\u201cThis and the changing needs of our customers that our proposed investments were designed to serve have resulted in scaled down operations in the country at this time,\u201d the company said in its statement.With regard to the Wisconsin project, Foxconn has said it plans to build one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturing campuses in the southeastern part of the state. The company expects the buildings that will make up the campus to total 20 million square feet \u2014 about three times the size of the Pentagon \u2014 and to help transform the region into a major production center for flat-panel display screens.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, called the Foxconn deal a \u201cgame changer\u201d that could help spur a manufacturing revival in the Midwest. At the White House in July, President Trump hailed the agreement as a great one for American manufacturing, American workers and \u201ceverybody who believes in the concept, in the label, Made in the U.S.A.\u201d Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin officially approved the deal on Monday.Foxconn has good reason to diversify its manufacturing operations. About 95 percent of the company\u2019s 1.1 million employees work in China. Building a large work force elsewhere could reduce the company\u2019s reliance on a single locale, lowering its risk if countries imposed tariffs or other trade barriers on Chinese exports.But exporting Foxconn\u2019s Chinese strategy is virtually impossible.The global supply chain for electronics remains firmly rooted in Asia, where advantages like low-cost labor and an abundance of skilled engineers have been crucial to the region\u2019s development as a manufacturing base.What makes Foxconn\u2019s Chinese operations really hum are the extraordinary level of government subsidies and support, and the sheer scale of those operations. Local governments often finance and build the company\u2019s factories, manage its dormitories and recruit tens of thousands of workers. Some government officials have gone door to door in small counties to recruit workers.The government aid can reach into the billions of dollars.Foxconn began to shift large-scale production operations beyond China in about 2009, when it opened plants elsewhere in Asia, including Vietnam and India. The company now has factories in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, and a large plant in Mexico that employs 18,000 workers.When several countries began to require that some components be made locally as a way of encouraging production at home, Foxconn stepped up its efforts to build outside China. And company executives essentially followed the same playbook they had used inside China.Foxconn\u2019s chairman, Terry Gou, met with high-ranking leaders, including Brazil\u2019s president at the time, Dilma Rousseff, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. Mr. Gou made pledges; won tax breaks and government concessions; and announced plans to spend billions of dollars to create tens of thousands of jobs in multiple countries. Brazil called one of the planned Foxconn sites the \u201cCity of the Future.\u201dThen reality set in.Labor strikes in India and Vietnam prompted Foxconn\u2019s operations in those countries to be shut down temporarily. Political and economic turmoil in Brazil led the authorities there to scale back some of tax breaks it had offered the company. A plan to invest $1 billion in the construction of a plant in Jakarta, Indonesia, collapsed, partly because Foxconn could not develop the supply chain it had hoped to, according to analysts and government officials.Foxconn\u2019s plans also fizzled in Pennsylvania. In 2013, the company, which has a small office in Harrisburg, said it intended to build a $30 million factory in the state that could employ 500 workers. The plant has yet to be built.Pennsylvania officials declined to comment on why the factory had not been built, but said that they had not given up hope. (Foxconn also did not comment.)\u201cWe do not believe Pennsylvania is out of the running for any particular project,\u201d David Smith, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development in Harrisburg, said about Foxconn\u2019s commitment in the state.For Foxconn, the move to Wisconsin offers political benefits.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump skewered China over what he deemed its unfair trade practices. He vowed to force Apple to make its products in the United States and said his administration might impose a border tax on imports, raising the prospect of a trade war.After the election, Foxconn joined a parade of global companies bearing promises.Jack Ma, the executive chairman of the Chinese internet giant Alibaba, arrived at Trump Tower in New York and pledged to create one million jobs in America. Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank of Japan, said his company would invest $50 billion in the United States. And at around the same time, Foxconn said it was planning to build production facilities in the United States.Wisconsin lawmakers pushed it through nonetheless, and when Mr. Walker approved the deal on Monday, he called it \u201ca truly transformational step for our state.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Brazil, and Joe Cochrane from Indonesia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Pitches Tax Cuts as \u2018Rocket Fuel\u2019 for the Economy", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump took his push for deep tax cuts to a supportive audience of manufacturers on Friday, arguing that reducing levies on businesses will be \u201crocket fuel\u201d to propel economic growth and ultimately translate to more jobs and better wages for American workers, as well.\u201cUnder my administration, the era of economic surrender is over and the rebirth of American industry is beginning,\u201d he said in a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers. \u201cAmerica is winning again and America is being respected again.\u201d Arguing that most manufacturers will see their tax rates fall to levels not seen in many years, Mr. Trump said, \u201cit will be rocket fuel for our economy.\u201dThe framework crafted by the administration with Republican lawmakers would lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and create a new 25 percent rate for so-called pass-through businesses like partnerships and sole proprietorships that are currently taxed at the rate of their owners.About 95 percent of businesses in the United States are structured as pass-throughs, and they account for most of the corporate tax revenue paid to the government. Businesses would be allowed to deduct the full cost of new equipment in the first year rather than spread it out over time.Mr. Trump said the net effect would be \u201ca giant, beautiful, massive \u2014 the biggest ever in our country \u2014 tax cut\u201d and called on business to press Congress to pass it. \u201cWith your help and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land we will bring back our great American dream,\u201d Mr. Trump told the audience of manufacturing executives gathered at a Washington hotel.But in addressing the manufacturers association, Mr. Trump was preaching to the choir. The group said a survey of its members found that most reported that a package of tax cuts would make them more likely to expand their business, hire more workers and increase wages and benefits. The group\u2019s survey found that over the past nine months, 91 percent felt optimistic about the outlook for their businesses, the highest three-quarter average in its 20-year history.\u201cToday\u2019s tax code lets other countries win, and our workers and our families are paying the price and we have an obligation to speak out,\u201d said Jay Timmons, the association\u2019s president. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go big, it\u2019s time to go bold \u2014 and manufacturers are grateful to have a president who agrees.\u201dFollow Peter Baker on twitter @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Washington Set Puerto Rico Up for Disaster", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIt\u2019s been more than a week since I\u2019ve had any word in New York from my 93-year-old father in Puerto Rico. He lives in Coamo, a town in the path of the worst storm to hit the island since 1928. My experience has been shared by millions of Puerto Ricans in the diaspora since Hurricane Maria wreaked its havoc on Sept. 20.The so-called natural disaster wiped out the deteriorating infrastructure of the entire commonwealth, destroying homes and roads, and leaving Puerto Rico without electricity. Estimates are that it will take months to make the grid fully functional again. The loss of communications has meant no news at all from the more remote communities like Coamo, which is also my hometown.This wasn\u2019t just nature\u2019s work. Another type of storm had been pounding the island long before last week. With no real representation in Washington, Puerto Rico has always been subject to the whims of stateside politicians unaccountable to the island\u2019s people. More than half a century ago, tax breaks lured industry from the mainland to Puerto Rico, but in recent decades those advantages were yanked back. That set the stage for vulture hedge funds to swoop into the vacuum, but left hospitals, schools, electrical and communications grids too underfunded and fragile to weather a Category 4 hurricane.The cruelly named Promesa law (\u201cpromesa\u201d means \u201cpromise\u201d in Spanish) passed by Congress last year was supposed to resolve the debt crisis and right Puerto Rico\u2019s economy. But any meaningful recovery for Puerto Rican families remains a distant hope. The commonwealth\u2019s tight budget has made life on the island impossible for hundreds of thousands of families. They migrated to the mainland; in Central Florida, they were arriving daily by the hundreds before hurricane season.Then came Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Immediate needs on the island include search and rescue, getting communications back up and clearing roads to get goods and help to people who need it. Beyond that, though, Puerto Rico needs Congress to help it recover from the devastation wrought by economic strategies that have failed the island for decades.Congress and the Trump administration cannot hide behind the Financial Oversight Board created by Promesa \u2014 a semi-colonial entity that in effect controls Puerto Rico\u2019s future. To undo the damage done by years of neglect and abuse by corporations that strip-mined profits out of Puerto Rico with federal blessing, Congress must act to create conditions for a sustainable economy.On Thursday, the Trump administration said it would temporarily waive the century-old Jones Act, which Puerto Rican officials said was slowing delivery of relief supplies. The act requires ships carrying cargo to the island to be built and owned by Americans, and to make port in the mainland United States before continuing on to Puerto Rico. A temporary waiver will help, but it is not enough; Congress must repeal the act itself, because it has hindered economic growth and stability on the island even in the best of times.In addition, whatever emergency assistance the Federal Emergency Management Agency sends must come with no strings attached.It\u2019s time we faced facts about Puerto Rico\u2019s debt: as former Governor Padilla said, it\u2019s unpayable. The only thing Promesa has done for the people of Puerto Rico is put a temporary stay on claims from bondholders and other creditors. Even as he acknowledged the disaster, President Trump reminded people on Monday that the island, \u201cwhich was already suffering from broken infrastructure and massive debt, is in deep trouble.\u201dIt would be immoral to insist that before Puerto Ricans can rebuild their homes, hospitals, schools and roads, they must pay back this onerous debt. Instead, repayment must be postponed, maybe even eliminated. The banks that have benefited from the debt must take their own losses and let people come first.Already, the vultures have been circling. Even as Maria hit Puerto Rico, hedge fund creditors were filing motions in court to further their claims to be repaid \u2014 sparing no thought for need for rescue, recovery and rebuilding in the coming months.A good model for recovery and moving forward is the Marshall Plan, which Washington passed into law after World War II to help rebuild the economies of Western Europe, restoring confidence and prosperity for generations.In the past few years, Puerto Ricans like me across the United States have come together to support our families still on the island, and to demand an end to the cuts that have made life harder and harder for our parents, our brothers and sisters. We will send help to them and our communities, but we must also defend them in the States, by resisting any measures from Washington that will make matters worse.As the president of a union that represents thousands of Puerto Ricans along the East Coast \u2014 from Boston to New York to Florida \u2014 I will push our congressional representatives to extend the moratorium on the debt service and create a comprehensive plan to get the island back on its feet.In the past, terrible storms like the one in 1928 set Puerto Rico back. I hope we can use this opportunity to make changes that will leave the island more resilient.As I await news from my family, I think about the long road back to normality ahead of us. And I hope our fellow Americans will stand in solidarity with us and demand lasting relief from the crisis we face today.All we really need, like the tropical forests crippled by the storm, is an opportunity to grow again, in a sustainable and more equitable way.Hector Figueroa is president of Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union.This article has been updated to reflect news developments about a decision to waive the Jones Act.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Agrees to Let Women Drive", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySaudi Arabia announced on Tuesday that it would allow women to drive, ending a longstanding policy that has become a global symbol of the oppression of women in the ultraconservative kingdom.The change, which will take effect in June 2018, was announced in a royal decree read live on state television and in a simultaneous media event in Washington. The decision highlights the damage that the ban on women driving has done to the kingdom\u2019s international reputation and its hopes for a public relations benefit from the reform.Saudi leaders also hope the new policy will help the economy by increasing women\u2019s participation in the workplace. Many working Saudi women spend much of their salaries on drivers or must be driven to work by male relatives.\u201cIt is amazing,\u201d said Fawziah al-Bakr, a Saudi university professor who was among 47 women who participated in the kingdom\u2019s first protest against the ban \u2014 in 1990. After driving around the Saudi capital, Riyadh, the women were arrested and some lost their jobs.\u201cSince that day, Saudi women have been asking for the right to drive, and finally it arrived,\u201d she said by phone. \u201cWe have been waiting for a very long time.\u201dSaudi Arabia, home to Islam\u2019s holiest sites, is an absolute monarchy ruled according to Shariah law. Saudi officials and clerics have provided numerous explanations for the ban over the years.Some said that it was inappropriate in Saudi culture for women to drive, or that male drivers would not know how to handle having women in cars next to them. Others argued that allowing women to drive would lead to promiscuity and the collapse of the Saudi family. One cleric claimed \u2014 with no evidence \u2014 that driving harmed women\u2019s ovaries.In 2014, Loujain Hathloul was arrested after trying to cross the border from the United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia and detained for 73 days.The decision won near universal praise in Washington. Heather Nauert, the State Department\u2019s spokeswoman, called it \u201ca great step in the right direction for that country.\u201dThe momentum to change the policy picked up in recent years with the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the king\u2019s 32-year-old son, who has laid out a far-reaching plan to overhaul the kingdom\u2019s economy and society.Increasing numbers of women are working in a growing number of professions, and in 2015, women were allowed to vote and to run for seats on the kingdom\u2019s local councils.Ending the ban on women driving is expected to face some resistance inside the kingdom, where families are highly patriarchal and some men say they worry about their female relatives getting stranded should their cars break down.But in a small news conference at the Saudi embassy in Washington, an exuberant Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador, said women would be able to obtain driver\u2019s licenses without having to ask permission of their husbands, fathers or any male guardian \u2014 despite so-called \u201cguardianship\u201d laws that give men power over their female relatives.Under these laws, women cannot travel abroad, work or undergo some medical procedures without the consent of their male \u201cguardian,\u201d often a father, a husband or even a son. While the enforcement of guardianship laws has loosened in recent years, there is little to stop Saudi men from greatly limiting the movements of their wives or daughters.The ambassador, who is a son of the king, said that women would be able to drive alone but that the Interior Ministry would decide whether they could work as professional drivers.He said he did not expect the change in policy to face significant resistance.\u201cI think our society is ready,\u201d he said.That remains an open question. Many Saudis remain deeply conservative, and social strictures like the driving ban have been reinforced over the years by the kingdom\u2019s top clerics, many of them on the government payroll.After the change on the driving ban was announced, an anonymous text circulated through What\u2019s App in the kingdom calling on the \u201cvirtuous ones\u201d to work against its implementation, to protect against epidemics, adultery and other disasters.At the news conference, the ambassador insisted that the decision would not be reversed or seriously opposed.Beyond the effects it could have on Saudi Arabia\u2019s image abroad, letting women drive could help the Saudi economy.In recent years, many women have come to rely on ride-sharing apps like Uber and Careem to gain some freedom of movement.Many of the kingdom\u2019s professionals and young people will welcome the change, viewing it as a step to making life in the country a bit more like life elsewhere.Ms. Sharif was instrumental in organizing groups of women for collective protests to demand an end to the ban on female drivers. She was arrested at the time for taking part in the actions, and later wrote a book about her experience. She now lives in Australia.But despite celebrating the success for female drivers, she said the next campaign would be to end guardianship laws.The royal decree, read by an announcer of state television and signed by King Salman, said traffic laws would be amended, including to allow the government to issue driver\u2019s licenses \u201cto men and women alike.\u201dThe decree said a high-level ministerial committee was being formed to study other issues that needed to be addressed for the change to take place. For example, the police will have to be trained to interact with women in a way that they rarely do in Saudi Arabia, a society where men and women who are not related have little contact.The committee has 30 days to provide its recommendations, the decree said, so that the new policy can be carried out starting on June 24, 2018.The decree said that the majority of the Council of Senior Scholars \u2014 the kingdom\u2019s top clerical body, whose members are appointed by the king \u2014 had agreed that the government could allow women to drive if done in accordance with Shariah law.Gardiner Harris and Megan Specia contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Corruption and Venality Were the Lifeblood of America", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cThe Gilded Age: A Tale of Today,\u201d which Mark Twain co-wrote with Charles Dudley Warner, isn\u2019t much of a novel but it has two strong features. First, a guileful character: the backwoods beauty Laura Hawkins, who falls in with a corrupt United States senator, connives her way to the top of Washington high society, beats a murder rap after a sensational trial, then suddenly dies of remorse (a fate the authors\u2019 wives evidently insisted upon). Second, its excellent title, which remains American historians\u2019 standard label for the fourth quarter of the 19th century.\u201cThe Republic for Which It Stands,\u201d Richard White\u2019s new history of that age, as well as the Reconstruction decade that preceded it, is a capacious and forceful book with a dull title \u2014 the inverse of Twain and Warner\u2019s satire. Instead of one arresting character, White develops dozens. (Among them are two Henry Adamses, the dyspeptic historian whom you know and a Louisiana ex-slave who courageously fought white terrorists before he encouraged freed men and women to migrate en masse, first to Liberia, then to Kansas.) The Gilded Age will keep its name, but White\u2019s book ought to worsen its already dismal reputation for sordidness and rapacity.But that promise, White demonstrates, turned out to be treacherous. The ambiguous liberal ideals of contract freedom and self-regulation that helped eradicate slavery became instruments for brute and chaotic corporate power. With the ex-slaves betrayed and the Indians conquered at last, an \u201cuncommon\u201d America emerged, characterized by neither the imperatives of creative destruction nor even simple greed as much as by extravagance, mismanagement and predatory flimflam. Risk-taking and rugged individualism, big business\u2019s eternally self-proclaimed virtues, were in extremely short supply at the top; Gilded Age fortunes sprang from government subsidies, insider tips and, above all, the corruption required to get these favors. \u201cCorruption suffused government and the economy,\u201d White writes; it was not a distortion of the system but the system\u2019s lifeblood.The book begins with an evocative description of the public mourning and funeral of Abraham Lincoln, whose tragic shade haunts every chapter. Lincoln would be revered as the Union\u2019s savior and the Great Emancipator, but his envisaged \u201cnew birth of freedom\u201d would soon enough be suppressed. White treats the decade after Appomattox (with a nod to the historian Elliott West) as the Greater Reconstruction, in which the federal government aimed to clear out the Far West as well as tame the defeated South by inculcating the virtues of free labor and economic development. White also suggests that the venality and political feebleness that ensured Reconstruction\u2019s overthrow in the South marked the actual commencement of the Gilded Age.Linking the subjugation of the Indians with the government\u2019s treatment (and, finally, abandonment) of the ex-slaves is meant to provoke recognition of the limits of American equality after the Civil War. Yet it leads White to pass too quickly over the fruits of Southern Reconstruction before its downfall in the mid-1870s. Backdating the Gilded Age to 1865 may explain White\u2019s odd retrieval of the traditional malicious caricature of Ulysses S. Grant \u2014 the president who, with all his flaws and errors, did break the Ku Klux Klan \u2014 as an inept, money-struck coddler of corruption.The narrative improves at the Panic of 1873, a Wall Street disaster that initiated a five-year depression and that temporarily disgraced the Republican Party. The panic hit the railroads especially hard and helped clear the way for new titans of industry, not least the pious oilman John D. Rockefeller, a steward of the Lord who, White notes, \u201cadamantly believed that \u2018God gave me my money.\u2019\u201d The depression led to drastic wage cuts and stricter work rules, which touched off the great railroad strike of 1877, pitting entire working-class communities against police, state militia and federal troops. Shaken respectables thought the Paris Commune had crossed the Atlantic. The Rev. Henry Ward Beecher admonished the poor to heed God\u2019s will and \u201creap the misfortunes of inferiority.\u201dMisfortune multiplied over the next two decades while well-connected financiers and industrialists reaped staggering fortunes until an even greater depression hit in 1893. White\u2019s account of it all is a masterly historical synthesis. American living standards briefly improved, then hit bottom after a long-term decline: In 1880, the average American-born white boy of 10 could expect to live to age 48 and grow to 5 feet 5 inches, considerably less than his Revolutionary-era great-grandfathers. And the figures were worse for blacks. (Immigrants were not included in the measurements.) In the growing big cities \u2014 where immigrants, White writes, \u201cwere creating the American future\u201d \u2014 overcrowding, trash, sewage, human waste, animal waste and decaying carcasses bred contamination and disease. Larcenous local political machines, feeding off the graft of fee-based (which is to say semi-privatized) government, were no help; the party hacks and spoilsmen at the top of national politics produced leaders like President Rutherford B. Hayes, a man, in White\u2019s view, \u201cwho thought that attracting opposition from nearly every direction meant that he was right.\u201d\u201cCommon\u201d America erupted again, in the furious strikes and local political campaigns of 1886, collectively termed the Great Upheaval, and in the labor wars at Andrew Carnegie\u2019s Homestead steelworks in 1892 and the railroad car magnate George Pullman\u2019s eponymous company town in 1894, all part of a crescendo of unrest unmatched in the industrializing world. White\u2019s handling of these set pieces is especially strong, sympathetic to the commoners yet not without wit (as in his appraisal of the anarchist terrorists, \u201cwho rarely missed an opportunity to make a bad situation worse\u201d). But the labor struggles are just a big slice of the story. There is almost nothing about the era that White fails to treat with intelligence and style, as he ranges easily from the dissipation of classical liberalism to the Lakota Ghost Dance and Wounded Knee to the antimorality tale of the accused ax-murderer Lizzie Borden.White\u2019s book ends in 1896, with the debacle of the agrarian Populist movement and reconsolidation of a Republican Party that now worshiped the gold standard and protective tariffs. White turns to Howells to make sense of it all, and finds him \u201csurprisingly hopeful,\u201d glimpsing an American future that is democratic and egalitarian. But there was also, it needs remembering, the Howells who in 1894 wrote, only in part satirically, that \u201cinequality is as dear to the American heart as liberty itself.\u201d Here is the constant American struggle, and Richard White has related a decisive part of its history with stamina and skill.Sean Wilentz's latest book is the forthcoming \u201cNo Property in Man,\u201d on antislavery, the Constitution and the coming of the Civil War.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Slaps Duties on Canadian Jet, Raising Trade Tensions", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 The United States announced Tuesday that it would impose duties on imports of a new jet made by the Canadian jet maker Bombardier, a decision likely to fuel trade tensions between the United States and Canada just as the two countries face off over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement.In response to a trade case filed by the American jet maker Boeing, the United States Commerce Department ruled that Bombardier\u2019s CSeries aircraft, a smaller, regional aircraft that entered service last year, had received subsidies of 219.63 percent of the plane\u2019s sales price, and it said it would begin collecting duties equivalent to that amount.That will more than triple the price of the new jet, chilling Bombardier\u2019s future sales and potentially giving Boeing more space to expand into the market for smaller aircraft.\u201cThe U.S. values its relationships with Canada, but even our closest allies must play by the rules,\u201d Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, said in a statement.In a statement Tuesday evening, Bombardier said it strongly disagreed with the decision and called the magnitude of the duty \u201cabsurd.\u201dThe Commerce Department announcement, which centered on Boeing\u2019s claim that the Canadian jet maker had received unfair government subsidies for its products, was the first in a series of rulings on the duties that are to be charged to Bombardier\u2019s products, rulings that could be reversed in months to come.The next decision, on Oct. 5, will consider whether Bombardier sold its jets in the United States at an unfairly low price, a practice known as dumping. That could add an additional duty to imports of the jet.The United States International Trade Commission, a federal agency that monitors trade, will make a final ruling on the case early next year that could uphold or eliminate the duties. Yet federal customs officials are authorized to begin collecting the duties on Bombardier planes immediately. While the new jet has not yet been imported into the United States, the measure could damp future sales.Boeing greeted the news in a statement: \u201cThis dispute has nothing to do with limiting innovation or competition, which we welcome. Rather, it has everything to do with maintaining a level playing field.\u201dThe ruling was handed down as negotiators from Canada, the United States and Mexico met in Ottawa to negotiate reforms to Nafta, a sprawling trade pact that has guided the North American economy since 1994.In Canada, where trade supports much of the economy, and news of Nafta is splashed across newspapers and television channels, the talks are being viewed as a test of whether the government will stand up to President Trump\u2019s aggressive stance on trade.In response to duties on Bombardier, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has threatened to abandon a planned purchase by Canada of military aircraft from Boeing.\u201cWe won\u2019t do business with a company that\u2019s busy trying to sue us and put our aerospace workers out of business,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said on Sept. 18 in a joint news conference with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. Ms. May also criticized the Boeing case, arguing that it would cost jobs in Northern Ireland, where the wings for Bombardier\u2019s CSeries jet are built.Jerry Dias, president of the Canadian labor union Unifor, said Tuesday that there was \u201cno question\u201d that President Trump\u2019s election to office had ratcheted up trade tensions between the United States and Canada.\u201cAt some point or another, Canada is going to have to strike back in a very aggressive way. Just continuing to take it on the chin doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he told reporters on the sidelines of the Nafta negotiations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Change Is Complex. We\u2019ve Got Answers to Your Questions.", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "Part 1Both are accurate, but they mean different things.You can think of global warming as one type of climate change. The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.President Trump has claimed that scientists stopped referring to global warming and started calling it climate change because \u201cthe weather has been so cold\u201d in winter. But the claim is false. Scientists have used both terms for decades.Two degrees is more significant than it sounds.As of early 2017, the Earth had warmed by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 1 degree Celsius) since 1880, when records began at a global scale. The number may sound low, but as an average over the surface of an entire planet, it is actually high, which explains why much of the world\u2019s land ice is starting to melt and the oceans are rising at an accelerating pace. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, scientists say, the global warming could ultimately exceed 8 degrees Fahrenheit, which would undermine the planet\u2019s capacity to support a large human population.We\u2019ve known about it for more than a century. Really.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.This one is nailed down.Hard evidence, including studies that use radioactivity to distinguish industrial emissions from natural emissions, shows that the extra gas is coming from human activity. Carbon dioxide levels rose and fell naturally in the long-ago past, but those changes took thousands of years. Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done.Nope.In theory, they could be. If the sun were to start putting out more radiation, for instance, that would definitely warm the Earth. But scientists have looked carefully at the natural factors known to influence planetary temperature and found that they are not changing nearly enough. The warming is extremely rapid on the geologic time scale, and no other factor can explain it as well as human emissions of greenhouse gases.Mostly because of ideology. Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented, some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science.Part 2Big trouble.Are you rich enough to shield your descendants?The simple reality is that people are already feeling the effects, whether they know it or not. Because of sea level rise, for instance, some 83,000 more residents of New York and New Jersey were flooded during Hurricane Sandy than would have been the case in a stable climate, scientists have calculated. Tens of thousands of people are already dying in heat waves made worse by global warming. The refugee flows that have destabilized politics around the world have been traced in part to climate change. Of course, as with almost all other social problems, poor people will be hit first and hardest.The real question is how fast.The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century, forcing governments and property owners to spend tens of billions of dollars fighting coastal erosion. But if that rate continued, it would probably be manageable, experts say.Some of it is.Part 3Yes, but change is happening too slowly.Society has put off action for so long that the risks are now severe, scientists say. But as long as there are still unburned fossil fuels in the ground, it is not too late to act. The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero. The good news is that they are now falling in many countries as a result of programs like fuel-economy standards for cars, stricter building codes and emissions limits for power plants. But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.Virtually every country agreed to limit future emissions.Job growth in renewable energy is strong.The transition to cleaner energy certainly produces losers, like coal companies, but it also creates jobs. The solar industry in the United States now employs more than twice as many people as coal mining.Both could help clean up the energy system.Hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking,\u201d is one of a set of drilling technologies that has helped produce a new abundance of natural gas in the United States and some other countries. Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run, though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run. The fracking itself can also create local pollution.Sales are still small overall, but they are rising fast.It\u2019s just jargon for putting a price on pollution.The greenhouse gases being released by human activity are often called \u201ccarbon emissions\u201d for short. That is because two of the most important gases, carbon dioxide and methane, contain carbon. (Some other pollutants are lumped into the same category, even if they do not actually contain carbon.) When you hear about carbon taxes, carbon trading and so on, these are just shorthand descriptions of methods to put a price on emissions, which economists say is one of the most important steps society could take to limit them.Start by sharing this with 50 of your friends.You can also take direct personal action to reduce your carbon footprint in simple ways that will save you money. You can plug leaks in your home insulation to save power, install a smart thermostat, switch to more efficient light bulbs, turn off unused lights, drive fewer miles by consolidating trips or taking public transit, waste less food, and eat less meat.Leading corporations, including large manufacturers like carmakers, are starting to demand clean energy for their operations. You can pay attention to company policies, support the companies taking the lead, and let the others know you expect them to do better.These personal steps may be small in the scheme of things, but they can raise your own consciousness about the problem \u2014 and the awareness of the people around you. In fact, discussing this issue with your friends and family is one of the most meaningful things you can do.Produced by Gray Beltran and Rumsey Taylor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s Great Escape", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotebookOn the evening of Sept. 14, a man who looked an awful lot like Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the president of the United States, boarded Air Canada Jazz Flight AC 8889 in Vancouver, British Columbia. He made his way down the aisle of the Bombardier CRJ 900, found his seat, 17A, in the economy cabin, then settled in for the 923-mile flight to his final destination, Whitehorse, in Canada\u2019s Yukon Territory. He was carrying a camouflage backpack, but he checked some other luggage at the beginning of his journey, two cities earlier, at New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport. That luggage consisted of a high-end hunting bow and a duffel bag. Hunting bows are dangerous weapons, and when you travel from the United States to Canada with a bow, you are supposed to retrieve it and whatever other luggage you are traveling with at your initial port of entry, then escort it through customs for inspection before continuing your journey. He had entered Canada in Toronto but failed to retrieve his bow and duffel bag there, which is why, a half-hour after his flight arrived in Whitehorse, when most of the other passengers had long since gotten their things and gone on their way, he was still milling around the baggage carousel, looking increasingly forlorn, as it appeared his luggage was not going to show up.I was supposed to be on that same flight from Vancouver to Whitehorse \u2014 I spend a lot of time in the Yukon and keep an apartment there \u2014 but I\u2019d missed a connection, so I was still in Vancouver when a Whitehorse friend who happened to be at the airport that night called to let me know about an unexpected visitor.\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s him?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s he wearing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 outdoorsy gear. Gore-Tex. Khakis and boots. Baseball cap.\u201d\u201cIs he with anyone?\u201d\u201cYeah \u2026 older guy, squat and short. And a young kid, maybe early 20s. Southern accents.\u201d\u201cAre they Secret Service?\u201dShe didn\u2019t think they were. They didn\u2019t fit the template, physically or behaviorally. The kid, for one thing, was really young and acted it. He just seemed super psyched to be there, she said. Also, no earpieces.\u201cMaybe they\u2019re parked outside?\u201d I said.\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t really be doing their job, then, would they?\u201d she said.Still, they wouldn\u2019t abandon their protection altogether, would they?Eventually, my friend told me that the man had stopped pacing around the carousel and had wandered over to the Air Canada desk, where he was filing a report about his missing luggage. She heard him tell the people behind the counter that he planned to take a chartered floatplane to a remote hunting camp the next morning.The area often evokes romantic images of Jack London and the Klondike Gold Rush. Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s German great-grandfather, Friedrich Trump, actually lived here for a while during the Rush. He opened a saloon on Main Street in Whitehorse \u2014 one that may have doubled as a brothel \u2014 and ran it for a few years, catering to the boom-and-bust desires of gold-panners. Then he sold his share and eventually made his way to the United States, where he decided to start investing in real estate. Large- and small-scale miners are still drawn to the Yukon, but these days when Americans come here they\u2019re often in pursuit of a different natural resource. The territory hosts a cornucopia of wild game \u2014 there are at least twice as many moose as humans here, for example \u2014 making it a hunter\u2019s paradise.Donald Trump Jr. is an avid hunter. The internet is full of grisly pictures of him posing with the corpses of elephants, leopards, water buffaloes, crocodiles. That he might come here on a hunting trip wasn\u2019t surprising. But it surprised me that he had traveled on a commercial flight \u2014 economy class, no less. I wondered whether my friend at the airport had been mistaken. The president\u2019s son is the sort of generically handsome guy that might have more than a few look-alikes.Over the next couple of days, I occasionally checked news stories online but didn\u2019t find even the whiff of a Yukon trip. Trump\u2019s social media accounts had gone suspiciously quiet, though. The morning after his supposed arrival in Whitehorse, he tweeted the following: \u201cProtip: If have to tell others you\u2019re an alpha \u2026 you\u2019re not,\u201d but after that his usually active feed became just a sporadic drizzle of retweets.But I was now confident that I knew where he was \u2014 give or take a couple hundred thousand square miles \u2014 and that it was nowhere near Moscow. Instead, the son of the president was traveling on the down low in a remote wilderness, without Secret Service. And that seemed significant, regardless of your politics, or your investment in the Russia scandal. After all, one reason you want to protect the president\u2019s family members is to prevent them from being abducted, a nightmare scenario that would put the president, and the whole country, in an awful position. I mean, a whole story arc on \u201cThe West Wing\u201d hinged on basically that exact premise. (Incidentally, after Zoey was abducted, President Bartlet temporarily abdicated office by invoking the same amendment \u2014 the 25th \u2014 that some people hope might eventually push Trump out the door.) Whatever your politics, whatever you think of Trump, the last thing you would want is for his son to fall into the wrong hands. Meaning that if Trump Jr. had decided to give up his Secret Service protection, at the very least you would hope he wouldn\u2019t be easy to find.I decided to see if I could track him down.Then I froze.In other circumstances, looking for another person, I might have aggressively called all the likeliest outfitters and tried to talk my way into their camps. This was different. It occurred to me that my questions might trigger an unpredictable series of events. If Trump realized that his under-the-radar trip was no longer under the radar, he or someone else might decide that he had to be yanked out of the bush, for safety\u2019s sake. He\u2019d spook, in other words. Which would inevitably lead to bubble-reinforcing headlines that might contain at least a grain of truth: \u201cReporter Endangers Trump Son (and Ruins His Vacation).\u201dBaseball cap, red checkered shirt, week\u2019s worth of stubble, khaki pants, camouflage backpack, sturdy shoes and a long black carrying case presumably containing a hunting bow. He walked past me, all alone, and stopped in front of a door to the side of the main security entrance, a door you use when you\u2019re checking either unusually bulky items or weapons. He started ringing the buzzer beside the door. Nobody answered. I got up and walked over.\u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m Luke.\u201dI held out my hand, and he shook it.\u201cI\u2019m Don,\u201d he said.I told him that I heard he was in the area, that I was with The New York Times Magazine and that I\u2019d love to talk to him about his trip.\u201cThe Times,\u201d he said. \u201cI never know where you guys are coming from.\u201dI asked if he bagged anything.\u201cI can\u2019t really tell you that,\u201d he said. \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s just say it was a good hunt.\u2019\u2019Was it a moose?\u201cI can\u2019t \u2026 look, I can\u2019t say.\u201d(It was a moose. Big one, too.)He politely nonanswered a few more questions. We went off the record and chatted a while longer, focusing on his decision to drop his security detail. He had at least an hour before boarding and said he was hungry and was going to go eat with some of his hunting buddies, who had by now joined us in the security line. I told him that I\u2019d hang around till he got back and that I hoped he\u2019d reconsider talking with me on the record. He left, and I waited. By the time he returned, the airport had filled with people. There was a family going to Disneyland, each of their five children wearing a Mickey Mouse hat. There was a man hauling a cooler full of moose meat. And there were guns. Lots and lots of guns, long-muzzled and high-velocity, carted through the terminal by a motley crew of hunters. It was that time of year.I walked back up to the eldest son of the most powerful man in the world. At that moment, it seemed to me that he had put himself in an unwisely vulnerable position. I asked again if we could talk. He said no. I asked if I could take a picture at least.Then I bagged a selfie and went home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Irma Grazes Puerto Rico but Lays Bare an Infrastructure Problem", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLO\u00cdZA, P.R. \u2014 As government workers cleared roads obstructed by uprooted trees and repaired toppled electricity lines, residents of Puerto Rico felt some relief that the eye wall of Hurricane Irma had skirted the island on its recent rampage through the Caribbean.In Lo\u00edza, one of the coastal towns hit hardest by the hurricane, Javier Rivera and Lina Carrasquillo were still without power on Saturday.Water leaked into an assortment of pots and buckets they had scattered throughout the ground floor. The metal roof that once covered their second floor had blown away and crashed into a neighbor\u2019s home. The couple had driven hours in search of generators, but they were sold out everywhere they looked.\u201cI\u2019ve always said that government should provide the essentials: electricity and a health system,\u201d said Mr. Rivera, 54.In their humid bedroom, Ms. Carrasquillo\u2019s 84-year-old mother, recovering from two brain hemorrhages, rested motionless. A feeding tube was connected to her stomach; a battery fan was propped on the bed. Several 24-packs of water bottles were stacked on the floor.Ms. Carrasquillo, 54, shrugged.As of Saturday evening, about 40 percent of the island did not have power and 13 percent of households were without water, local officials said. That was down from 34 percent on Thursday, when Irma swept past. An estimated 15 of the 69 hospitals on the island were running on generators.\u201cIt\u2019s the lack of maintenance in our infrastructure,\u201d Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t want to point fingers, but the truth is it\u2019s been periods of over a decade with very little or no investment in the maintenance of our infrastructure, and that makes us more susceptible.\u201dEfforts to modernize Prepa\u2019s plants, which burn imported oil to produce electricity, and diversify energy sources have mostly come to a halt. Trees near power lines have gone untrimmed, poles unattended. And residents have come to distrust the island\u2019s electrical grid, which started faltering hours before the bluster of Irma grazed Puerto Rico.\u201cHere, a small gust blows in and the light is gone,\u201d said Zenaida Qui\u00f1ones, 53, whose cement house in Lo\u00edza is still dark. Ms. Qui\u00f1ones said that even under normal conditions she typically lost power three or four times a week.\u201cI\u2019m used to it now,\u201d said Ms. Qui\u00f1ones, whose refrigerators are often damaged by the failures. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? There\u2019s only one electric company.\u201dFor Puerto Ricans, Irma was a close call that revealed the system\u2019s chronic fragility and heightened the urgency to strengthen the island\u2019s antiquated infrastructure before future natural disasters.\u201cThis is a moment of crisis that we need to benefit from and transform into an opportunity of change, production and investment,\u201d Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez, the island\u2019s nonvoting representative in Congress, said.How a commonwealth going through a decade-long recession will be able to pay for much-needed upgrades is the key question. One option is to turn to the private sector, local economists say.Hurricane Irma \u201ccan become an opportunity or another liability,\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said.But the idea of privatizing public utilities is a divisive one on the island. The electrical workers\u2019 union fears that the government purposely let Prepa deteriorate over time to justify privatizing it.\u201cThere were 6,800 linemen in the year 2000. Now we have 3,500,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Figueroa Jaramillo, president of the Irrigation and Electrical Workers Union, the largest union representing Prepa workers. \u201cAnd the number of miles of power lines has more than doubled in that time. They cut personnel, reduced material and cut back on maintenance. All this adds up to not meeting your obligations.\u201dCarlos Monroig, a Prepa spokesman, said he could not comment on the union\u2019s statements because the company\u2019s leadership had changed and the current director, Ricardo Ramos, had been on the job only five months. Prepa had already acknowledged its \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d and \u201cdeteriorating system\u201d in the past, Mr. Monroig said.He added that in the wake of the storm, the company had deployed hundreds of repair teams working 12-hour shifts to bring back power across the island. By Saturday night, Mr. Monroig said, Prepa had restored electricity to almost 887,000 of the 1.2 million customers affected by the shutdown.In San Juan, the capital, it was hard to tell that one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic basin had roared past and taken out the power grid. Resorts were lit. Restaurants bustled along the Condado promenade.But in more rural Lo\u00edza, Melissa Rivera and Jorge Tavera had suffered far more than a temporary loss of power: They were one of 79 families there left without a home, a sobering reminder that even a glancing blow from a hurricane can devastate lives.The couple weathered the storm in a neighbor\u2019s house, watching as winds ripped apart their zinc roof and rains drenched every corner of their two-bedroom home.\u201cAll I thought was, \u2018Wow, my house is gone,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rivera said, standing near a pool of water that had once been her living room. \u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere to live anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Haiti, a Building Fights Cholera", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesNext month marks the seventh anniversary of the cholera outbreak that ravaged Haiti. The disease, which can cause death within hours if left untreated, came less than a year after Haiti was rocked by an enormous earthquake that left hundreds of thousands dead and millions injured, displaced and destitute.Haiti is prone to earthquakes and tropical storms \u2014 the island was spared the worst of Hurricane Irma last week \u2014 but the cholera outbreak was an anomaly; the disease had never before struck Haiti. It was brought in, it is widely believed, by United Nations peacekeepers from Nepal. One of the world\u2019s most infectious waterborne diseases, cholera spreads quickly and has proved extremely difficult to contain in Haiti. Over 10,000 have died and nearly a million have been stricken to date.But one organization has managed to nearly eradicate it in a large slum in Port-au-Prince that lacks clean water and sanitation.One of the game changers that would surprise most people, including global health experts, was actually a building. It wasn\u2019t just any building, but a very intelligently and beautifully designed one: the Cholera Treatment Center, operated by Les Centres Gheskio, an acronym that stands for the Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections.Gheskio, founded in 1982 in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, provides primary care services free of charge to people suffering from tuberculosis, malnutrition, and other life threatening conditions in an area of the Haitian capital that is home to 60,000 Haitians. (Gheskio is a less well-known sister organization of Partners in Health, which focuses on Haiti\u2019s rural population.)After the 2010 earthquake, Gheskio\u2019s multi-acre campus was badly damaged. So the organization erected emergency tents to serve as a makeshift cholera treatment clinic. Once cholera reached Port-au-Prince, patients showed up on foot or were carried in wheelbarrows, around the clock.Cholera manifests with extreme diarrhea and vomiting. Virtually all liquid is excreted from the body, causing victims to die of dehydration within hours of full manifestation if untreated. It is relatively easy to treat, but patients must be rehydrated immediately. To prevent it from spreading, infected human waste must be managed carefully.Gheskio\u2019s founder, Jean W. Pape, an infectious disease specialist and native of Haiti, knew that eradicating cholera would take years. So even as the organization struggled to keep up with the influx of patients during the first year of the epidemic, he embarked on a long-term solution: building a permanent treatment center.Gheskio turned to MASS Design Group, a Boston-based nonprofit organization that specializes in architecture that promotes dignity and justice in resource-limited settings. It has built hospitals, health-worker housing, schools and civic spaces around the world, including a tuberculosis hospital for Gheskio. MASS Design began by studying the conditions inside the tents.Tents provide relative shade and privacy but offer limited light and poor ventilation, trapping warm air and compounding the smell of bodily waste. The materials become worn by rain, wind and sun, and must be replaced routinely. Because of the nature of cholera, the makeshift beds, fashioned out of old fiberglass school chairs and costly army cots, also didn\u2019t last long.Most problematic, Gheskio was relying on manual removal of human waste by an outside vendor. This was both costly and risky: The organization couldn\u2019t ensure its disposal would not recontaminate the water table, risking the infection of others.\u201cWe did some back-of-envelope calculations and found that over a 10-year span of time, which was then considered optimistic for how long it would take to get rid of cholera, the tents and manual waste disposal system they were then using would cost Gheskio in excess of $500,000,\u201d according to a co-founder of MASS Design, Alan Ricks.Ricks estimated that MASS Design could build, for a comparable sum, a permanent structure that could be repurposed once the epidemic was fully contained. So MASS Design and Gheskio joined forces to raise philanthropic funding from the Deutsche Bank Foundation, Barr Foundation and individual donors, and began work.One important innovation, developed with Fall Creek Engineers, based in Santa Cruz, Calif., was to bring a water-purification technology to Haiti called anaerobic baffled reactors. The reactors are a form of septic system that uses bacteria to treat sewage and contaminated water, turning it into clean water. Reactors, buried under the cholera center, force water through five chambers, each successively increasing the level of purification.Each week, Pape receives a detailed report on the water quality. The system sanitizes and recycles 250,000 gallons of water annually, ensuring that the water is free enough of bacteria and other pathogens that it can be returned to the water table. This output is supplemented by separate, large cisterns to capture rainwater for drinking.Many other details incorporated into the center also promote health, as well as comfort, beauty and pride. Above the reactors, for example, is a pavilion structure designed to maximize airflow. Rather than spending money on tents, furniture or waste disposal services \u2014 money that leaves the local economy \u2014 the organizations enlisted local artisans, whose metalwork is world renowned, to create perforated metal sheets, painted a chorus of blues, to wrap the building exterior. Waffle-like patterns of these sheets can be opened and closed to provide shade and privacy, or sealed completely during storms, as they were when Hurricane Irma neared Port-au-Prince last week.The airflow is aided by large-diameter fans, like those in gyms and airports. The cement floor is smooth, free of crevices where bacteria can congregate, and sealed with epoxy. MASS Design interviewed many patients and staff members in an effort to design and create prototypes of beds that would be comfortable as well as easily sanitized and reused.\u201cWhat I love about MASS is their attention to detail,\u201d Pape said. \u201cThey asked us everything that work and everything that doesn\u2019t work. But most importantly, they are problem solvers.\u201d\u201cThe building looks absolutely extraordinary,\u201d said Roger Glass, a cholera expert who is director of the Fogarty International Center for Advancing Science for Global Health at the National Institutes of Health and has visited the Gheskio campus. \u201cFor ventilation and coolness, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201dBefore encountering a hospital that MASS Design developed in Rwanda, Glass said, he had not seriously considered the relationship between health outcomes and building design. \u201cIf you had called me seven years ago to talk about buildings and health, I would have blown you off,\u201d he said. Today, Glass is eager to see more collaborations with human-centered design firms, like MASS Design, in the field of global health.Comparing the treatment center to the tents, Pape is blunt: \u201cIt was like going from hell to paradise.\u201dAmie Shao, who helped lead MASS Design\u2019s work in Haiti, reflected: \u201cWhen we started, our goal was simply to help Gheskio do their work better in treating their patients in a more dignified setting. We realized, however, that architecture could not only help treat these diseases after the fact, but prevent the spread of disease in the first place by controlling recontamination. In all of our work, we seek to proactively challenge many of the underlying risks and issues that global health faces.\u201dTo be sure, the cholera treatment center is not solely responsible for halting the spread in Gheskio\u2019s target area. Gheskio also developed a robust water chlorination program and maintains its own factory to produce chlorine. The organization also supports and participates in broad efforts by the Ministry of Health to raise public awareness about symptoms and the risk of contamination throughout the country.And Gheskio joined forces with Partners in Health to get cholera vaccines approved in Haiti. Euvichol, a vaccine that can be administered orally and lasts up to 30 days without refrigeration, costs less than $2 per dose. \u201cWe would need a budget of less than $50 million for universal coverage for all of Haiti,\u201d Pape estimates.Gheskio\u2019s Cholera Treatment Center was ultimately built for $750,000. Pape now predicts that the organization will have recouped that cost in just three years. Haiti needs a modern, countrywide water and sanitation system, but it\u2019s unclear where the money will come from. In the meantime, Gheskio\u2019s center has saved many lives.By uniquely combining patient care with on-site water treatment, Gheskio\u2019s center also holds lessons for other regions struggling to contain cholera or facing it in the future. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates there are between 1.3 million and four million cases of cholera annually in 42 countries, with 21,000 to 143,000 cholera-related deaths each year. This year, Somalia saw a major resurgence of the disease, with over 50,000 people infected. About 1,000 died.In the three years since Gheskio\u2019s Cholera Treatment Center opened, the facility has remained in constant use because those outside the organization\u2019s target area continue to be exposed to contaminated water. It has admitted over 10,000 patients to date, including over 7,000 who were hospitalized. Eighty-three percent of those patients came from outside of Gheskio\u2019s catchment area.While cholera reports in Haiti were on the rise in 2015 and 2016 at upward of 25,000 cases annually, the country saw a decrease in 2017, which Pape attributes to higher-than-normal rainfall in the region. Of the 100 beds, no more than a third were occupied at any time this year, with as few as a handful of patients at times. The risk for outbreaks remains high, however, and the disease\u2019s countrywide eradication is still years away.\u201cHaiti\u2019s recently elected government, and the president particular, is focused on universal oral cholera vaccine as well as home chlorination,\u201d Pape reports. \u201cIf we get the vaccines and if we pursue home chlorination, I truly believe we can rid of cholera within four to five years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Center-Right Party Hangs On in New Zealand Election", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 After a tumultuous campaign, the center-right governing party in New Zealand placed first in the country\u2019s general election on Saturday, but failed to capture a parliamentary majority, meaning it will have to assemble a coalition if it wants to extend its nine-year hold on power.With nearly all the votes counted, the National Party took 46 percent of the vote, beating back a late surge by the center-left Labour Party, which received 35.8 percent, according to the Electoral Commission. Smaller parties took the rest.Late Saturday night, Prime Minister Bill English delivered a victory speech in Auckland, New Zealand\u2019s largest city, but his main challenger, the Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern, did not immediately concede defeat.Mr. English failed in a previous bid to become prime minister in 2002, when he was National\u2019s leader, so the party\u2019s first-place finish on Saturday was something of a vindication.During the campaign, she emphasized issues including child poverty, environmental management and housing affordability.In the end, however, her efforts appeared to have fallen short.Neither of the main parties won a majority of the 120-seat Parliament, which means that National, with 58 seats, and Labour, with 45, will now try to court minor parties to form a coalition \u2014 a process that could take days or even weeks.Given its advantage, National is more likely to succeed, but to do so, it will need support from Winston Peters, a populist whose right-leaning New Zealand First party won nine seats.Mr. Peters, 72, who is poised to act as kingmaker, did not tip his hand on Saturday, boarding a ferry to go home as reporters peppered him with questions. He said he would reach a decision by Oct. 12.Amid blue balloons and triumphant applause, Mr. English, 55, told supporters at Sky City Casino in Auckland, \u201cWe gave it everything, and we got better and better.\u201dMs. Ardern reminded supporters that she had once called the Labour leader\u2019s position \u201cthe worst job in politics,\u201d adding that she had now changed her mind. She said that the party and its supporters had given it \u201ctheir all\u201d and that, while she had called Mr. English to acknowledge that National had won the most votes, she was not ready to admit defeat.The campaign was raucous, at least by the standards of New Zealand, a prosperous member of the Commonwealth that has largely been spared the divisive debate over migration that has roiled its larger neighbor, Australia.The resignations of Mr. Key and of Mr. Little put new leaders in charge of the two biggest parties.Adding more uncertainty to the result is a likely high number of \u201cspecial votes\u201d \u2014 ballots cast by New Zealanders living overseas and by people registering to vote on the same day they cast their ballot. The count from those votes is expected by Oct. 7.In the 2014 election, 12.5 percent of the ballots cast were special votes, and they tend to trend leftward. National lost one seat, and the Greens picked up one, as a result of the special-vote tally that year.A major upset in Saturday\u2019s results was the vanquishing of the Maori Party, a group which grew out of protest action about indigenous rights to New Zealand\u2019s foreshore and seabed.Formed in 2004, the party won two seats at the 2014 election; in the next Parliament, it will have none.The right-leaning, libertarian ACT party, a traditional coalition partner for National, won a single seat, with its leader, David Seymour, returned to Parliament.Gareth Morgan, a millionaire making his first attempt at Parliament as the leader of the Opportunities Party, received 2.2 percent of votes, too few to win a seat.Advertisement"}

I also try to balance that with comfort \u2014 a treat now and then to mitigate the occasional lumpy mattress.I don\u2019t view frugal travel as a race to the bottom. There\u2019s nothing difficult about being cheap \u2014 what\u2019s challenging is finding something both cheap and enjoyable. If there\u2019s a modest but clean guesthouse for $50 per night, I\u2019ll take that over the fleabag place that costs $30. The difference in price, in my mind, is worth the added comfort. While I did my share of $5-per-night hostels in my twenties, that\u2019s not what I look for now when I travel. Nor, I\u2019m betting, are most of my readers.This is how it works: I book my flights (in economy, naturally, an arduous experience for someone 6 feet 3 inches tall), followed by my lodging (homeshare sites and crashing with friends tends to offer a more authentic experience than hotels, but I\u2019ll stay anywhere). I do a good amount of on- and off-line research for every place I visit \u2014 websites, guidebooks, friends, social media.There\u2019s only so much prep you can do, though, before returns start to diminish. There\u2019s no substitute for being on the ground, walking up and down unfamiliar streets. I\u2019ve also found that exploring public transportation is an insightful introduction to a place. From Sydney\u2019s public ferries to Moscow\u2019s extraordinary subway system, it\u2019s a great way to get around and teaches you a lot about a city\u2019s character.Being a good traveler means being adaptable. My habits \u2014 eating habits, particularly \u2014 will be culled a bit, depending on where I am. Fresh fruit in Japan, where they import a lot of their food, can be prohibitively expensive. Good coffee, all but ubiquitous in the United States, hasn\u2019t really penetrated the Chinese market. A decent cup is also hard to find, ironically enough, in many Central American countries. (I\u2019ll frequently bring my own when I travel.)I take a lot of notes, mostly on my phone, and take even more pictures, which I frequently find are more helpful than the notes. Unlike some travelogue writers, I have to pay particular attention to prices. Since I tend to favor small businesses and street food \u2014 places I won\u2019t necessarily be able to call later if I need to double-check a price or the name of a menu item \u2014 I get fairly obsessive about tracking details and costs.

A week ago, after they waded out of it with a few suitcases on air mattresses, those hopes had largely faded. Then they got an unexpected call from their real estate agent: a house hunter was interested.\u201cSomebody actually called her before we got back in here,\u201d Sue Powell said as she stood in her driveway last week, a safety mask around her neck and a pile of her possessions on the curb.\u201cI was really surprised,\u201d said her husband, describing how they had \u201cgondoliered\u201d their way back home over Labor Day weekend. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would be interested for years.\u201d\u201cYou have a country that\u2019s divided between high cost places like Bay Area and New York and higher unemployment areas like Detroit, and places like Houston pick up the slack,\u201d said Issi Romem, chief economist at BuildZoom, a San Francisco company that helps homeowners find contractors.And even after Hurricane Harvey revealed the city\u2019s vulnerability to catastrophic flooding, leaving thousands displaced and still living in shelters, people here are betting that nothing can stop Houston\u2019s continued growth.Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm, said its agents had 45 home buyers lined up to purchase homes here when the storm hit. Only eight buyers backed out because of the storm, and tour requests immediately rebounded a week later.\u201cI was shocked,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, the company\u2019s chief executive, who lives in Seattle.For now, buyers and sellers are trying to figure out how prices have changed after the flood. The Powells\u2019 potential buyer and many others are looking for a deal on a damaged home.At the same time, many economists are forecasting that the price of undamaged homes will rise as demand outstrips supply. Early estimates suggest that tens of thousands of homes were damaged, and developers are worried about labor shortages as repairs get priority over new construction.But as insurance and government money comes in, developers and real estate agents are betting that the area will quickly clear the backlog and continue along its normal trajectory of adding homes and people.Throughout Houston proper and the surrounding suburbs, developers sprawl ever outward, paving over pastures and former wetlands and leaving nothing to absorb the water, when it comes.\u201cIt is one of the most affordable housing markets in the country because people were able to build in places where they were likely to get flooded in the future,\u201d said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow, the real estate data service.Houstonians lose track of how many times they\u2019ve been flooded. They repeatedly renovate or rebuild on elevated platforms and say they will go higher the next time if they have to.Stefanie Asin and her husband, Jake Everett, live about a block from Brays Bayou in an area of Houston called Braes Heights, where the flood reached the middle of stop signs. After the storm they sat on their porch watching motorboats go by. Their closest neighbor was pulled from the roof of his house by a helicopter.Their own home was fine because after the last flood, two years ago, they moved out and built a new one on an elevated platform, returning in March. The storm waters of Harvey rose up six of their seven front steps.\u201cWe have stairs everywhere \u2014 front, back, garage,\u201d Ms. Asin said. \u201cWe have stairs going into the backyard.\u201dThe appeal is particularly obvious right now: Elevated homes sit untouched above devastated houses with massive piles of debris all around them. Across the street from Ms. Asin, Arturo Loza, part of a Mormon volunteer relief effort, was helping gut a flooded house with a sink, cabinets and piles of books heaped in front.\u201cOne word: wrecked,\u201d he said.Ms. Asin had been through three large floods since she moved near the bayou two decades ago. In Harvey, her losses were contained to the garage, which was not elevated, and so her daughters\u2019 cars were ruined, and a refrigerator was left floating. But this was nothing new. She said her family had lost five cars to rain and water damage in the last three years.Asked why they had bought a home in the neighborhood to begin with, Ms. Asin said: \u201cThe house was built in 1955 and it had never flooded. We thought, it hasn\u2019t flooded yet!\u201dThen Tropical Storm Allison hit in 2001 and left a foot of water on the ground floor of the house. \u201cWe got it remodeled,\u201d Ms. Asin said. \u201cThey told us it was a 500-year flood.\u201dBut in 2015, the so-called Memorial Day flood almost completely covered their front yard, and Mr. Everett was photographed standing on a little patch of ground surrounded on all sides by water.That flood left three inches of water in their home, enough that everything had to be torn out \u2014 Sheetrock, cabinets, floors.They\u2019d had enough, and considered moving away, but decided to stay put. \u201cWe were looking at how to come up with the mortgage for somewhere we didn\u2019t really want to live versus building our dream house,\u201d Mr. Everett said.So they put up their dream house \u2013 seven feet above the street level.A builder, Brian Silver of BAS Concepts, said that over the last 15 years, his company had built more than 50 homes around Brays Bayou that were elevated in some way \u2013 including Ms. Asin\u2019s \u2013 and 10 just in the last year.He predicted that after Harvey, even more homeowners would decide to demolish their flooded homes and build from scratch, but higher, and that already elevated homes would increase in value. (According to the Insurance Information Institute, homeowners in flood-prone areas are often required to elevate their houses to get flood insurance, and the areas designated can change with storms and development.)In the meantime, even as National Guard trucks remained on the streets and drones assessed damage, the steady stream of migration continued.After the hurricane, when the city was still underwater in some places, Christine Garcia and her boyfriend, John Klein, packed their car in Chicago and set off on a long-planned move to Houston. They were not entirely sure whether their apartment would be habitable, and were unable to get any answers from their landlord, but they arrived to find their two-bedroom duplex was dry.The couple is renting now, but they moved there because they would like to buy eventually.

Those include setting new requirements for the use of American-made goods and lowering barriers to exporting American agricultural products.The White House is particularly eager to show progress on the trade agenda \u2014 one of President Trump\u2019s signature campaign issues \u2014 given the failure of Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and the uncertainty about tax reform.For a new Nafta pact to be approved by lawmakers in the three countries, negotiators say it needs to be largely concluded by the end of the year. They fear approval could be complicated by a series of events, including Mexico\u2019s presidential election on July 1, 2018, midterm elections in the United States and provincial elections in Canada.Legislation authorizing Congress to pass a trade deal with a simple up-or-down vote is also scheduled to expire in July.New proposals by the Trump administration are adding pressure to the already complex negotiations.Last week, Mr. Ross told an audience that the administration was considering adding a \u201csunset clause\u201d to the North American pact. Under such a measure, the agreement would terminate after five years unless all three countries voted to continue it.Canadian officials and business community representatives have expressed concern about a temporary pact.David MacNaughton, Canada\u2019s ambassador to the United States, criticized the provision. \u201cIf every marriage had a five-year sunset clause, I think our divorce rate would be a heck of a lot higher than it is right now,\u201d he said.Chad Bown, a trade analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said a sunset provision would create so much uncertainty that businesses might end up ignoring Nafta altogether in their planning. It can take years for businesses to recoup the returns from investments, by which time Nafta might no longer exist.A Canadian government official briefed on the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Canadians were surprised by the proposal. Mexican officials could not immediately be reached for comment.Mr. Lighthizer, the trade representative, declined to comment Monday on whether the administration would seek to add the five-year limitation to Nafta.Also hanging over the negotiations is Mr. Trump\u2019s ongoing threat to pull out of Nafta \u2014 an outcome that economists say would be a blow to industries whose supply chains stretch across the continent.While Mr. Trump has the support of labor unions on trade, many business and agricultural groups have argued that withdrawing from Nafta could cut them off from major export markets and devastate their businesses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Alaska\u2019s Far-Flung Villages, Happiness Is a Cake Mix", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGAMBELL, Alaska \u2014 In a modest boardinghouse on an Alaskan island just 30 miles across the sea from Russia, a handwritten order form hangs on the refrigerator. There are photos of cakes a few women in this village can make for you: rectangles of yellow cake and devil\u2019s food enrobed in buttercream, with local nicknames piped out in pink.\u201cHappy Birthday Bop-Bop,\u201d one reads. Another, \u201cHappy Birthday Siti-Girl.\u201dTraveling out here, where huge bones from bowhead whales litter the beach, takes a 90-minute jet ride north from Anchorage and another hour by small plane over the Bering Sea. In this vast, wild part of America, accessible only by water or air, there may not be plumbing or potable water, the local store may not carry perishables and people may have to rely on caribou or salmon or bearded seal meat to stay fed.But no matter where you go, you will always find a cake-mix cake.Elsewhere, the American appetite for packaged baking mixes is waning, according to the market research firm Mintel, as consumers move away from packaged foods with artificial ingredients and buy more from in-store bakeries and specialty pastry shops. Yet in the small, mostly indigenous communities that dot rural Alaska, box cake is a stalwart staple, the star of every community dessert table and a potent fund-raising tool.\u201cCake mixes are the center of our little universe,\u201d said Cynthia Erickson, who owns the only grocery store in Tanana, an Athabascan village of 300 along the Yukon River in central Alaska. \u201cI have four damn shelves full.\u201dEating in rural Alaska is all about managing the expense and scarcity of store-bought food while trying to take advantage of seasonally abundant wild foods. Cash economies are weak, utilities and fuel are expensive and many families live below the federal poverty line.To offset the cost of living, Alaska Natives here rely on traditional practices of hunting, fishing and gathering, known as \u201csubsistence.\u201d In a good year, they fill freezers with moose, berries, caribou, salmon or marine mammals, depending on where they live. In a bad year, they have to buy more from the store.The offerings in village stores often resemble those in the mini-marts or bodegas of America\u2019s urban food deserts, at two and three times the price. Food journeys in via jet, small plane and barge. Milk and eggs spoil fast. Produce gets roughed up. Among the Hostess doughnuts, Spam and soda, cake mix is one of the few items on shelves everywhere that require actual cooking.As a result, tricking out mixes has become a cottage industry, and many villages have a \u201ccake lady\u201d with her signature twist. Some bake as a hobby, while others do a brisk business selling cakes in places where getting to a bakery requires a plane ticket.In the far north, bakers make cake with fondant photo prints of Inupiat whaling crews and serve it with mikigaq, fermented whale meat. On the western coast, mixes may be prepared with sea gull eggs. In the interior, pineapple upside-down cake is eaten with a salad made of lard, sugar, berries and whitefish. Fund-raisers known as cake walks \u2014 a variation on musical chairs \u2014 pay for coffins, support people through chemotherapy and send whole basketball teams to the Lower 48.\u201cSometimes you don\u2019t have a lot of the stuff to make a regular cake,\u201d said Ms. Erickson, who frequently bakes for St. Aloysius Roman Catholic Church. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t have butter or you don\u2019t have milk.\u201dBut with one substitution or another, you can always make a mix cake. Mayonnaise can take the place of an egg. Some recipes call for nothing but a mix and a bottle of Sprite. The Whole Foods crowd may judge it, she said, but where she lives it makes sense.In Unalakleet, 300 miles west of Tanana on Norton Sound, Donna Erickson (no relation to Cynthia) is a noted cake lady. Her most famous creation was born in a rush to get to a community potluck. She made a white cake and poured it into a sheet pan because she knew it would bake quickly.\u201cI mixed orange Jell-O with two cups of bright orange salmonberries. I poured it on top of that cake and I threw it in the fridge,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were just like, \u2018Wow, can you make that again for me?\u2019 \u201dRural Alaska has some of the highest rates of accidental death and suicide in the country. When there is tragedy in Unalakleet, bakers bring cakes to the school multipurpose room and lay them on a big table with corresponding numbers. Popular flavors include salmonberry, tundra blueberry and low-bush cranberry.Then the cake walk begins: People buy a ticket, then circle the table while music plays. When it stops, somebody draws a number out of an old coffee can. The person standing by the corresponding cake wins that one and the money goes toward healing someone\u2019s family, Donna Erickson said.\u201cIt\u2019s a festive environment even though it\u2019s a sad time,\u201d she added. \u201cYou should see the cakes; they are so beautiful. Village bakers are so brilliant.\u201dIn America\u2019s northernmost town, Utqiagvik (formerly known as Barrow), the baker Mary Patkotak is an expert at gaming cake economics. She uses Betty Crocker triple chocolate fudge mix for her famous cherry-chocolate cake. In the village store, it costs $4.59 a box. On Amazon, where Ms. Patkotak orders it, it\u2019s $1.29. Alaska\u2019s many weather delays mean the mix never shows up on time, but she doesn\u2019t care because it qualifies her for partial refunds on her annual Prime membership.\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I paid the Amazon Prime fee,\u201d she said.She bakes when she knows a payday is coming around. She ships cakes and cupcakes to out-of-town customers who order from her Facebook page, freezing them and tucking them into the cargo hold of a small plane. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any bakeries. We have very few restaurants,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople really crave the fresh cake.\u201dLast winter, Cynthia Erickson snowmobiled an old propane stove to her summer hunting camp, 50 miles northwest of Tanana on the Tozitna River. It fell apart on the way, but her husband wired it back together. She fired it up and slid in a chocolate cake.It\u2019s a simple thing, making a cake from a box, but when you\u2019re doing it at 30 degrees below zero in Alaska, you feel rich, she said.\u201cI was, like, the camp queen!\u201d she said. \u201cMiddle of nowhere, eating cake.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
